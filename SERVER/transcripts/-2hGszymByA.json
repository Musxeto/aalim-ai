  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in brother Mustafa we're studying chapter that deals with well brother Abu Malik talking about the prayer it's well we're all talking about the prayer we've been talking about prayer for the past couple of months now brother Muhammad condition of conditions of Salah see it helps you to focus once you know what you're doing because it's it relates things to uh uh to the other things so uh the Hadith we have here is Hadith number 166 by may Allah be pleased with him brother Malik would you please read it for us narr by I saw Allah's messenger sallam praying while mounted on his riding animal facing whatever Direction it faced Al bukari added making gestures with his head and he did not do that meaning uh pray while mounted with obl uh obligatory prayers so this answers the questions we had previously that is it okay to pray obligatory prayers while riding on a camel or riding in our cars and this answers it that the prophet did not do this except with voluntary uh uh prayer now again we come to this issue just as a revision facing the is one of the conditions of Salah obligatory prayer you have to face the in voluntary prayer you may not face the as the doing of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh uh shows us that he did not do it now the question is Mustafa do you think that in obligatory prayer in sorry in voluntary prayer when I'm riding on my ride with whether it's wheels or or camel or whatever do I have to face the to say the first allahar then whever it goes it's okay or it's open all the way I don't know it's open all the way it's open all the way those some Scholars say no you should face the make beard then whatever your ride goes your plane your guit car then you're okay but there isn't according to what I know a strong evidence that backs this uh up Abu Malik yeah uh somebody's driving a car how do they pray and take care of the road at the same time you don't have to pray to take care of the road I've I know a lot of people that don't pray and don't give a damn to what's happening front of them we have lots of reckless drivers and believe me this is a serious issue that I don't want to you know distract myself from it of it but the number of fatalities the number of Road accidents taking place in the Muslim world is UN unbelievable people don't pay any attention to human lives their carelessness they're not abiding by the laws and by the speed limit and by the age you get kids like 12 13 years driving this is all a sin it's forbidden and it's unacceptable to go back to your question If a person is driving see you are driving and reciting the Quran and the prophet used to gesture you know when he wants to Bow he does this when he wants to prostrate he does this so your eye your eyes are still on the road if you're driving and you you wish uh to pray but but if you're not driving then this is much easier remember that voluntary prayer is much easier than obligatory prayer you may not face the you may not be standing up you may not be looking where you should prostrate and you may pray by or with gestures so it can be done most of us while driving talk and we can you know argue in things and and and have conversations with with the passengers and that does not affect our uh driving abilities and capabilities uh what else now uh also in this Hadith uh brother Mustafa yeah but isn't there uh different narration for Abu that says that first the prophet used to face the with his and then he says allahar and then he List It direct Point any direction I have half of the knowledge with me here which is I do not know I I cannot tell you what I know is that a a group of Scholars said that you have to face the and then you go onwards but to my recollection I don't recall if there's authentic Hadith or not probably inshallah next time we meet we will look into it and and and try to find it and maybe we'll find it here somewhere or the other it says here by Abu da yes uh can you read it for me brother Mustafa narrated an in another narration of the Hadith reported by Abu D when he sallallahu alaihi wasallam traveled and intended to pray a voluntary prayer he used to direct his riding camel towards the say allahar and pray facing whatever whatever Direction it is fa it faced okay this also uh uh did we read this no we didn't read this who didn't read this okay three more marks are taken away from you okay then this Hadith reiterates the fact that some Scholars have but again I have to go back to my references and check if this Hadith is authentic or not because as we stand I don't have any recollection of it so we have I have to go back to my references inshallah next time we meet I'll have it with me inshallah nevertheless if you can if you were able to do this okay but if in the case you are flying or in the case you are on a bus and and and the car is going in a direction different than the it would be probably difficult for you to do so so we have to go back and ensure that this is the correct uh uh virgin and authentic uh Virgin uh what else now this Hadith tells us that the prophet Sall wasallam used to make 100% use of his time because you travel for days and nights now do we do the same do we make use of our time when we travel if you travel in air airplanes nowadays they came up to the point that they brought movies and music to accompany you for five or 6 hours while you're traveling and flying or maybe more if you're going to the Far East or to the to the West the Far West you probably mounts up to 11 or 12 hours of flying and they bring you the latest movies the latest music everything that you want to do except things that connect you to Allah and it's very strange the amount of you know the amount of an awareness of people of their of their lord Allah the almighty you you are stranded between the skies and Earth there's a very big possibility your plane is going to crash lots of people had plane crashes and died in it so why you you do you think that you would be safe from having such an incident nevertheless the people don't have any fear of Allah while while they're flying they watch movies they enjoy themselves they listen to music they have fun and none of them even think of praying I remember once I had a flight to Viana Austria and the flight started at late night and in midair fer Dawn fud prayer was was due and all those in the aircraft were mainly Muslims and to my surprise until we landed not even one single person stood up and prayed and they're all Muslims this is strange this is awkward prayers should be in our blood we we should not abandon prayer under any circumstances and yes to answer the question you're thinking of there was a place for people to pray and there was enough place and space but the problem is Satan comes to you and says listen you're going to Europe and you're going for a vacation to have fun if you stand up and pray what all would what would all these people say about you look at this primitive look at this he's praying who prays nowadays we're going to the place where we can have liquor and booze and and and women and gambling and have fun that we're going to the place that no one will consider us as Muslims so why pray before I I last flight I came in I was Trav traveling to an Arab country and unfortunately in the plane the women that went in they were all covered in Veil and black uh uh dresses and you know they looked very nice you know you couldn't see anything of them and the minute the the aircraft was Airborne they went to the bathrooms and they came out with their jeans tight jeans and shirts and and and perfume and and and blonde hair and what the hell is happening where where is this I thought that we were hijacked by UFOs or something and they were transformed and these are aliens and and started shaking hands with them what is this they said well we're going for a vacation okay do you have a vacation from Islam you have a vacation from work you have a vacation from your uh H commitment to school or university but you don't ever have a vacation from your religion and from your beliefs unless unless you are not a Believer unless it's a matter of habit once we have the Habit we're Muslims once we're away from those who are looking at us then we are not Muslims anymore so this is a serious thing when you're traveling you should always connect yourself with Allah as the prophet did sallai Al the following Hadith Hadith number 167 n Abu may Allah be pleased with him the prophet s. wasam said the whole earth is a mosque except graveyard and a toilet uh can you repeat that again the whole earth is a mosque to pray on except a graveyard and a toilet and a toilet now this is what I don't like about translation the word Arabic word is H and they've translated it into toilet did the prophet and the companions have toilets no so how this translation translates to toilet then what what was meant by toilet no a place where you relieve yourself yes but they didn't have any ham hamam in Arabic means you know the Turkish Turkish uh bath where a big pool with hot water and people rubbing uh uh uh people's backs and cleaning them it's Turkish or Syrian or morocc Moroccan in some countries it's found it's a general place for bathing uh we have to pae here inshallah after the break we will continue talking about Hadith that we have just heard so stay tuned in this program inshallah we'll be discussing the major sins in Islam the way that the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam had taught us why the neighbor does not care about their neighbor anymore why does the father does not care about the son anymore why does the mother does not care about her daughter anymore there's major SC that we need to be very far away in our lives so we could get and get the place of Allah subhanahu waala obtain the pleasure of Allah as long as we commit those major sins Allah subhah Waal would not be too pleased from us and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will punish Those who commit those major sins keep away from what Allah subhanahu had forbidden and you'll be the closest worshiper to Allah it is our duty in front of Allah subhah wa tala to keep away from what Allah had forbidden as when we commit those sins especially those major sins remember you are displeasing in your lord and you are bringing upon the curse and the anger of your lord upon you and welcome back just before the break we had the Hadith uh that stated ab's where he said that the prophet Sall wasallam said the whole earth is a mosque to pray on except a graveyard and a toilet and we said that the prophet did not have a toilet so the translation is wrong the word ham means a public bath where people did not have bathrooms in where they lived so they go to a common bath where they bathe in it the the the water is hot and sometimes maybe they get a back scrub or or soap the prophet says in this Hadith that it's not acceptable graveyards okay we understand but ham why some Scholars say because usually the the people are exposed there and maybe one would not wear a towel or cover his a properly but the Hadith is self is not authentic so we don't have to go uh uh you know a lot out of our way to try and elaborate and explain this Hadith though the meaning is acceptable and also similarly it is not preferable for us to pray in places that are not uh modest and respectable such as uh uh bars such as churches such as uh nightclubs we should not honor these places by praying in them as it is not suitable Place uh uh to pray in Mustafa um what about uh Muses that have graves in them there are certain mosques that I believe have graves in well this is a very a good question the rule is that any mosque that contains a graveyard or a grave prayer in it is void and unacceptable this is crystal clear and it's it's understandable but the question is what should we do if we have a mosque with a grave in it okay how can we correct this error now prayer in it is unacceptable so how can we correct this error what do we do do we you know uh uh uh destroy the mosque or do we take out the grave F I don't think we can take out out the grave because this will be disturbing of the dead and uh if we could like take down the mosque and build somewhere else it's okay but it's going to be very costly so the best solution would be just perform walls or a different room for the grave for and try to isolate as much as possible from the mosque okay Abu Malik scholar said that uh what was put in first stays okay and that is correct whatever came first stays so if a person died and we buried him and then later on people came and said let's put a mosque build a mosque on top of his grave then the mosque has to be destroyed and if the opposite is true that is the mosque was built and after a while someone died and we brought his body and B buried him in in the grave then he should be dug out and buried somewhere else so this is uh the most authentic of all opinions brother Mustafa so what about Prophet Muhammad's sallallahu alaihi wasallam grave yes what about Prophet Muhammad Sall alaihi wasallam grave fat Prophet Muhammad was buried in his house in his at his home and the mosque was closed by he had doors opening in a certain of time the the musque was being expanded expanded expanded Till by mistake it included the house of the Prophet inside the mosque s wasam so therefore he he was not buried in the mosque he was buried in his house which include the Mosk at the end that's the answer to your question the prophet sallallahu alh wasallam when he died he was not buried in the mosque he was buried in the house OFA and that is why the prophet uh companions may Allah be pleased with them when they had a dispute among them the prophet is dead so they didn't know whether to take his body and bury him in or what to do with it so one of the companions came and said that I've heard the prophet Salli wasallam say that prophets of Allah whenever they die they are buried where they're dead so he died on his bed dig under it and bury him in the house of may Allah be pleased with her after 40 or 50 years in the Oma Reign One of the uh rulers of aaya wanted to expand the mosque so he included the house of the Prophet Alat wasam in the ex in the expansion now the scholars tried to stop him but he had all the gunpow around he had all the authority so they could not say anything or they cannot do anything anything because they were they were hopeless or they were helpless they could not do anything to change the situation and that is why if you go to the mosque of the Prophet Alat wasam you'll find that this is the direction of the and this is the room where he was buried but inside the room you will find three triangular wall so the the room is surrounded by a triang and the tip of the triangle is to those who are trying to pray to the room so if this is the and you come and try to pray to the room you cannot be facing the room because to face the room you have to be either this side or this side or giving you back to the and then you are not facing or praying to the room and this is an exception that cannot be you cannot do anything else do you want us to dig the prophet Sall alam's grave this is completely Blasphemous no one can do this now do you want us to uh uh destroy the area where the mosque is where the Prophet Sall wasallam room is included then people around the Muslim world would accuse you of being a wahhabi of being all sort of names and and gestures and this is not logical and that's acceptable it was there for the past 100 well 1300 years plus it will stay there but other than the prophet Alam no one has any sacrecy no one is sacred so you can take their graves out if it came after the mosque was built and unfortunately nowadays we have lots of rulers building their mosques and saying to the people that when I when we die bury Us in the mosque and this is forbidden this is unacceptable at all could couldn't they like an in Medina just like d not remove the little part where you know when you go out and the the grave is on your left only this little part the exit like change the exit so and then just so the and put a wall so the the great the house of the Prophet or his barrial wouldn't be inside the mosque just a littleit the problem is that you cannot change anything in Medina the the people will not accept it and they will consider this to be an act of blasphemy the Prophet himself sallallah alaihi wasallam did not do certain things because the people were not ready as in the bukari and Muslim where he says to just because your people are were not they're newly Muslim they were close to kufur and Jah just because of this otherwise I would have destroyed or uh um destroying is not the word I would have you know uh rebuilt the Kaa and made it on the same pillars of Abraham this means that he would have enlarged itat and I would have made two doors one for the people to enter from and one for them to exit so what stopped you Prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said because your people are not ready their minds are not capable of grasping and comprehending this it would have you know be too insultive for them Abdullah Zu when he ruled Mecca he did this and he did exactly what the prophet wasallam wanted to do when he was killed and hajaj came he again rebuilt it and made it as it was and then when uh 10 or 15 or 100 years later one of the kif wanted to rebuild it again as the prophet Sall wasallam wanted to do it one of the said don't do it because now people are you know ridiculing with the Caba one builds it and one dismantle well takes part of it off and one adds something to it and this is not the way it's supposed to be so you cannot change much in Medina because you have 1.7 1.8 billion people that believe in meca and Medina and anything you do even if you are following the Sunnah even you doing if you're doing the right thing they would consider this to be as Blasphemous and they will not accept it so the harm you're getting out of it is more than the benefit of course the benefit is to get the wall back again so that the room and the house of the Prophet sallam is out of the mosque there's no doubt in that but you cannot do this if you do this all the Muslims and the holigans and those who who have uh uh hidden agendas would come out and say ah look at them they don't like the prophet they don't follow the prophet they do this they do that and they start cursing and doing things that are not uh uh uh true and correct so the Hadith talks about the graveyards the cemeteries and talks about the public baths telling us that it is not uh allowed for us to pray in these areas the Hadith is not authentic as mentioned before uh going to the public baths is is not a recommendable thing because lots of are exposed there especially for women it's forbidden for women to go to these public places and take off their clothes though there are only women but they will be exposing their bodies and this is forbidden a woman should protect her body so that no one else would look at her the same thing a man is supposed to protect his body that no one else looks at him at his a and to have these things protected uh as far as the cemetery some Scholars say that this is forbidden simply because uh in a cemetery the soil itself is impure why is it impure because of the remains of the dead people so the remains of that people makes it impure is this correct no no it's not correct so why isn't it recommendable for us to pray in cemeteries because we don't want to pray for the dead you know you may have people coming and praying though they're praying to Allah but they pray to have their W their Imam their Sheikh in front of them and this is not acceptable um I'm afraid we don't have time FY for a question uh but until we meet next time inshallah we'll try to go through these topics once again until we meet next time oh oh"
