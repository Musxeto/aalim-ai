  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m m [Music] alhamd dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to Mercy to Mankind sallallahu alaih wasallam now we've reached almost to the 10th year after the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam received the first revelation after two or three years of being surrounded andalib by the pagans not allowing anyone to sell or buy from them not allowing anyone to talk to them or communicate with them after 3 years they came back to the senses and they let them out of that Siege they were in just as they went out Abu Talib who was 80 years old felt the number of years and the trouble that he had to defend the prophet Sall wasallam from facing he fell sick and soon afterwards he died he was the supporter of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam though he was a non-muslim but he supported the prophet wasam more than any Muslim could have done so sh so what was the reason of not becoming Muslim despite he was supporting the most supporting one of the prophet and the most protecting one of the Prophet Sall the reason was that he was a man of customs and a man of tradition and in so many cases it is the customs and traditions that prevent people from changing their way of living and change is a positive process but it has to be to the positive when the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam came to him while he was on the bed of death while he was dying he came to him and urged him uncle say the word say I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshiped but Allah alone subhana wa tala say it and give me the excuse to intercede at the side of Allah with it so that you would be safe from hell and he kept on thinking of doing so but unfortunately next to him was Abu jahal and another of the pagans telling him are you willing to abandon the religion of your ancestors of your father Abdul mutalib of your grandfather Hashim and so on so they kept on reminding him of his traditions of his customs of the things that he lived lived for all of his life it wasn't that easy for him to do and he was in a struggle but at the end he looked at his nephew and said Muhammad I will not die and let the people talk and say that I have abandoned the day the the religion of Abdul mutalib therefore he died on the religion of ABD mutalib there are weak and unauthentic narrations that that say that in his presence was Al Abbas his brother and Al Abbas told the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that I heard him say the word and Whisper it but the prophet told him that I did not hear it these are unauthentic and we have unfortunately a lot of unauthentic uh hadiths and reports trying to change the situation as Muslims we would have loved if Abu Talib reverted to Islam because that was the best thing that could have happened and the prophet would have been extremely happy because of that of that Abu Talib was like a father to our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he took care of him when he was 8 years old and he lived with him since so 42 years he was supporting the prophet Alam taking care of of him defending him and he knew that he was the messenger of Allah he knew that he was saying the truth and he never said it was a lie but so simply the traditions and Customs that overtook his decision and he died as a non-muslim she is that true that the prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him asked from God to elevate in his punishment on the day of judgment in the hell well he did not ask but the companions of the Prophet once asked the prophet himself they told him Abu Talib was a great help and support to Islam so what did that do for him what good you Prophet Muhammad Alam presented to him he said well because of what he did to me and because of me Allah Asel has made his punishment the least in hell and how was that the prophet told us that the least punishment in hell was for Abu Talib a stone a burning stone is to be put in his slippers from its heat his brain boils and this is the minimum thing that anyone could be punished in in in Hell yet Abu Talib thinks that he is the greatest pun he's having or receiving the greatest punishment of all now imagine this is hell and this is the minimum so what about the maximum what about those who go down and down and down God protect us from hell so the prophet Sall wasallam was shocked by the death of his uncle and he was shocked Again by the death of his uncle as a non-muslim and if you notice that the life of the Prophet Alam was was filled with tragedies his father dying when he was when his mother was pregnant and then his mother dying when he was five or six years old and then his grandfather Abdul mutalib who took real good care of him also died when he was 8 years old and then the Revelation came to him through his life the death of his two baby boys abim and Al and Abdullah as infant and he was left without any son of his own and then the death of Abu Talib when he was what almost 50 years old so when you need the support when you need the help all the help you can get you're not young anymore his uncle died and he lost a support that he had and to add to his grief only 3 days afterwards the love of his life his best friend His companion the perfect woman of this life as the prophet told us that four women only were perfect and among them was khadus with her 3 days after the death of Abu Talib she also passed away and that why that is why the people called that year the Year of grief it was so so shocking and so bad to all the Muslims to hear what happened and it you can imagine the effect it was it or or it had on the prophet alham the death of his lovable Uncle who supported and protected him and 3 days afterwards the death of the love of his life that was with him for almost quarter of a century are these events had an has an effect on Islam On Da it definitely did because the pagans now knew that the only thing that prevented them from attacking and abusing the prophet Alam is gone which was Abu Talib and the wealth of Khadijah was also Gone But at the time it was not of any importance because the prophet did not need her money he needed her support and love which he now misses so the only logical thing for him to do was to start looking somewhere else where he could find a safe haven for him to start and spread the message of Allah Asel he looked around and the most appropriate Choice was T at the time thif is an hour drive almost from Mecca but it is on the top of mountains it's a mountainous City so the prophet Salli wasallam took almost a day to get to T and he went and he presented his religion to the tribes trying to and the dignitaries of of T trying to get the support from them and get them to host him and accept him to come to their city and defend him but to his surprise none of them accepted him and on the contrary they insulted him humiliated him and told him that if you were the messenger of Allah it's either too low for us to believe that or you're too high for us to talk to you and they ridiculed him and they did everything in their hands to uh reject him and also they asked their young ones and their servants and slaves to throw him with pibbles and Stones until his heels uh uh uh started to bleed and was accompanying him he had a companion with him that was Z har Z har tried to protect the prophet Sall Ali wasallam until his head started also to bleed because of these Stones thrown at him and in a guarden there that was owned by and sh they saw him and they were from meccah also they were the pagans but they felt sorry because he was from their country and from their tribe he was a cousin of theirs so they allowed him to come in and they sent their servant Adas to him and this servant was a Christian or from a city that was called Na and when he went to him and told him and and and gave him a plate of fruit he asked him about his name and where he was from and when he told him he told him then you are the follower of Jonah yunas mat and the man was astonished because no one knew this messenger of Allah at the time they were all pagans and he told them do you know Jonah you know yunus meta he said yes he's my brother he's a messenger I'm a messenger of Allah and the man fell down to kiss the prophet's feet the owners of this servant and shba looked at him and said he spoiled our servant he has spoiled our servant and when he went to them he told they told him what were you doing and he told them that this is a man of God he's a messenger of Allah no one knows about Jonah no one knows about Unice meta except him and they kept on telling him come on he is not a messenger he's lying your religion is by far greater than his religion we have a short break so stay tuned if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day our our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our

TV so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you [Music] asalam alaykum and welcome back the pagans did all what they can to prevent the prophet Sall alhi wasallam from spreading his message he tried his best in TF the mountainous city that is about an hour drive from Mecca he went there he took almost a full day to reach there and whenever he went to the dignitary of Mecca to present his religion they would ridicule him they would reject him and they would ask their servants and children to throw him with stones who is this man who's coming asking us in our cities to shun our Idols our Gods who is this man who's asking us only to worship one God and to abandon all these gods that we we have the prophet Salli wasallam went out of T and he was completely depressed may Allah be pleased with her once asked the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam later on oh prophet of Allah have you ever faced a very tough situation worse than uhud the Battle of uhud and we will come to mention that later on inshallah and he told her yes when I went to T and I was met with the worst meeting anyone could have and they did this and they did that I came down from T and I I was so depressed to the Limit that I W I only woke up in a particular area called now can you imagine someone being depressed and so worried to the extent that he does not feel or see what's in front of him this happens if you have a a crisis a big problem you would probably get into your car drive and not wake up except after 1 hour and you recall the hour that pass and you don't remember anything how did I drive how did I get here how did I avoid having accident a person walks without thinking because he has so much that worries him and this is exactly what happened with a prophet Alam he was not worried because of a wife or a child he was not worried because he had a financial crisis he was not worried because he was Ill he was worried because he was unable to deliver the message of Allah Asel as he wanted to he's the messenger and prophet of Allah and this was his priority to call people to Islam and this should be as Muslims also our priority and whenever you watch Muslims you can feel how far or how big the Gap is we as Muslims may ask others to come into Islam we may give few hours or few minutes from our day to calling others to Islam and this is not acceptable the prophet Alat gave his life full-time job as preaching people calling them to Islam and we can do this we can call people to Islam through our work through our Sports through our Behavior through our ethics and good morals morals this is the best way to call people to Islam and this should be the only thing that is worrying us because everything else Allah Asel will make it happen the prophet s wasallam while he was coming down from T on his way to Mecca he saw the Archangel Gabriel who came to him and greeted him and told him oh Muhammad this is an angel who is responsible for the mountains and the angel responsible for the mountains said oh Muhammad Allah has instructed me to ask you if you wish the people of thif I could collapse the mountains on them and they will perish and die this would happen also to the people of Mecca just give me the order and I will demolish them and the evidence backs this up Allah has demolished and annihilated the people of sadum the people of AD the people of samud all these people that came before us they have demolished them and they he the almighty has set an example to us to observe and take lessons from so the angel was saying you want me to do this I'll do that in no uh without any problem in seconds if we were the ones who were just beaten up and thrown with stones if we were the one who've been accused of lying of being Sorcerers of being poets insane priests fortune tellers if we were the one that were our our uncle has just died and my wife has just died and people are torturing my followers and abusing them and in some cases killing them if we were the one in that situation I guarantee you that we will immediately say well if you can take them and the cities around them that would be a good thing to do but that was not the the response of the Prophet Alam why simple because he was the Mercy to Mankind he was not sent to punish yes he was a Mercy to Mankind to all mankind so the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam told this Angel no don't attack them don't annihilate them don't demolish their cities because I hope and I wish I pray to Allah and I urge Allah Asel that from their descendants there will come people that worship Allah Alone look at the mercy of the Prophet sallallah Ali wasallam and look how far he's looking he has a very Noble objective and that is that Allah Almighty would be worshiped so maybe this generation would not worship Allah asael but from their descendants from their offsprings there will come people that worship Allah the almighty and that is exactly what happened because few years later the city of of T they all converted to Islam and after the death of the Prophet Alat wasam everyone rejected Islam except Medina mecah T and bahin which is the Eastern uh uh area of Arabia and this shows us that the pro Prophet Alam was not sent to punish people to kill people he would he was sent as a mercy to all mankind the prophet sallallah Al wasallam went back to Mecca but then he had a problem as many of the companions had this problem the problem was if he goes to Mecca people will attack him the same thing happened with Abu Bakr the same thing happened with though they were respected among their families but because they have declared their religion and Faith people had all the right to attack them Abu Bakr he had one of the dignitaries of mecah giving him his Allegiance and protection and that was he told him and he went to the people of Mecca and told them Abu Bakr is in my protection and why was that because he saw him packing and and wanting to leave to Yemen and he told him Abu Bakr where are you going he said well my people abuse me and oppress me and they do not allow me to worship Allah so I'm going to Al y to worship Allah there he said no you are an honorable person you feed the poor and help the needy the likes of you do not abandon their country come stay and you have my protection and he went to the people of Mecca and told them that Abu Bakr is in my protection had the same problem they wanted to kill him but who was one of the leaders of quray one of the dignitaries of quray said you have my protection as for the prophet wasam when he came back to Mecca on his way from T he didn't know what to do so he sent a man to a number of men and each one refusing to give him protection and refuge except mut mut said I'll give you the protection you need and he ordered his sons to wear their armor and weaponry and then he went to darad and met the dignitaries and the leaders of quray and told them Muhammad is in under my protection whoever harms him he will face war from me and my children and the prophet went back to mecah under the protection of after the death of Abu Talib and that is why on the Battle of Badr when the prophet wasallam captured the prisoners of War he said that if M were to be alive I would given him these prisoners for his sake it shows you the Gratitude of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to this unfortunately man who died as a non-muslim but still the prophet wasallam appreciates the fa the favors done to him and he was in by in his turn uh ready to return the favor to that man who helped him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was now safe and able to spread his message without the fear of being attacked as it was at the time of Abu Talib with this we come to the end of today's program so inshallah until we meet you next [Music] time m [Music]"
