  "transcript": "what's the ruling on watching cartoons such as aladdin and teaching our children about the tooth fairy and things of such nature these are two different things tooth fairies and what they do to you after taking your tooth this involves shirk and this is not permissible to even talk to the children about when you talk about ada dean i i'm not familiar with the story but i already know that it's a genie that comes out when you rub a a lamp and you say he says i'll grant you three wishes and if you ask for an apartment he says okay if i can afford an apartment i wouldn't have been living in this lamp something like that these are stories and fables and culture is filled with it so as long as the stories themselves don't include haram so in arabic we have khalil and we have many things that are related to animals etc and we know that these are not true but there is moral behind it and there's nothing haram in in reading it then there's okay but if it includes women free mixing shirt things that goes against our religion we definitely must filter that and not allow our children to watch it even if it was a disney production even if it was something that they enjoy and and everybody else is watching"
