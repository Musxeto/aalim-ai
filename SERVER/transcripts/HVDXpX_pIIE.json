  "transcript": "Elizabeth says if another convert is not practicing and does not believe in Islam anymore if she comes back to it does she have to say shahada publicly or can she do it privately if a Muslim commits an act of apostasy between him and Allah everyone else still consider him or her to be Muslims so this is something between them and Allah if they go back and revert to Islam again and embrace it and they're remorseful and they're regretful they do not have to expose their sins and go to others and say listen we've committed this and that we have apostasized rather they just say the shahada and express their remorse to Allah and that would be sufficient insha Allah"
