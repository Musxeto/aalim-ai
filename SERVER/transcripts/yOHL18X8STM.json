  "title": "How to serve the parents if you live separately with your wife and kids? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "profile says we in Kashmir live in joint family but you seem to support nuclear families I don't support any weapons of mass destruction but I think he means that moving out of the house so then how is it possible to serve parents when we live separately please reply in details first of all if you look at the time of the Prophet Alakazam and the Companions you will find that they once got married lived in a separate house the most famous example Fatima may Allah be pleased with her with Ali bin Abi Talib once they got married they moved out and they lived in a separate quarters now it is very good of you to think of the welfare of your parents they have rights over you but at the same time your wife has rights over you and we never heard that the Companions used to live with their parents in their houses maybe there is an exception where jabber nabbed Allah even how omni allah be pleased with him and with his father when his father was martyred he got married to a woman who was not a virgin and the Prophet Isis I asked him why did you choose someone who was previously married instead of picking a virgin like you and he explained that he did not want he had a number of sisters children and he did not want to bring another child to them who did not know how to take care of herself let alone of others so he brought someone who is a bit mature older and wiser so this is the only exception where we find maybe in the Sunnah that a companion lived with his wife with his family so the wife lived with her in-laws to make this the norm as it is being practiced in the subcontinent whether it's Pakistan India Bangladesh etc this is wrong meaning that in one out of a thousand you will find that the parents are really too old and need help and assistance but in normal cases in 99 999 cases out of a thousand this is not the case you will find that the the in-laws the the parents are healthy and strong and can do everything on their own yet the culture mandates that when the son gets married he brings his wife to serve in the house she's not a maid she's not a servant you married her to serve you as a husband and your children but not your parents and not your sisters and siblings and and we know that in such joint families there isn't anything as he jab because the brother-in-law is exposed to the sister-in-law and they mix and sometimes catastrophes take place and I have lots of stories of such mixing because this is what the Prophet asaram warned us of when he said that beware do not enter upon women folk so a man stood up and said o prophet of Allah what about the in-laws my brother-in-law my uncle etc to meet and mix mix with my wife the Prophet said ISM the in-law is deaf so if you want deaf to approach your wife and you feel that is normal then you allow your brother or your uncle who is not a Muharram to her to mix with her this is crystal clear in' in islam so she has to have her own separate quarters composed of one room a bathroom a kitchen whether it's separate home or it's an annex of the house where it is isolated if she doesn't want to see any of your family the whole day the whole week the whole month this is her right which is not obliged to cook for them to clean for them your mom is not entitled to control your wife this woman was free when you married her what right does your mother have to control her where she goes and where she doesn't what she buys and what she doesn't what right do your sisters have to go into her room without her permission and use her jewelry use her clothes or snoop around like so many do this is not fair this is an Islamic so you have the option either live separately or live in an annex of the house or in the one out of a thousand case when your parents are really in need of care you have to please your wife and take her permission the vast majority of women when they see that her father and mother-in-law are vulnerable and weak and need assistance they would volunteer the vast majority but when they're not in need and you force her to live with that this is an Islamic analyzation knows best"
