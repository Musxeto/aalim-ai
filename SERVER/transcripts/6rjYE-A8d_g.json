  "transcript": "Sheik I recently watched a video where an Imam broke down in tears during Salah while reciting the story of Ibrahim peace be upon him and his son in Surah saat witnessing this video made me realize that despite reading the same story for over 20 years I have never felt such depth of emotion and connection this is not just about this story I often fail to grasp the nobility of the Quran and Hadith even after reading and listening about Islam a lot it troubles me deeply Shake because I gen want to feel and understand these Divine words as wholeheartedly so sh how can I strengthen my IM to understand and connect with the words of Allah on a different level this is the beauty of the Quran and of the Hadith and this is the nature of our hearts our hearts don't beat at a fixed rate it has tops and people and it has valleys as well and this is the belief of that the IM increases with good deeds and decreases with sins unlike what the say that Iman is one unit cannot be increased and cannot be decreased and unlike what the say that Iman is a whole lumpsum if you break it with one major sin you're a cfir are not like this this means that you have Peaks and this is why for 20 years we read the same Quran the same verses of the Quran and all of a sudden one day Allah wills it and the light of the truth penetrates your heart and you read an Ayah as if it's the first time you've read it in your life as in the case of Omar for example when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam died and everybody was in chaos and people did not believe that he died Omar said if people keep on saying that he died I'll chop their heads off he did not die he was only on a short Journey or erand like Mo Moses was and he's going to come back until Abu Bakr came and started to preach the people and he read the a Omar says this Ayah as if I've heard it for the first time in my life though I know it by heart Muhammad is merely a messenger whom before him came so many Messengers and it speaks about about his being he's he's dying so Allah is preparing the Muslims that he's a human being he dies like everyone else so Omar says may Allah be pleased with him this is the as if it's the first time I ever hear such an Ayah so this happens to all of us now we can't sustain a very high level of Iman as per theith of may Allah be pleased with him Muslim the prophet said sallallahu alaih wasallam oh if you were at your homes and your businesses and Farms with your wives and children as in the St same state of Iman as you are when you're with me then the Angels would descend and you will see the angels in Broad day light and you'll be able to shake hands with them because you've reached the peak of Iman but this is not possible because Iman go goes up and down so you should strive your level best to pursue this highest level of Iman by reading the Quran by contemplating upon it by reading the Sunnah by contemplating upon it by actually implementing it in your life sharing the beautiful meanings that you've learned with others and this would help you inshallah sustain such an IM Allah Knows Best"
