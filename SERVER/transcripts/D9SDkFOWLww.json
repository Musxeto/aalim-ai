  "transcript": "my questions about the morning ofar after F Salah uh if I if I pray F Salah and I forget to do the morning ofar or uh because of time constraints I don't do the morning ofar is it permissible for me to do the morning ofar later in the day like after sunrise or maybe even closer to Z time thank you what purpose Abdullah of morning AAR ABD to recite to recite it in the of course wh what what is the purpose of it why do we say it uh as far as I know it's uh for like uh protection excellent this is what I wanted to hear so to answer your question if you want to get protection from morning time till evening time you have have to say it let's say 6:00 a.m. if you forgot or you were too tired negligent and you did not say it until 10:00 or 11:00 then you're not protected from 6:00 till 11: the moment you say it the protection begins it's like your antivirus on your computer if it's not activated it's not going to work if you deactivate it You're vulnerable for attacks but if it's activated the moment you activate it it starts to work with the grace of Allah so is it mandatory to say no it's not mandatory but you're the one who's going to lose a lot of benefits from not being protected that's all so you can delay it but with the threat of being vulnerable for attacks and Allah knows best"
