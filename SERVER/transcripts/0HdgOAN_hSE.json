  "title": "When should a traveller pray his prayers in full? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah my question is regarding shortening the prayers while we are traveling and also combining them we all know that we have the option of combining up there while traveling and also we can shorten it but the dispute amongst the score has arrived when we reach a particular case 15 days are you talking about reaching your hometown or reaching your destination you're traveling to no no I traveled from my homes and played to another country to another country so you're allowed to shorten and combine your prayers even if you reach that town for example if you are residing in Lahore and you're traveling to Islamabad you go to Islamabad for five Six Days Seven Days ten days you combine and shorten there because you are still labeled as a traveler when do you pray normally when you become settled meaning that you have an apartment or you have moved in with your brother or with your cousin and now you're settled you're staying there for three four months this is when you start to complete your prayer and Allah Knows Best"
