  "transcript": "um so my question is basically um what like constitutes like backbiting so is it like Haram to like State like oh this and this such person like did that or like can I give like a general overview of what happens and people know who you're talking about no okay backbiting as defined by the prophet is to mention something that your brother hates people to know about in his absence so if my brother is unknown to the people I'm talking about talking about with for example I come and I see my brothers or my wife and my children and I say to them oh today I met this arrogant driver he did not want to do this and that he crossed a red light and he caused an accident he was an ignorant imbecile and when people tried to speak to them he start started fighting with them physically what an imbecile now all of them would curse him would say bad things about him would make Dua about against him none of them know that know him is this backbiting nope there's no problem in that at all but backbiting is when I come home and I say listen your brother did this and that yesterday when we were invited to a wedding and I'm telling my wife your brother is is um is dumb he's stupid he should not have done done this now if he were to hear this he would be angry this is backbiting although he's dumb with all due respect to my brother-in-law but say stating such a fact in his absence does not change anything because backbiting is stating a fact that would anger the person in his absence and Allah Knows Best"
