  "transcript": "foreign foreign today inshallah we're going to discuss one of the main events that took place on the sixth year of hijrah as some scholars say others say it took place in the beginning of the fifth year of hijrah and this is the event or the incident of if and if means something wrong something gossip rumor it means lie is the lie that was told and people talked about and gossiped about the origin of this incident again was the hypocrites and if you look around it's either the jews or the hypocrites who would do and dwell such events it started when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his companions were coming back from the muslim and on their way back aisha tells us may allah be pleased with her that she lost a necklace when they were camping so she went looking for that necklace and that was about a day or less before reaching medina so we're told that she left and searched for her necklace not knowing that it was time to leave so the people responsible for her camel and what is known as helge and it's the carriage that a woman sits in and it's being carried on uh the shoulders of men and then put on the camel the woman not the the men responsible for her camel not knowing that she was not there they lifted the house and put it on the camel and left because she was light in weight she tells us and when she came back she found that the people had already left and she didn't know what to do so she sat down in her place thinking that when someone would miss her they would go back again to where they camped and this is very important for people who go camping whenever someone especially children they are to be taught that whenever you are with a company and you lose track of them do not go and wander looking for them stay where you are they will eventually come and look for you because if you wander around most likely that you will be away from the center of the location and people will not be able to find you she sat down in her place and went to sleep now every army had a man or more looking and investigating what the camp plays and if they've lost something if they've dropped something if someone was lost and in came suffolk may allah be pleased with him he was the one responsible for such things in that particular battle when he came close to aisha she tells us i was asleep and i woke up when i heard him say we all belong to allah and we are all going to allah the almighty and this is the sentence is said when something happened something something of a calamity of a catastrophe so when he saw the wife of the prophet allah on her own on that place he said this word she woke up when she heard this and she tells us that he recognized me because he had seen me previously before hijab was made obligatory upon us which indicates that covering the face is obligatory and by the way this is reported in bukhari and muslim so it bears the highest degree of authenticity in islam she tells us that he was so polite he did not even say one word he got his camel to sit down and i mounted over the camel and he walked with the camel until we reached medina but already the people had arrived in medina so when they saw us coming in the hypocrites started to talk definitely they had something going on between them and they started slaundering mother aisha may allah be pleased with her she was unaware of that she tells us that the minute i went into medina i felt sick and for a whole month approximately a whole month i was ill in my house and i could not know anything of what was going on from the gossips because i wasn't seeing people i was sick in my bed the only thing that did not look normal was the prophet's salallahu alaihi al-assalam's attitude and behavior towards me i didn't sense and feel his usual kindness and love all what he used to do was to come when he visited me and they say how are you today and that is it but i didn't know what was wrong so and i had nothing to fear so i there wasn't anything for me to doubt she wasn't know anything about what happened no she has no idea none whatsoever and three of the companions of the prophet sallam talked and gossiped about not from their own but with the handiwork of abdullah who was filled with hatred to the prophet and to islam these three companions were hassan and mithabit the poet of the prophet josh who was the sister in law of the prophet because her sister was zainab may allah be pleased with them all so she tells us that after one month of being sick i went out with most of his mother and muslim was the cousin of abu bakr so he was related to aisha because is the daughter of abu bakr and he was among the very first to migrate to medina and he was also one of the soldiers who fought in the battle of badr so he is a top pranking companion of the prophet allah she tells us that we were going out to answer the call of nature outside the skirts of medina because at the time they did not have bathrooms in the houses and she tells us as we were walking out and it was nighttime mustache mother tripped in her dress and as she was tripping she said a bad word about her son so she's praying against him as if she's saying that damned him so isha stood and said that's not a very nice thing to say about a companion of the prophet who is your son and at the same time he attended badr what are you doing how dare you say such a bad thing about him so master his mother looked at her and said oh child you are unaware of what he said and she told her no i wasn't what did he say and she told her everything about the lie the event of the ifk and the lies they've managed to make on her she said that the minute i heard this i felt sick again and and i just went back to my house and i met the prophet ali and i requested him that i go and stay with my parents so that they could take care of me now she did not discuss this with the prophet sallam she was shocked by the fact that for the past month the prophet knew the companions knew and they were gossiping about her and no one told her about this she went to the prophet to to her parents house she got even sicker and she was really sick she went on crying for two nights and two days non-stop tears would not stop crying of what had happened and about the gossip the hypocrites were spreading and the prophet alaihis allowed her to go when her mother saw the the the case and saw her situation she tried to relieve her she said daughter anyone like you in your status if she was close to her husband like you are close to the prophet of allah her co-wives would again talk about her and try to degrade her at her husband's side and she was again astonished saying subhanallah everybody knows about this except me she kept on trying and crying and the strange thing was that the prophet salallahu though confident of his wife's innocence for a whole month allah azza tested him by not revealing her innocence and this again showed shows us that he is a prophet of allah because if he wasn't he would have immediately said on the first day that yes she's innocent i know her i trust her and this was a test from allah for all parties the prophet salallahu was uncertain because he could not judge over a case without having proof it's not what he likes or what he feels this is the beauty of islam it is facts and figures you have to have evidence that proves this he brought us and he brought alibi and he consulted them what to do and their answer is what we will know inshallah after the break according to the quran we live in a universe that worships allah it is not just human beings who celebrate his praises but animals as well join us every wednesday at 20 gmt for your show even animals glorify and welcome back the prophet salallahu was confused so as was his custom he brought us his eight and ali nabi talib one of the two most beloved people to his heart and he asked them what what do you think you've heard what the people are gossiping about so what do you think of aisha usabilizate was a young man he knew the amount of love the prophet alas aslam had for aisha and he knew that she was a pious person and she was the daughter of the best companion of the prophet allah so she came from a house of faith and belief so he told the prophet allah o prophet of allah we know nothing about aisha except that she is a chaste person a person of virtue and pisces pisces and that she comes from a very good house so you love her and you know her we we cannot say any bad thing about her alibi the cousin of the prophet sallam and his son-in-law told him that there are so many women that you can marry off so as long as this one has doubts around her get rid of her and marry another one he wanted to relieve the prophet salallahu and he told him just to take a second opinion ask the maid barira who serves so the prophet asked bharira and said i i have not seen anything that is not acceptable from aisha except that she's a young girl she's still young she used to prepare the dough to be baked and while she's doing this she would fall asleep and the chicken would come but the goat would come and eat it without her noticing this which says that she is she does not have any ill intent she is pure and honest and truthful robert sheikh what about the companion the who used to with the said the one who sent that to the medina did the prophet salallahu ask him about anything happened he talked to him well we were not told of this because this was not proven and the prophet sallam did not want to interrogate something that was not yet an accusation on the contrary the prophet sallam went once and delivered the speech in the masjid on the member on the steps that he usually used to stand on and he asked the people who would pardon me from a man talking against my wife and my family and accusing them my wife with a man that is affordable who i'd never seen or heard anything that was bad against me so the prophet sallam is asking the companion about the deeds of abdullah the head of the hypocrites who would pardon me from what he has done who would give me an excuse that is acceptable what do i do with such a man who is accusing my family with safari and this man saw final mutter i've never heard anything bad about him he's always been good to me and to my family so sad the leader of the house because abdullah in obey as you recall is from khazraj so said o prophet of allah just point to us the man you want if he is from the house we will kill him and as he is from the hajjraj we will chop his head off no problem now sad saying this who was the leader of the hajj raj he's a good man he's a good companion of the prophet sallam but subhanallah he's human he felt that he had to protect his tribe and this is what is known in arabic hamiya it is part of arrogance that is not accepted in islam because in islam you're instructed to stand with your brother whether he is on the aggressor side or he's being oppressed so the companion said the prophet sallam if he was oppressed i know how to grant him victory and and to stand by him and that is to defend him but what about if he is on the is the aggressor how do i stand by him the prophet told him that you should prevent him from his aggression this is standing by your brother whether he is the aggressor or the oppressed saddam hubbard tripped may allah be pleased with him on that incident and he stood up and said by allah you are telling lies you are unable to touch one hair of him so now he's defending the enemy of allah but aisha tells us that he is a good man he is a pious man but that on that incident he tripped he did he made a mistake be pleased with him stood up and shouted at saddam and told him that you are telling lies and by allah we will execute whatever the prophet sallam or whoever the prophet saw tells us to do so and both and you remember they had wars among them for 100 years for a whole a full 100 year before the uh uh migration of the prophet saws so they stood in the masjid and they were almost about to fight until the prophet salaam came and came down and calmed them and they respected the prophet salallahu salaam and stopped i shall may allah please with her continues to say that i kept on crying tears would not stop and i cried for two nights and a full day until i thought that i was going to die you know when you cried so much you can cry for what five minutes ten ten minutes an hour a full day and the tears keeps on keep on falling but for two nights and one full day she thought that she was going to die and she tells us as i was there one woman from the ansar came in and visited me and she herself broke into tears with me and we both sat crying and weeping the prophet sallam at this incident came in and he never came to sit before that day for a full month he never came in to sit down with me so he came in and i thought that maybe something was revealed by allah so he came and he started praising allah azza and then addressed me by saying if you had sinned then ask allah azza for forgiveness because allah forgives the sins of those whom repent and if you were innocent then allah will clear you and will prove to the world that you are innocent so ask allah for forgiveness she says that the minute the prophet salallahu said this my tears seized and stopped and i didn't know what to say so i told my father answer the prophet of allah and the father abu bakr said daughter i don't know what to say so she looked at her mother and said answer the prophet of allah and also the mother said daughter i don't know what to say she tells us about herself she says i was a young girl and i didn't recite a lot of the quran and i told them that by allah i know that you've heard something about me and you've accepted and believed this gossip that people are gossiping and if i confess of doing something that i didn't know you would believe that because this is what you want to believe and i don't find any example for you and myself except the example of the father of joseph she says i was so young i didn't recall who was joseph's father and that was jacob and he said that i will ask allah azzawajal for patience and i will seek his support on whatever you you say i'll depend on allah on whatever you say and she tells us that she gave her back to the prophet allah she knew that if she told them the truth nobody would believe her if she told them i didn't do anything nobody would believe her and if she confessed of something that was not true they were all believe her and she says to us that i didn't think that i was something to the extent that allah would reveal verses of the quran all what i wanted was the prophet to claim and say that i was innocent but to my surprise i saw the prophet alaihis being revealed to and whenever the prophet had the revelation he used to sweat she says and it was a very cold day and the prophet started sweating and when it was over the prophet salallahu broke into laughter he laughed and said uh give all due praise to allah the almighty because he revealed your innocence so the liberation came in the same time on the same time in the presence of abu bakr and um roman and all the other parties were all in there and the prophet says had revealed your innocence so um roman the mother of aisha told her go to your husband go to your husband in form of gratefulness and being thankful aisha said by allah i will not go to him and i will not go to anyone because it was only allah who revealed my innocence uh from the heavens so she was grateful only to allah and again she is a wife and it did not come from the husband it came from the messenger salah and it was not from him it was from the allah the almighty now the truth was unveiled and now the consequences of those who gossiped and said what they've said must take place and effect i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program when we meet inshallah next time i'll tell you and discuss what took place with the three that were involved in slandering our mother aisha may allah be pleased with her and until then was huh oh oh"
