  "transcript": "from bangladesh says some people say and he is referring to a scholar from hadith in his country that listening to the quran being recited by a tabliri or the dubundi or whatever from the people of innovation is sinful and it would erase all of your deeds i doubt that any scholar would say such a statement with all due respect but if you can confirm this and this scholar said exactly what i have just repeated this person is not a scholar he's from the hawaris most likely because he is nullifying people's good deeds for listening to the quran from an innovator if you listen to the quran from a mushrik kafir it would not nullify your islam it would not cancel your deeds what kind of extremism is this and he quoted uh him saying that even or even has him or someone else i don't even syrian i think yeah and said he said something like that i don't know about such quotations and to tell you the truth maybe they've said it maybe they've not i doubt it highly nevertheless we have the fundamentals of a religion do you think if eben tamiya comes or imam muhammad abdullah and tell us something that goes against the quran sunnah that we will abide by the way but let me rephrase that i'm getting a second thoughts do you think if they say what they say even that goes against the quran sunnah that we will abide by by what they said and abandoned the quran of course not no muslim would ever say such a thing that listening to the quran from someone who's an innovator would cancel all of your good deeds this is heinous this is ridiculous now if a person is classified that he is from the people of we've talked about this gazillion at times innovations are levels there are innovations that takes a person out of the fold of islam like the innovations of everything in this universe is allah himself or the innovation of thinking that the prophet is created from allah's light and he's not from uh created from adam or from clay and that he knows the unseen and that he controls the universe this is blasphemous but there are innovations that do not take a person out of the fold of islam such as in the case of when a person innovates certain adkar or prays certain types of prayers or throws celebrating the birthday of the prophet these things do not take people out of the fold of islam your quote unquote who says this is the type of person when he sees any type of innovator and the innovator says he does not reply to salaam if he invites him to a wedding he does not come so he's classifying him as a kafir this is a treat of the hawaris this is a characteristic of the khawarij so you be careful of this so-called scholar and try to avoid the likes of him and allah knows best allah you"
