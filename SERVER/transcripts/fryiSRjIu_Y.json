  "transcript": "I want to ask a question about about price bonds I want to ask is it permissible to invest in price bonds like if I invest in price bonds and if I win I will get the price and if I lose I will get my money back so okay price bond let me understand it is like the bonds that the government issues right yeah so it is a form of a loan because it's not an investment yeah like they will give up they will make up rise like ten people will invest like five hundred years they will invest in it okay okay I will assume you see that so Abdullah is asking from Pakistan about the price bonds all bonds are haram why bonds are actually putting your money and taking taking a certificate in return and this money is alone and usually it's a loan to government so it is not an investment see an investment is when I give an entity a government or a company an amount of money knowing what they will do with the money whether they build a factory plaintiff arm the sell commodities whatever and they tell me that you have thirty percent of our net profit but if we lose your money will be lost accordingly because it depends on the investment and this is trait there is gain and there is loss this is Hallett the bonds you buy there is nothing halal in it they you put ten thousand dollars in a year time will give you the $10,000 plus two three percent seven percent twenty percent depending and this is total RIBA so they come off logit again with the prizes so you give us ten thousand dollars and there will be a draw every month and you may win a Porsche or a Ferrari or you may win a Kia depending on the government so is this Halla again this is gamble and it is RIBA based as well and this is prohibited and Allah knows best"
