  "transcript": "if Mohammed Soleimani you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters divided on the show then he gave he be screaming after no maroney's well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to another episode of contemporary Islamic issues and concepts on Hydra TV I'm your host arkem regime on this episode we will continue our discussion on Islamic eschatology now in the past we've spoken about the belief in the last day the concept of this last day and the Sheikh has mentioned many minor signs that will take place and that have already taken place before the day of judgment and we've also started discussing the major signs in the Sheikh has given us wonderful descriptions of the gel and how he will be when he comes and also a very sorry Salam so to start off today's discussion let's welcome the share to the show a Sanaa Malik when welcome to the show she has a Maliki body comes Salam what I want to live ellicott shift so in the past we've spoken about the Mandi we spoken about it early Saddam we spoken about the jaw now let's let's cover some more of the major signs and then inshallah we can conclude this series on Islamic eschatology that we've been doing so if you can start us off with either the beast the rising of the Sun from the West the hydrogen ma'juj whichever one you would like in shock she loves watch her malice will learn who is our enemy who dare who what I do as a timeline the best that we should talk about would be Eugene ma'juj gog and magog and why is that because after the Mahadi comes out and he fills the earth with fairness and justice then it is that the jail who comes and spreads his era of terror and deception followed by ISA peace be upon him who comes and kills him and reigns for 40 years while in his reign while ISA is there Allah the prophet told us are some that jujin ma'juj would come out and what are the illusion magician to huge tribes and they are human we were told about them in Surat al-kahf chapter 18 at the very end and as stated before the surah has four main stories each one revolves on a calamity and a temptation which is similar to what the Dajjal would bring so we have the temptation of wealth and the jail would come with the treasures we have the temptation before that part of the wealth of the two the man with the two gardens there's the story of the youth who went into the cave due to the prosecution in their religion so fitna tell at the religion fitness Adeem this also would come with the Dajjal because he would test people in their belief in Allah dodging the temptation of wealth the temptation and the fitna of knowledge where musa peace be upon him said I'm the most knowledgeable person on earth and then Elijah Rijal told him to go and accompany the other to know what knowledge he has that Musa does not have peace be upon them both and finally the temptation of power and authority which was given to Luke our name now the car nine which is the last story of surah the calf was a king they say he was a contemporary of Prophet Ibrahim he had peace be upon him he had great knowledge of languages so he did not need interpreters he communicated to everyone and he swept the whole earth from east to west and he was powerful he was fair and he was god-fearing when he reached the east the people there complained of the mischief of youjin magician and they were spreading a lot of violence and may have and chaos so they proposed to her name that he may help them and they will give him money and he said I don't need this I I don't need your wealth so he built a barrier of iron and of a copper a big dam that they were unable to climb it neither to dig a hole in it and the Prophet told the sorriest alotta said that there will come a day that they will come out and cause a lot of trouble to us how is that the Prophet told the sorry so Salaam that they dig every single day until they see some light and they say their supervisor says with them okay leave let's leave it here and we will come tomorrow and when they come the following day they find that they have to dig again because it went back to its original form and they're back to square one every single day for the past hundreds or thousands of years they've been doing the same task till the time that Allah allows them to go out there supervisor would say let's stop here and we will come tomorrow insha Allah and continue so they make an exception by saying if God Allah is willing so when they come in the following day they still find the day of light and it's only few inches and they're out when they come out they come out in their Millions Allah knows best most likely they will come out in their billions because there's so many of them they are disbelievers are the humans they're humans some say that they are not humans but definitely they're humans and they're not from the jinn because the Prophet told us I assume that they are from the dwellers of hell Allah told Adam o Adam extract from your offspring the share or the portion of hellfire so Adam said what is the portion of Hellfire Allah says from every 1999 so the companions may allah be pleased with them we're shocked into the prophet of allah out of every thousand one only would enter paradise how can we qualify for this because the percentage is huge so the Prophet said don't worry ya Jews and Jews are included which means that they are of the offspring of Adam in this so huge should extent that they pass by a lake called Lake table area and it's in the sham the Levant region and as they passed the people drink from it when the last of the army comes to it they find it dry so they consumed a whole lake how many are they and they say ah we heard tales that there was water here and it's all gone so this is there a brief description they are so arrogant that they kill everyone they see and once they get to a limit of their arrogance that they even think that they can overtake Allah soldier so they take their arrows and they shoot the skies as if they want to kill whoever is in the sky now let the exalted from that and Allah Azza WA JAL tests them by returning their arrows with blood with blood on them so they're happy and see how we killed the people of earth now we've killed the people of the heavens then the people complain to praise them peace be upon them you say look what they're doing they're killing us they are corrupting the whole of earth so pray to Allah so J so ASA praise to Allah for salvation for protection so that Allah would take care of them Allah the Almighty sends to them a small warm a warm that goes into their noses and kills them and all of a sudden it's like an epidemic so when you see these airplanes air fighters fighter fighter jets the the missiles the nuclear bombs do you think that we have no choice we have no chance we have no way of surviving and you always forget that it is Allah who runs everything when Allah wants it he can destroy anything and this is what happened with gog and magog a small warm that went into their noses and killed them all so in matter of a short period of time they're all dead so the people are happy but with all these corpses the whole of the air and the water in the the soil is beginning to rot and smell so again they go to esa' and say do something for us so he asks allah azza wajal for a way out and allah almighty sends a birds huge birds that has the neck of a camel something of a creation that we do not know of is it the reintroduction of dinosaurs or the these birds of prehistoric times Allah knows best and they snatched these bodies and scatter them away from human life and but Hampton that everything goes back to normal very interesting actually you know all these topics are so interesting the stories and you know the predictions that the prophecies are made so we've completed the odds Madras just very briefly so I wanted to go through the beast the rising of the Sun from the West and also the wind or fire from Yemen whichever one you're gonna do next in Chaves okay among the signs the major signs of the Day of Judgment a sign call at Duhon now Dohan translates into smoke smoke and in colliculi arabic it refers to cigarettes because when when someone smokes it smokes comes out the smoke is mentioned in the Quran Allah says then wait you for the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke converting the people or covering the people is a painful torment so this is one of the signs do we have any about it no it's mentioned in the Quran the Prophet idiso sallam told us that it would come and in a hadith that is disputed over its authenticity it stated that it would be like the flu and it will make the people who inhale it become big like a balloon and then he would die out of it so we don't have strong information about it but we know that it is coming and it would be like this some people said that this sign had taken place among them is a beloved masud may allah be pleased with him as you say bihari but the majority of scholars say that no this is a different interpretation because when famine struck full of Quraysh because the Prophet asked Allah to give them drought and famine a person would come up of his house due to hunger and thirst and would see fog so this abdullah wrote said was the fog and the torment you see but the majority of scholars say that this is his interpretation which the other companions did not agree upon agree on so basically with in terms of the wind this is mentioned uh sorry in terms of this smoke that you've just mentioned it's in the Quran and it's also in the hadith of the Prophet SAW said is there any other description for example that it comes from Yemen is this taken from the hadith er this is an interpretation we don't have any reason to believe that it's coming from Yemen what is coming from Yemen is a different thing and that is the soft wind at the very very end of time see when ISA is there peace be upon him there are no disbelievers after his death Eman level seems to decline and drop and there would be sinners there would be disbelievers and at the very end of time the day of judgment would not take place with believers on earth this soft kind beautiful wind from Yemen would breeze and come and take all the souls of the believers and they will come another went from sham that is from the north southwards that would do the same so when there is no soul that is believing on earth then the day of judgment would take place while all the kafir and disbelievers are there okay sure before we continue our conversation we're gonna go for a short break so dear viewers so far we've covered a couple of them made signs such as the the hydrogen ma'juj and though the smoke after we come back from the short break we will speak a little bit about the beasts and also the rising of the Sun from the West so stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were speaking about some of the major signs before the Day of Judgment sure we've covered ya'juj and ma'juj and we've covered the wind coming from Yemen that's all the way at the end of time and we've also covered the define the smoke or the smog so now there's two things on my mind that I have left if you could explain whichever one you want first the beast you know what's what's this what's this thing about the Beast is he gonna come what is he gonna do I mean I've even heard accounts that he's gonna break the kaabah it's a true thing or is this from the hadith is it somebody made this up and also the Sun rising from the West is this also true is this is it going to physically rise in the West's there is some questions I want to ask you and Charlie about these things so whichever one you want to start off with okay first of all the beast was mentioned in the Quran Allah soldier says in the Quran and when the word of torment is fulfilled against them we shall bring out four from the earth a beast to them which will speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our signs in our ayat the hadith tells us that there will come a time where there is a beast and this beast would speak to us and this is shocking to some but to those who read the hadith of the Prophet as Salam know at the end of time there would come a time where animals speak where even your shoes your whip your house would speak and also your body organs and all of this is backed up by authentic hadith the Prophet tells us a time while one man was riding over a cow the cow stopped and looked at him and he said I was not created for this and I said what the heck a cow talking the cow was created to cow but not to be ridden so the Prophet SM says I believe in this and I've been Homer and abu-bakr also believed in this that this will happen also the wolf after taking a sheep from a shepherd the shepherd takes the Sheep back after fighting the wolf and the wolf says why do you take something that Allah has given me and the shepherd looks at the was it well what is this Speedy Gonzales what's happening and the Prophet says I believe that this will happen and so does Abu Bakr and Umar so they they work out time this beast is different it will come as a way of tormenting people speaking to them explaining it to them of course nowadays if this happens is all what a freak it is something that is a mutant it is something that is this or that this beast is something that is unlike anything we ever seen it will brand people in their faces under noses and those brand it will live long long lives to the extent that after the Beast has gone people communicate they said oh where did you buy this animal from and the man said I bought it from one of the branded ones meaning that they've lived so long they are few of them but they're known to be branded by the Beast do we have any more information no we don't is it as you've mentioned earlier what did you say about it that it's gonna break the carbide that's gonna break the car but no this is all not authentic those who will break the Kaaba is most most most likely the one from Abyssinia who comes to attack the Kaaba from habesha and to break it and this is also one of the signs of the Day of Judgment at the end of time so this this idea that the Beast will break the Kaaba is a complete misconception it's nothing to do with the beasts he has a whole different purpose see the issue is that where do we get this information from its from the Quran Sunnah and which Sunnah are we talking about because there are fabricated hadith there are weak Hadees it has to come from the authentic hadith that were authenticated by the scholars of this science otherwise we will be like telling people tales and fairy tales because you get some so-called Diaries sitting and talking for endless hours about the dead Jan and they go into details saying that the Dajjal is already out and he is in the UK and he's the monetary system of the USA in in the central but what is this some of the brothers made a series on the internet called the arrivals like 50 hours of them I saw a couple of episodes in pathetic they're saying that the Dajjal is there and they show you a high risers and Dubai and elsewhere and they said this is the Dajjal this is the one eye and they make you know think conspiracy theories and and things that are baseless no as muslims from a hallucinogen are we have to refer to the or an anti vision and obviously that's where we get our information from the the sound a hadith of the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam now the last major sign that we wanted to cover on our show in sha allah was the the sun rising from the west what can you tell us about the sun rising from the west is this also an amazing event that's going to happen or is it is it something that it's not going to physically happen metaphorically metaphorically you know what's the situation here well a lot i've just mentioned this in chapter 6 verse 158 allah says do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them or that your lord should come or that some of the signs of your lord should come the day that some of the signs of your lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe then if he believed not before nor earned good through is faith this ayah all the scholars and the companions and the Prophet that is awesome told us that this is referring to the sign of the Sun rising from the West this is true accurate physical and again we have to realize that we are servants of Allah and Allah is the master of all he who makes the Sun Rise from the east every morning it does it come by itself like the eighth day there's no God creating anything all of this has created itself by itself this is rubbish this is nonsense so many times I tell a theist when I speak to them okay if you talk about evolution let's bring a pile of wood and put it in a room and lock it for a million years after 1 million years we open it would it be a kitchen table or a cupboard definitely not you need a maker so it is Allah Sojin when he wills it it will rise from the West and once it rises from the West this is the end of acceptance repentance the Prophet tells us as I am that repentance is accepted anytime you have the time you need to repent today tomorrow in the morning in the evening but once the Sun rises from the West then there is no going back even if you want to repent Allah would not accept your repentance so this is the most horrific sign because it's the very end of everything once you see it that's it and what about there there are some people that say that it's actually not physical it's metaphorical and that the rising of the Sun from the West actually means the rising of knowledge and education from the West is this completely wrong or what your thoughts in this this kind of interpretation is known as a tough seer at Botany where people tend to say that there's an apparent meeting and there's a hidden meaning and what you laymen and folks know is the apparent meaning this is for people who don't have connections we have connections direct communication with our Lord and we know what's hidden and what's written between the lines and this is the methodology of a little bit ah well uh WA the methodology of the people of deviancy and of whims and desires you can come to any verse of the Quran or to any hadith and you can twist it and manipulate it by saying that this is not the right thing to say for example when the elephant invaded with Abraha Mecca trying to demolish Kaaba at the year where the Prophet was born at least alot of Salaam the people were idol worshippers but Allah protected the Kaaba Allah sent birds with stones one of their peaks and - and their claws throwing them hey Jonathan means it gene Allah says in the sewer everybody was an interrogator faribault caballo Stubblefield LME al Qaeda Fe table etc so everyone knows that this is a real incident that took place real flocks of birds killing all the invading army with these three stones lately we get people claiming to be Muslims and saying no no no no this is not real this is smallpox and this is a form of epidemic that took place and killed Spinola it killed them all and did not kill any of the people of courage whatever is this so twisting the meanings and interpret it due to a hidden agenda this is completely unacceptable I thank you very much if that comes that brings us to the end of our episode for today inshallah you know you've given us a wonderful you know explanation of so many of the major signs and minor signs so you know once again thank you very much this dear viewers I hope you guys benefited from today's program don't forget to join us next time on contemporary Islamic issues and until then may allah subhanho wa taala bless us all
