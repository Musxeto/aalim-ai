  "transcript": "yeah what's the ruling uh on false promise or like someone uh tells you to do something that you don't like and you don't want to argue with him and you just say okay I will do it and you won't do it that's false promise what's the ruling on that this is not a promise it is saying something that you will do it but you decide not to do it there's no problem in that inshallah uh unless it becomes a habit when you promise people you say I promise you I will do this and it becomes a habit then this is a characteristic of the Hypocrites so the best way out is to always include inshallah so I will come tomorrow inshallah definitely I will have lunch with you inshallah this inshallah exempts you from lying and from false promises and the likes and Allah Knows Best"
