  "title": "Can a woman lead men in prayer? Woman Imam for women, where should she stand? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes mean says can a lady lead the prayer in house with other ladies for example can I lead the prayer with my daughter's and where should I stand as an imam first of all it is permissible for a female to lead other females when there are no nun muharram around this is totally permissible and unfortunately again we see people introducing things into Islam which can be blasphemous and this is the way of the enemies of Islam in attacking Islam trying to undermine the infrastructure of Islam with we're getting news from a mosque here or there in Europe where they try to integrate men and women in congregation in salat in the Masjid and I saw one with two Imams a woman and a man both leading the prayer of men and women intermingling together no barriers a man standing next to a woman and the women were not wearing hijab so I thought for a second that this is a new cult because definitely this is not Islam and it is not Islam yet it is obvious that the enemies of Islam and the hypocrites are collaborating trying to destroy Islam from within so those who are distant from Islam would consider this to be something new something worth praising and supporting not knowing that this is blasphemy changing the religion of allah azza wa jal defying the purpose of hijab these people don't even know the quran don't know the sunnah and they're introducing this new gimmick of theirs to again attack the infrastructure of islam this is totally unacceptable and their prayers are all invalid but for a woman to pray with other women this is totally legit yet it is totally prohibited to allocate a Masjid only for women and this is again another innovation women can pray together in their homes there's no problem to build a message it and say that this is for women only to have a woman leading them five times a day or to even give them the Friday khutba this is totally prohibited and an innovation in Allah's religion so to answer you yes ma'am yes you can lead your daughter's your sisters your friends and as any ma'am you must not stand in front of them like the Imam of men stands in front of them you should stand within the first line next to the worshippers as one of them and Allah sol-gel knows best"
