  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to our 16th class of the islamic faith and today in sha allah we will be talking about chapter eight and basically chapter eight is designated to address the issue of the impossibility of having any contradiction between what allah has revealed from his religion through the quran and the sunnah and the logic the reasoning that humans are known to have when this logic and blizzarding are sound and perfect what is the importance of such a concept to the apida of the muslims it is extremely important especially nowadays when we live in a materialistic world where everything is supposed to be governed by science logic reasoning experiments which led a lot of the people astray and refusing to believe in the unseen as as a consequence they don't believe in religion because something they cannot see they do not believe in its existence and from an islamic perspective we have extremes and a middle path there are extremes such as the super sufis who tell you to believe whatever comes out of the mouths of their peers and leaders where you should be like a dead corpse between the hands of the person washing it he turns it as he wishes and does what he wishes and the opposite there are the marthezilla who say that first comes the reasoning and logic then comes the revelation with the quran or sunnah and you don't know allah except with your mind and your intellect and they don't believe that allah can be seen in the hereafter they don't believe in so many of allah's attributes their own sick logic led them to say that sinners who commit major sins are in an area between two places neither they're impressed and believers are nor they are disbelievers but they are in hell forever they it led them to say that the quran is created among other things that are heinous and unacceptable and can easily be blasphemous what caused all of this many of these things were caused by a a own person's intellect and reasoning and in an arab proverb they say whoever uses his brain in where there is no place for his brain to be used he will be killed with by his own brains he will be destroyed by his own intellect because he did something he was not supposed to do so the essence of islam is to submit to surrender when you come and say that i would rather use my logic and my reasoning ahead of the quran the sunnah this is a sign of destruction it was used by satan in the beginning when allah told him to prostrate and he refused he justifies he justified his refusal by claiming that logically i am better than him you created me from fire and he was created from clay and fire is far superior than clay so i will not look what his logic led him to if you search around you will find also that the son of prophet noah peace be upon him after 950 years calling them to islam and his people refusing allah ordered him to build an ark so he built the ark he embarked on the ark and he told his people that the flood is coming and you all will die and none of them believed him then when the flood started he saw one of his sons and he said my son come and embark with us on the ark and you will be saved he said my reasoning my logic tells me to go to the highest mountain where i will be in shelter from such a flood and we know that he drowned before he attempted that he used his logic in rejecting allah's instructional order nowadays we have the same problem we have people and you've probably heard this a lot claiming that the reason for the muslims to be back benchers to be not adapting to the technological changes not being civilized not being modernized the reason is that they're abiding by the sharia instead of depending on logic and reason we've seen others claiming that whatever it is they will not accept any ruling from the quran or the sunnah unless their reasoning tells them it is valid and this defies submission this defies surrendering which you have to do to allah you have to submit and surrender to allah's ruling so this chapter deals with this fact with this introduction i will go through what the author has written and inshaallah we will explain what needs to be explained when revealed text and rational thinking are combined together religious truth is fully understood so this is clear revealed text is of no benefit to one who has no reason and reason on its own is of no help to one who has no knowledge of the revelation when either of these is missing knowledge of the truth is deficient should they superficially contradict each other reveal text is given precedence because it comes from allah perfect knowledge while reason is derived from the knowledge of creatures which is imperfect now sheikh al islam even he composed a big book of many volumes and it's called the defense the rebuke of the possibility of the clash between logic or reason and revelation because sometimes we hear people saying that this is not logical and i'll give you an example you may reject something in islam your rejection is either due to the fact that your reasoning or understanding is corrupt and false or due to the fact that the evidence the revelation that you're depending upon is either misunderstood or not authentic but whatever comes from quran or sunnah must coincide with pure reason and logic even if people hate it on the surface for example marrying more than one woman this is totally logical and the reasoning behind it is well established why not a woman marrying more than one man this is also clear and crystal to people why is intoxicants prohibited go to any hospital or any prison and look at inhabitants of these two places and you will understand why why is interest or usury prohibited in islam ask the economists look at the credit crunch on 2008 look at the great depression look at so many things very obvious very clear why is incest prohibited all religions prohibited why is stealing not permissible logically i don't want people to steal a penny from me so how can i justify myself stealing from them and the list goes on and on and on but sometimes there is a hurdle that doesn't seem logical how is it possible when a dead person dies and he's buried he's brought back to life and he sits in his grave when we know that there is no place for him to sit and then that he's questioned and that he's tormented or maybe blessed with blessings from paradise how is this possible well there is a limit for your reasoning there is a limit for your logic as there is a limit for your sight and hearing this is where you get information from so just because you can't see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist just because you can't hear it it doesn't mean it was not sad the there are limits for you the things of the unseen heaven and hell this the the path the sarat uh the scale um the torment of the grave the angels the jinn these things we do not see but we believe and there's nothing against your logic or reasoning or intellect to believe in it so let us move on um hoping to finish on time the sheikh says reason is like the seeing sense while the revealed text is like light so now let us try to imagine how reason and revelation work together the sheikh says our reasoning our logic our intellect needs to work in a particular environment as the sight the eyes require light to see likewise your reasoning needs the light of the sharia of the quran and sunnah in order to sync with it and be fruitful because the eyes in pitch dark environment as as good as not being there you and the blind person are the same because there is no light so no matter what you are if you're an einstein if you are um addison if you are a newton without the revelation your intellect your wit would would not do you any good in the hereafter in the world maybe yes you'll invent something you'll progress in something you'll do something that might be useful for the humanity but nothing other than that while with the light of sharia you will prosper for eternity the sheikh says no one benefits by having two eyes when he is in pitch black darkness just like a rational person benefits nothing by his reason without revelations the better the light the better the vision similarly the more text is revealed the better reason is guided when religious text and reason complement each other perfectly full guidance and insight are at their optimum just like vision is at its best at midday allah the almighty says is he who was dead and whom we have raised to life and for whom we set up a light to see his way among men to be compared to one who is in deep darkness out of which he cannot emerge this is a parable allah is giving us between someone who is guided by allah so he's alive he's been risen from the dead he's been given light to see while the disbelievers are in deep darkness and they cannot come out of it a rational person benefits by reason in his life just like flying and walking animals benefit by their instincts what does that mean it means that when we say reason intellect and logic without revelation has no value this is when compared to a person who has that in addition to religious knowledge he will benefit from that immensely and we mean by that in the hereafter but in this world logic intellect and reason can benefit an individual in worthy matters so you can become a manager you can become a supervisor a director a ceo but this has nothing to do with the hereafter whether you will make it or not so a rational person benefits by reason in his life exactly like the birds and the animals who have a particular kind of instinct but it has no power of revelation so they know when to travel and when not they can feel the dangers that are coming to them the sheikh says they migrate and settle at certain times they know each other find their way to their areas make their own nests and recognize their predators however this is all what they can do they cannot get a degree they cannot build skyrises because they're limited in their reason and logic and intellectual powers however man cannot find sufficient guidance from reason to know his lord in full unless he benefits by what he the almighty has revealed to his messenger and this is a universal fact the biggest brains in the world who can build space rockets who can discover the nanotechnology who can do wonders in science they cannot know when to prostrate for forgetfulness before or after the salam without the revelation they cannot know that there is only one way for salvation on the day of judgment and that is the acceptance of islam without revelation and the list goes on and on so their intellect benefited them only in worldly matters man simply cannot reach out to his lord without the benefit of divine revelations because without them he is in darkness and this might sound a bit strange especially to those living in capital cities like new york uh delhi mombay london paris milan rome all of these cities to many of the us seem to be the capital of civilization the people the culture the aroma thinking that this is the ultimate one can reach not knowing that all the light you see around you is darkness in reality because without islam they are living in a pitch-black dark environment don't become don't be fooled by their catwalks by their movies by their music industry don't be fooled by their financial systems and industries and trade and farming without la ilaha without islam filling up their hearts they are in total darkness listen to what allah says to what translates to allah is the pardon is the pattern of the believers he leads them out of darkness into the light as for the unbelievers their patterns are false deities who lead them out of light into darkness those are the people destined for fire therein to abide this is crystal clear however this translation does not give the verse its due right allah says that he is the patron of the believers he leads them out underline this phrase leads them out of darkness and in the arabic verse of the quran it is darknesses so the noun darkness is not one there are many types of darknesses while there is only one light and this shows you the power of arabic language allah doesn't take the people out of a single type of darkness but all types of different darknesses and this is done by one light and this is the light that was revealed to muhammad ali which is the quran and the light that is equivalent to the quran in its glowing power and that is the sunnah so both quran and the sunnah are light from allah azzawajal given to us so that we can exit these different types of darknesses that we are surrounded by the sheikh says we note that allah says that he leads them now this is between quotation marks leads them is missing a word which is very important so please add it to your notes we note that allah says that he leads them out without out the word or the phrase doesn't make any sense allah leads this out leads them out because without him they will remain in darkness light is the same even though it may be a of different types such as fire brightness likewise revelation is the same even though it may be in different forms such as the quran and the sunnah allah says believers obey allah and obey the messenger this is an order from allah allah says so this is an instruction now all of this has deep meaning to it and you need to reflect and think and ponder upon it the sheikh says a person who says that he will know allah through his reason without need of revelation is the same as one who claims to find the right way using only his eyes without the need for light both deny what is definitely necessary the first has no religion and the second has no life two people they're similar in essence one says i will find what pleases allah without revelation and most of the muslims nowadays are like this i'm not talking about muslims need to find a way to know what their purpose on this earth is before it's too late most of the disbelievers live on earth not knowing why they are here in the first place while the muslims even their children know where they came from what is the reason for their existence on earth where they are headed and how they should act all of these are questions with their answers are known to our children the disbelievers they live till they're 60 70 years of age and they have no clue except that they are about to die and this what terrifies them the most then what so they have to fool themselves they have to convince themselves that we're going to a better place do you have any revelation no but it's logical if i'm good i will go to a better place so they are delusional this is why we cannot depend on our logic and reason the sheikh gives an example of two people one who has excellent reasoning and intellect yet rejects the evidences the revelation and he says i'll find my way he claims that he can find what pleases allah through logic which even may take him to blasphemy without knowing but he brought this to himself cleaning temples rebuilding temples where there are idols and taking care of it what are you doing you're a muslim i said yeah yeah but i want to show them that islam does not um mind if we help others but not in there can cover what are you doing he's intellectual he's smart but he has zero knowledge of the revelation and this is why he is without religion and likewise another person who says it is pitch dark but i'm not going to light a candle i'm just going to open my eyes and try to work my way into carving beautiful calligraphy on this piece of wood or assembling an electronic device or doing this or that what are you doing so this person who insists to work in pitch dark black dark environment has no life like the first one has no religion the first one depending on his reason and intellect and not willing to look into the revelation the second one depending on his sight when there is no light to see thinking that he can do something about that allah described his revelations that is the quran as light that gives guidance to all mankind allah says those therefore who believe in him the prophet honor and support him and follow the light that has been bestowed from on high through him shall indeed be successful his revelations the that is the revelations of allah almighty provide guidance to prophets and to their followers so not only these prophets benefit from these revelations but also the people they're sent to and they are all in need of that because without it it is definitely not possible to have or to benefit from so by itself such revelations from allah azzawajal is the beg the biggest and the most important favor and blessing of allah given to us we accept what allah has commanded and prohibit and prohibited this is submission when you accept what allah has commanded and prohibited and when you believe in what he has told us this is submission clear surrendering to allah azzawajal if we know the reason for any particular thing we believe in it but if we do not know it we still believe and submit and this is the threshold many muslims depend and make it a condition that you convince him in order for him to believe and if you notice that most of the sharia most of the rulings of the quran the sunnah are crystal clear even to the disbelievers logical but there are topics that are considered to be a test of your iman so when someone comes to you a disbeliever talk to me about islam islam is to bear witness that there's no god where they're being worshipped except allah muhammad is his messenger and servant okay i can understand that tell me about the pillars of islam it is uh to pray five times to fast ramadan to give a percentage of your wealth to the poor directly and to perform pilgrimage and umrah interesting why intoxicants are prohibited well as we said earlier let's visit prisons and hospitals and cemeteries and you'll find a lot of those who live there or or inhabit such places where alcoholic or as a result of being toxicated okay sounds good why is gambling haram and a major sin well you can see that so many of the people become compulsive gamblers and they lose their wealth they sell their daughters to prostitution they do anything just to be able to gamble and this is the destruction of any community in exchange to the benefit of one out of a 100 000 or a million of the population who are the lone sharks or the people running the gambling business okay why is prostitute prostitution why is this hara why is that why do we have to pray what everything is logical people even the disbelievers who believe in but there are certain gray areas where it's an issue of this of submission when we know the reason it's easy for us to abide by it have a let's have a toast in champagne no i don't drink why because my religion says it's convinced okay but when it comes to for example eating what a disbeliever a hindu or an atheist slaughtered no i can't eat from that why it's haram but it's a a cow yesterday i saw you eat steaks so yeah yesterday's the steak was slaughtered by a christian or a jew or a muslim and this one is an ace so what's the difference the same slaughtering process has been done the cow is a cow i don't believe there's any difference this is submission why is gold haram for men to wear this doesn't make any sense i've asked about precious stones and they told me you can wear a diamond ring as a man even if it is three uh thousand or thirty thousand or three hundred thousand euros worth but you can't wear a golden ring that is a hundred year euros worth doesn't make any sense and what is this about when i pass gas from un down under no pun intended australia australians when i pass gas this breaks my wooden and if i burp this doesn't affect my wooden and it's from the same place only the exit was different doesn't make any sense and this disbeliever who was convinced by 99.9 of all the things in islam when he asks me about performing woodle to pray and i tell him i wash my hands three times i gurgle i i turn the water in my mouth and i sniff and blow my nose three times i wash my face three times i wash my arms to the elbows three times and i wipe over my head once and my ears and then i wash my feet to the ankles three times he said wow you do that for every prayer this is like 15 times a day i he says about himself as a christian wash my face only when i wake up in the morning while you wash your feet 15 times a day your foot is cleaner than my face what a beautiful religion you have my friend and after a short pause he says uh what happens if you don't have water i say well we strike the soil once we wipe our faces and our hands and that's it he said excuse me are we talking about the same prayer i said yep so why would you do that in the beginning you washed all of your limbs with water which is clean now why are you soiling your face and hands with dirt with with soil with sand with dust this doesn't make any sense here is the fork of the road the 99.9 that convinced him could not work with the .01 which his logic and reasoning could not comprehend the result he rejects islam lots of the muslims behave and believe in the same fashion and they don't know that they are this close from leaving islam if they have not left it yet and this is why in the grave the three questions are important who's your lord what is your religion who is this man who was sent to you the prophet tells us that the hypocrite the one who looked like us behaved like us but wasn't truly like among us he answers by saying huh huh i don't know i heard people say something so i repeated it and he would be treated like the disbelievers and to be tormented in it for eternity in hell so this is extremely difficult situation we have to um uh be aware of the sheikh says again we accept what allah has commanded and prohibited and we believe in what he has told us if we know the reason for any particular thing we believe in it but if we don't it will still we will still believe and submit reason does not necessarily comprehend every reasonable thing which is true how can it comprehend what is incomprehensible and how can all minds agree to it the smartest man on earth cannot comprehend every single and this is a fact there are there are limits the sheikh says the one who says that he accepts those of allah's laws and rulings that reason comprehends but this believes what is incomprehensible this person puts reason ahead of divine revelations and this is what most of the muslims unfortunately are today if our mind cannot comprehend something this does not mean it does not exist if only it only means that it lies beyond our faculties of comprehension and the gives an example the human mind has a limit beyond which it cannot go just like eyesight has a limit the furthest one can see does not represent the end of the universe or existence so if i'm in a desert what's the furthest thing i could see a kilometer two miles three miles then what then there is an end there is a limit to what i can see the furthest one can see does not represent the end of the universe or existence likewise hearing has a limit but this does not mean the end of sound an ant makes a sound that we cannot hear when an ant walks on marble no one can hear it but there is a sound when a coach calls its trained dog with a special whistle no man can hear it but the dogs can so we have limitations an ant makes a sound that we cannot hear and similarly there are atmospheres planets and stars in the universe that are invisible to us now this is deep but it does not matter how deep it is if you fail to understand this chapter is very important it is an eye opener for those who are arrogant who are ignorant who insist that they know everything and that they can comprehend everything they claim that this is not logical this is not feasible this is not this this is not that and at the end of the day they reject a lot of the sharia because simply it doesn't make any sense and this is how shaytan acts and behave when he comes and confuses an individual saying to him that you are a good person allah will not punish you because you have to believe it comes to people when they are upbringing their children and they are not following the islamic pattern why aren't you bringing up your children in an islamic way why aren't you ordering your teenage daughter to wear the hijab why aren't you ordering your teenage son to pray the masjid he said i cannot force them to do anything they are not convinced with subhanallah so a thief who wants to trespass and break into your house to steal you will not block him or stop him because he thinks that he's doing a good thing and it's his legitimate right of course not likewise your children the prophet told us hassan to instruct them to pray when they're seven and to beat them up when they are ten and this is a divine instruction from allah azzawajal through his prophet to teach our children and to discipline them and you say um i don't want to force my wife to do something that she's not convinced of i have so many people telling me that they've been married for 20 years the brother is practicing long beard always in the masjid his wife doesn't wear the hijab so what's happening he said i didn't want to force her to do something against her will okay so why did you divorce her she said i thought of giving her time so now you tell me what's happening i said well she's still defiant my girls have grown up and became like her the apple doesn't fall far from the tree and now i don't know what to do this is why i'm getting a counseling session with you sheikh tell me what to do it's too late whatever you got to do is is going to impact your life drastically and this is your mistake for not taking the initiative from the very beginning it's not a gamble that you try your luck in this is marriage you're not a guinea pig convincing yourself that inshallah allah will guide her and without you knowing it now you have a child two three five and she is defiant she is rebellious she is badmouthing you day and night and your children are with her and the bad news is that you live in a cafe country you can't do anything so this is your mistake from the very beginning if you were to abide by the sharia not by your logic or people's logic they have to compile they have to uh um i forgot even the word what's compiled composed to collect they have to uh um believe whether they like it or not follow whether they like it or not because this is islam and they are ordered to follow it not to follow their logic because we know what happened to satan when he followed his logic we know what happened to the son of prophet noah when he followed to followed his logic in died or drowned so again this is a point that we should ponder upon and reflect and see how it impacts our lives we uh have a number of questions so we'll take few inshallah and wrap it up says i like to know if it's permissible to clean the toilet with my right hand scholars in general say that the right hand is honored for good things and the left is reserved for filthy or indecent things where did they get this concept or notion from the fact that the prophet prohibited us from eating or drinking with our left while he ordered us to clean ourselves and to hold our private parts while answering the call of nature with our left and not to use the right so from these evidences the scholars came up with this logical analogy that what's the reason then most likely is this and that so those who follow this type of thinking would tell you when you clean the toilet seat or the toilet in general you use your left hand because it is used for such filthy or indecent or inappropriate things but no one to my knowledge said that this is prohibited to use your right hand so it is up to you there's no problem in using the right hand using the left is safer and better because it is something that you don't eat with so most likely you will not be affected negatively from such an act and allah knows best farzana says and she sent us like um three questions um what is the difference between shirk and kufur kufur is the umbrella which is disbelief and underneath it there are types of disbelief such as hypocrisy such as shirk such as atheism believing that allah does not exist so some scholars say that this is a bigger umbrella but shirk by itself when generally speaking we mean by that associating others with allah full stop so whoever worships an idol a tree a rock a statue whatever he's mushrik and he's kafir but if someone does not believe in the existence of allah like atheists or knox agnostics claim then he's a kafir but is he a mushrik when hypocrites pretend to be muslims but they hate islam and plot to undermine it their kafir ade mushrik this is an issue of dispute whether they are mushrik because they worship their whims and desires or not it's a long topic but generally speaking what i've told you in the beginning is the most authentic and there is a very thin line between them so whenever we say mushrik we also mean kafir whenever we see kafir we mean mushrik but when they're together this is where the distinction may take place number two if a born muslim begins to practice the religion after many years of ignorance should he say the shahada in front of everyone the answer is no shahadah is not difficult and i am always amazed by the number of questions people say sheikh i did so and so so and i think it's good should i say few seconds point zero zero zero zero zero one calorie there's no difficulty in it none whatsoever so why do people keep on asking these questions farzana the person who was born muslim this is the default and though he was not practicing he was never labeled as a disbeliever so once allah guided him and he started practicing there's no need to reassure the fact that he's a muslim because he's a muslim so there's no point in him saying the shahada which he says tens of times during the day and the night and land was best her third question is if we ever find ourselves falling into any of the kuffer you taught i didn't teach you any kuffar i taught you how to stay away from kufur i taught you the types of kuffur to avoid but i never taught you kufa should we immediately say our shahada to enter islam again the same answer if you exited islam meaning that if you did the kuffer act intentionally and willingly knowingly then you have apostasized or became a kafir but if you didn't you did something out of mistake you went to a fortune teller and believed them not knowing that this takes you out of the fold of islam then you're still a muslim and again is it that difficult to say the shahada uh zaid zubair says i'm asking about the hud of theft what is the ruling on those who snatches people's property now the issue of um the prescribed punishment of stealing we have a huge confusion among the muslims and if you were among those who watched my series of islamic phil which we did for also same as this one it's on my youtube channel and it's also on the uh facebook page of islamic and on their website the islamicflip.net if you watched it you will find that we talked about it in detail and we said that not every act of taking someone's else property is considered stealing that requires the prescribed punishment of chopping off the hand there are a number of conditions that are required to impose such a punishment punishment first of all such a crime must be done stealthily in secret not in broad daylight so if a person for example takes his cousin's property in broad daylight and puts his gear and cars and property on it this is not stealing yeah this is haram this is um taking what's not yours but it's not stealing that requires cutting the hand off why because they saw it they can complain they can defend it themselves they can re-take it while a thief comes stealthly in the darkness of the night and steals without anyone watching him second condition the wealth or the property taken has to be honored so if someone steals a bottle of wine or musical instruments or a pig all of this these are worthless in islamic terms so we don't chop his hand off it's a sin it's a crime and he will be punished by throwing him in jail by flogging him who knows but not chopping off his hand thirdly it has to reach the threshold which is a quarter of a dinar or three dirhams so it is yeah i need something of like maybe 50 dollars worth maybe something around this area i don't know you have to do the calculation number four it has to be stolen from a place that is considered to be safe so for example the shopkeepers who keep their goods on the street while they're inside if i come and snatch a jacket or a dress this is not considered to be punishable by cutting off the hand because this was not preserved in a place suitable of it so money jewelry we put them in a safe in a wardrobe or in uh somewhere hidden the person breaking into it this is a thief that we can chop his hand the ruler can chop his hand having said that be careful because if someone hides their cash money or their jewelry in the freezer and somebody steals it from the freezer this is not punishable by chopping off his hand because they kept it in a place where usually people do not save their wealth in number five it has to be proven so the crime of stealing has to be proven with all these above conditions either by the testimony of two eyewitnesses or him confessing against himself and finally the one who owns the property the money the jewelry must complain and demand the punishment so if someone breaks into my house and steals my diamond ring from my safe and i caught him red-handed and i set him free without complaining to the police or to the authorities then no one can come and say no no he stole the diamond ring and we have to uh inflict the prescribed punishment upon him this is not true as long as i do not demand that it is there's no need for this and allah azzawajal knows best and i think with this we come to the conclusion of today's class um next thursday today is monday correct next thursday inshaallah will be devoted to your questions there won't be a class but it will be only answering your questions so if you have any questions from now send them to uh the moderators in the facebook or on the web page of the islamic and inshallah we will see you then until then"
