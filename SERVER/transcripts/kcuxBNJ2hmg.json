  "title": "'Islamic Will' - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Saudi Arabia oh before that Muhammad the first Muhammad uh had a fourth question which is the Islamic will what is an Islamic will there isn't any such thing as Islamic will there is a will may Allah be pleased with him and his father told us that the prophet Alat said that it is mandatory for a Believer not to go to bed for 3 days that is without having his will underneath it meaning it is prepared and ready so if you have something to write in a will and you leave that more than 3 days then you're not doing the right thing so what to write in a will you write the things that your family need to know if I borrowed a 100,000 from a friend and he trusts me and I trust him and there's nothing documented no Witnesses if I die his money would be lost and gone down the drain and this is not right so Islam recommends that I write it down so when he claims it there's uh something uh uh written likewise the other way around if I give money to a friend and I don't take any paper from him and I die this money is my heir's inheritance my heir's wealth so by not writing it down down I have a problem likewise if my family are uh uh is known to do Innovation after my death putting uh uh lights in the streets and blocking it putting chairs bringing aari to recite the Quran between M and is giving coffee and tea to the passers by and those MERS who are coming to give their condolences these are all Innovations so I have to write them it down telling them do not do this for example but there isn't any cliche to be followed or to be adopted when writing such a will and Allah knows best Muhammad"
