  "transcript": "but the next question is is really I'm gonna take like a minute just to explain and I want to get your your take on this  and if you don't mind of course right now once it comes to credit cards because in America if you are a traveler and you wanna rent a car you need to have a major credit card and in some cases you need to build up your credit in order to be able to rent house and rent a flat because they look at the credit if you don't have one they disqualify you right away so there is a necessity out there to take a major credit card and you agree to that corrupt condition that in case if you become delay deliquent you pay the interest most of the jurist here and elsewhere they said it's permissible of course you can always negate that but because of the Cosette 19 we have this initiative now the government is offering three loans for businesses especially nonprofits like us like we do haven't been held Academy I have a school I have almost seven eight years I we have to pay for them but they say if you mishandle this fund 1% will kick off if you do not spend it on time 1% you kicks off so now there is a necessity because these teachers have to provide for their families parents and teaching Muslim students these parents are sitting at home they cannot pay the tuition anymore so I even have money coming in meanwhile the Muslim kids have to finish the school year we still have two three months left and we don't know how long this is going to take so is it permissible to apply for that it's called paycheck protection program offered by the government or not and if you need further clarification I will be more than happy I understand check even now that my question would be once the government gives me these loans and I use it justly what is the duration that I have to return these loans in it's it's pardons automatically no miss it's a grant it's a grant yes it's a grant and you use it for what it was given for there is no problem that is okay stop even if you have caused it let's assume that maybe I'm not definite here on what if you have to detain that the 10k which you got 10k no no increase whatsoever if used it justly is that permissible to apply for it if it's going to be returned usually they put a clause so okay you have to return the ten thousand the ten grants you have to return it within a year right if you did not return it within the year then it will kick off another increase no this is RIBA this is clearly RIBA and Allah does not burden us without what we cannot bear so I don't get money from the parents I cannot give money for my teachers with all due respect right any it's not a charity I'm I'm not gonna put burdens on my back and and and and face the possibility of going to hell for my students and all for my teachers and a brother a boy and then can you kindly apply then check and see if it is a grant or a loan please I know that your your your life with us here and text me please right away so I can verify with the ship insha'Allah be delighted okay I guess the last process for the credit cards yes about the credit card yes it's if it is as you have described and there's no other alternative because there can't be alternatives such as debit cards but let's assume that they do not agree for debit cards and you're forced to take a credit card my own person opinion and don't attribute this to the scholars this is my own personal opinion is you may take a credit card but you must not I repeat you must not use it before charging it so I want to use it to rent a house or to rent a car and I know that I'm gonna rent a car for one grant or two grants then I have to pay in advance in my credit card $2,000 so when the grace period is over and they want to take the money it's already there yep protection is no way Jose yes yeah yeah just like a love Haven so let me see if the brother responded or not but he did not respond whether gonna see it's a grant or not okay here is the the the next question that I have and then will benefit only the the chat we have a lot of questions a lot I'm not sure okay there is the last question just okay let me just see what is my it says right here because I didn't want to clarify this share with your permission because a lot of peers and a skin and I don't wanna shake it is alone which measures in two years we you do not pay interest if you use it okay so it is a loan which matures in three years you don't pay interest if you use it for payroll and business expenses however you pay 1% if you use it for any other reason so if it exceeds two years also you're gonna pay yeah yeah so this is no this is no goal okay jazakallah fair and Baraka laughing so this is clear and now we got the word there's a couple of lemma"
