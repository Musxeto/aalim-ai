  "transcript": "and brother musa says i read an answer in one of your replies and his long story is about the ruling on a and he says sorry but these kind of things are very common in hinduism not islam i'm not a mufti but i think in islam women have every right to get married without the consent and approval of their guardians of course uh brother musa it's good that you've declared yourself not to be a mufti because it is extremely dangerous to talk about islamic issues without knowledge backed by evidences from the quran and the sunnah according to the understanding of the three favorite generations of islam the generation of the companions the tabernae and the tabery tavian and it is extremely dangerous what we are doing and it has a great toll on us because it is easy when you know the ruling and you give the fatwa but it is extremely difficult when you reach a question where you cannot answer and shaitan comes to you and tells you to improvise or even worse it comes to you and tells you to use your logic like you have just stated you're not a mufti alhamdulillah you believe that it is part of hinduism that a woman cannot marry herself well if there's a dispute between you and i allah tells us in the quran and i don't think you have any rejection to the quran or any hesitation in accepting what quran says allah says that whenever you dispute over an issue refer it back to allah and to the messenger which all scholars say it means that referred back to the quran to the sunnah so let us see what the quran and sunnah say about a woman marrying without a guardian all the verses in the quran whenever it mentions the marriage of a woman to a man it usually addresses the guardian of the girl not the girl herself when it addresses the man it says you marry when it addresses the woman's side it says that you make them get married or you make the girl get married or you do not prevent do not prevent the women from going back to their ex-husbands whom had divorced them and now they want to reconcile so the guardian says no allah says in the quran do not stop them do not prevent them meaning that if the woman could have gotten back to her husband or ex-husband without the consent of the guardian allah would not have mentioned it and there are two or three more ayahs telling us that whenever a woman wants to get married it is the role of the guardian to get her married not that she gets married on her own so this is port point number one in the hadith in the sunnah there are overwhelming narrations where the prophet says there is no marriage without a guardian without the consent of a guardian any woman who marries without a guardian or a welly her nika her marriage is void void void said and it's an authentic hadith in a third hadith the prophet said allah a woman does not get another woman married she doesn't become her guardian a sister comes and says my mother is my guardian no this is not permissible and a woman the prophet says that islam goes on in the hadith does not marry herself only he says the prophet elaborates only an adulteress a fornicator marries herself all of these hadiths are in accordance to the vast majority of the scholars maliki shafiri and hanbali they all agree that it is prohibited and the marriage is void if done without the consent of the guardian who is usually the father only the hanafi school of thought say that it is permissible and all of the hadith and all of the evidences they presented forward are weak and not uh and cannot stand in front of these uh narrations from the quran and from the sunnah therefore this is the ruling of the prophet alaihis salatu so whether you think that this is fair or not logical or not unfortunately for you for some and fortunately for us this is the religion of allah we have to comply with it and we have to follow it"
