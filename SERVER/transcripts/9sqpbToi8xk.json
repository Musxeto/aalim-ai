  "title": "Will the children who die before puberty be tested on the day of judgement? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "khadijah from bangladesh she says that the children that died we heard that they will be tested on the day of judgment is this true first of all if the children belong to a Muslim couple by default they are with their parents in paradise and there is no difference of opinion upon scholars the difference is if the child belonged to a kafir couple some say that they will be with their parents and some say that they had not done nothing wrong and they did not reach the age of puberty so they are unaccountable and they will end up in paradise and there's a long debate and the most authentic opinion is that they are insha'Allah in paradise yet in this life the burial they are treated as disbelievers in this life but we believe that insha'Allah on the day of judgement that they will be admitted to Paradise because they are children and they're not accountable"
