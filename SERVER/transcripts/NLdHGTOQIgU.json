  "transcript": "slackman rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallahu ala mubarak arab dehiwala zoo de nabina muhammad voila ali he was a biatch mane imma bad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh if you recall last time we met we discussed about the things that amorim must avoid he must not wear and the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that amorim should not wear shirts should not wear turbans should not wear trousers should not wear a head cloak or anything that has a hood on it and should not wear shoes unless he cannot find slippers so if you cannot find slippers he must cut his shoes and he told us that a woman must not wear the knee up nor the gloves if she's in the state of a harem and a man should not wear anything that is perfumed with zefron or died with worse zefron is a perfume and die as well for the clothes the Prophet forbade this now from this hadith we learned that you cannot wear t-shirts under your hump you cannot wear underwear under your hump how about if a person has a shirt yet he does not put his sleeves in he wears it on his shoulders is this permissible anything you wear on your shoulders is permissible so if i get trousers and i put them on my shoulders it's okay what's not okay is to put my hands inside and likewise if a person you know they're on the waist rapper it is open we usually do this and do this and do this and then put a belt on it if someone comes and says I don't want to do this I want to show it from top to bottom so it becomes like a skirt you know skirts of women it's a white towel but it is sold so that he can wear it like this without any problem of opening scholars say this is permissible huh why because the Prophet I told us what not to wear do we have this description and what the Prophet said don't wear them this means it's okay the Prophet says do not wear his shirts so if i bring this dope and i just put it on my shoulders I don't wear it I just put it on my shoulders as if it's a towel this is permissible the prophet alayhi salaatu sir I'm told us that if you do not have slippers don't cut it wear your shoes until you find slippers if you don't have a waist rapper wear your trousers until you find the waist wrapper and this is very important for people who come without the intention of rum or someone sets from Mumbai to Jeddah on a flight for the reason of Rome bra and just before the my heart he looks into his hand back and he remembers that he did not pack the haram or his wife instead of putting it in his hand bags she puts it with the luggage what does he do he cannot stop the plane and he cannot go back so scholars say he must make a rom as he is does he have to make them no because this is his ability so he makes a romp if he has something on his head he should take it because this is something he can take off but trousers shirts what to do I cannot take it so say labaik elohim marambra once you land and you're able to find your rom or to buy one immediately you have to remove this and where you're wrong so this is what we learned from the hadith now we come to the issue of the new carb of a woman what is the meaning of a new car the cob is derived from the Arabic word nakhaba and nakhaba means to make a hole and this is mentioned in surat al-kahf from a spa I Haru o master paola who na ba na Copa meaning they could not drill it so then the cob is to have a mask no to have a veil that has an opening for the eyes this opening is called nakum so then the cob for a woman is exactly like a shirt for a man the man enters his hands in the sleeves and the woman can see with her sight from the neck up so it is exactly the same so what to do scholars say that if there are no men she should uncover but if there's one man who is not a muharram present or in the road or can see her she must cover her face with a veil that does not have any opening and the evidence behind this is aisha and this man may allah be pleased with them that they performed Hajj with the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they used to uncover and whenever the riders came because they're in a caravan so someone may write fast someone may write back so if there were men coming they would lower their veils and cover their faces and it's an authentic hadith so a woman who is in the state of ROM must not wear the veil but she must cover her face what about the gloves she is not permitted to wear the gloves but she can cover her hand through her abaya through her dress anyhow moving on to the following hadith that deals with at lb I think it's hadith 215 is it yes who will read it for us that'll be a of a las prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam owes labaik allahumma labbayk la piccola sharika laka labbayk in Al Honda well no matter lockable milk Larry color I respond to your call o Allah I respond to your call you have no partner I respond to your call all the praises and blessings are for you all the serenity is for you and you have no partners with you if naome are used to act labaik alibi was are they well hi Ruby I take well Russell bad ooh la koala man ok and this hadith even or more may Allah be pleased with them is telling us about the tell via what is the tell via it is what you heard to continuously say o Allah I'm coming o Allah I'm responding o Allah I'm obedient to you so you say labbaik allahumma labbayk alibi que la sharika laka labbayk in el hamdaoui near metalico al-mulk la sharika lah and you keep on doing it this is known in trip as a tell via you are doing the action of labaik you're saying labaik so they call disturbia like when you say LOL Akuila Billa they shorten it and they say how color when you say bismillah r-rahman r-rahim they call it basmala when do you say Allahu Akbar they said takbir when you say la illaha illallah you they call it a lil that lil and you need a subpanel I this is called this be we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back now the scholars have differed over the ruling of a tell bia is it sooner or is it mandatory and it's an issue of dispute what seems to be the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory you have to say it at least once or twice but if you go for hajj without saying it or formula without saying it you might be sinful and the reason of saying that elvia is following the sooner however is my rom connected to it in the sense that if I don't say tell via my harem is invalid the scholars say no your run for ombres and your home for hatch is by your intention so if I intent when I take my shower and where my garments that I'm in the state of a Haram even if I don't say that elvia it's ok but the scholars say that you should say the tell beer some of them as stated say it's mandatory some say that it is only a swinger and most likely it is mandatory but does it require that if you don't do it that you slaughter a sheep no I hope that it does not reach that extent the sooner is to raise your voice unlike other vicar where you are instructed to keep it to yourself the Sunnah is to raise your voice and this is why the Prophet said the best of Hajj is the one that has a lot of Hajj and fetch an edge means that you raise your voice with Sylvia and thatch is the slaughtering of sacrifice so this is the best of hatch and the companions used to raise their voices with the tell beer especially when things change so if they are in a road and then all of a sudden they go over a help they raise their voices if they go in a valley they raise your voices if the day comes or the night comes because of the change of the situations there is the voices with the tell beer should women do the same know if there are men she is not allowed to raise her voice she is allowed only to say it so that her neighbor would be able to hear it and men would not be able to hear it if there is no man at all yes she is like the man requested to raise her voice what about the addition of Abdullah number when he says the Baker Baker radical hey ro ba de Cordoba will ACO animal these are some of the other forms that some of the Companions used to say and the Prophet I racism would not object to it which means that any display of obedience to Allah and showing a la that I'm coming that I'm in response to your call that I am coming to worship you and fulfill my obligations to you that this would be accepted insha Allah moving on to the final hadith in today's program hadith number 216 I believe Abu reported that the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the last day to travel for one day and night well except with the matter and in another narration for Bihari she must not travel the distance of a day except with the Muharram and a Muharram is someone who woman cannot marry for eternity now the hadith is in response to an occasion to an incident the Prophet once was addressing his companions and he was not talking about hatch he was talking about travelling so he said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a Muharram so a man stood from among the crowd and said o prophet of Allah I was instructed to go in an expedition for the sake of Allah we are going for war my name was drawn but my wife has gone for hatch and we didn't know that it is not permissible for a woman that believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a Muharram the Prophet said that is a solemn go and catch your wife meaning go and accompany your wife for Hajj from this hadith the majority of scholars said that it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a Muharram period and they differed regarding hutch Imam Shafi said that it is permissible for a woman with a group of trustworthy women to travel with them for Hajj other than that no it's not permissible and there is a lot of dispute among scholars but a Muslim looks at this hadith looks at the instruction of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he has no other choice but to comply now the prophet salallahu selim said this hadith when the man stood up and said my wife went for hajj question number one did the Prophet ask him is she alone or with a group of women who are trustworthy did he know he did not did the Prophet ask him is she beautiful or ugly did the Prophet ask him is she young or old that people would not look at her the Prophet did not ask him any of these questions which means that a woman cannot travel without a Muharram whether she is old or young whether she's beautiful or ugly whether she is alone or with the company of trustworthy women or trustworthy men she has to have a madam this is the fatwa of the Prophet that is still awesome so when someone comes to me and says yes but share so and so said so and so what can I do for you I'm telling you the Prophet said and you telling me that chick said who do you believe in huh mama salio Sally Mally we believe on in the profit that is lobster that is why I've been a bus may allah be pleased with him said you people allah azzawajal is about to send rocks from the sky on your heads why why is this punishment of not bad says I tell you the Prophet says so and so and you tell me but Abu Bakr and Umar say so and so and they're coating abu bakr and umar nowadays we say the Prophet says so and so a man comes up to say yeah but I saw a share on a TV channel say it's ok do you know the share no you know his name yeah I think his name is Mohammed maybe me Abdullah ok do you know anything about him no but it's enough for me that he appeared on television subhanAllah any share appearing on television is a scholar now I am a scholar because I appear on television this is ridiculous you have to know who a true scholar is not anyone who comes on television and scholar it's a person who is knowledgeable of the Quran of the sunnah of the fundamentals of the filter of the four schools of thought of the Arabic language is able to differentiate between verbs and adjectives and nouns and proverbs and pronouns but the person who does not know any of this yet he heard this island and made mashallah a Caesar salad and now he's giving it to everybody this is not proper knowledge this is not proper l so you have to know you have to identify and it is mandatory upon you to follow the prophet sallallahu are you selling them this is what Allah will ask you on the day of judgment he will not ask you about shake so and so or dr. so-and-so or scholars own so he will ask you what did you answer my prophet sallallahu lamp when he came to you and he told you a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment it's not permissible for her to travel with a Muharram and what is the definition of a Muharram is a person she cannot marry at all so if her brother-in-law who's married to her sister his/her muharram should know can she marry him at the moment no once her sister is divorced or dead he can marry her then this is not a Muharram so her father her son her brother her uncle her nephew her father-in-law her son-in-law these are all considered to be her muharram and of course her stepfather her stepson are also considered to be her muharram and so on so from this hadith we learned that women are not allowed to travel anywhere without having a proper protection by having a Muharram with her can she travel with a brother who is 10 years old is he a proper mahahm Muharram must reach the age of puberty so if one travels with a woman says I'm traveling with my son he's my mom he's two and a half years old what kind of Muharram is this he cannot even take care of himself he cannot even change his own diapers no this is not permissible do you have any questions regarding this that women cannot travel to anywhere so what's the distance that she can travel or she can travel anywhere without a mirror the issue is traveling so if she is going from mum Bay to Madras or what you call Chennai this is considered to be traveling so she has to have a Muharram but if she's inside the city if she's in mum be going from one district to the other or going from the south to the east or anywhere in mum Bay this is not traveling so it's permissible for her to go on her own but providing that she is not alone with a man in a cab or in a rickshaw for example she has to have someone to break the whole world the seclusion so if there are two women and the man in a cab it's ok but one woman and one man this is not permissible shake if a group of women are traveling and only one of them has a madam with her will that Mara suffice to be a guardian falls again the ruling is regarding the other women the woman who has her muharram is ok now her friend who is her muharram you tell me who is here Muharram no no now you said that a group of women have one Muharram of one of the women so this woman has a Muharram now let's choose another woman from that group who is her Muharram no one so you answered yourself the Prophet said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to travel without a Muharram because she is with a woman with a Muharram does not make her having a Muharram and therefore is not permissible just my question is regarding the earlier topic of me cut like those who come from outside so they're able to do only umrah in non hajat is so once they complete the major umrah then they say that there is something called a small number aware they go to mozilla I shall never I don't know and then they perform this small uemura is it permissible first of all there is no small or big umbra amra is one but the issue is if a person comes and offers umbra from the me hot and then he is free he's made to hell can he make another amra there is a difference of opinion the most authentic is it is possible for him to make hamra but it is not recommended where does he make a crumb from because he came with a proper rom from the me part now he takes the same ruling of the place he's in so if he's in Jeddah he makes his rum from Judah if he is in matka the people of Mecca do not make a run for umrah from Makkah they have to go out of the sanctuary area they have to go out of the harem area so what is the harem area for them the closest is at a name which is outside of the harem orders at a name they have a message they're called machine Aisha why they call it machine Aisha because when I shall finish her hatch and she was in the state of mensis and she was pure she did not like not making a separate room row so she requested the prophet the prophet told her you don't have to she said I want to so he instructed her brother a grown man to take her to at the name make a harem and then come back why because roma in arabic means to visit and if you are in matka you want to visit the Kaaba you are in the car but how can you visit your own house you cannot visit your own house what you do I have to go out of my house and then come and visit this is why they call it masjid i am afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via mala assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
