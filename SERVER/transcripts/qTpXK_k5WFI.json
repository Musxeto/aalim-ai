  "transcript": "okay uh I'm pretty I'm pretty confused um so the thing is if a woman has no Pious um Muslim mams no muslim relatives at all like how can she do a mar marriage interview you know because she cannot be married blindly no her personality needs to be know known and well the groom needs to know how she looks like I I'm I have no idea please tell me a way to do it so this is the last woman on earth and you guys are stranded on an island this is not logical someone who you don't know her well and you don't have access to see her in in a legitimate interview with her Maham why would you pick her up why would you be fixated on marrying her doesn't make any sense so it's not a question how to solve this dilemma more than it is a question of how to legitimize dating so what you're asking about is how to sit with her chitchat get to know her personality without the presence of any of her male Maham because she doesn't have a male Mah and this doesn't make any sense you don't know her you don't have to know her move on there are thousands and thousands of other women out there"
