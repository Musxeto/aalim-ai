  "transcript": "what is the ruling on wiping the face after making duaa there is a hadith but it is not authentic and hence the scholars like Bernard bottle and and others say that this is only done by the ignorance who do not know the Sunna so wiping the face after the door is not from the Sunnah and it's only done by those ignorant who do not know the authentic Sunnah"
