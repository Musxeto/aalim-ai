  "transcript": "a question that is often asked what is the role of Nia in fasting and is it a must for me to have suhoor or the pre-dawn meal first of all as for the nia there is a difference between fault fasting and voluntary fasting in fault fasting it is a pillar that you have the intention for fasting before the break of dawn because the Prophet says Alice I'm in an authentic hadith whoever does not intend to fast at nighttime then there is no fast valid for him and this is regarding the fault fasting which means that if tomorrow is Ramadan and I do not intend to fast it at night and the dawn breaks and then I intend to fast the fastest invalid now what do you mean by intent to fast should I say no way to an assumed tomorrow I intend to fast should I verbally say it no intention is in the heart when I want to go and answer the call of nature do I before moving say hmm I intend to go to the toilet to have 101 or 201 no I don't have to say this if there's an Apple in front of me should I say to myself I intend to reach out to the Apple and eat it of course not this is insane then what is meant by the word intention the word intention is something in your heart you intend to do it you do it that's it what it's fasting your pre-dawn meal you intention wanting to fast tomorrow before you go to bed or at least before the event breaks maybe you go to bed not intending but seconds before the break of dawn de-identify sure you intend to fast this is valid do I have to do this every single night of Ramadan no Ramadan is connected continuous so what your intention the first day of Ramadan suffices the whole of the month you don't have to intend it every single night unless you break what do you mean I facet for a whole week intending it on the first night on the eighth day I traveled so I broke my fast for a couple of nights then I went back I have to initiate a new intention for tomorrow if I did not then the fast is invalid because of the lack of intention a woman has her menses for seven days she saw her purity she took she took ocean she must intend from night that tomorrow she is fasting otherwise this is invalid and so on now is the pre-dawn meal a must dancers know meaning that if I walk while intending to fast tomorrow I woke seconds before the event and as I was getting out of bed the event was called so should I continue to fast or this doesn't count of course you have to fast but I didn't eat no problem I didn't drink it has not no impact the fast is valid it is highly recommended that you have a pre-dawn meal as it's the Sunnah and even if you don't want to eat at least you have to drink a glass of water again this is the instruction of prophet ioser but if we if for one reason or the other you fail to do this your fast is intact [Music] [Applause]"
