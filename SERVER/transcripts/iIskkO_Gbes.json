  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet Amalia Coleman a beer host for today's episode thank you for being with us as we continue to look at ways guidelines assistance that we're looking at how we can stay with the Prophet in our lives looking at the example of the Sun now specifically how the Prophet manage the relationships with the people around him peace be upon him our guests from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalaamu alaikum and welcome riding from Saddam alone okay John thank you for having me thank you for being with us look forward to another interesting discussion as we promised in our last episode we have one more segment or episode dealing with servants okay and we spent a lot of time it was a very great conversation lots of good feedback we got regarding the the slaves and the servants and you did a great job we look forward to it again today in the modern workplace corporations spend lots of money and time keeping their staff professionally trained and that's not just about their job performance their job knowledge it's also about the work environment the people skills maintaining a high morale in a healthy workplace interpersonal relationships between co-workers and so one of the subtopics within people skills for managers in particular has to do with counseling people identifying mistakes encouraging them giving them a systematic process for an opportunity for improving we want to look at the example of the Prophet in this regard and dealing with his servants peace be upon him how did he respond when his servants made mistakes and surely they did I mean human beings make mistakes so in this relationship we had with his servants in and controlling his anger working with them encouraging them giving them opportunities to improve phenomena he hummed in Lebanon I mean Salaam Salaam Baalak I love the auto sodium in nabina muhammad in white and he was happy he remain and my back this is a very wide pick and seriously I love this topic because it deals with management alright managing people is an art it's a gift before it's a science it is something that a large L gives to individual you might find someone well educated well experienced but has bad ways of dealing with others and impulsive not kind I remember working about 10 12 maybe more years ago in a pipe company a global international pipe company CEO who I used to report to was a very good Saudi well-educated masha'Allah and and religious one of the best characters in him that after the Eid vacation need holidays so the first day back to work he used to leave his office he's the CEO yeah and he has 34 factories under him he used to leave his office and goes around the administration building and the nearby factories shaking hands with the janitors with the gardener's with the coffee boy with every young and old employee of the company giving them greeting of eight why would anyone do that it is something built in him this is how he was raised by his parents and that is why everyone loved him now to go a little bit higher and greater how did the prophet alayhi salat salam who was number one in the muslim state the judge the leader the teacher the imam the Prophet the messenger the husband of nine the father of so many the grand father of so many the companion he had so many things to do yet in authentic hadith the Jews servant that we talked about yes fell sick one day so what he's a Jew the hell with him nope this is not the attitude in the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam with his position went to his house to a house of a Jew yes hmm and he went in and visited this poor boy but he utilized his visit to what allah azza wajal had sent him for so it's not just a cordial visit a social visit he said to the boy boy accept Islam so the boy looked at his father who's a Jew is a Jewish home yeah and and the father said obey about Qasim obeying his instruction I know that he is the prophet of Allah I can't help accepting Islam because of so many factors among them is I'm a disbeliever hmm but you my son obey Him so the boy says ash'hadu ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan rasulullah the Prophet went out of the home happy with a big smile saying praise be to Allah who saved this boy from hell through me so who would visit his servant in his home and give him dower other than the Prophet areso yes yeah Wow what was that Jewish servants name we don't have any recollection of it ah I see so many things in Islam may not be mentioned to us in details because it's insignificant insignificant for example someone tells us that the dog that was with the youth the youngsters in the cave was it a schwa WA a Doberman German Shepherd doesn't matter who cares yeah so Islam does not tell us about it that the planet that Ibrahim saw peace be upon him and said that this is my lord was it Jupiter was it Mars was it this it could also in this case just speculation on my part it also be a form of protection and if they are mentioned by name then it could lead to trouble too therefore their descendants may be no no no no this this is unimaginable because everything is mentioned to us but things that are not then they have no significance for us now the Prophet Allah saw some not only visited his servants he used to check up upon them now I have servants I have drivers I have subordinates and I can see that there's something wrong usually I would neglect it if it's ain't broken don't fix it so why should I open the Pandora Boxx and then he complains to me I have - I have problems I have illnesses I have headaches let it be hmm but this is not the right thing to do a proper manager mm-hmm a proper leader checks upon his oh when you say checks you're not going to look over their shoulders where they're appearing on the camel no no what I meant is to care for them and look for their needs I see so for example he would give dua supplicate and we know that when the prophet supplicates it's crystal clear that it will be answered on the spot so um silane brings the prophets to the Prophet as I am her son Ana's after a while after serving him she says o prophet of Allah your servant Ana's now as a form of incentive and bonus make dua for him so the Prophet raises his hand and said o Allah increase his wealth prolong his life and forgive his sins anna says that when he narrates this hadith that look at me I am well into my 90s he was one of the the latest of the companions to die long life yeah so Allah answered number one and look at my wealth all people's farms and Medina produce once a year mine produced twice a year and the Prophet said increase his offspring and I've buried from my children and my grandchildren more than a hundred hmm and I am hopeful and wishful in the fourth thing which is may Allah forgive his sins to be answered and so this was a request a supplication to allah made by the Prophet SAW Allah is Allah for his servant and late into his years he see all these things coming out coming to life and and being answered not only that even if you look at the Beehive niqab he was one of the servants of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he used to be in charge of the water for performing ablution and answering the call of nature so he used to always prepare this to the Prophet s son one day the Prophet looked at him and said ask me ask anything you want mm-hmm so the man instead of saying listen I'd like this building on 54th Street or I like a plot of land or I like to get married to a beautiful woman or I like money no the only thing that the man said he said I ask from you that I become your companion in gender so the Prophet says that I said I'm anything else and then I said no this is all what I want in this life so the Prophet said no problem offer as many prayers as you can Villante mm-hmm because this would make a tangent and be my companion the the point is that the Prophet did not neglect the needs of his servants he was asking them physical needs emotional spiritual needs in the same way that he was a complete man in every his interaction with people peace be upon him also addressed the people at all the levels of their being he would not ignore them okay well good stopping point we're ready for our break and we will come back to continue the remainder of the episode Salam alaikum welcome back to with the Prophet Sheikh let's please continue our conversation we had talked about beautiful examples from the life of the Prophet peace be upon him what about when his servants make mistakes and certainly they did what was his response light well this again is shocking news someone in the magnitude of the Prophet a desolation in his position you would expect that there is no room for mistakes it's a zero tolerance policy you make a mistake I chop your head on he's a tyrant he is bloodthirsty his son saw stuff for laudably this is what the kafir disbelievers accused of prophetess Ram and those who do not read his biography and learn how he used to deal and treat with others may tend to fall weak and believe some of this the prophet alayhi salatu salam was so soft-hearted that when people made mistakes he forgave them and pardoned them anis tells us that a prophet once a day saw son told me to do something for him he sent me on an errand so I went and on the way I saw the boys playing you know like football or or whatever so as a kid I joined in mm-hmm like an hour later while I was playing I felt someone holding me from the back of my neck and I looked it was a prophet of Sam who was laughing and with a big smile and he said Denis did you do what I tell you to do mm-hmm and I said to him yes sir prophet of Allah I'm on my way and I ran away so the prophets were kept on laughing he did not reprimand him he did not say to him why you did not do this on the country it's a big smile and he appreciated the ability of this person this individual this is something we fail big time yeah in appreciating in a sense that I've seen a brother once ordering some food from the restaurant and the driver brought the food to him and he found things missing he was shouting his head off on the phone why don't you understand I told you desert I used to Pedroia and I'm telling this brother okay why are you doing this we've all seen that yeah he says no so many times I tell him to do something he doesn't do it I hate this guy is a driver his job description states that he drives and bring things he's not a rocket scientist he's not a politician he's not a doctor so you have to speak to him in his level this is his capabilities intellectual abilities so you have to put yourself in their shoes you have to go down to their level and this unfortunately is not found among the Muslims in general and especially and among the people in general which means that we have shortcomings when it comes to practicing practicing Islam the Prophet Elisha lobster was once asked o prophet of Allah how many times do we pardon the slave the servant now this is a servant that you own not the normal slave the normal servant he's asleep okay so the Prophet did not answer the guy said again how many times should we pardon the servant the Prophet is not answered the third time he said o prophet of Allah how many times do we overlook do we pardon our servants when they do mistakes here the Prophet said that I saw to Salaam seventy times a day okay discuss some Ballack number seventy times we can even do it once so this shows you that Islam highlights the disability of some servants from being as perfect as we want them to be but it also highlights the importance of our forgiveness our overlooking their mistakes when they do something hmm you know there are many benefits that we take for granted in the time that we live in minimum wage the five-day workweek the 40-hour week having time off all these things had to be fought for and it was a long struggle people died but we have them now nonetheless and a part of that is also a right to be paid for work that's been performed in my country I have never experienced the situation of working and not being paid it happens though there are our cases that make their way through the legal system people are trying to be cheated you know that's it's human nature I have seen this more in developing countries where people are working they're working hard and they're not being paid or their pay will come two weeks late and it's only half or something like this even in some is Lama organizations please you know I'd like for you to address this first of all the Prophet peace be upon him what was his way in terms of compensating those who he was obliged to compensate financially and then if you could address the modern times that we're living in even especially for Muslims Islamic organizations who were struggling to in the in the economic situation well first of all as stated earlier the Prophet as Saddam did not employ servants okay so they worked voluntary hmm and without any compensation no payment was given to them and they were happy with that nevertheless if you want to look at what Islam says you'll find that it gives you the perfect relationship between an employee and his employer in the sense that the Prophet said that a hysto lot of Silla give the one who does work for you his wages before his sweat dries hmm this is according to the Prophet Robinson uh-huh so he said that you must it is the employees right to be paid before his sweat dries meaning if someone carries a load for me a porter a driver a worker and he does work for you it has to be paid on the spot that means promptly yeah I need not even for his sweat to have time to dry and also the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam that Allah the Almighty said 3:00 on the day of judgment I'll be their opponent when Allah is your opponent you are in great loss yeah one of them is someone who employed some person and did not give him his wages nowadays I look to my country where I come from mm-hmm to the Arab world to the Muslim world and unfortunately we come back to the issue of the frame and a photograph yeah yes we are Muslims by a name but we're not walking the talk we have companies construction companies we have establishments we have organizations that employ people and they would not give them their salaries for 3 or for months Wow not because the owner doesn't have money mm-hmm but simply he has other businesses or he says if the government pays me mm-hmm I will pay you because I'm doing a construction for the government and the government itself may delay and postpone giving these payments to the contractors yeah for a few months six seven and they can't they don't have a bank to give from so they have to wait but this is unjustifiable it's not my job that the government did not pay you know who employed me you pain how prevalent would you say that this is a problem among Arab and Muslim countries to the best of your understanding it is a big problem it is there no one can deny it okay however this injustice is not only in the Arab and the Muslim world it's also in the United States yeah you have illegal Mexican workers who do not get paid correctly and may be deprived from what their rights are simply because they're illegal in the UK I have so many problems coming to me from illegal workers or from employees who do not want to register the workers on their records and pay them through the bank so that of the fear of taxation yah it's a big issue so it's there but having said that we Muslims do not care about others we care about what our religion States and we have shortcomings this is wrong the Prophet totally prohibited our in salat wa salam and he emphasized on the danger of not paying your servant their dues on time we are running out of time very quickly we got about two two and a half minutes left a few things I want to get to and you can choose there's this subject of concubines and I'd like for you to address that male versus female servants and also thirdly it's a lot you can choose the sensitivity the the the sensitivity that the prophet had towards his servants they had children that needed to be provided for the image that they had before the community was he embarrassing them or giving them opportunities to look good too so on and so forth first of all the prophet alayhi salat wa salam was an advocate of so-called human rights in an islamic way he defended the weak and the weaker the segments of society is the stronger he becomes defending them and this is obvious when it comes to women to children and obviously to servants an asymptomatic tells us that whenever the prophet alayhi salatu salam asked me instructed me to do something and i fell short from fulfilling it my relatives my mother my neighbor's my those around me would blame me big time oh you did something evils you did something wrong you did not honor what the prophet has some instructed you to do you failed in doing it who would come to his defense the Prophet now you would have expect that the Prophet would say yes that's true they've said what I cannot say on the contrary the Prophet would stand up for him and say Salalah Selim leave him alone if it were distant it would have had happened Allah did not choose to ordain it so Allah did not choose to ordain it so it didn't happen so don't blame him who's defending him the one who he fell short from doing mighty or the tempted very quickly 30 30 seconds if you could address male female servants and the modern times can I have a female masseuse and my home can she drive for me can I be in the pool and all this kind of thing wish the problem is that Muslims are so far away from the teachings of religion this can happen with a concubine with a slave girl that you bought that she can look at your body she can touch you unlike nun muharram women because she is your possession okay so she can do all of these things nowadays people are cascading this to mage they import and they bring from other countries they're free women their nun muharram to them or so even if there are non-muslims even if they're not much it doesn't matter they can not look at them they can not touch them they cannot be alone with them they cannot free mix with them they are free women got it great we have to unfortunately in there thank you so much and we look forward to our next conversation Baraka la vie goons of Malaya we will continue the show with a prophet shall are next subject deals with a very special segment of society those with disabilities until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahu a burqa"
