  "transcript": "foreign about my husband they were given given Islamic lessons by my husband that backbiting is a major sin and one should abstain from it but they don't listen so my husband has made a plan that he will make phone call to my family members every now and then and he will talk about something with which they can backbite even more and my husband says that in this way good deeds of my family will transfer to his account he will talk normally nothing wrong so is it permissible to give them some topic to backbite and gain their Good Deeds it seems that your family with all due respect and don't be offended are toxic and your husband is very wise and very mature he has to options on the table number one not to see them not to talk to them to cut them off and he's not sinful if he does this he allows you to go and meet them and dine with them and do whatever but he doesn't want to see their faces why because they're toxic they're evil they just backbite and make fun of him and there's no sin on him and that's a very good choice option two is to continue to go to them to be kind to them to speak about things that would benefit them if Allah were to open their hearts for them to benefit but he knows that they will continue to backbite and make fun of him and he is right he'll be collecting and harvesting all of their good deeds and benefiting from it on the day of judgment and that's a good uh investment so which whoever he takes alhamdulillah it's very good and I'm I feel very sad for your family because they're gonna become they're gonna come on the day of judgment broke in the authentic Hadith the prophet said to his companions do you know who is a broke person so they say the broke person who does not have an investment doesn't have cash doesn't have any wealth he said no a broke person is someone who comes on the day of judgment with prayers fasting charity Hajj or umrah all the nine yards but he backbit this one slandered this one beaten this one shed the blood of this one consumed the money of this one Allah will take from his Good Deeds to compensate Those whom he had wronged done if his Good Deeds are over Allah will collect their bad deeds and it will be thrown on his shoulders and then he would be thrown in Hell Fire may Allah protect us all"
