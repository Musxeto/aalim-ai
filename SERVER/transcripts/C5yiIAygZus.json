  "transcript": "okay uh brother sadiq from nigeria asked the question about uh some people go and they sing songs about the prophet salallahu and attached with this his music so both the questions is singing songs about the process this is this aloud this is something which is befitting and also added with the music music is completely forbidden in islam whether you like it or not this is the consensus of scholars of islam the four schools of thought they all make music forbidden end of story now going back to just chanting the name of the prophet you have to look at the motive and you have to look at the times you do this why are you doing this people say because of our love to the prophet salallahu the companions never did this so why do you do it well i tell you why do you do it you do it first of all because you like music but this is a substitute to music because when you hear someone with with a very nice voice and he is imitating a song with music instruments but with only vocals so it reminds you of a certain type of music or songs or so on and again this person who's doing this is he doing it because of you know enjoying himself or this is his life and he orchestrates such songs and he works in studios for six or seven hours every day and he might even get musical instruments to write a song and then remove the musical instruments and use his voice or vocals only to bring you this piece of art and piece of work i would advise people to stay away from these songs as an everyday thing to hear because at the end of the day after one or two years you would be fed up of these kind of of lyrics and vocals and you would like to listen to the real mccoy to the real thing with with music and with drums and with guitars and with everything else that would maybe fill some of the emptiness in your soul just for that clarification"
