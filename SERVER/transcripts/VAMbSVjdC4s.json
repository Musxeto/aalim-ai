  "transcript": "draw the line and know exactly what you are held accountable on the day of judgment on the day of judgment Allah will look and would hold you accountable for your heart ibraim peace be upon him the messenger of Allah and Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam is this is a misconception a very very common Mis conception ibraim is and Muhammad is this is wrong ibraim is Muhammad is and these are the only two and what is the difference is the Beloved but the is the companion and the closest and the prophet said if I were to take a companion a I would have taken Abu Bakr but your friend he's mentioning and pointing to himself is so the Prophet ibraim peace be upon him was talking to Allah and asking him not to disgrace him on the day of judgment and then he started to describe the day of judgment by saying which mean translates to that the day whereon neither wealth nor Sons will Avail except those or him who brings to Allah a clean heart on the the day of judgment this is what Allah will hold you accountable to he will not hold you accountable to what you look one would say ah okay then why do you always nag us about prolonging your beard every time beard beard beard beard Allah will look at your heart is this way of looking at your heart correct no whatever is in your heart will reflect on your on your actions and on your body that is why the prophet said that Allah will look at your hearts and your Deeds so your Deeds have to be in line with the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat the lecture would go on for hours if we would like to give you more insight on Iman but I thought of just glimpsing some incidents or some examples from the Sunnah very few that do not comp uh compose more than 5 or 10% of what is actually there maybe less but just gives you an Insight on the gravity of Iman and that without actions without actually walking the talk it's not enough to say that I'm a mmin I'm a Believer for example the prophet saysat whoever cheats us is not from Among Us so now this is a good deed or a bad deed it's a bad deed meaning that those who do bad Deeds such as cheating cannot claim to be Believers they're cfir no but they're not full fleshed Believers their belief is decreasing so one if he has a checking list you know what checking list is and you have good deeds and you start going through it do I pray five prayers uh a day yes do i do them in the Masjid no is the Masjid close by yes do I pray uh Sunan no and you start doing this you'll find out that you are on the losing end unfortunately we are all on the losing end because we have a lot of our shortcomings so the prophet is telling us that the heaviest prayer upon the Hypocrites are F and and if they knew what good and benefit in them lies for them they would have come to it crawling on their hands and feet okay one was when was it the last time you skipped fer prayer I'm proud to say alhamdulillah only last night because I came from jida otherwise if I had a Masid nearby I can hear the aan do you have do here call thean here alhamdulillah I've been to UK several times and the people there Subhan Allah they go to the Masjid though they're not allowed to call for the aan and as Muslims if you don't hear the aan you're Exempted from praying in the Masjid providing that the distance is not sufficient for the voice of a normal human being coming on top of the Masid calling for the Adan in your house there are no obstacles and you're not having double BL uh uh uh double layer of of of glass and you're not turning on the AC and you're not putting your iPhone headphones and you're listening to something and say I don't hear thatan no the normal distance which is a radius of about 2 to three uh uh5 kilomet if you are within the radius you have to as a man pray in the Masjid so the prophet is telling us that it is a sign of hypocrisy not to pray in the Masid and especially and this reduces your IM also the prophet saidat and this is a very authentic Hadith but it is also strange I haven't seen it here I've seen it in Arabia the prophet saysat it is not among us who does not take from his mustache this is for men of course H it is not among us he who does not take from his mustache in Arabia we have people mashallah like you know the crabs W with with long big mustaches that are filthy and disgusting this is UN Islamic it's part of Islam part of Sunnah part of increasing your IM to follow the dress code which part of it is to trim your mustache and to uh uh honor and uh uh leave your beard also the prophet says he who carries weapon against us is not among us is not from us so any Muslim who carries weapon against another Muslim he's not considered to be among the Muslims and this decreases his IM greatly and he said that swearing at one Muslim is f is a sin fighting him is kufur but it does not nullify Islam it's a lower degree of kufur and known as minor kufur of course this is with the exception if someone is the aggressor and he's attacking you now no one would say that if someone break into your house and wants to kill you or to take your money or to assault you in your house that you should not defend yourself and raise arms against him no of course you have to the prophet a man came to him and said yeah oh prophet of Allah a man wants to take my money what should I do the prophet said don't give him he said if if he fights me the prophet said fight him back the man said if he kills me the prophet said you are in Paradise you're a martyr if I kill him he's in hell so don't get me wrong when you hear what I'm saying because it is not a a place for elaborating on every small detail Mah you are all students of knowledge and you know don't take one word and sayam said so and so and so this means means that we can do this and we can do that no you have to uh uh understand it as it came in context also the prophet said he is not among us who who ever corrupts a woman against her husband how is that this happens unfortunately a lot I go to work my mother-in-law or my sister-in-law come and they visit my wife while I'm at work before I went to work I kissed my wife goodbye she said she prayed for me may Allah protect you the minute I walk into the house at 4:00 or 5:00 I see a gloomy face I say when I say I don't hear I say I know that there is something I put on my helmet and I my I put my armor and wait for the attack to come what is wrong said why don't you have new furniture for me like my sister has and why do we live in this small house it has only 12 rooms why is this and our car is one year old and I'm not getting this why don't we travel why don't we do I understand who was it it was the visitor in the morning the prophet says he's not part of us whoever talks negatively to a wife against her husband usband even if it was the father the mother the sister and that this is why it's very critical when sisters call me and ask me for advice you know the minute she speaks I say divorce him immediately he's not a man and actually he's not a man a lot of the complaints that I get from the sisters seriously their husbands are not men they they are not worthy of carrying the word man because they are not nice they're not polite they're not kind they're not grateful every bad word you can find but at the end of the day you have to reconcile even the sister that is complaining is not perfect she's not masallah from Heaven she has her shortcomings but you have to try to reconcile unless life is impossible then we do this why because we don't want to turn women against their husband and the opposite is true we don't want to turn husbands against their wives so the prophet is indicating that this decreases your Iman to the extent that you may not be among the followers of the prophet he goes on to sayat that those who do not have mercy and respect to the elderly and do not have love and care for the youngsters are again not among the Muslims not among and those who do not believe in predestiny there are people that say all what we do we're forced to do it and they're known as ja Allah forced us to do whatever we do all the sins we do are we forced to do it if one says okay if Allah registered it 50,000 years before he created us we're forced to do it no you don't you're not forced to do it because you don't know what you were ordained to do otherwise go to the top of the building and throw yourself and see if you die it was ordained if you don't alhamdulillah nobody does this but again you find people thinking in this fashion which shows you how less a man is loving to your brother what you love to yourself This is a sign of IM he will not believe those who do not love for their brothers what they loved for themselves is this general or there is something that we have to specify well if you say this generally without specifying it a smoker would say I smoke and I love to smoke brother look a cigarette is this true no because there is another narration of the Hadith only of good things so if you like good things for yourself like it for your brother but if you like bad things for yourself keep it to yourself um also it is not lawful for a Believer and this decreases his belief once he does not communicate with with his Muslim brother for more than 3 days and then their deeds will not go up every Monday and Thursday Allah would not look at them would not have mercy on them until they reconcile how many of the Muslims you know you have cut connections with long time ago a lot not only that how many of your relatives you don't talk to you don't send smss you don't call on the phone you don't visit inid I know in jida brothers from the same father and mother have not communicated to each other in 15 years they have not seen each other they have not spoken to each other and not only that they force their children not to go to their uncles and if they do they punish them they don't speak to them what more of ill-mannered and weak Iman can a person have intoxicants those who drink or abuse drugs all of this is a sign of Iman is leaving the prophet said when a person commits adultery he does not do it when he when he fornicates he does not do it when he is a m meaning that IM belief comes out like a cloud and leaves him until he repents likewise those who drink alcohol some would say it's a little not drink it's social Drinker a little bit it's okay I'm not drunk yet no this is all Haram what when when the large amount makes you intoxicated the smallest makes is Haram as well your neighbors three times he is not a Believer he is not a Believer he's not a Believer who those who their neighbors are not safe from their ill doing you have a neighbor is he safe from your illo doing what I don't have anything alhamdulillah you go to the neighbor yeah this guy is killing us he's putting music on the loudest thing all the time I go out of my house I find his trash on my doorsteps he parks in my place my parking place he does this he does that his children are always knocking on the wall walking on the roof jumping and doing all of this is a sign of less and less of IM in a person's heart and finally it's a sign of IM to love the prophet wasam more than your love to yourself to your children to your family and to your wealth now do we love him yes bring the checklist and let's see are you doing what he used to do you don't have to fill it up just put at the bottom no night prayer it's fasting Mondays and tues and and uh Tuesday it's a new fasting Monday and Thursday being nice to your wives if you have more than wife more than one wife being nice to your servant not complaining and nagging an Malik may Allah be pleased with him he said I accompanied the prophet for 10 years never ever he told me for something that I have done why did you do this and never ever he told me for something I did not do shouldn't you have done this and this he wouldn't talk to his servant in such a fashion now how many times do you open an interrogation room for your wife for your children and put you know the white big light on top of them and ask him why did you do this why did you do that and every time time you talk to your children it's always interrogating them every time you talk to your wife it is always blaming her every time your wife talks to you it is hell why did you do this why did you do that you shouldn't you have done this I told you so many times don't you listen are you stupid and the husband is just looking down says it is a big problem are we following the footsteps of the prophet Alam then how can we reach the IM we want Iman is not something we say you can stand up here like me talking about Iman for 3 4 hours mashallah beautiful speech if your actions do not coincide do not come side by side with what you say then you are a hypocrite may Allah protect me and you from being Hypocrites we have to try and walk the talk claiming is not enough because even if you convince me even if I convince you that I'm a believer that I'm a strong uh uh Muslim and I have strong IM in my heart even if I convince you can I fool Allah Allah knows what's in my heart so this is a call a friendly call from me to myself and to you that we should try our level best to increase our Iman and to try our best to Implement whatever the prophet has instructed us to do and not to be choosy not to be picky we don't have a choice in the sense that um yeah I think I will shorten my trousers because it's good for me it lasts longer but as for praying in the Masjid no this is not convenient I'll skip that this thank you maybe next year you don't have a choice you're commanded by Allah to do this you have to do it if you don't do it you're sinful and your Iman is decreasing so don't be deceived by thinking that mashallah my Iman is on the highest level I am this I am that no a Believer has to be fearful all the time has to be afraid all the time that Allah could easily reject his Good Deeds may Allah be pleased with him the servant of the Prophet Alat narrated and the Hadith is authentic that Allah the almighty uh that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that on the day of judgment I know of people who would come with h with good deeds as big as mountains of Tama they're white full of good deeds that Allah would make it all go into thin air would erase it Allan when he heard this he fell on his knees and he said oh prophet of Allah describe them for us tell us who they are so that they we would not be part of that the prophet saidat wasam as you have asked me they pray as you pray and they fast as you fastan and they have night prayers as well but whenever they were alone with Allah and the sins they used to take all kind of sins because only Allah is watching and that is why Allah would make all their Good Deeds evaporate and go into thin air so I pray to Allah Asel that he accepts our good deeds and that he elevates our IM to the extent and level that pleases him and in we will start the question answer session inshallah I'll be reading out from the slip I got the first question we'll start now she can you please tell us what we should do when our Iman sings Low tell us some Iman boosters for women adults and children in a separate lecture or it goes all for all in Islam we don't have any segregation between men women children in terms of Iman the the boosters are as may Allah have mercy on his soul commented he said that the first one is the knowledge of Allah his names and his beautiful attributes we and I'm talking about myself we have a very big problem in our knowledge of Allah the Almighty we don't know who we are worshiping we just we were born for Muslim parents and everybody around us is Muslim we pray as they pray we refrain from bad things as they do because we're in a community the minute we leave this community the minute we travel to somewhere where people don't know us we find that our Iman is decreasing we're starting to have a lot of compromises we're giving up a lot of our beliefs and our our our practices why is that because our IM is weak so the first thing is to know Allah and how to do this is by reciting the Quran by contemplating by comprehending and understanding what Allah is telling you the Quran is the greatest book on Earth it is Allah's words it came out from Allah and it will go back to Allah the almighty and it is not something that was created it is Allah's attribute meaning if you swear by the Quran this is permissible if you swear by the Kaa this is forbidden if you swear by Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam this is forbidden you can only swear by Allah's names and attributes so if you say Quran I did not do this this is Hal because you're swearing with Allah's words in it is one of his attributes subhanahu wa ta'ala secondly you have to contemplate on the Nations before you the um before you and how they rejected their Messengers and what Allah has done to them look how great they were how big they are thirdly you have to contemplate and try to imagine Allah's creation and this gives you great love and glorification for Allah when I was coming last night yesterday morning from jida we were flying over chenai and I was looking at this city and Subhan Allah it just struck me I was seeing so many houses how many what's the population of of chenai 100,000 100,000 yeah you're kidding yeah 10 million yeah 10 million 100,000 we have here 100,000 you have 10 million people and I was flying over the city and I looked at the houses and the cars and the people and I just sat there and thought okay now each individual not let's not look at chai let's look at this H how many people do we have here 200 each one of us has debts wife children worries needs desires shortcomings forms of worship things he wishes he wants to do we urge Allah oh Allah do this for us and Allah answers everyone who calls him so imagine this that Allah is not confused by the difference of voices languages or requests not in this Hall if we get a laptop two laptops three laptops to process our needs and desires and our problems and worries it won't be enough so what about the city of Chennai where we have 10 million people to run these 10 million people administratively with the sewer system with the water system with the electricity with the transportation it's a headache it's a nightmare now who's running all this upstairs Allah the almighty not only chenai Tamil Nado India Asia the whole earth the whole lower Heaven the seven heavens Allah not even one leave of a tree that falls Allah knows about it subhah and it's not only the six billion humans on Earth that Allah takes care of if someone MTS does this to you you blink why do you blink to protect your eye who's protecting your eye Allah and I've said this so many times how many eyes do we have have on this Earth six well two this very little 6 billion by two equals 12 billion and how many eyes are in the making in the wombs of the mothers another 3 billion who made all of this Allah Can America or Russia or the whole world contribute to make one single eye they cannot Allah only made this simple organ eye how many eyes of ants do we have how many eyes of bees of flies of animals of fish of birds and this was done only by Allah does Allah need Angels does Allah needs help if you know Allah once you go to your home tonight inshallah you make ation and you stand and say Allah abbar you feel how great Allah is you appreciate your prayers you stand in humility and submissiveness it is me the wrongdoer asking for your forgiveness I know you you cannot get this without knowing Allah studying the universe around you and see how magnificent Allah's creation is and finally the things that boost your Iman would most likely be doing and offering Good Deeds a person who does not say Subhan Allah at all definitely is lesser in Iman than a person next to him saying Subhan Allah what"
