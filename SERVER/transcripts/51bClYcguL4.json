  "transcript": "Norrell law says can the following statement be true in order to be a good Muslim you need to be a good human being this is generic see in Islam there are basics so you have to believe in the oneness of Allah and that no one is worthy of being worshipped except him you have to believe in the Prophet Isis on being his servant and messanger you have to pray 5 times a day you have to fast Ramadan you have to give a zakat to the poor as known and you have to perform pilgrimage this is the basics now a person could have a lot of shortcomings yet still he is classified as Muslim when you say in order to be a good Muslim you need to be a good human being when you approach people to define who is a good human being you will have a lot of different conflicting opinions especially from those who do not relate to Islam because each one of us has his own orientation his own thinking his own whims and desires so someone would say ah being a good human being means that you do not interfere in people's affairs so if you see someone's being or getting killed or mugged in front of you being a good Samaritan is to leave he's going to die I can't prevent this said well it's it's not on your business you don't know what the conflict between them is and it goes on other one says being a good human is not to prevent your wife or daughter or sister to go to the beach in their bikinis this is their freedom it's the right to do whatever they want to do so if you if you understand what I'm saying that the definition of being a good human being differs from one culture to another from one country to the offer to the other depending on my orientation while being a good Muslim is fixed you have to be generous to be a good Muslim you have to be brave you have to be kind you have to be caring you have to love two people what you love to yourself you have to refrain from sins you have to do a lot of things that count as being a good Muslim so I hope this clarifies it a little bit"
