warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 240 of amrit Rock'em jaburn abdullah may allah be pleased with him and with his father narrated that we came with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam pronouncing tell beer for hajj and the Prophet of Islam Salaam commanded us to make our harm in to that of umrah question what were they performing they were performing Haji frog they were performing hajj chili frog how did you know because the Haji fraud has got normal in it it has the answer in the hadith he said we pronounce tell via for hatch if they were doing tomato he would have said we pronounce the tell via for umrah to the hajj and if they were having the intention of tehran they would say we offered or pronounce the tell via for umrah and hatch so this is the difference so job it is telling us jabber Nellie fills with him is telling us that we pronounce the tell be of hatch the Prophet told us solo la sala make it umrah so now it changed from had Joey fraud into had jus tamit tour because they will make the Remora cut their hair where the normal clothes do everything that needs to be done moving on to the following hadith hadith number 241 narrated by Abdul omnibus may allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that when the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and the Companions reached Makka assuming rom for hatch on the fourth day of the ledger the Prophet ordered damsel allah salam to perform umrah with that rom instead of Hajj meaning that their Haram is for hajj so the Prophet told them flip it into Rome bruh they asked Oh prophet of Allah what kind of finishing the ramp after you finish umrah what kind of being halal is it limited to this or that the prophet said finish their arm completely meaning return back to your halal state as if you did not offer harm meaning everything can go of course everything that is Helana one hears this and says you can do everything you did not do when you were my room so I can drink I can smoke no these are haram things we're talking about the things that are restricted for him to do and this hadith we learned that when they arrived to Mecca it was the force of the ledger so they had about four days of living normal life not in the state of a rom and the following hadith had a 242 this was narrated by Ottawa Hypno's obey may Allah have mercy on his soul he said Osama may allah be pleased with him osama ms8 was asked in my presence how was the speed of the camel of the prophet alayhi salatu salam while departing from ala fat during the Hajj atul were there boo sama replied the Prophet is also and proceeded on with a modest pace and when there was enough space he would make his camel go very fast now what do we understand from this we understand that the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam is not to harm others is not to hastin in moving from one place to the other on the account of others as we see the people nowadays in hatch we see people trying to push one another trying to reach their destination ahead of others as if this is what has is all about and this is wrong the Prophet said ah restaurateur salaam pushing forcefully during Hajj is not part of piety it is not part of piety to be the first the first is the one who Allah accepted his hatch and that is why from alpha to Mustafa when the Sun sets people move all of them in their millions from a lava to was deliver Osama ms8 may allah be pleased with him explains to us and describes to us how the prophet used to ride his camel he said the prophet used to write in a very slow pace why because of the crowd and the minute there was an opening and there is no crowd he used to let go for the camel to run quickly or to run in a fast pace but whenever there were people he would slow down from this we learned how ignorant people are in Hajj nowadays only few vehicles are allowed to come in in hatch and unfortunately the way they drive is reckless they're surrounded by hundreds of thousands and millions of pilgrims yet they drive as if they own the road likewise those on motorcycles they do not pay any attention they might harm someone they might run over someone they might hit someone all of this for the cause of reaching was the river ahead of the people and then what this is hatch you're supposed to get closer to Allah not to do these things that harm others now in the following hadith hadith number 243 Abdullah even amber it allows me allah be pleased with him said that the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam stopped during the farewell pilgrimage at minna for people who had something to ask so the profit in that occasion designated some time to answer the people's queries and questions a man came and said o prophet of Allah I didn't notice I shaved before sacrificing the prophecy that Ishrat salam now sacrifice the animal and there's no harm on you another man came up and said o prophet of Allah I did not notice I sacrificed before throwing the pebbles the Prophet see that is salatu salam throw the pebbles and there is no harm for you the prophets allah salam was not asked about anything which had been done before or after its proper time but he said do it and no harm is there for you now the Prophet was asked about the actions on what day on the day of an hour on the day of slaughtering on the day of eight now you have to learn the sequence the order you go to Mina on yom teruah which is eight of the ledger what is the meaning of your mood Turia it's the day that the people prepare for our affair must deliver and meaner by watering their camels Soteria meaning watering their camels so they make their camels full of water so that it would not need to drink they go and pray five times or five prayers this is the Sunnah in minna they prayed over a thermal brescia and pleasure of arafah they shorten the prayers so lahore awesome and Asia are prayed to request two rak'ahs combined no they pay each on time after thatcher they go to a lava and after the whore the antenna rafa and they spent the day there supplicating making liquor they pray the whore and a sir combined at the time of the whore two rak'ahs the whore two rak'ahs also with an add-on and a comma for both and then after sunset everybody goes and moves too much deliver which is not very far away it's walking distance but it would take you sometimes like 35-40 minutes depending on the pace you're walking and they spent the night n Mo's deliver but as soon as they arrive they pray maghrib three records and they join Asia to it whether they come before a show or after I sure but they have to pray it combined and they should not delay it until the middle of the night because if they are on the road and it's close to middle of the night they must pray it wherever they are even if they did not reach must deliver once they reach was deliver the sunday is to spend the night there and to rest because the following day they have a lot of things a lot of activities to do once they pray fechar they leave can they leave before fechar only for the women and the children the Prophet gave permission for the elderly for the women for the children and for the men accompanying them so if i have my wife I don't tell my wife you go I'm stronger will stay no I have to go and accompany my wife so they leave and reach Mina the first thing they begin with is throwing the pebbles how many peoples do they throw 37 this is what we'll find after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so on the day of read the first day after you leave from miss daily fee back to Mina you throw only seven stones how big is the stone is it a big rock seven pieces or it's a very tiny thing that cannot be seen scholars say it should be like this it's like the seed of dates for example or a little bit smaller so you throw it in the what is known as jumeirah to Aqaba al-kubra which is the closest to mecca and the farthest from mina we have essaouira al whoo spa al-kubra the smallest the medium and the largest after you throw it the Sunnah is to slaughter this is the sequence if you are muta material karan you have to slaughter your Heidi after the slaughter you shave and by shaving you become hella you can immediately go shower put your shirts put your trousers wear whatever you wish everything for a modem is now permissible for you except for intimacy with the wife this cannot take place until you go and offer powerful a father and soil hatch and what is the ruling on powerfully father it is mandatory it is a pillar of the hatch if you don't offer it your Hodges invalid even if you stand in out of art and do everything except the toe of this is a pillar that must be performed once you offer the power off and you make the site your hatch is complete now you can do everything even intimacy with the missus this is all permissible you have to do spent the following two nights minimum and maximum three nights in mena where every day after the iron of the whore I go and throw the pitbulls seven at the small seven at the medium and seven at the big one every day where do I collect the stones from anywhere you find it in Mena as you walk you pick it up and you throw and you say Allahu Akbar with every throw you throw it and do I have to hit the pillar itself or is it enough just to fall into the pool it's enough to fall into the pool seven for each one and then you spend the night also praying the hawser Maghreb Russia and pleasure you shorten the four rak'ahs into two records but you do not combine do I offer any sooner for maghrib for Asia for the whore before and after the answer is no whenever you shorten prayer you skip the cygnus of the whore Margaret and Asia but you maintain an observe sunnah of furture night prayer witter etc and the final thing you do after you finish your hatch is you have to offer the farewell power and this we will come in Charlotte to mention later on hadith number 244 this hadith was narrated by a black man even yazid he said I performed Hajj with in my suit may allah be pleased with him and saw him throwing the pitbulls off the big genre vámonos a la cava with seven small pebbles keeping the Kaaba on his left side and Mina on his right side and he said that this is the place where the one whom surat al-baqara was revealed there is a prophetess ramp this is the place where he stood is to have the Kaaba on your left min on your right and throw it from this side why because at the time the back side had a mountain so this is the only place or this side or this side you can throw it from nowadays the mountain has been removed and all four sides can be thrown from the Sunnah is to do what they were my throat did but if everybody is focusing on this area and the rest are free and empty and you don't want the crowd you can throw from any place you wish why the dependence root said that this is the place where the one whom surat al-baqara was revealed to because sort of the baccalà contained most of the rulings of hatch and a lot of it so that is suitable for him to say that I've seen the prophet and he and his son is the one who surah al-baqarah was revealed to ok we move on to hadith number 245 and the lognormal may Allah be pleased with them narrated that the prophet of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam said o allah have mercy upon those who get their heads shaved the companion said prophet of allah what about those who get their hair clipped the prophet repeated may allah have mercy upon those who have their heads shaved and the prophet alayhi salatu salam repeated that and they repeated their inquiry and what about those who have their hair clipped the prophet repeated three times in the first time he said and those who have their hair clipped what is this this is regarding when a person in the state of Aram is making the hell lool he is making the halal meaning that he concluded his ritual and now the last thing for him to become halal is to either shave or clip his hair the Prophet salah salem prayed for them to be or to have the mercy of allah three times and in the fourth he said and those who clip their head meaning cut it short what do you understand from this we understand that when you make our ambra allah would reward you more if you shave your head because this is a sign of a beating so Allah while clipping your hair cutting it short nobody would know that you offered Ramallah so it is part of showing the people that this is the trace or the sign of my ritual which i did in an authentic hadith when the Prophet was explaining allahís a lot of Salaam hedge and the virtues of it he said in an authentic hadith to the companion as for shaving your head Allah would reward you with each hair a good deed so imagine that if you have a hundred thousand hair allah azzawajal would reward you 100,000 good deeds 100,000 hasana and if you have more it's more and therefore usually people try their best to get their hair shaved to get their head shave and therefore this is the sunnah nevertheless a las mercy did not only restrict the sunnah for those who shave but also those who cut short their hair or clip their hair how should we clip their hair if we want to clip it a lot of the Muslims make a general mistake after they finish umbra they do this and this that's it no clipping the hair has to be from the whole of head so you have to cut short all of your head not only a part of it or a side of it so shaving is for the whole head likewise clipping or cutting short should be from all sides of the head you have any questions yes shaken the person after completing his herd make his Salah 422 he can say I'm a traveler that's why I can pray my seller as to for the soul and others when he completes his nudge and later he is staying there for some time he'll say that I am a traveler and can I read too yes as long as he's a traveler he can pray two rak'ahs as long as he's staying in Makkah and he's still a traveler however the rule is even if you're a traveler if you hear the adhan in the message it you must pray where the adhan is being cold and hence if you're a traveler and Ukraine the message you will eventually complete your prayers so even if you finish hatch and you stay in Mecca or go to Jeddah or go to tithe or go to Medina you're still considered to be a traveler and you can shorten prayer but if you hear the adhan you're obliged to respond and then you would not be able to shorten prayer but in cases that you did not hear the adhan you over slept and woke up then you can shorten prayer as long as you are a traveler shrimali key salam I wanted to know that is there out of the three hegde out of the three types of Hajj which type of the Hajj has the mush fazila we mentioned this before and said that the best of hatch is tomato because it has two rituals are Umbra separate and hedge separate then follows that clear on which is having the Remora embedded in the hatch with a sacrifice and the last and third is le fraud which has no Umbra and it has no Haddie obligatory but if you want to offer hadi this is up to you ship why do we have to make intentions loudly intention is not said loudly we've stated this before that at elvia is different than the intention at elvia is a form of vicar you say labaik allahumma labbayk arabica la sharika laka labbayk to the end if i wear my rom and i do not say tell beer is my room ro ROG correct the answer is yes what is important is my intention by assuming the state of rom and everything that is forbidden and restricted for a mahram is now restricted for me tell via is not an intention it is a form of vicar we've stated that scholars differed whether it is mandatory aur suna and it is most likely to be mandatory in the sense that no one has ever left saying it and this is a son of the Prophet Ursula but it appears that if someone does not say it he is not obliged to slaughter a sheep and a large dajjal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time p.m. manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
