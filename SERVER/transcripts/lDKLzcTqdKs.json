  "transcript": "where do I raise my hands to Hadees one next to the shoulders one next to the ears the palm is next to your shoulders the fingers are next to the level of your ears and this is how you combine between the two authentic hadees so it is not like allah akbar as people say or Allah Akbar as people do this is all wrong it is not Allah Akbar no it is this way so the palms next to the shoulders the fingers are next to the level of the ears facing the Qibla"
