  "title": "Must we feed a poor person (expiation) in addition to making up missed Ramadan fast? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "label says i heard that whoever had missed days of ramadan that he has to make them up and in addition to that he has to feed a poor person but this expiation of feeding a poor person multiplies with the number of years so the more you delay it the more feeding you have to do is this true this is totally bogus this is totally baseless the difference of opinion among scholars is if i missed a day from three four years ago and now i want to make them up so when making them up the difference is should i feed another poor person for that day in addition of making it up or not the most authentic opinion is that there's no expiation you miss the day you fast a day in its place and allah knows best"
