  "transcript": "he says i have a confusion when the scholars discuss an issue such as nullifying wudu by touching the opposite gender so they say imam shafi says it nullifies wudu even if you touch your own wife hanafi scholars say that it does not impact your wudu now when they say this how do we know which is the most authentic of all first of all you have to understand brother anwar that the truth at the side of allah is one there are a number of different opinions regarding this particular issue all those who strived to do the best in their ability to reach the truth if they succeeded they rewarded twice if they failed they rewarded once because they did their best and this includes imam shafi imam and the scholars now i'm talking about real scholars who are qualified in the quran the sunnah in the philippines arabic language and this and that why because the vast majority of nowadays scholars and previous times who they were blind followers of their school of thought so they know the ins and outs of their own school of thought and they would not agree to remove an inch away from it even if this goes against the quran these are not scholars these are blind followers they are not allowed to give fatwas or to teach people by claiming that this is the most authentic opinion now for you as a layman and me allah azzawajal says that whenever there's a dispute over an issue you have to refer it to allah and to the messenger which means you have to refer to the quran and to the sunna of the prophet sallam as they will be the decisive factor in knowing which is right and which is wrong so it's not a committee of scholars it's not the majority it's not how many do you have in your party and how many do i have it's not how big your bicep is it depends on what coincides with the truth and the truth can only be known from the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations of sahaba tabi's so therefore whenever there is a difference of opinion we have to refer back to the quran sunnah now the question is why do scholars say well imam shafer he says this and that imam hanafi abu hanifah says this is that says this and that they say this to indicate to their students of knowledge that the issue is an issue of dispute and it depends on whom you're addressing so if i'm addressing total laymen i would not confuse them by telling them well there is an opinion that says write an opinion that says left an opinion that says front an opinion that says back so people will say duh i'll choose whatever i want no this is confusing you tell and teach the people according to your conviction and what you believe in if they believe you if they trust you if they think that you're a knowledgeable and trustworthy they'll follow you nobody will scrutinize you and say wait wait wait you say this and that where did you bring this from you say that's permissible to eat the slaughtering of the jews and christians in the uk and the us but they're atheist but they're mushrik but they're not proper christians or people of the book maybe they did this maybe so he wants to argue with you i'm not ready to waste my time to argue with you go and check with the scholars bimbasmanath i mean they will argue with you and they will teach you my job is to educate those who are laymen who trust me those who don't trust me sue me don't don't listen to me don't learn from me i don't need you you guys definitely don't need me so this is the norm you go back to the quran sunnah to try and figure out what is the right opinion and if you don't know the right opinion then you have to stick with one sheikh whom you trust his knowledge his religious practices etc"
