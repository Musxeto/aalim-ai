  "title": "If my menses stop after Fajr, must I fast rest of the day & also make it up later? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in a book called fatwa for women um I read that and I quote if your mention blood stop after Dawn you have to observe the rest of the day for fasting and you still have to make up for that day after Ramadan this is not true correct no this is not true if a woman is in her menus and sees her Purity After Dawn meaning that she's not obliged to fast that day and hence how would we say to someone who's not obliged by a legitimate reason that he must refrain the rest of the day this makes no sense if I I'm going to refrain for the rest of the day might as well count it as a day of Ramadan but it's not counted because I did not or you did not see your Purity before fer so this day does not count and you were considered to be a woman in her men when the day started hence you can continue to eat and drink without a problem"
