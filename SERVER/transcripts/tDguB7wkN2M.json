  "transcript": "as for the second question the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned to us six categories and he said gold by gold silver by silver wheat by wheat barley by Barley Days by date sold by salt these are the six main categories of items that lead the riba items other items fall underneath gold and silver you have currencies and banknotes falling underneath them so the prophet said when you are buying gold with silver or silver with gold there's no problem in that because this might be 200 grams and this might be seven kilos so the weight difference is permissible because the items are different they're not identical it's not gold and gold it's gold and silver or gold and dollars but the prophet put a condition and this condition is that such purchase and transaction has to be physically simultaneous meaning that I give you the dollars and in the same instance instance you give me the gold physically and I possess it instantly this is halal now if I have a gold shop and people send me requests to buy a necklace or a bracelet made of gold and they see it and they know the weight and they send me the money and I ship it to them overnight this is totally prohibited why I cash the money yes but it's not simultaneous therefore Scholars even went further by saying if I have a gold shop and someone comes to buy gold from me or silver through his credit card not through his ATM if it was through the ATM a thousand dollars is withdrawn immediately it appears on my bank account I get an SMS saying that a thousand dollars was deposited this is instantly done a credit card is not like that because there is a 40 days a grace period And I don't know when the bank is going to transfer this amount to you may takes uh it may take some time therefore such transactions are not permissible because the fact that there is no uh simultaneous exchange and physically and Allah Knows Best"
