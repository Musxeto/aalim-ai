  "transcript": "now his second question is about those who make it as a business there are reciters who make money out of it sure is it Haram no totally legit you serious yeah of course I'm serious what do you think I'm playing it is totally permissible for a person to teach or an and charge money for that but his teach charging money for the Quran no he started charging money for teaching he's charging money for his time you don't go to a physician to a doctor and he charged you a big bill for consultancy and she okay this is a lot fear Allah do it for the sake of Allah I'm not opening a charity so the profit in the hadith of abou sorry the hoodie told them that charging money for reciting rukia is totally legit but the Rakhi himself should fear Allah soldier and not make it part of a business in the sense to get richer and to build mansions just take what its barely needed for you to live a decent and honorable life of he first of all second of all he said he's not obliged to sit until the guy is cured so as if I understood from said that when he recites that Rokia on the cancer patient he has to confine himself to him even if he gets cured after five or six months until he's cured now this is not correct he does the Rokia and allah azza wajal does the rest if there is good in it he will be cured maybe next week next month Allahu Alem but it is not logical for him to stay he is entitled to go and move on and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
