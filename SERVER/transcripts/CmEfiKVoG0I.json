  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] miss Molloy rahmanir rahim' wa salatu was-salam ala rasulillah Kareem alhamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we were discussing child rearing its virtues its benefits its many ups and downs and how are we to where our children in a way that is according to the Quran and the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam today we'll be talking about Tobia amania or raising the children with the the idea of theology and mind with God consciousness if you will many times when rearing children that's one of the last things that parents may think about you think about the well-being of the child the education of the child that does it how eat does the child have a good education but many times parent leave out for a child to know God for a child to know Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and the scholars say that one of the first things that a person should know the McAuliffe should know is Allah what a Sulha BC fatty they should know Allah and His Prophet and their attributes so they can have a correct al-qaeda to help us with these matters we have Shaykh awesome documented Hakeem who's the teacher at that Academy and at that Academy and KIU and has been an mm and a teacher for over 30 years salam aliekum wa rahamtullah lucilla what along here about a Ketchum okay Sheikh was get into this al Qaeda why is it important for a parent to teach the children al Qaeda they are Takeda men ever him and hungrily let him in I mean what sallallahu wasallam / O'Connor I believe what I saw I mean nabina muhammad in why the early he was sahbihi ajma'in first of all copied the name itself terminology itself was not mentioned in the quran or in the Sunnah and this is why a lot of the ignorant and imbeciles about Islam tend to take an offensive or a defensive position saying that this is not in Islam this is not from the Quran and they fight it and they fight it not because they want to and Khurana sooner rather because it goes against their deviant beliefs so what do you mean sure well the Prophet told us Alice autosum that this Ummah of his will be divided into 73 sects all of them will be in hell except one and the 72 sects who are in hell it is not because they have chosen a filthy legislative difference so they put their hands in prayer under the belly or they put it on the chest no no this is something totally different it deals with al-qaeda it deals with their belief it deals with their conviction conviction it deals with whether they follow the sunnah or innovate these are the 72 sects so it is related to our pita so what is a pita Ikeda is what you believe in it comes from the word octa which is a knot and this knot is what constitutes your belief so anything that deals with Allah is beautiful names and attributes or anything that deals with the Day of Judgment with the Angels with the scriptures with the messengers of Allah and prophets with the Day of Judgment would the unseen all of these are part of your art EDA so if someone says I pray I fast I do the whole nine yards but I don't believe that there is heaven or hell we say sorry you're not a Muslim why because your Arpita is not correct it's corrupt someone says yeah I believe in everything you say but I don't believe in the presence or in the existence of jinn said well this is mention the Quran falsifying it or disbelieving in it makes you a kafir so what is most important in our religion is not praying it is not fasting it is not giving money to the poor the first thing that we have to correct and concentrate on is that either what you believe in and this is what the Prophet manifested Adi has sold out or salons to all of his companions whenever he dispatched an army he used to tell the the the leader of this army to call people to the tow heat and this is mentioned in Sahih Muslim a new ID Allah and so many by the way do act in America and elsewhere they fight though heat they say it's not in the Quran and the Sunnah because they don't know the Quran nor the Sunna and not only that they even want people to avoid anything to do with Sunna and focus only on the Quran and this is part of the 72 sects known as a poor Anna Yoon who neglect the Sunna totally and this is an act and a belief of apostasy may Allah have mercy on us all so we should focus on Ikeda okay that means that you believe in the oneness of Allah through to heat a robo beer the lordship to heat a Lulu here the worship the hater as modified the beautiful names and beautiful attributes of Allah so if you have these three combined within you and your belief is solid then this is step one in al-qaeda now this has to be cascaded to our children at an early age we teach our children to rely and to depend on Allah solution this goes in many many different aspects for example we give only beautiful attributes to allah azzawajal and this is extremely important because in normal families of Muslim when I know it in Arabic I don't know how they say it in English but so many times we make them take of associating others name to bad actions so if a child does something disgusting what do we say disgusted we which usually say Allah agree may Allah make you discussed it but attributing disgust to Allah social as one of his actions is inappropriate when we see someone who does something inappropriate Allah he is sick Allah does this or Allah does that to you attributing bad actions and attributes to allah azzawajal is bad Ikeda so we have to up bring the children on only associating good things with Allah this is one part also when it comes to Allah's attributes so the child asks where's Allah what do we say this question if asked to deviant sex they would say Allah is everywhere this is not true Allah so Allah is not everywhere Allah has described in his or an he described himself to be upon the throne and the prophet alayhi salatu salam explained that when he asked a slave girl where is Allah and this is the prophets asking us or some so we should also ask her children where is Allah and the girl said pointing above her above the heavens she said unwise above everything so he said Who am I she said you the prophet of Allah is also so the Prophet said to her owner set her free she's a believer we have to bring our children to this understanding from an early age I know one sister who had a two or three years child and every time she sees him when playing with her she said to him where is Allah and the child says fish sama and he points up so from an early age okay the boy doesn't understand but if you make this in him this would help decades later on you should always bring to his attention the food on the table okay maybe the Christians have grace before eating the Muslims don't have this they say bismillah in the name of Allah so everything they do they begin in the name of Allah so before eating we say bismillah in the name of Allah we eat we begin to eat and this isn't the hadith of Omar ibn ABI Salama may Allah be pleased with him and with his father who was a stepson of the Prophet as a son he came to eat and he was a child for years five years of age and the Prophet taught him and this shows you the importance of teaching our peda teaching religion to children at an early age some people say they're too young to understand no you're too old to understand they not young they can learn and they come and ask you questions later on which shows that they were aware of everything so the Prophet told the boy yahoo l'm sam milah he said o son oh boy say bismillah before you eat you have to begin by the name of Allah what could be an Enoch you're eating with your left and this is Haram in Islam you have to eat with your right hand what could mean Malik and eat from what's in front of you instead of going and stretching in front of others to pick the food this is inappropriate etiquettes taught to a child of 4 or 5 years of age so that he would learn we need to have this with a lot of wisdom to our children what do you mean sure okay if you just monitor your child and only see the negative things don't do this dude don't do this do that he would never learn on the country he would probably learn how to cheat you how to do it behind your back but if you give him instructions and at the same time give him encouragement Marshall look at him he always eats with his right hand this sticks at the back of his head oh my father is praising me he's smart mashallah my child is is is generous we went to the Masjid and we saw a beggar he asked me for money and he gave it to the beggar this puts a lot of positivity in it in him so when you have money to give to someone who's in need don't give it to him give it to the child and tell the child to give it to that person he'd learn how to be generous and to give rather than always asking other aspects of al-qaeda is to teach the child that whoever is putting the food isn't on the table it's not me it's not mom this is from Allah and when there's a gift given to him oh thank you daddy thank Allah then after that you can thank me Allah has given us this look at all those favors upon us look you can walk you can talk you can see you can touch things there are so many people who are deprived from this Allah has favoured you upon all of those you make him appreciate all those gift and blessings over him and you can cascade from there to elsewhere daddy I cut myself the idea hit my hand in the wall it's hurting so much is it hamdulillah my son this was decreed by Allah Azza WA JAL and we believe that everything was decreed for a wisdom then you start to explain to him how Allah owns everything how Allah created everything how Allah is knowledgeable powerful fair and just with all these feelings him and acknowledging all those beautiful names and attributes he tends to be more mellow chill which allows decree it happened unlike someone who's always on edge why is this why is that he understands whether thinking about it or not but he can you know relate to it we're gonna pause for a short break and then we'll come back to discussing the Skua matter of al Qaeda and how to rectify the matters of a kid within the child at an early age and they will also trick listen to other matters as well a viewer stay tuned we'll be right back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim assalamu alaikum and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where today we're talking about her bein mania or taking the time to raise your children in a in a way that they are God conscious there are conscious of allah subhanho wa taala they understand his attributes and they have a correct and appropriate belief about a lot about his prophets about the quran his books about the color and the things that were mentioned in hadith so we're talking today about how crucial is it to begin an edit early age with this in the prospect of parenting we left took our chicken we're discussing about you know the stairs stations have Arcata different with the dissection off and you mentioned the first thing which is to a child to understand as i mentioned a hadith analyst promote on and as we know this is a contentious point i remember when i was younger and i was studying in al-qaeda and when someone would say to me that allah is this is the position of allah as a young child I remember I was sit down and I would think about a person or algebra in the sky sitting on a throne because my young mind could only comprehend this so that caused and inside of me a lot of confusion and I later on I studied the Nichole of him and Manik when he was asked about stoa when he said that you know the Stuber maha roof that is known the KPA is no one knows it and so on habitat so do you think that has early age to introduce them to such issues of arcadia in a way that they don't understand what how do you sort of address that well first of all you have to understand that the Prophet himself are in salat wa sallam told us that every new born is born upon fitrah so this is instilled in them this fitrah this nature they know Allah social exists they know that Allah is above all so when you relate them to the Quran and the Sunnah and you tell them is Allah is above his throne in a way that fits his Majesty Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and allah does not need the throne Allah does not need the universe Allah is bigger than anything that could your mind they tend to believe without going into details or asking about how this is part of the upbringing of of the children and whenever they come and try to draw a picture and you say LASIK Amelia shakes there's nothing like unto Him subhana WA Ta'ala whatever you think Allah is like is totally different than that and if the children a little bit grown up you can explain to them that this life is bound by three dimensions that we know off so it's the length it's the wet it's the height but we can't understand that there are more than these dimensions so if they can which are I don't doubt they would understand the theory of relativity of Einstein and there's the dimension of time which is not entirely true that I but it's there and when it comes to the unseen there is a fifths and fixed sixth and maybe more dimensions that we're not aware of how would it be possible for the Sun that we see to prostrate at the throne before rising up again we don't understand this and we can't comprehend it because it falls under different dimensions that we do not realize in this world that is why the Prophet is around on the miraculous night journey saw moosa' praying in his grave then a while later saw him in Jerusalem and he led him in prayer and when he was ascended to the heavens he saw him there so how is this possible this is something beyond our comprehension and to believe is what Islam is based on so this is what we try to have our children understand and believe in if you look at the Koran the sooner you will find the emphasis off beat the belief of the Day of Judgment mechanik me noble a holy roman after whoever believes in Allah on the day of judgment why is that such a belief would make the child immune from sinning when in privacy Islam is really marvelous and great religion children who are nine years of age 10 years of age thirsty yet today fast in hot days when they make Woodill what is preventing them from swirling water and swallowing it they know that Allah is watching where did they get this knowledge from their parents who always tell them that ok whatever you are gonna do Allah is watching you so once a child remembers this throughout his life what lie this would have one of the greatest impact on him because even if he's alone he's aware that Allah is watching him so he refrains from doing Haram while others who are non-muslims the most important thing is that you do not get caught anyone who is a non-muslim would tell you yes I'm a law-abiding citizen providing that I do not get caught so I can cheat the system I can cheat IRS I can evade taxations or whatever I can do things professionally as long as legally nobody can catch me this is ok how do you feel when you go to bed at night this is beside the point a Muslim is unlike this Muslims No they have to be acknowledged they have to acknowledge that Allah is watching them so even if I'm tempted to do something I refrained because though nobody's watching me Allah is and recording everything I do yeah and this is exactly the point I was getting at because when accident when I later access question I was giving some practical things of our kid that really stuck with me my whole life so it's giving these are the attributes of Allah and anything that goes against that it couldn't be possible and you know even I remember talking about practicality my father we had a business where he would buy realistic them up ourselves like mission renovate them so my father had a truck full of tools you know they were essential for doing the work and every morning like after fajar we will I will go my job was to go and start the car up when it's cold so the car can be warm and we can go so one morning I went out to start the car and I realized that someone had stole all of the tools in the truck she found everything I mean a year's worth of building work of tools and I started crying why the way is if I had bought the tools myself right and I went to go to my father and he said ok I'd cut it Allah and I was it and to this day that was one of the most profound things that ever happen to me my shop because I learned the color of Allah like I was flipping out how can you be so calm let's go find them what are we going to do the dunya is over but he said no Allah is that when I gave it to me and I took it away so like practicality what a ways that we can like in these little teachable moments that we can teach our kid that it's not necessarily textbook but it's still the way the process wasn't taught and your father was not classified to be a scholarship or a student of knowledge he's a normal Muslim he's your everyday joke yet this is why this is a perfect example why normal Muslims don't commit suicide why normal Muslims preserve their sanity and they don't have you know like psychotic illnesses that makes them hallucinate or turn them into insane people on the contrary hamdulillah the vast majority of Muslims are easygoing what happens to them no matter how hard the calamity is they acknowledge this is from Allah so JAL it was predestined and written fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so a calamity takes place I'm saddened by that but I brush it and move on because this is something that Allah had prescribed I can't do anything about it but to be tolerant and patient so when a calamity takes place I have two options whether to wail shout cry bang my head on the wall but the calamity will remain as it is nothing will change or to praise Allah and to be patient and the calamity will remain as it is yet I'll be rewarded at the sight of Allah this is how Muslims think and I remember reading maybe 15 20 years ago maybe more Christopher Reeve known as Superman to personal and this guy's article was I think he's in Newsweek on x I read it though I don't read English often but III was a flying I think and I've read on the plane I was captivated the guy was a superstar a Hollywood actor married to a beautiful woman had four children healthy beautiful four children and he was a horse rider you know jumping these fences I don't know what they called him Olympic jumping or whatever and he had everything he was he had fame wealth in all of a sudden he gets an accident where he falls off his horse and breaks his neck so he was in seconds paralyzed from the neck down he went into rehabilitation because he had problems with respiratory systems he could not breathe and they put him on a ventilator after like a few months he started to have interviews and he was telling us that he were he almost gave up and wanted to commit suicide and to die but he knew that this is something that God according to him to Allah has prescribed and he has to be patient Allah I was reading it and I almost felt the tears coming out of my eyes this guy is almost a Muslim we need someone to speak to him but at the time I had no possible way of doing that and unfortunately he died a couple of years later after opening a foundation for spinal cord injuries and doing many many things that a lot of the people would concave on themselves and you know just give up life altogether so the belief in unless decree the belief that Allah owns everything once we managed to put this in our children it would make them grow seeing the world different than anyone else was beautiful it's the simplicity I've allocated that this heart was had they understood Allah sponaugle it was simple but profound in a great way and you see over time there's many many schools of thoughts and many fights and gets more complex but the way the Sahab was understood up here the in depth but in a way that was very clear masha'Allah believe that this is a great reason for the success with that being said inshallah Tejada we're going to end the program here today and continued inshallah to Allah in our next segment with the terbium Ania how to raise the children with the Karaka key there was a correct understanding of Allah Spinetta Allah and how this will benefit them in the future in sha Allah Thank You Sheikh awesome as always benefit for our viewers thank you for joining us we hope that you benefited then you learned a great deal of information and knowledge and that you put into practice today the things that you learn until next time assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] you"
