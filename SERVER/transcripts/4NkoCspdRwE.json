  "transcript": "uh so I wanted to ask a very important issue that concerns me a lot so I came to France from Afghanistan to pursue my master's degree giving the current situation for Omen in Afghanistan like where we are not allowed to work or travel freely or move so I I sometimes feel inclined to stay here I mean in France however when I reflect on the A and the reality of that I feel that this life holds on no real benefit for me especially in non-muslim countries so this often leads me to accept the situation in Afghanistan and decide to return regardless of the political or financial challenges that I will face there so what do you recommend to do uh like I should do in this situation also what's the ruling of for Muslims who live in non-muslim countries I really wanted to discuss this issue with you in a Consulting session but given the fact that I'm a student and I cannot afford it so I brought it here first of all the prophet prohibited the Muslims from living permanently among the disbelievers in their countries and he encouraged us as mentioned in the Quran and also in the authentic Sunnah to migrate and be among the Muslims of course Muslim countries are not all alike some Muslim countries the Muslims themselves are oppressed either due to political regimes or to their misunderstanding of the Shar or extreme extremism as simple as that so and this is rare unfortunately unfortunately alhamdulillah this is rare however the vast majority of Muslim countries the amount of Tolerance is there a person can eat halal food hear the aan attend Salat in the Masjid practice his religion without any fear and without any problem so it is ideal for a Muslim to run with his religion with his Iman with his Chastity as soon as possible now if a person has a legitimate reason to stay in such a cafer country for example to pursue studies that cannot be pursued elsewhere or to make money through investing or working where he could not do that or for medical purposes and seeking treatment or for da people go there to make da to Allah and teach people Islam in these cases if you're staying there for a limited per period of time and there is no danger on your Chastity you have righteousness and fear of Allah that you won't fall into Haram in addition to there is no fitna in your own religion you're not prone to doubts and Whispers of missionaries and uh uh the likes in this case this is permissible and you have to leave as soon as your errand is over and Allah Knows Best"
