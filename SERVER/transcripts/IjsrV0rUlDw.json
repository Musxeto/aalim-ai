  "transcript": "is it true that women need to need the constant or the consent of guardian in her first marriage but after she if she's divorced and wants to marry second time she does not need the consent and can go ahead with the marriage answer's no this is totally false the Prophet said adding his salat wa salam there is no marriage between brackets valid except with a guardian and two male witnesses so this means that if a woman marries without the approval in the consent of her guardian such a marriage would not be accepted and allah azzawajal knows best"
