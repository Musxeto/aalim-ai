  "transcript": "haider says one girl reverted and she's a Muslim now her father is still a non-muslim can he be her welly the answer is No part of being a guardian is a condition of being a guardian is that you share the same religion so if I'm proposing to a Muslim woman her guardian has to be Muslim whether her father or her brother or her uncle regardless in if I'm proposing to a Christian woman her father has to be a Christian as well he can't be a Muslim if he's a revert so he was a Christian his daughter is a Christian and then he reverted and accepted Islam can I propose to him to marry his Christian daughter the answer is no her guardian has to follow the same religion and this is an issue that can be debated but this is what the majority of scholars say and we have to stick with that and a large those'll knows best however one has to put in mind that this is regarding marriage but if a Muslim woman wanted to travel from one city or one country to the other and the only Muharram with her was her Christian or her non-muslim father or non Muslim brother this is totally permissible and legitimate"
