  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah alrahman alraheem masala tea or salam ala rasulillah Kadeem alhamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we were discussing child rearing is beauties its virtues its difficulties its many trials and tribulations its blessings today we'll be discussing something very crucial which is the causes that the things that cause children to go astray we find many times remember the things that causes parents much grief is worrying about their children's guidance you find parents often praying to Allah so Allah please guide my children please lead them on the path to the street please leave them bring to you Allah following the Quran and the Sunnah but as my mother used to say you can give birth to a child but you can't give birth to their hearts so I lost Renault child as the one who was always in control of the hearts to help us discussing these matters we have shaken awesome Luqman and hacking was the teacher at that Academy and KIU as well as a teacher and an imam for over 30 years would like to introduce our guest sheikh awesome Luqman Hakeem so don't wanna take my waalaikumsalam to like a child ah thank you so much for joining us and sharing your wisdom office as always we always appreciate you coming here the pleasure is all mine ahipara colophony Iook we'd like to start talking about the estab the causes that leads one's children to go astray so we like the first beginning of poverty how does finances play into a child's behavior a lot of men of our team at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu seldom over like I'm doing here or solely I mean nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in Amado the children are like a piece of dough you can make a cross song you can make a piece of toast loaf bread different kinds depending on how you mold them and and inform them but the guidance is from Allah like your mother rephrased it and if look at some of the deviant or some of the children who went astray you can't always point out to their parents for example look at no peace be upon him one of the strong will messengers of Allah who had spent 950 years giving dower to his people and among them is his son who rejected the offer of his father to board the ark with them so that they can be saved from the floods and he died as a kafir can anyone in his sound mind blame prophet no of course not so guidance from allah azza wajal however we know that the parents have a role and a positive role in upbringing their child as they may have a negative role the beautiful hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he said that ma'am in melodeon Allah will adorn alpha plot every newborn is born upon the fitrah about upon the nature of human beings which is their inclination to worship one God though heat so every child that is born if left alone on an island he will grow up to believing in the existence of Allah not knowing how to pray or fast or learn Arabic or the Quran no of course not but it is built-in in a each and every individual like the Prophet said that is also to worship only one God however the Prophet also said that his parents may change him into a Jew a Christian or a fire worshipper so the environment has a role the upbringing of the fat family has a strong role poverty is one of the factors that may change a child and most of the time we think of poverty as a negative thing but it can also be a positive thing because wealth is not always a good thing it can also be a negative thing and this is why allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala gives each and every one what he needs some of us may be poor and they complain and they say why others are rich and we are not as rich and the answer would be had Allah given you wealth you don't know what kind of a person you would turn into so you see so many wealthy people who are arrogant who are proud who are extravagant would you like to be one of them each one of us would say no no definitely I'm not going to be one of them I'm gonna be better but you don't know and so many wealthy people look at the poor and become depressed why did Allah favor us I wish I was like those poor not being so better than them and live a simple life I've never heard that well because they haven't tried it so a lot of the wealthy people take their children to Africa to poor areas of Africa to see how poor they are and the children go not to learn rather to take selfies and to write about their endeavors and not learning so they don't know what poverty is but those who have some life in their hearts feel depressed because they that Allah has favored them over others and they believe that they're not entitled for such way yet Allah knows best if they were to become poor they may disbelieve in Allah they may go astray they may do sins beyond recognition but Allah Azza WA JAL is Latif he chooses the best for his servants though this the ignorant servant does not know what is best for him so poverty is one of the factors that may change and impact the life of a child drastically and this is why the Prophet always Allison encouraged us to have our children have the upper hand not the lower hand the hand that gives and this is why he told saddening ABI Waqqas it is best to leave your offspring rich and wealthy rather than leaving them poor begging people for money so poverty causes a child to be envious and this is the easiest sin around so it's something in the heart no one knows about it I'm envious to my neighbor they have food we don't they have clothes that we don't they go to school we don't and this is why the Prophet as I'm advised up with her and he said a Buddha when you cook a meal put a lot of water in it so that you can give from this soup to your neighbours when your neighbors smell the food and they don't have anything on their table they're envious and when people are envious they are bound to commit a crime so they may steal they may cheat they may lie and all of this comes as a result of borrowing so step number one you're poor step number two you borrow step number three you lie cheat and deceive people in order to hide what you are borrowing or to pay it back if you were put under pressure poverty may cause a child to grow up in an environment where prostitution is prevailing people need money stealing bribery's selling intoxicants dealing in drugs doing bad things and this is why go to America for example and look at the crime rate there and you will find that the vast majority of criminals were not criminals by nature they were pushed to be criminals because they were either so poor that they needed a way out and if you look at the media it kills people from inside when you see people driving convertibles living in houses or mansions having money living a lavish style of life and I could barely eat and I'm living on Social Security on benefits this causes an imbalance in the society which would lead to people or children it who we are concentrating on which leads them astray you mentioned many things taking those like crazy over here you mentioned the environment you mentioned the media you mentioned poverty so I want to touch on all of this points before we leave here today but something that I remember I have a friend by the name of Bashar Jones who he grew up in a shelter home him as a siblings they were very very poor but even while he was in the shelter his mother would take him to other shelters to feed people homeless people were they were themselves are homeless so this gave him a to be a sort of like a good discipline for as he got older he was always generous because he never forgot that teaching that his mother gave so there are many benefits to come over the other side I didn't even think about that till now another thing is and this will take maybe take a whole segment is environment how crucial is the environment is is in the development of a child okay now this is not plant yeah sure so whatever comes out is Charlotte true but it might not be structured sure the environment is a very vast and big topic so the environment includes your parents because this is the first environment you encounter when you are born it includes your school it includes your neighborhood and it includes the media now when we talk about the parents this is a vast topic as well your parents can make or break your personality if you're blessed with good caring and loving parents they can be source of pushing you astray because they are spoiling you if you are blessed with parents who are not loving or caring but discipline then you may become a disciplined person lacking emotions so the parents have a lot of things that can make it or break it in your upbringing yeah so this is a very crucial point I would like to pause here and then after the break we're gonna continue the development of our mission atala viewer stay tuned for this wonderful episode of life's adornments we'll be right back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim assalamualaikum warahmatullah welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we were talking today about the causes for children to go astray and this is a very crucial point talking about the environment how the environment plays an effective role and has a profound impact on children on their upbringing and there's a crucial like the parable that can be given which is that if a person exists in the environment in a place and this place has a horrible smell the first time you enter into a city or a place that has a horrible smell you would immediately recognize the smell immediately recognize the defects the things that caused an environment to be corrosive but after a day or two days or three days or a month or a year you become accustomed to the sicknesses and the elements and the poor smells of this environment of this place likewise when a child grows up in environment and they are dependent upon these things it becomes normal to them so how do we raise children and great environments where they take the positives and they take the beauties of an environment which they take on to their own character as opposed to leaving them in places where they take on the bad characteristics and a bad trace of an environment Shama so the environment has a great impact upon a person's upbringing or any person's personality in the authentic hadith a man killed a hundred and asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth they directed him to a scholar he went to the scholar and told him that I have killed a hundred souls and I did no no no I'm just talking about the scholar or the scholar so I just wanted to make the hadith shorter okay instead of taking you to the monk okay and then so the scholar said and who can prevent you from repenting however you are in a town there is full of corrupt people so you must leave this town to another town where there are righteous practicing people to worship Allah with so this indicates that the environment has a very negative impact on your life if you live among the righteous people inevitably your wife is gonna wear hijab you're gonna practice Islam you're gonna go to the Masjid when someone does you something good you say jazakallah Iran barakallahu feel calm you won't be cursing and swearing and saying using profanity rather you would be like them yes and if you are in a place that is stinking the people are awful not practicing you will be like them maybe in the beginning you will resent what they're doing but after a while as you've stated the smell the the environment the taste that is bad would become normal and you will be accustomed to it and this shows the corruption of the heart therefore the environment does have a great impact on the individual and definitely this is one of the reasons where children are gone astray because of such environment yeah so let's begin with the home you broke it down beautifully into subcategories which is the home the neighborhood and even perhaps the country so and within the particular home environment many children pick up poor characteristics as the home is the first man dressed as the first learning place they pick a very bad characteristics in the home environment and this could be the very initial calls for them to be led astray when I was teaching I remember we had a student every day she will come to my class and she would never prepare she would never do a homework she would sleep she wasn't a bad student but she was just wouldn't engage completely so I got really frustrated with her or not talk to the principal like why is the student even in class she was getting left back every year and he said that at home she doesn't sleep at night because her father was abusing her mother like beating her badly almost a near death at times so she couldn't sleep she didn't feel safe so school was the only place that she will come someone feel safe and she was sleep in school because that was our only piece of comfort so you know how could the environment of the home affect a child's livelihood this is very unfortunate now if we were to go to homes we have a number of factors that control the upbringing of the child in that home yes number one the chemistry between the parents number two the rivalry between the siblings number three what children spend their time doing throughout the day and night and this includes video games entertainment television the Internet and the sky's the limit when we go to the parents the chemistry between the parents is very important the love the care that the children see between their parents is essential mother hadiza may Allah be pleased with her and we know that the Prophet had no children from all of his wives except from hadiza and from his concubine Maria the Coptic he had Abraham who died when he was like less than a year old or something close to that so hadiza was given the glad tidings may Allah be pleased with her of having a house in Paradise made of a hollow pearl where she would not work or feel tired and she would not be disturbed from loud noise scholars say this is a reward for her things that she had done to the Prophet whenever he went home he did not find any need to work or to not to rest she always made sure that he would not get tired or not to work and she always kept the house tidy and quiet so even the children would not shout and disturb the Prophet I assumed oh he loved them when the children are brought up in a household like this they see the respect the utmost respect from this woman to her husband and they see the mutual love and care plus respect from the husband to his wife definitely they will grow up to be this kind of a family that would produce other families in the same fashion but when we have a couple even if they love one another unfortunately they're not wise they would fight they would shout at one another they would bring their disagreement in front of the kids this is very negative the children will grow to be like them they will take the role model of one of them and usually it's the aggressor so if a husband is unfair unjust and abusive physically they will become also abusive physically to one another and to the children at school and we've seen this in real life when the principal complains about a child hitting and abusing other children we trace this back to his house and we find that the mother and the father do this so this is one aspect of the house the parents then we have the siblings rivalry and this is extremely important to be careful from because Envy is there and it develops in no time into hatred and enmity look at use of not you look at use of peace be upon him his father loved him so much though his father was a prophet prophet yaqoob the son of prophet Isaac the son of prophet and messenger Ibrahim so what kind of lineage is this perfection yeah goeb never crossed the line all was unfair but it was obvious that he loves Youssef more than anyone else just cordial love just a feeling and what did this cause his brothers his siblings plotted against him took him and threw him in a well leaving him to his fate lying to their father saying that he was killed and attacked by a wolf and we know the whole story this is why the Prophet I system said fear Allah and treat your children equally because I do not testify on injustice so giving your son as a gift a hundred dollars and giving the other 150 dollars is injustice as the prophet has said that is awesome so such rivalry between the siblings impacts personalities and the siblings themselves should pay attention to this what do we mean by paying attention so many times I am the favorite one to my parent when I see that my brother is doing something wrong to me I complain yeah and this makes my parent hate or at least reprimand scold my brother for what he had done to me this causes enmity and this may cause him to go astray because of me of being selfish so such rivalry should be always taken into consideration we have the media we have the video games that I don't think I don't know if you have time to go another episode now a baby shower lastly you mentioned the story of know how they sell em I just wanted to make a point about when Alice when I thought I told no and who lay Simon Alec that he is not from your family in these environments if you have a child that's a quote unquote good or a car's quote unquote bad any mixed together and one influenced the other does this mean that this child who isn't believing or is it Muslim or isn't righteous that he isn't from your family how do we understand this how do you deal with this when you read the ayah before that now the Sun is drowned is dead so now no he's begging Allah no and he's saying o Allah my son is from my family but your promise is the truth so what can I do so Allah tells him he is not from your family he has done something that is outrageous he has disbelieved so Allah is telling no peace be upon him that your actual family are those who believe your followers are those who are considered to be from your family and this is why when we say Allah humma salli wa sallim ala muhammadin wa ala aalihi here can be me meant to be his family and can be also meant to be his followers in another verse in surah ghafir allah says at Hilu alifair una i shed the light up way no matter whom sir at Sala Verona I shed the light up I left around the family of round his wife was okay she's among the masses of of Jenna the people the followers of so in this context we understand that he is not from your family does not mean he's a bastard or born out of wedlock no by lineage he is your son but he's not actually from your family of believers and this is why you should not ask for his forgiveness or intercede for him and he refrained ha Allah I hate to end the episode on this crucial point there's so much what to be covered charlotte ila we can continue and continue to doubt like there's so much knowledge and wasn't being granted thank you welcome viewers we know that you don't want to go but please be patient with us and attend our next episode of life the dorms insha'Allah thank you for viewing may Allah bless you may Allah increase your knowledge assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] [Music]"
