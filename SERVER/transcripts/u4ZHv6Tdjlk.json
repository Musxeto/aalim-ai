  "transcript": "foreign I am 18 and I want to get married and I recently got a proposal and my parents like him and I also like him and the guy also likes me back but my parents want to delay Danica because they demand I'm ahead of that I don't agree with and it's pretty high and the guy can't afford it and they want to delay the  till he can afford them but me and the guy we both fear that we're gonna fall into Haram and we're gonna commit Center so what can I do your name means fearing Allah azzawajal which includes all types of Virtues and righteousness and piety how is it possible for a person to fall into Zina if he is abiding by the laws of Allah azzawajal it is not possible falling into Haram has prerequisites it doesn't happen just like that so there has to be pre-matical communication and relationships there has to be continuous chit chatting and socializing and phone calls and texting there has to be meetings without the knowledge of your parents and the public there has to be Haram step by step that shaytan Grooms and caters for if you have fallen into these footsteps of shaytan you're doomed and we cannot justify wrongdoings due to other wrongdoings which means that two wrongs don't make a right if you're unable to get married due to constraints and obstacles that your parents place that does not justify you to go and marry behind their backs because such a marriage is invalid then it says word says committing Zina so number one fear Allah and cut all means of communication with this boy because if he was a practicing righteous person he would not have communicated with you before marriage at all full stop secondly try to convince your parents especially your father because he's the one who's got the lead in his hand he's got the keys if he says yes it doesn't matter what everyone else in the family says if he says no even if the whole family in the tribe approve of this marriage the marriage is invalid try to convince your father that you have to get married soon that you fear fitna upon yourself going to UNI meeting this boy um getting phone calls Etc it's very hard for you and you don't want to fall into Haram be blunt straightforward if he does not agree in this case you have to cut all Communications which we have done in step one but forget about this boy totally and consider him not existing he died and focus on your life focus on getting closer to Allah focus on your studies if you're studying because there's no way you can get married to him without your father's approval Knows Best"
