  "transcript": "why is owning a dog as a pet wrong well the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam forbade us from owning a dog as a pet and he told us that this would reduce the Good Deeds of an individual every day as heavy as Mount what is the reason reason one of the reasons was mentioned in the Hadith of jiel peace be upon him the angel when he had an appointment with the prophet wasam and he was late so the prophet went out of the house and found jiel waiting outside so he told him why didn't you come in and jel said that we Angels do not enter a house where there is a stat or a dog or a portrait a picture so the prophet ordered the dog or that was a puppy belonging to Hussein to be taken out of the house and the statue jel said chop off the head of the statue so it would be like a tree and as for the picture or the portrait just simply uh cover the face or color the face and Allah knows best but this is one of the reasons and as Muslims we do not have to ask for the reason for everything that Allah tells us to do or the prophet told us to do because though we may know the list the wisdom behind 95% of what we're told to do or not to do Shan comes into our heart through the remaining 5% and he would say okay this is forbidden because so and so logical we're ordered to do this because so and so logical now when it comes to the remaining 5% Shan would say this is not logical and he would make the individual he would make him refuse to submit his will in these 5% because he could not believe in them or understand them and this definitely is a dangerous thing and it would probably nullify a person's Islam when he rejects Allah's instruction and uh claiming that they are not logical to him and Allah Knows Best"
