  "transcript": "um the tradition of when somebody passes um what are the Sunnah aspects what do we do when somebody passes away he said some rituals of praying on the third day the seventh day then having a a 40th Day feast or some something similar to that what are the sun aspects uh all of what the brother mentioned is considered to be Innovation the only authentic thing for a Muslim when a close one dies is that you mourn for three days and that is all whatever is more is forbidden except in the case of a widowed woman she is to mourn her husband for four day four months and 10 days now umab B AB sufyan may Allah be pleased with her and with his with her father Abu sufyan when he died a on the third day after three days were over she called her maid and brought some uh perfume and she put some of the perfume on the side of her head and she told those who were attending by Allah I do not have any intention or need for this perfume but I heard the prophet tells us sallallahu alaihi wasallam that it is not permissible for a woman to mourn any person more than 3 days except her husband so she brought this to show and teach those who were with her that this is the Sunnah and tradition now mourning or performing prayer for a deceased person on the 10th day or one week afterwards and the 14th and then one year after that this is all uh uh based on teachings of the old pharaohs it has nothing to do with Islam or with Arabs the these are all customs of the Pharaohs and it's completely forbidden for Muslims to practice it and one of those things is that we follow the Sunnah so if it was there it would be done by the prophet the sahab at the time that is completely correct and as long as the prophet did not do it neither did his companions then there is no excuse for us to innovate in the religion of Allah"
