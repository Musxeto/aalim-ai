  "title": "Can my Shia friend be imam & lead us in prayer if he knows more Quran or must I lead Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] okay so in the prayer at my school either i lead or my friends my friend has memorized more quran than me but he is shia he has also said words that imply that aisha is a monafic he said that um only monotheists hate ali and then he was arguing that aisha hates ali and then i confronted him do you believe aisha is a monotheist and he said and he denied such he has also tried to spread his shia beliefs publicly and i worry that he one day might give a hook by trying to spread such beliefs am i obligated to oppose him and to try and be the imam myself or someone else even though he he has memorized more quran than me i don't want to be arrogant what should i tell the others i don't know this is something that you're claiming and if you don't have proof that backs it up i don't know what what you should do because maybe you're lying maybe he didn't say these things maybe you are speculating things such beliefs usually become public if a person holds such a belief usually everyone around him knows this about it about him so you don't have to go out of your way to expose him everybody talks that yes he said ill things about mother aisha yes he's trying to praise shia and their mullahs and their weird fatwas and their corrupt akida so if this is the case then the answer would be definitely all those who follow the quran the sunnah must not pray or accept him to pray or lead their prayer even if he's a half of someone with such a corrupt akida that is known to everyone must not be allowed to lead so you or anyone else could do this and you should make people aware of it insha allah you"
