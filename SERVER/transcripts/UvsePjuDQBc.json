  "title": "If imam makes sujood tilawah in silent rakah, should we follow him & is it permissible Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "if i am the imam or a follower in a silent rocker and if i recite an ayah or a surah containing stationar presentation i recited unintentionally or intentionally should i prostrate so let me understand your question you're saying that if i am in a silent prayer and the imam recites a ayah of uh that contains a prostration of recitations if he prostrates as a follower you should follow him but i don't know any sound imam with his uh sound mind would do that because everybody else would think that he went for rukur therefore it is not permissible for such an imam to offer such a sujud as this would confuse the masses and the same case is for you and the ruling of the prostration of recitation it is mustahab it is not mandatory so if you skip it intentionally your prayer is valid and you're not sinful for that and allah knows best"
