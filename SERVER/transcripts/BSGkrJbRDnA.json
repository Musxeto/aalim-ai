  "transcript": "Alum so I was praying behind the because some he does onah so what happened during the I was doubting whether or not my like my outer was uncovered at the back cuz my shorts are kind of long but then they're kind of loose to that like maybe the been shown so I bent slightly just looking at the behind to see if my order was uncovered I'm wondering if that invalidates prayer whether like if you bend it a bit just to like this was in or in what in while the IM was making so while you're in a standing position yeah how did you look at your back end are you a giraffe I just like kind of like look just behind with me I can't even imagine you need to be like rubberman or something how is it possible to be able to see your back I can't even imagine that but if you turned your head 180 degrees and and you looked backwards your prayer is invalid and Allah Knows Best"
