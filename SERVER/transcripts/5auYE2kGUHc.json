  "title": "Skipped fasting Ramadan when they were young, must they make them up now? #ramadan assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "She this question is for my parents that when they were young like 13 or 14 they did not have any seriousness for Ramadan. Even though fasting was for them they used to not fast during Ramadan unintentionally and now they have seriousness. What should they do? Do they need to complete all the mist fasts of when they were young or they can pick up for it? We we've said this so many times and I'll repeat it for you. Those who skip the fasting of a day of Ramadan or more either they did not fast it from the beginning till the end they did not have intention to fast it or they started to fast but few hours later they broke their fast. If it is the first they did not fast like in the case of your parents they simply skipped fasting the whole month of Ramadan. They cannot make up for these days because the time is gone and they did not intend to fast it at its prescribed time. They have to ask Allah for forgiveness and move on. But if they started to fast, meaning that they started to worship Allah and at 10:00 in the morning they drank and ate and broke their fast. They have to make up for that day or days because they've started a form of worship and now and spoiled it themselves. They have to make up for it and Allah knows best."
