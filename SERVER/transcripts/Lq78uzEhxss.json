  "transcript": "asks another question is it permissible to apply eye lashes now eyelashes are something that women apply and put as an extension to their own natural eyelashes so it makes it longer and it gives them as they claim more beauty so what's the ruling on that if we go back to the Quran into the Sunda we find that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam cursed a number of people and he told us that Allah has cursed these people and among them are those who make tattoos they're two artists and individuals who have tattoos done on their bodies this is something that is cursed by Allah Azza WA JAL and unfortunately nowadays we find ok disbelievers doing it this is normal they don't believe in Allah Azza WA JAL so what's the point in talking about it they're already disbelievers but when you find Muslims who abide by the Quran and Sunnah and they're influenced by sports men by athletes by actors by celebrities who have these tattoos covering their body and they imitate them this is problematic how can a Muslim do such a thing to himself change the creation of Allah knowing that Allah so gel curses those who do this among the things that the Prophet Elias a lot of Salaam told us that Allah curses those who do them is plucking the eyebrows for women of course then for men by default but usually women do this so plucking the eyebrows the woman the hairdresser who does it and the woman who's being done - they were both cursed by Allah and by the Prophet Elisha lot Salam and the Prophet told the Sallust a lot of sand that Allahu Allah well Mustafa Salah the hairdresser that fixes hair extensions and the individual the woman that has this done to her this is also something cursed by Allah and by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so many times people ask what's the logic ok it is there is no such thing as logic per se because Allah as usual is the owner of the universe his messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam is the one who's delivering this message to us and when allah tells us something it is disrespectful to say why justify this for me give me a reason who are you you're a slave of Allah you are told to do something and you believe so as Muslims we submit our will to allah azzawajal allah tells us that this is prohibited we stop we refrain now is there any wisdom definitely there are tons of wisdoms but we may fail to see it and we may see some of it nevertheless whether the wisdom is clear to us or not as Muslims we have to comply so when it comes to having hair extensions this is changing a last creation a woman has thin hair short hair wearing such extensions whether natural or not natural it gives the look that she is having here that is not hers I've seen girls little girls wearing a cap with braids falling down and it looks as if they're theirs this is haram so any type of extension even if made by cloth some of the women have long hair but they bring a piece of cloth and they put it underneath and they put layers of the hair on top of it so it gives them the look of having longer hair than normal or thicker her hair than the actual truth this is prohibited and the Prophet has cursed those who do that now when you come to eyelashes the scholars say at the time of the Prophet as salam there were no eyelashes so what's the ruling they say let's see if it fits the hadith is it hair on the body being extended by something that is not from the body the answer is yes the scholars say then this fits the curse of the Prophet allosaurus unto those who do them and by the way the essence of hijab is generally defined by such women so sisters asked what's the ruling on wearing contact lenses what's the way the ruling on bleaching our eyebrows what's the ruling on piercing the nose with an earring for example or this or that some of if not all are halal generally speaking but when it defines the purpose of hijab where the woman herself exposes such a decoration or adornment or whatever - none Mahalo meant to see her then this becomes hala she has to cover so what's the ruling on a woman wearing makeup permissible providing men do not see her nama-hatta men so she has to cover her face if she goes out likewise when having eyelashes some scholars say it's okay even those who say it's okay they tell you that you cannot waive any job while having these false eyelashes because it will give you one heck of a look when men look at your eyes even if you were a goat a goat has excellent eye format and if you put any herb on a goat and let it sit next to you in the car people would you know look in astonishment wow what a beautiful woman because of what they see is big eyes so a woman should always put at the back of her mind that hijab is not only for her protection but it's also for the protection of the whole community people men in general they're not the same there are those who are pious there's those who are righteous but there are those who are sick there are those who are weak so women by nature Allah created them to have this magnet in them that pulls men either by the way they look the way they sound when they talk the way they walk and the sound they make when they walk whether with high heels or with normal heels all of these things Satan utilizes to lure men to sin and this is not your problem as a woman as a sister but your problem is to abide by the Quran and Sunnah and hence Dina this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
