  "title": "A person claiming he is Isa / Jesus Christ - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "rubbish from malaysia says that there's someone claiming that he's jesus christ and his followers are talking about islam about everything being metaphoric etc these are deviant people and we have to look in what they claim this person who claims that he's isa and he's the son of mary definitely he's a blatant liar and he's a kafir but most likely before we say he's a kafir he is insane if you were to do a psychiatric evaluation you will find that he is not sane so if he's saying then he's a kafir those who follow him depend on their beliefs and what they say if they say anything that goes against islam or nullifies the principles of islam or reject anything of islam or the quran or the sunnah authentic sunnah then they are kafir as well"
