  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to this 20th class of the islamic faith or fusolan philippede and today we are discussing the chapter number 12 of this book so the 12th chapter of this book and it talks about the relationship between the muslims and their rulers which is a pivotal point in the islamic hakida you see islamic capital is not only related to toheid as we know it and that's it this is akida no it is a larger picture it depe it also relates to the role of the intellect to sharia it relates to the belief in allah and his existence his books his messengers his angels the belief in the hereafter as we talked last class about and what inc is included in that such as the torment of the grave resurrection helen heaven accountability etc it also relates with our relationship with our rulers and what governs that and this may seem odd to a lot of the muslims who are ignorant as simple as that when muslims think that islam is only to pray and fast but if i commit sins it's okay if i legislate something that goes against the quran and sunnah it's okay if i am not convinced of something that is proven by the quran and the sunnah no problem freedom of speech not knowing that this breaches your iman this invalidates your islam so a lot of these ignorant muslims who know nothing about islam except what they saw their parents and grandparents practice so they're doing the same and if their parents and grandparents were idol worshipers they would have done the same as well their islam is not genuine it's not out of conviction it's out of tradition these people when you talk to them and say that your relationship with your muslim ruler has an impact on your apida and on your islam they shrug their shoulders and say this is nonsense this is not related to islam when it is indeed related to islam but their ignorance prevents them from acknowledging i remember once about 30 odd years ago i was attending a lecture in big huge message here in jeddah and the sheikh who had a weekly class was shocked to see ibn rethey mean sitting in front of him so after he finished his class and we offered margaret prayer the sheikh refused to go back to his chair and announce that we have shaykh he's our greatest sheikh so the sheikh took the share and gave a short speech about the importance of knowledge etc and then answered few questions and one of the questions it some people say that sheikh so and so the one who's sitting in front of him the one who gives this weekly lecture every week some say that he is from the hawari is this true now look at the question posed to the to the shaykh and the man is sitting in front of him i remember clearly as if it was yesterday that the sheikh pretended that he doesn't know where the sheikh is in front of him he said where is sheikh so-so so he said do you say that we can give tak fear to muslims because of doing a major sin he said no sheikh i do not then he asked him a second question do you believe that we are allowed to rebel against muslim rulers and the shaykh said no shaykh i do not believe that this is permissible then the sheikh ibn said well i declare to you all that this man is a hawari meaning a rebellious or a rebellion against the people of innovation and the deviant sects and everybody in the messenger of allah but because that was a declaration from sheikh mean who only made this play to show the ignorance and the haters of the sheikh that he is on the right path and on the right uh akida so this issue is important because it always has a chapter in the books of apida whether those who went overboard in praising their rulers even if they commit kuffar and shirk they still back them up or those who simply would like to jump the gun and give tak fear to the muslim rulers without any verification without any justification and provoke the layman to rebel against them and this is the treat and characteristic of the hawari that's why every single book of akhida has this chapter in it and we will go through what we have in sha allah and hopefully that we would learn from it to stay with the community is obligatory and no community exists without a leader or an imam what is meant by the community well this is a rough translation of al-jamaa and al-jama comes from the word that relates to congregation to the unity or the majority and it's not judged as an islamic terminology by the masses or the quantity you see when the prophet saw was sent to quresh he was the jamaa on his own and everybody else was on kufr and sheikh and likewise when ibrahim peace be upon him was sent to his people he was the jamaica so the word jamaa means congregation means the majority of people but it does not relate to the number or the quantity let that be known to all of us may allah be pleased with him the great companion of the prophet isam said al-jaman the definition of jamaa is whatever coincides with the truth even if you are alone whatever coincides with the truth even if you were alone and this is the truth so when we have a community when we have a country where they all pretend and claim to be muslims but they sell intoxicants wine and they deal in gambling they allow prostitution they have all vices and sins that you can ever think of no one in his right mind would go and say oh masha allah everybody in this country are liberal this is the islam we want this is a true islam because they are the jamaa they are the congregation they are the majority well this is false news the jamaa is that which coincides with the truth if i go to a country where the muslims are the minority this is the jamaa even if they are the minority allah says in the quran even if you try hard the vast majority of people would not believe so don't be fooled by the quantities this is not an indication of truth then the sheikh says the leader of the muslim community of the jamaa is obeyed in line with the obedience of allah so the obedience of the muslim ruler is not independent it must be in line with the obedience of allah allah says in the quran in chapter 4 verse 59 and i'm reading from the trans translation international allah says oh you who have believed obey allah and notice the verb obey allah and obey the messenger again obey is repeated and those in authority among you and if you disagree over anything refer it to allah and the messenger so here we see that obey is used with allah and is used with the messenger which means that the obedience of the prophet allah is a must the obedience of allah of course is a must but the prophet islam may also instruct us with things that are not found in the quran and we have to obey but when it comes to the muslim rulers allah says and obey the messenger and those in authority he did not repeat and obey those in authority and he said among you which means that the phrase among you means from among the muslims so this is a condition for a mush for a ruler that he must be a muslim in order to be obeyed and the shift clarifies this further he says a disbeliever may not be an imam by the way imam is an arabic terminology that can you can be used for a number of leading roles one is the great imam which is the muslim ruler to the imam of the prayer usually referring to the masjid and he's a leader three any person who leads a group even if he leads them to hell fire he's still considered to be an imam so usually here they refer to the muslim ruler because this chapter deals with it says a disbeliever may not be an imam nor a leader of the muslim community so it's a condition that the leader or the imam of the muslim community must be a muslim nor is it permissible to appoint a disbeliever to such a spot or a post so in so many so-called muslim countries where they apply democracy they have elections and sometimes if not most a christian leads their country a hindu leads the country a disbeliever leads the country this is not at all permissible to the muslims to appoint someone like that it is not required to obey him if he is a non-muslim it is not required to obey such a leader except in so far as what serves the interests of the community so now we are in a predicament we have a muslim country and the army the civil defense the police force backed the elections and the winning of a disbeliever ruler what to do if we don't obey him we'll go to jail if we don't obey him we will cause chaos in the country so the sheikh says it is not required to obey him except insofar as what serves the interests of the community so in order to ensure peace in the land and to not disrupt the livelihood of our muslim brothers and sisters if this non-muslim ruler orders us to stop when the traffic light is red we have to obey him when he tells us that we have to do certain things that do not go against sharia but we don't like it this he has to be obeyed because this serves the community the muslims at large now the sheikh goes to continue in if the leader of the muslim community does not have good knowledge of islam he should appoint a scholar to advise him so as to ensure that the religious and worldly affairs of the muslim community are set on the right basis what does that mean now a muslim ruler is supposedly one of the best if not the best of the community of the jumar so he has to have deep insight wisdom mercy strength firmness fairness justice knowledge if you look at the first muslim ruler the prophet allah any comparison would be unfair so we skip we go to abu bakr we find that abu bakr was the muslim ruler of the whole muslim world yet he was the one who led the prayer in the grand masjid of medina he was the one who conducted the affairs of the country two years plus he died when roma succeeded him peace be up may allah be pleased with him he ruled like a true leader for a decade or more he managed to set the foundation of the islamic state with all the bookkeeping and the administrative directives that he used to issue and he led the prayer when uthman came when ali came and on and on it was the duty of the caliph the muslim ruler to lead the prayer to look into court issues he would appoint judges but maybe they did not have grand jury or the high court but the muslim ruler was the ultimate power he used to go and check everything he used to uh send expeditions and he used to send um armies to conquer other countries he was responsible for diplomatic international diplomatic relationships he used to be responsible for ensuring the safety of the interior where he was in his country so they used to do everything nowadays it's a different ball game unfortunately and rarely if any that you would find a true muslim leader so the vast majority if not all are totally ignorant about islam about the basics of islam and if you ask someone to recite a verse of the quran most likely he would fail so the sheikh says that this due to the fact that this is where we live the scholars of different schools of thought said that it is his that is the leader the imam's responsibility to appoint a scholar so that he would advise him to ensure that the religious and worldly affairs of the muslim community are set on the right basis and this is a must allah says in the quran and when there comes to them something that is information about public security or fear they spread it around but if they had deferred it back to the messenger or there is the sunnah or to those of authority among them there is the people of knowledge then the ones who can draw correct conclusion from it would have known about it those who can draw correct conclusion of it who is capable of drawing correct conclusion only the scholars so this is a duty upon all muslim rulers if they are truly muslim and they want to please allah azzawajal that they surround themselves with scholars of islam who would tell them that engaging with the enemy in a tree in a peace treaty is this or that they're selling alcohol is totally prohibited this is not permissible charging the people taxations and burdening them with financial expenses is haram etc those who would give the good advice to such a leader the sheikh goes on to say if the leader uh no we've gone through this he says it is not permissible to rebel against the leader or try to usurp his authority if he deals unfairly his unfairness should be tolerated with resignation unless he perpetrates some clear disbelief um may allah be pleased with her said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi said some leaders will be appointed over you and you shall be happy with some of their actions but not with others whoever is displeased with the latter clears himself of responsibility so this is something that you're displeased with but you're not doing anything about it then the prophet says and whoever speaks out against it is safe it is the one who accepts and follows that is condemned people asked the prophet alison o prophet of allah should we not fight them the prophet said allah not as long as they attend to their prayers and this hadith was related to sahih imam muslim now the issue of rebelling against a bad ruler in our times when we are so distant from the quran and from the sunnah and the way of the self it seems like a fabulous idea rebelling out ousting the ruler overthrowing the government making a coup all of these words seem to be glamorous and eye-catching especially when we are dominated by decades of rotten regimes ruling the muslim world and democracy is prevailing in the non-muslim world and also it's creeping to the muslim world big time so it seems when people are oppressed depressed and feel the and the injustice done to them and to the muslims all over the world they feel that the only way out is to be violent [Music] the muslims know that this is not the right way from the quran from the sunnah so they try to calm people down but the people don't want to come down the people are backed by the kafir countries the democratic countries world forces trying to manipulate and change the map the amount demographically geographically politically and economically so they fuel these people and this is why al-hasan al-basri said when tribulation and calamity comes no one is capable of seeing it except the scholars they stand firm and say be careful of people this is bad this is going to hurt us this is going to kill our unity and the layman and the masses ignore that and they ride the tide and they take the wave once the destruction is done and the tornado is gone everybody can see the consequences of it everybody regrets but it is too late look throughout history what are the results of such rebellions what are the results of such attempts we all hate oppression don't get me wrong i hate oppression i hate injustice i hate to be treated unequally why would someone be treated better than me and my family why would someone be given more than myself why isn't there justice to the poor and needy and those who call for our help all of us hate this but we are muslims and this is what separates us from the rest of the world we have guidelines to follow we have the quran and we have the sunnah and we understand them with the understanding of the favorite three generations of the companions taberin and taberet tabbing we are the best we are the elite because we are following the footsteps of the prophet sallam and those whom he told us to follow their footsteps there is no second choices we have to abide by this so what does quran and in the understanding of the self say to us they say to us it is not permissible to rebel against the leader or try to usurp his authority and we see this all over us we can see this clearly in many places of the world why because they don't abide by the quran we have seen what is known as the arabian spring in yemen in syria in egypt in libya in tunisia and before that in iraq and the list can go on six muslim countries what happened to them from here to here from being able 10 years ago to travel anywhere with their passports to have proper education for the children to have food on the table to have medical care in their hospitals to complete chaos now most people there curse islam because they think that what hardship they're living in was caused by those rebels who claimed to be muslims reformers who wanted the justice to prevail and who wanted to bring prosperity to their communities even if this led to some bloodshed some chaos some internal wars and division ten years down the line look at what had happened look at their economies look at their political system judicial system look at the safety and security of the people and their well-being okay now it's clear you are one of those paid by the government to [Music] do their pr well i am not given a penny by them and i don't work for them i work for the quran from the sunnah and messengers before me peace be upon them were accused of being sorcerers liars insane poets and the list goes on just because they gave and brought and delivered the truth to their people so it is not permissible for us as muslims to rebel against the ruler but sheikh the ruler takes our wealth and money the ruler is unfair the ruler is a tyrant the ruler puts his hands with the disbelievers the ruler has done so many atrocities again we have a dividing line and this dividing line is what binds us the prophet says he ordered us to be with the jamaa and without any imam there is no jamara even if he does all these heinous things the bigger picture dictates that we obey him because we have now and we have then if you go to libya you have now go 10 years ago when all qaddafi was ruling and he was one of the evilest people around and comparable to apple now or then 100 of the people would say then go to syria no one likes bashar now or then everybody would say then so the scholars look at the bigger picture according to what the quran the sunnah dictate to us the hadith of the prophet is crystal clear you must obey what your muslim ruler says as long as it is not against islam now if he does things against islam if you abhor this and hate it with your heart then you're safe if you take a step further and condemn it publicly and educate people not to provoke the people against the ruler but rather to clarify that listen guys what the ruler is doing is against islam this is all haram and prohibited according to the quran then you have done he has done his duty the fault is on those who clap and give thumbs up to their ruler and talk against those who try to enjoin virtue and goodness and prevent and prohibit vice and evil this third category are with them in hell fire on the day of judgment so now when the companions showed that it was this bad and the companions melodies with them were knights with a k they were warriors so they said to the prophet saw what would force us to stay under such tyranny shouldn't we fight them the prophet said no as long as they establish prayer as long as they on the surface to us pray then they're muslims now many people disrespect such a hadith and other hadiths and these people are in great danger of losing their islam the hadith something even more difficult to them the companion may allah be pleased with him he said that we gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet and he's talking about before migration early times and we gave him the pledge to obey him and to adhere to his instruction whether it's in times of ease or in difficulty and even if the ruler prefers himself over us and exclusively take things for himself and his family and his tribe depriving us from that and the prophet took the pledge of allegiance that we do not fight those in power for what is theirs meaning power and authority and he gave an exception meaning you must not rebel you must not overthrow the government or fight against the muslim ruler unless and the prophet gave four conditions unless you see so it's not someone telling me no something i saw with my own eyes unless you see blasphemous and this means that if he drinks wine if he fornicates publicly if he gambles this is not kufr these are major sins so i must still obey him but if i see kufr blasphemy that is blatant that is crystal clear so even if i say kaffir if i see kufur but it's an issue of dispute among scholars the prophet says do not rebel against him the kuffer he commits has to be undisputed like when he steps on a copy of the quran nobody says okay maybe he has some reason no this is blatant kuffer and the prophet says the fourth condition is that you have a clear evidence on it from allah meaning that it's not something that scholars said it's blatant rather it is so unambiguous that it is mentioned in black and white in the quran or in the sunnah four conditions before we can rebel some scholars added a fifth condition they said yes if the ruler we see him doing blatant coffer with evidences from the quran and sunnah to prove that this is comfort we do not rebel against them unless we know we can be victorious what's the point of sending 200 000 of our people to rebel and fight only to be annihilated in half an hour by the armed forces by the civil defense by the police forces by the national guard he's got the ul the heavy artillery when they don't have except knives and rocks this is killing themselves which is not permissible in islam so this is a an important aspect of the hakida that many of us don't know and i believe that many of us listening and watching this thing that i yeah i know it's hakida but i don't feel good about it and this is a dangerous thing because in my counseling sessions when i sit with people with ocd with intrusive thoughts of kuffer and violating their sanity with whispers of purity and impurity etc the first thing i say to them is are you don't waste my time i know you paid for your session but i'm gonna ask you straight forward question are you willing to follow the sharia or to follow your whims and desires everybody says of course sharia so i said then if i finish my half an hour with you and i clear all of your doubts and you find out that you're unable to implement it in your life then you should know that you refuse to follow the sharia and you decide to follow your own whims and desires and the whispers of shaytan because i made it clear for you so you have to be following the same path are you following sharia or are you following your own whims and desires is it just that you want to get rid of the muslim ruler and this is why if you go into social media the vast majority of people say all muslim rulers are kafir the ruler of this country is a kafir the ruler of this country is a puppet the ruler of this country is originally jew his grandmother is a jew he's this is that all of these are traits of the khawarij guys would you like to follow sharia or your whims and desires some of them would have the audacity to say well sheikh if shariah is what you're saying i'd rather follow my whims and desires such a person leaves the fold of islam because he doesn't want to follow the quran he wants to follow his own desires and this is where the khawarij come into existence they are not willing at all to budge or to follow the sharia they want to follow their own wins and desires and unfortunately we cannot do anything for them so if the ruler as you've stated is a tyrant is oppressive is everything what can we do well the sheikh says advice should be offered to the ruler with knowledge and wisdom so as to remove or at least lessen evil such advice should not be aimed to seek self-satisfaction or to show the ruler in a bad light so advice is inevitable but not everybody is qualified you have to have wisdom you have to have knowledge you have to select the right time if you go to the ruler in front of his ministers and his generals and you shout in his face saying fear allah allah would put you in hell because of all what you're doing it costs him only an extra bullet to get rid of you or to throw you for 20 30 years in prison for what you could have done it in hundreds of other ways that would have been acceptable and you would have done your duty so you have to use wisdom with knowledge the prophet said in an authentic hadith religion is sincere counsel adino so when the prophet says and we know that there are four pillars of hajj one of them is arafah the three if you don't make one of them your hajj is invalid so why does the prophet say that it's to indicate and highlight the importance of arafah when the prophet says assalam repentance is remorse and we know that remorse is one of the conditions of repentance not all of it it to highlight the importance of remorse likewise religion is advice so this is a prominent role of advice in our religion so the companion says okay sincere counsel advice to whom so prophet says said to them to allah his book the quran his messenger and to the leaders of the muslims and their common folk so this is what sincere advice should be given to and this is when you are sincere to allah azzawaj and this hadith i have explained it in detail alhamdulillah in the arab and you can find it on youtube um inshallah and you would know what is the meaning of whether it is advice or it is sincerity and where it is stemmed for etc now the sheikh goes on to say a scholar must not stay away from people's affairs without concerning himself with what sets their affairs on the right course so it is a duty or before that i think we've skipped a paragraph i apologize okay well actually there is um i skipped a paragraph before the hadith for the advice it is said it is not permissible i apologize it is not permissible to rebel against the leader or try to usurp his authority if he deals unfairly his unfairness should be tolerated with resignation resignation unless the he perpetrates some clear disbelief um may allah be pleased with her said the hadith and we read that hadith um okay and we finished that and we finished that and then advice should be offered okay this unfortunately um that's good that i have um the arabic text advice should be offered to the ruler with knowledge and wisdom so as to remove or lessen the evil uh such advice should not be aimed to seek self-satisfaction or show the ruler in bad light and we've read all uh of that but apparently those who translated the book dropped a paragraph and i'll paraphrase it from the arabic virgin it is not permissible to follow his shortcomings nor to expose his mistakes that belongs only to him and to broadcast his flaws sins and shortcomings rather he should be given advice privately between you and him and this is the same advice allah has given to musa and harun when he told them to go to pharaoh and to give him advice and to be gentle with him pharaoh to be gentle with him he is saying that i am your lord yet allah tells them to be gentle with them so what we see among the masses of exposing the muslim ruler showing his flaws shortcomings making fun of him this is not constructive this is destructive the shaykh says if the muslim ruler would legislate evil or something that is haram to the people and he spreads it out like if the muslim ruler for example um allows sins to be publicly performed and he endorses that and he protects it so the sheikh says if we know that between him and himself he's repenting and he is remorseful and he's trying to fix what he has broken then this is okay you as a scholar must go and speak to that imam and try to remind him of allah trying to give him counsel and advice so if he retreats alhamdulillah you've done your job as a scholar but if this is not possible if he doesn't accept advice if he doesn't allow people to give him advice or to meet people in this case a scholar becomes a duty upon him to show the people that this act is prohibited in islam and it is evil even if it was permitted by the muslim ruler this is the religion of allah a scholar is not a puppet he is not the ministry minister of information and says whatever the imam the ruler says he doesn't parrot what the ruler says a scholar job is to identify and to show the people without provoking the people against their muslim ruler because it's his duty upon them to advise them and this is the duty of his religion and their religion as well this is what was not found in the translation and we move on to a scholar must not stay away from people's affairs without concerning himself with what sets their affairs on the right course if he does not seek life's comforts so as to personally stay away from temptation then this is good and praiseworthy so if a scholar knows that if he indulges in worldly affairs that this will corrupt his heart so he decides to stay away not to work in corporates uh in the corporate world not to get closer to rich people so that he would not envy them or he just wants to be safe rather than sorry this is praiseworthy this is what scholars should do however if he does not concern himself with the people's affairs his attitude is not the right one see when i jahasem don't want to work in the corporate world anymore i've had it being a manager a general manager a director i don't want this anymore it's consuming my time my effort where i can do something better elsewhere this is my problem it's praiseworthy for me but if i go around and tell people why are you the ceo of this 500 largest company of business no no resign just go to the masjid occupy yourself with something useful this is not right and this attitude is wrong indeed a scholar should support whoever suffers injustice even if his support is merely offering what is very little when he cannot afford more why simply because if i manage to fix other people's worldly affairs help them in their jobs help them promote themselves this would add value to their religious commitment to allah because it's coming from a scholar so they can balance but if i put them down not allowing them to work in business or to progress or to develop this would have a negative impact on the religious practice the sheikh says he should seek help in order to feed the huma to feed the hungry even if it yields no more than a date a scholar has recognized authority and setting people's life on the right basis serves as a way to improve their religious attitude the prophet never aspired the prophet never aspired to any riches even when the treasures of the earth were available to him but he supported barilla the slave women woman who came asking for her freedom he supported bereal and others who were in need over the case of a few dinars even delivering a speech about the case so though the prophet sallam had all the ability to gather money to be wealthy it was praiseworthy that he did not choose that because he was a man of allah yet he never delayed or postponed helping others he would help barrier in paying off her debts he would help others even by dirhams and dinars paying off their debts going to their debtors and asking them to put down some of the debts he would make a hutba a speech in the masjid when he saw people with torn clothes from mudra asking the people to donate and to protect themselves from hellfire he used to go out of his way to help the muslims better their standard of life and this is praiseworthy a scholar for himself he may choose to stay away why don't you go and mix with the government with the prince with the authorities they like the way you talk and they would probably be inclined to do a lot of good because of you being with them no no no no i know if i go there and i see these persian carpets and these magnificent mansions that shaytan would control my head and want me to be like them and this is destruction i can't do that okay this is praiseworthy but now instead of sitting home doing nothing help others go and try to speak to this rich man to give donation to a school that teaches the quran speak to this influential person to give permits to an islamic magazine or a satellite channel try to cross the t's and dot the eyes in order to please allah azzawajal so uh with this we come to the conclusion of our um session and until we meet on thursday i leave it you"
