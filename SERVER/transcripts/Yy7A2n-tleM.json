  "transcript": "so this is a frequently asked question people who memorize the quran and they forget it is this sinful the answer is no because allah says don't burden us if we were to forget or to make an error forgetfulness is a human nature but forgetfulness that one is punished for is when you know the ruling and you don't abide by it this is what people would be punished over on the day of judgment for our signs came to you and you forgot it meaning you neglected it you did not implement it so you know that allah cursed those who deal in usury or interest in riba and he waged war against them as mentioned in chapter two yet you still do it this is neglecting and forgetting the verses you will be punished for that but if someone memorized it by heart and forgot it and cannot remember it but he's not dealing in ribba there is nothing uh a sinful on his side inshallah you"
