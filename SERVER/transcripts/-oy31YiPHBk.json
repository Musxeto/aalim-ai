  "transcript": "alhamdulillah wa salatu was-salam ala rasoolillah dear brothers and sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome to a new episode of contemporary v issues we have with us again in the studio she hassan bin luck man and Hakim share Hassan welcome music mellow Harun thank you for having me Wroclaw viacom Hossam is one of the well known colors and diet who has traveled extensively across the globe delivering lectures and Dawa to both Muslims and non-muslims alike she Hassan we know that killing or taking a soul is generally prohibited in all the major religions and is something of great concern and great evil that is going on where people are being killed unlawfully but what about things like euthanasia what is the Islamic ruling on euthanasia we'd like to discuss that issue with you in sha allah but first we'd like to just go to a report that we filmed with dr. sam Marawi here in egypt so let's just go to the report first inshallah and then we'll come back with your permission and can't discuss the issue just like a la jolla dungeon let's go to the report if an easier is taken from a Greek word hold good death that's to say if an easier is ending life is a practice of ending life in a painless manner it is done for patient whose cancer who has metastases all over and suffer from severe pain during the course of their diseases it's an easy a is correct voluntary or involuntary according to the patient can can is capable of giving a consent for himself to end his life in a painless manner or by one of his relatives if he is unable or on mechanical ventilation it is carried either actively or passively passively it just withholding medication or a machine that is very essential for the patient life actively by giving the patient drugs that facilitate ending his life in a painless manner there are many devices used in the issue of a Phoenicia like the sonnet role in which we use many drugs to induce a Phoenicia like giving the patient sleeping barbiturate like they saw the observe intent which is called here in Egypt in travell this induced sleeping to the patient then we give him a muscle relaxant as a pen chronium provide and then give him a lethal dose of potassium chloride which induce stopping the heart in SE story this is one of the methods we use in Asia the other one is called the method Rome or the mercy machine where the patient is connected to a mask this mask is supplied by carbon monoxide which induce hypoxia for the patient the other machine is called the deliverance machine it's like a computer that is connected to the patient and the bottom it asked the patient questions when the patient reply in a right way this machine delivered to the patient lethal dose of barbiturate which induced death to the patient Ethan Asia is legalized in some countries as Netherland in April 2002 and in Belgium in September 2002 some cities in the united states like Washington and Oregon also legalized the even easier here in Egypt and most of the Arabic countries it is not legalized I think that in France there is a debate about this issue and they are trying to legalize it but yet it's not utilized Sadam walaikum warrant allahi wa barakatu and welcome back shikharsen we just saw the report on euthanasia and the doctor Barak Lafitte was describing some very harsh and very shocking techniques that they use to really just kill people or patients who are in some cases terminally ill but what is the Islamic ruling on euthanasia what is what is Islam say about this man Rahim Hungary left behind I mean so long Ocilla Mubarak had a hobby he wore a suit I mean maybe Ana Muhammadan why the honey he was happy had remain in Islam it is forbidden to kill a soul especially to kill oneself suicide is not permitted in Islam and the origin of this is a hadith where in a battle between the Muslims and their enemies there was a Muslim soldier who was doing quite well in fighting the non-muslims the enemies and the Prophet are they saw - Salam so how his companions admired the way this man fights yet the Prophet said Ali so Sam he's in help and the Companions were astonished if this great great and brave warrior is in hell who's in heaven then so one of them volunteered and said I'll follow this man and know what would come of him because obviously a hundred other Sahaba they trusted the process time 100% and they knew that he was sincere and his revelation was from Allah so they said ok so they didn't say oh how could he be in hell it's rape because this is forbidden in Islam we have to know that everything the precise name came with its true so they said I'm gonna see why the process answered that and this is exactly what the companion did he said that the man fought bravely but just before the end of the the battle he was severely injured and it was so painful the man could not tolerate the pain so he put the edge of his sword to his chest and and leaned over it until it penetrated him and came out of his back committing suicide so the man went to the Prophet Alice asam and said I testified that you are the prophet and Messenger of Allah the man did so and so so he killed himself fleeing or trying to escape the great pain he is suffering not knowing that what awaits him at the sight of Allah is far greater of punishment than what he was suffering killing oneself is prohibited in Islam and what they call as suicide bombing is also prohibited in Islam and we've mentioned this before because it is killing yourself you're the one who is pushing the button you're the one who is detonating that bomb and killing yourself among others so you're the one who killed himself and a cornered accordingly whoever kills himself goes to hell and it is completely prohibited in Islam this is a verdict of Cheryl Bonnie Shipman bass Jacob Riis I mean and the major scholars of Islam prohibiting such procedures not to mention suicide bombing itself is indiscriminate it targets innocent and non innocent alike and it doesn't care if there's a child on board the bus or whatever wherever they detonate themselves yes everything to them is collateral damage but when it comes to their parents or to their loved ones then it's a different story they would not love anything to come to them but anyone else its collateral damages it's acceptable para Kofi come here shake so it's killing them completely prohibited in Islam in all cases no this is not indiscriminate killing is prohibited killing the non-muslims who are not fighting us is completely prohibited in Islam it's so prohibited that the Prophet RA so some settlers ever kills a non-muslim in a Muslim country or a non-muslim who has a treaty between us and them all other countries of the world whoever kills one will not have the fragrant or smell the fragrance of paradise I pray I fast I do all the things that Islam tells me to do and I would be deprived from entering paradise because because I killed this non-muslim the answer is yes you don't have the right to kill a non-muslim and the non-muslim that you're allowed to kill is only at Battlefield those who carry arms against us who want to invade our country who want to kill our people these are the people who are allowed to fight and this is legitimate in all religions of this earth going to the Muslims killing Muslims this is completely prohibited the prophet alayhi salatu salam Obama said that it is not permissible to shed the blood of a Muslim who bears witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped but Allah and that I am The Messenger of Allah except in 3 cases a married adulterer a soul for a soul or one who leaves the religion and splits from the damaja so these three as mentioned in the prophets hadith Allah so Sam and there are two more and these five it is permissible to shed their blood for the crimes they've committed but not for an individual or for vigilante to shed their blood and definitely not it is only for the ruler of that country after being bringing him into trial and convicting him then he has the right to do this sort of like capital punishment or which they have in some states they have the crime of treason we could say that leaving the religion is equal to treason in the States which is a capital punishment that is true and there are five types of people the apostate a Muslim that rejects Islam a married adulterer so a person who is married or was married once in his life and then he commits adultery he is to be executed and we have a soul for a soul so you kill someone you have to pay for that and fourthly a and it a person who terrorizes people well you know Esther's desire just to go back when you mentioned someone who killed somebody purposely not by accident definitely because if by accident he has to pay blood money but if he kills someone purposely then it is up to his family whether to take the blood money or to forgive him or to have him executed in custody right and the Bandit is a person who terrorizes people who steals their money who barricades the roads who terrorizes them intimidates them and maybe rape the women kill them all of this is considered to be an act that is punishable by death in Islam and finally a spy so any Muslim who spies to a non-muslim country and takes information to them and relays it to them he would be executed even if they still believe in Islam and even if they're only helping the non-muslims for a financial gain so they're not helping the non-muslims because they secretly believe that their way of life is better because in such a case the person would no longer be a Muslim but they're just helping them for some financial gains or whatever but in such a case the person would still be tried and if convicted executed we're not mixing between things that nullify Islam or things that require the death penalty it's a different issue but I'm talking generally speaking about the death penalty but as you've said if he's doing this out of his allegiance to the non-muslims then he's an apostate and he takes the same punishment pericle afikomen share inshallah will like to continue discussing this issue but right after the break Shalom alaikum warahmatu ly overhead you Oh [Music] so this is something that you have to point out to the to them in the Bible something which is I think very validated by the youth which is staying firm and the truth this is just one of the greatest examples for me of how to control your anger within the framework of being the cleanest religion the clearest jurisprudence and in the meantime the kindest religion to animals watch let's talk with Colleen I'm Annette as he interviews guests and discusses a variety of topics everything from youth issues to religious issues join us here on Rudy TV you assalamu alaikum Ketel she asked him just before the break we were discussing the issue of killing in Islam and when capital punishment can and must be established if the ruling party convicts and tries an individual now we briefly saw the doctor discussing the issue of euthanasia could you please define for us for those of us who don't know what is euthanasia well I believe the doctor did a very good job in defining euthanasia by saying that it is the good killing or the merciful killing in the sense this is a translation the rough translation we know that killing is killing it's horrible but in some countries they think that it's a form of mercy and that's why they call it mercy killing or the merciful killing because the patient is undergoing severe pains and it would be only fair that we relieve him of these pains by killing him and this concept itself is though it appears to be nice and merciful but it is not first of all because it goes against what allah almighty tells us to do secondly you can cascade this and the sky is the limit so I can go to Brazil for example and see the children and the kids on the streets who have no shelter and don't have any parents and I kill them when they're dying they're starving whether they're starving or not but but I know that they're gonna end up doing something wrong when they grow up so they don't have any future so and this was the acts of some of the policemen in Brazil for example they used to go on at night and kill as they killed stray animals and if you ask them they will say we're doing them a favor instead of them being on the streets and without a future and it goes and the sky is the limit so the intention though might look to be good but the actual action is against Islam so euthanasia can be divided into two main types either killing a person who cannot bear the pains he's going through he's deteriorating his Germany chronically and terminally ill he's going to die but he want to make this as soon as possible like the man you mentioned the hadith if you could just recap quickly for those of us the man who was injured during the battlefield during the battle and on the battlefield and he could not tolerate the pain so he committed suicide and despite his bravery he was still condemned to the Hellfire for committing suicide which is a major sin yes that's true also part of of euthanasia or part of this first part is deciding to terminate the pregnancy because of birth defect of the fetus even if it was like six or seven months old if it's going to be tripled if it's gonna be if it's gonna be have this defects in it - there's a certainty the child is gonna be born and suffer yeah well they say we terminate it and it is part of euthanasia the second part is unplugging the plugs so if the man is either suffering or he is considered to be brain-dead so you just stop his his life support whether it's medication or a or or that just take the you know unplug the machine yeah that runs the heart runs the lungs that cleans the blood etc so this is also considered to be part of you CNA Ethan Asia so are all these different forms Haram I mean let's say there's a family that has a financial problem and they have a sick father for example now he's in hospital he's been diagnosed by many doctors as terminally ill he's going to die it's just a matter of when there's no chance of his recovery and they're spending thousands and thousands on medication and on equipment just to basically keep him alive in a vegetable State now we're not saying that they go and stab him or they go and inject him with a lethal dose of any chemical that would instantly kill him but is it permissible for them to stop treatment if the patient is alive it is not permissible for them to do that but if he's in a very a t'v state if he's dead clinically mm-hmm but what's keeping him pumping is these machines then scholars say that it is permissible to take the plugs out what if they can't afford do they have to go and in the case where he's still alive but they can't afford the treatment they have to go it's an obligatory for them to borrow money from people and if they can't borrow money do they have to take out a loan if they can maintain his life they have to do all the means possible and Allah would not question them except on what they can deliver although I will not burn the soul with more than they can bear yes if he's alive in you can have the means to keep him alive and he's sound and he can hear you he can talk to you and he's alive you have to keep the machines running but you can only take the plug off when the brain is dead and a committee of trustworthy doctors come and say the brain is dead it's deteriorating there's no way back there's no way that he's going to be revived the brain is completely done only then the plot can be taken off but the man would not be considered dead until the heart and the lungs the breathing that is completely seized to work so the minute it is stated that the brain is dead and we take the plug off he's not dead yet the minute the heart and the lungs stop functioning then he's considered to be dead well we ask a lot to make our affairs easy and to help the Muslims who are going through this issue you mentioned briefly about abort abortion of fetuses before it's an actual child that are known or that are certain that that will develop into a child that has major defects or dysfunctions would aborting that fetus be considered permissible the scholars differ but the majority say if a committee of trustworthy doctors confirmed with evidence beyond doubt that the child would have these deficiencies and would have harmful birth defects and not minor ones but serious ones and it's gonna be painful and the child is gonna die after birth only awhile if this is the case and they're trustworthy and it's a committee and it is B for the age of four months before the spirit or the soul was breathed into the fetus scholars say it is permissible to abort the pregnancy but once the soul was breathed then once the child or the fetus is more than four months old no matter what is the status of the fetus the pregnancy has to go on and it's not permissible at all to abort the pregnancy what about a clinician you were mentioning before then the issue of capital punishment in the beginning of the episode so alhamdulillah that this issue of euthanasia for the most part is not practiced in most of the world and from what I've gathered in any of the Muslim countries but what about somebody or a Muslim for example who works as a doctor in a normal some country that practices this and actually does perform it and he were to be tried eventually let's say in an Islamic Courts what would his punishment be would he be charged with murder if he does that means that leads to the killing of a person then he is a murderer so if he's the one who takes a plug off and the the the the the patient is alive is still living or if he's the one who injects him with a lethal injection or gives him medication that kills him or escalates in his accelerates his death then he is considered to be the murderer regardless of whether or not the patient the manner that we mentioned in the issue of I believe it was insurance both parties agree to to the contract even if it's Haram then what's the harm if somebody agrees okay says I want you to kill me then they're agreeing to commit suicide because they're actually demanding it and they're requesting it and you're agreeing to kill them and murder them so you're both agreeing to Haram in a sense and yes and we have a difference in Islam between the person directing it and the person executing it so in terms of abortion for example if you recall we said that an aborted fetus if after four months age of four months old then they would have to give the blood money of five camels worth now if a woman goes to a doctor and tells him to operate so that she would the the pregnancy will be aborted mm-hmm who is responsible and who's the one who's supposed to pay this five camels worth mm-hmm the scholars say it's the doctor because though the mother ordered it the one who did the execution is the one accountable it's the final culprit yes of course they're both sinful but he's the one who's supposed to pay likewise in the case of the doctor even if the patient insists on the doctor killing him and the doctor does that then the it's a doctor who is the actual murderer and the patients obviously the patient can't be tried at that point but why he would definitely be tried well I was getting to but what the patient be considered have committed suicide yes he would because it is the right decision yes it was his decision barakallahu kamyshev we'd love to continue and discuss this issue but unfortunately we're just about out of time please join us again next week assalamualaikum warahmatullahi cancer you"
