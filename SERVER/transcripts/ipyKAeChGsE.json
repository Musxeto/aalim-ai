  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] um welcome back to our third episode of life's adornments i'm your host yousef karma we will be discussing the significance of child rearing its virtues and its response responsibilities and we have on our show with our our wonderful guest sheikh assam and lukman at hakim who's a professor at that academy and a knowledge international university he's also a teacher and a man for over 30 years we welcome our guests as an honor and privilege to have him i'm not a professor i'm a teacher so we would like to get in today talking about we talked about child rearing uh how to prepare for it beforehand i talked about how to choose a righteous spouse now once you have the child once you're preparing for the child to come in a child is present what are the steps you take how do you negotiate uh whose responsibility is it to raise you know child rearing you know how do you negotiate those lines before looking into the responsibilities it is important after the marriage has taken place that you prepare you you plan your strategy well yeah so this is an investment that you're about to have and in order to make your investment halal and successful there are a number of things that you should do among them which comes on the on the top of the list is dua and the dua is something that a muslim cannot exist without the true essence of your worshiping allah is to have this dua the prophet said supplicating to allah invoking allah is worship it's like saying not that it's only pillar but it's the most dominating pillar of all and likewise worshiping allah azzawajal is dependent and revolves around supplicating dua you find in the quran a great number of verses saying this dua it's the dua of the prophets and messengers to grant them a righteous offspring in surah al-furqan with the servants of al-rahman the most compassionate they say o lord grant us from our spouses and offspring a coolness of the eyes so even zechariah even all prophets of allah azza would ask for righteous offspring this means that you need to make dua before actually conceiving your wife conceiving and during her pregnancy you have to make dua of allah granting you a righteous child not only that but also in allah azza granting you a healthy child so if you have a health and this is what mother isha used to ask whenever she heard whenever she hears that someone had given birth before she asks whether it's a boy or a girl she asks is he in a good form is he complete or he has something wrong with him and if they say if he's okay she says and and prays to allah azza to and supplicate to allah azza for blessing of the child so this is something also you should make dua of that he's or she is a righteous child that he is or she is in a healthy uh fashion and manner and among the things that the scholars interpreted the ayah allah says oh you who believe ward off from yourselves and your family is a fire whose fuel is man and stones explained wording off or protecting your children and wives by saying that you have to teach them you have to up bring them in a most islamic fashion this is part of their protection and this also is manifested when you upbring your children at an early age because most of us learn this late so you find someone coming and complaining sheikh i'd like my child to pray but is stubborn he's disobedient how old is your child since he's 15. when did you start asking him to pray only last year you were late it was the prophet who said allah order your children to pray when they're 7 of age and spank them or beat them if they refuse to pray when they're ten which means that you just verbally order them for three years from there when they're seven till till 10. so you do the math five times a day 360 days a year multiplied by three years you get like three thousand four thousand times of telling him to pray without any force without reprimanding the child just instructing this is heart wash not brainwash so you will definitely after these three years will have this in his system in his routine now if he reaches 10 years of age and he still is stubborn then we have to refer to beating him regardless of what the non-muslims say this is his child's abuse the i'm not the prophet didn't say bring a bait a baseball bat and and hit the home run no he just told you to beat him and such beating does not leave a mark does not break a bone does not shed blood but it is important and essential in upbringing a good muslim child this is nothing related to what the disbelievers and the non-muslims say that this is inhumane and look at what such treatment to the children has a caused and produced drug addicts children uh indulging in sexual relationships when they're like in the 13s or 14 years of age consuming intoxicants etc all of this shows you how fragile their societies are while in the muslim community it's so strong and bonded that they themselves are shocked and astonished with the beauty of our community so yes it has to be put into the children from an early age because it's like planting a tree if you plant a tree not in the season of planting trees the tree will grow up weak and unstable and if you come late to upbring your child and you failed during the previous years of telling him about islam about allah about the quran about moral conduct about behaving then you will find it very difficult to achieve that yeah that's very significant i think as young you know children i know for myself as a young man that many of the things that i practice in my life today were things that my parents said to me so oftentimes you know we always as a team we always take the middle course you know not abusing children because many times you find people going overboard and physically abusing their children and also not verbally abusing them either so to encourage them to pray by way of going to give them to be a good reminders and then reprimanding them when when when there's need for rubber uh you know need for them to be reprimanded uh but i remember there's a story of a young man who after being born and raised muslim going to college and studying philosophy and these things he decided that he didn't want to be muslim anymore but when he was younger his parents would instill in him to always make salawat upon the prophet saws before he goes to bed so this day he decided i'm not going to be muslim anymore tomorrow i'm going to inform my family and for my friend and let everybody know that i'm going to leave islam so while he was going to bed he started to do his salawat subhanallah he thought what am i doing i'm not going to be muslim anymore why am i doing silhouette and in that process he thought if i'm not going to be muslim then that means that i'm going to say that the prophet sallam is a liar and his heart couldn't accept that in his mind he said my mind says one thing but my heart cannot accept to call this man that i love so much a liar so from nisa i'm going to rethink it and from there he started to learn uh you know you know he learned this and then he decided to remain muslim but it was just this little incident that his parents his mother taught him that saved his life and saved his donation it is what you water and irrigate the seed you put in the ground a similar story was told by i think muhammad the poet may allah have mercy on his soul that there was a person who was indulged in all types of sins so he used to sit with other folks and they drink intoxicants and until they're wasted one night he was there with his friends and he was totally wasted he was drunk and one of his companions was so he started slaughtering mother isha and accusing the wife of the prophet hassam the mother of the believer of adultery and he was insulting the prophet so this drunk man took off his shoe and went to beat this person insulting the prophet sallallahu salaam's wife and he's crying he's saying we drank wine we got wasted we committed so many sins but not the prophet this is something we cannot tolerate and of course they separated them and stopped him from beating him but that was the turning point in his life where he said oh god forgive me i've seen so many times but i can't tolerate this anymore and he quit alhamdulillah drinking and he started to practice islam from allah's beauty i think many times parents focus on putting fear in the hearts of their children but also help is so important as well and that's something that's long-lasting as you said this man was an alcoholic drinking but his heart could not accept because of the love of the prophet well inshallah to allah we're going to pause here for our break but we're going to return back insha allah to talk about the shared responsibilities how are they negotiated and how do we further uh invest in the process of teaching viewers stay tuned we'll be right back until we get back to allah [Music] welcome back to our second portion of life's adornments where we discuss today uh tarbia for the child how to invest in them in a very early age we talked about dua now we would like to talk about who is responsible for the child bringing how to negotiate the boundaries who takes what responsibilities and help inside the house and outside of the house well this is a big problem in most households because by nature we do not like to assume responsibility so when things go right everybody likes to hold the torch and say this is me i've done this it's a sign of my success but if things go south when things go wrong this is when pointing a finger becomes a a sad reality so the father usually blames the mother it's your mistake you're the one who did this and that and the mother blames the father it's you've been out of the house all the time you've never assumed your responsibility it is a teamwork a man cannot have a child on his own a woman cannot conceive on her own and as they say it takes two to tango with nasheed islamic nasheed not music of course and with your spouse not with someone else so you need you need two and a family is composed of two and this is a responsibility shared by both now to be fair a man has responsibilities but his greater responsibility would be to financially provide for his family including his children and providing for his family financially means that he has to look for halal income because the prophet said any flesh that grows out of haram out of prohibited unlawful wealth fire is more worthy of such flesh so it was reported that the women the wives of the companions whenever their companions wanted to set off early morning to look for income for wealth whether through farming or trading or whatever they used to remind their husbands and say fear allah in us we can tolerate hunger but we cannot tolerate hellfire so do your best to give us and bring us halal provision so this is a great responsibility upon the parent the father and this is mentioned in the quran when it comes in in chapter two surat al-baqarah that the one who was blessed with a child the husband is responsible for providing for his children he's even responsible for suckling the child if the mother refuses imagine your wife gives birth to a child her son and your son and she says i don't want to breastfeed him nothing in islam says that you're the mother is an obligation upon you no it is the obligation of the father the husband what do you mean should i go and get a milk bottle or what it's none of my business either you hire a what do you call it a nursing mom and she breast feeds the child or you do whatever it needs it's your responsibility the mother is not responsible she gave birth that's it and a lot of the people would not know this by the way but this is islam it's the man's duty to finance everything that goes into his house this doesn't mean that it ends on providing money it also he's responsible in naming the child and disciplining the child because so many times mothers do not have the same influence as the father i remember when i hear every single failure every single morning my wife waking up the children for prayer she spends half an hour and she repeatedly says wake up wake up it's fajr it's going to be sunrise come on fear allah remember allah they're dead the minute i come in and said boy or girl get up it's fajr europe so a man's interference and role is also needed yet the mother has a great responsibility in bringing up her children because she is 24 7 with them the father is out working the father is in the house working he wouldn't have enough time he has hints to give here and there and sometimes interferes but most of the work most of the burden is on the shoulders of the mother so it's it's mutual but different uh roles for each one sure we read that from the biography of imam jawani that his father masha allah is a righteous man and when he was choosing his wife he chose a righteous woman and he told her when she was uh giving birth to imam jawaini that don't let anybody breastfeed my son but you i don't want him to drink any milk that's not the you know the the milk that you're going to provide i know was hot out because i provided food and then one day she got really sick so she allowed someone else to breastfeed him and it was mentioned that he pressed the milk outside of imam duane's stomach because he didn't want his son to drink yeah but you see these stories though they have a moral point behind it i personally have my reservations the best of allah's creation is prophet muhammed and we know that he was given for the first four years or five years of his life to halima to upbring him to breastfeed him so his mother did not feed him she did not uh breast fed uh feed him for his entire life the first two years and still he remained with halima and her family until she was like four or five uh he was four or five or six years of age when he went back to the custody of his grandfather after the death of his mother so did this negatively impact the prophet islam of course not so to even try to make a child throw out the breast uh the the milk that he has suckled from a woman because of that reason this is i think overboard extreme and allah knows best but these again these are stories they're not uh the doings of a companion they're not the doing of a prophet and even that we don't know the authenticity whether it's true or just one of them tales that people would like to uh uh include in their books sure along the lines we're talking about now uh tarubia versus da'wah so what where do we find the middle course and given a child tarabiya versus a given dawah as we uh discussed briefly many times people will give dhawa as like preachers teachers outside of the house so our frame of mind is that calling other people outside of our family is considered da'wah and we spend many much of our time working with people outside of the house and then by the time we come home it's we're too tired there's not a lot of effort so what is the conception of dawah with inside the four walls of your own home the prophet alaihis salahu-salaam says will be mental begin with yourself and those whom you are responsible for this is in financial expenditure don't give to others and starve and make your children starve you have to fulfill your own needs and your children needs as a priority and he also says and this means that it is sufficient for a person to be sinful and this is the minimal type of sin is to waste those whom you are responsible for uh providing which means you cannot be a good carpenter when your door can't be locked properly you should start with your own door and fixing it likewise people think that dawa is limited in a tv program or a post you write on social media or in a lecture you give and deliver in a masjid or in something that is related to the masses and they forget and neglect that their priority should be to the children i've seen a lot of and i know a lot of people who work in quran circles so they run quran circles they have students of their own who run schools who do one of the sisters called me complaining about her husband who runs an islamic school and neglects his own children never teaches them an ayah though he teaches strangers and foreigners the quran never takes the children to school never does anything to ensure that his children are brought up in an islamic way definitely there is a grave and serious error in that individual so it is the greatest form of dawah that which you devote and dedicate to your own offspring to ensure that your legacy continues and they become imams of the team insha allah as the prophet said the best of you are those who are the best of their families and i'm the best in my family true so that we can take from this that we should all start with ourselves and focus on our families before moving out okay uh and insha'allah by way of rectifying our families we can then rectify society inshallah to allah uh with that being said this will close our program today thank you so much for your wisdom for your immense knowledge bless you and increase you uh for our viewers thank you for joining us until next time [Music] to [Music]"
