  "transcript": "he says what's the ruling on trading in counterfeit brand names products so I know that a Prada bag costs like fifteen thousand reals I can sell it for two hundred reals counterfeit Chinese excellent first grade second grade third grade I know that I can buy a Rolex for 65 to 80 thousand reals and I can get a counterfeit replica exact features for 600 700 reals so what's the ruling on trading in these it is not permissible to sell something that is like that first of all because the copyright is being violated secondly you are trespassing on people's rights thirdly when you do not tell the people that these are counterfeits even if they know by violating the rights of others taking their brand taking their design take it then their name as well if you take a Prada and call it Pradhan for example is it no problem even if you copy the design there is no problem in your country it's okay but to claim that this is real and frankly speaking I am shocked by those who go and buy counterfeit when you buy something that's counterfeit who are you fooling so everybody thinks that this is a Rolex wow they look at it and they're shocked and astonished okay if they are impressed by it how do you go to bed at night knowing that you are a fake nobody buys counterfeit and wants to gain people's admiration out of it except a true fake so if you don't have it if you can't afford it don't waste your time why did I other thing selling it and buying it this is not permissible in my opinion"
