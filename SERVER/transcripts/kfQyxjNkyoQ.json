  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] for. Alhamdulillah. Dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this program, this New episode of selecting the beautiful fruits of what our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said regarding the purity of the heart. It's selected from 40 hadiths that was compiled on this topic. And as we know our prophetat wasam was given the concise of speech. So few words have great profound meaning words that you can't you can count on your hand yet they have deep meanings included in them. The hadith at hand was narrated by Abdah, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father. He said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to seek refuge in Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and he used to say oh Allah I seek refuge in you from a heart that is not submissive that is not humbled from a supplication that is not answered that is not heard from a soul that does not have enough and from knowledge that does not benefit. I seek refuge in you from these four. The prophetat wasam started with the heart. I seek refuge in you from a heart that is not submissive, that is not humbled. Because if the heart is healthy and fixed then the whole body all our limbs would be healthy and fixed and this is why the prophetat wasam sought refuge in Allah from an illness that may affect it because if it's affecting the heart then your righteousness and good deeds would be also also affected and this is when the heart is not submissive when it's not humble. I seek refuge on you from a heart that is not submissive. A heart that is not submissive that does not have is a hard sick heart. It is a heart that does not feel humbled when Allah is remembered. when it listens to Allah's words, when it's reminded, unlike a heart that is healthy, a heart that is soft, a heart that is calm and submissive with the remembrance of allahel. A shani may Allah have mercy on his soul says the prophet sought refuge in Allah from a heart that is not submissive because when a heart is not submissive it becomes hard no reminder no advice no reprimanding or intimidation or even reminding it of what awaits for it with allahel in paradise would benefit It such a heart is a hard sick heart. Abu Da may Allah be pleased with him said seek refuge in Allah from the submissiveness of hypocrisy. His students ask what is the submissiveness of hypocrisy? Abu Da answered to see the body submissive with while the heart is not attentive is not in that case of submissiveness. May Allah have mercy on his soul. Says, \"No servant of Allah has been struck with a punishment harder than having his heart hardened and stiff or to be further away from Allahawel.\" And the furthest hearts from Allah is the hard heart. As when the body is sick, no food or drink would have any taste or benefit to it. Likewise, the heart when it is sick with desires and with doubts, no reminders would ever benefit it because it is sealed. It cannot hear. And this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran when he said, And when Allah is mentioned alone, the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter shrink with a virgin. But when those worshiped other than him are mentioned, immediately they rejoice. The heart falls sick as well as the body falls sick. And the healing of the heart is in repentance and blocking the means of anything that would tarnish it or would hurt it. So when the heart is submissive, the limbs are submissive as well and they fall in line to worship Allahawel. says, \"A man once was seen to be sort of joining his shoulders and body and concaving upon himself like those who try to look in a state of kushure.\" And he was addressed by the scholars, my friend, submissiveness is here in the heart, not here in the shoulders. So when you see people walking like this and they're as if they're weak and sick and they tend to show that they are righteous and pious, but their actions, what they say is different than what they behave. This is the submissiveness of hypocrisy. May Allah have mercy on his soul says at those who preceded us the used to hate when a man shows more than what is actually in his heart. This is pretending and this is not a good sign. May Allah be pleased with him. The companion of the prophetam said the first thing you would lose from your dean is and the last thing the last final strike that you would lose from your dean is prayer. And so many people who pray there is no good in them. And soon you shall enter a masjid and you would see the congregation and not find a single person who is inure. And this is really scary. When we look at the people in the masid, including us, of course, how they move, how they behave, how they're heedless and oblivious. Ask many of them, what did the imam recite? I don't remember. And the movement they have in the salat, it shows you that they do not have this case of Then the prophet says, \"And I seek refuge in you, oh Allah, from a supplication that is not heard.\" What is the meaning of a supplication that is not heard when Allah actually hears everything? So how is a supplication is not heard? You remember in salat when we rise from what do we say? We say Allah listens to those who praise him. Doesn't he listen to others? Allah hears everything. Well, listen here means Allah responds and answers those who praise him. So when the prophet seeks refuge in Allah from a supplication that is not heard, he means that it is not listened to. It is not answered. And why would a supplication not be answered? Because it means that there are things that block your supplication such as consuming haram, earning haram, sins, transgression, the heart being heedless as we've mentioned in previous episode, not being attentive, not being obedient, and many many other reasons where the supplication is blocked, your dua is blocked. So when the prophet is seeking refuge in Allah from a dua that is not answered meaning from causing the dua not to be answered such as the reasons we've mentioned earlier. Then he says and from a soul that never has enough that is never satisfied. And this is referring to those who who are indulged in dunya. All what they care about is hoarding, collecting, gaining money. Halal haram. No one cares. We just want to be rich. We want to be influential. And such a soul usually does not care about the hereafter. does not care about forms of worship and how to get closer to Allahawel and how to protect itself from hellfire. Gaining more money is not haram. It's not discouraged. But when it come becomes a priority, as we mentioned last episode, when it becomes your goal, then this is what you should be afraid of. Then the prophet sought refuge in Allah. He sought refuge in Allah from knowledge that is not beneficial. Alhamd may Allah have mercy on his soul said such as sorcery. This is knowledge but it is not beneficial. It is harmful. And likewise other sciences, other knowledge that is harmful in your religion or in this dunya. Shukani says the prophet sought refuge from knowledge that is not beneficial because it will backfire on its owner and it will be an evidence upon him on the day of judgment. So basically knowledge that is not beneficial is divided into two types. One knowledge that is not beneficial in itself and that would be extremely harmful such as philosophy or calam such as sorcery such as music and the arts and acting and the likes. This is knowledge of course and it requires a lot of work but it is harmful in itself and it would lead the one who learns it to hellfire because Allah has prohibited it. The second type of knowledge that is not beneficial is knowledge that is beneficial in itself but due to the fact that the one who's learning it is not benefiting from it because he's not walking the talk or he's doing something against it or he is learning it with the intention of seeking dunya then this would not be knowledge that has benefit such as learning the Quran. Whoa. Knowledge that is not beneficial is the Quran. Yes. If you intend by learning it that people would point at you and say he's a he's a or they would give you money so that you could teach them and this is the only reason you've learned it. If you found something more beneficial, you would have gone and left it. such as beneficial knowledge people learn from the Sharia but they don't pray they don't fast though they know the knowledge they know the evidences backing it they know that reba is haram yet they go and buy houses in mortgage not only that they give fatwa to people the first house is fine it's on the house second house no it's haram This is knowledge that is not beneficial and they will pay dearly for that. May Allah protect us. Then the prophet said, \"And I seek refuge in you from these four.\" Why? To emphasize that these four are dangerous. And that's why he repeated seeking refuge in Allah from them. From this hadith we learn that the prophetat wasam had a very soft heart and that he was afraid of anything that would harm him his iman his heart his relationship and connection with Allah and what would hurt his ummah. Likewise, that is why he taught us these beautiful supplications, these dua, so that we would open our eyes and see, whoa, is my heart submissive? Is my supplication heard and answered? Do I have a soul that never has enough? Is the knowledge that I possess beneficial or not beneficial? And we have to seek refuge in Allah so that Allah would protect us."
