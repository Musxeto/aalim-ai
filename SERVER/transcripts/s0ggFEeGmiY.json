  "transcript": "brother aemond from the Emirates asked about giving the cat more than what is actually do so for example I have 40,000 euros my zakat is 1,000 but I miscalculated it and I paid 2000 so after giving it to the poor a month or two later and I made my calculations again is wow I paid one thousand extra hmm no problem the thousand extra I will make it deductible from next year zakah is this valid answer is no it was given out and the 1000 euro is a cat the extra 1000 will be charity for you you cannot count it from next year's zakat"
