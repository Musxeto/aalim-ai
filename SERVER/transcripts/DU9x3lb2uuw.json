  "title": "Are humans the best of Allah's creations / Ashraful Makhluqat? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is it true that humankind is the best of Allah's creations meaning this is an issue of dispute the scholars have debated upon it long ago with the exception of the Prophet Muhammad so we acknowledge that the majority say that he is the best of Allah's creation but then when it comes to messages and Prophets and angels or humans and angels there is a dispute among Scholars which is which it's a long debate each one has his own opinion and evidence is that back his opinion nevertheless it is not an issue to waste our times in because this is not something that Allah would ask us about on the day of judgment and it would not increase our Iman or get us closer to Allah to know whether we are ashram we are the best of Allah's creation or not What would make a difference is whether we are complying with what Allah has instructed us to do and refraining from what Allah has prohibited us from doing or not this is the acid test this what makes you or breaks you if you manage to fulfill Allah's commands as instructed and ordered you will be in paradise and you will be better than anyone else but if you fail then how could you be compared as an individual to those who were created Created from light and who had spent their entire life praising Allah glorifying him and never ever committing a single sin or disobeying him logically this is not possible and no one can say that oh Angels don't have free will so they are just doing what they're told without the ability to sin this is not true the humans the Jinn and the angels have a freedom of choice but they chose not to disobey Allah and Allah granted them this choice so we have to be realistic what benefits us and we would we should act upon that instead of asking such questions and Allah Knows Best"
