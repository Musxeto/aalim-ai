  "title": "If a person intends to do haram but doesn't (due to obstacles) will he be sinful? Assim Al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is recently I read and I understood the Hadith of the two men's fighting with the sword um and so the conclusion is if somebody has a strong desire to do something strong intention and he almost does it but he doesn't he gets taught by something that is not the fear of Allah he has the same punishment so my question is uh for somebody who does something like this for example he goes to a house of a woman to do something with her as Haram and then he gets stopped because she's not home is the punishment or is he the guy seen as somebody who has committed so Zinda with her even though he has not uh you know physically done that because he got stabbed she wasn't home and he's never done it after and for this guy is a repentance just to rakas of and all the conditions are fulfilled Etc with the conditions and then or does he have to do something special and so basically brother abdullah's question is about the intention whether it's firm to do a sin or not because we have what seems to be conflicting evidences one says whoever intends to do a sin and he does not do it there is no sin recorded against him and Allah will record a good deed for him so this in comparison to when two Muslims meet with their swords both of them the murderer and the killed the victim are in hell so this companion said okay the murderer we know he's in hell because he's a perpetrator what about the man who was killed the prophet said he was keen on killing his friend or brother or the one who he was fighting but he could not do it so he died he lost so now we have two seemingly conflicting evidences and there's no conflict alhamdulillah the intention of doing a sin and refraining from doing it is a good deed the prophet said Allah Almighty has forgiven my um for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that come to their minds as long as they do not talk about it nor act upon it so the one who intended to make him ascendant he refrained without talking to anybody about it nor acting upon it this is Forgiven and he will be granted a good deed unlike the one who was actually fighting with the sword he intended it the firm intention is his heart to do it but he was and he was prevented due to conditions not within his reach in this case no he will be sinful and I'll give you a final coat of the Hadith the prophet Allah said this world belongs to four people one Allah blessed him with lots of wealth and lots of knowledge so he acts upon his knowledge and he squanders his money in the ways of Allah the second person is a person whom Allah has given him knowledge but no wealth so he says to himself if I had money I would have done with the money what the first man does so his firm intention is if Allah would have blessed him with money he would have squandered it in means of that please Allah azzawajal the third person is a person whom Allah did not give knowledge but gave him wealth so he squanders his wealth in Haram means and he goes clubbing and consumes can toxicants and deals with riba and buys Haram things so he lives a lavish life and he's ignorant of Allah he doesn't worship Allah azzawajal the fourth one the last one someone whom Allah has not given wealth nor knowledge and he says Ah if I were like this millionaire who spends in lavish lifestyle and Haram things I would have done exactly the same thing the prophet says they the last two are in the same level of sin exactly like the first two the one with the knowledge and wealth and the one with the knowledge and no wealth are in the same level of Good Deeds though the poor one does not have money but due to his intention Allah granted him the same level and that fourth person due to his ignorance and intention of doing sins Allah granted him the same level of sins and Allah Knows Best"
