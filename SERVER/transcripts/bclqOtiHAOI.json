  "title": "Moon sighting and the start of Ramadan - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Asaph's second question was about moon sighting this is an issue of dispute among scholars to cut a long story short the most authentic opinion as in accordance to the hadith of in advance may Allah be pleased with him and with his father where people in Mecca fasted differently to the place of Halawa in a sham at the time of mahalia evening ABI Sufyan may allah be pleased with him and with his father and there was a difference of one day due to different moon sighting yet even a basmala peace with him stated that this is the Sunnah meaning that each region has its own sighting so islamically the people in Japan must have their own moon sighting sighting the Crescent the people of Malaysia and Indonesia the people of India the people of the GCC countries the Gulf the people of Syria Iraq the people of Egypt the people of North Africa etc they all have to have their own sightings and there will be a difference of a day maybe two but this is normal it will all come back to normal when the following months continue and follow some say that we have to have a global moon sighting so it's one day for all and this is wrong because prayer times are not the same so when it's moderate in Saudi Arabia it is midnight in India and it is fair probably in Hawaii or somewhere else so the timings are different and likewise the moon sighting is different if you are in a Muslim country the Muslim ruler decides whether tomorrow is Ramadan or not weather tomorrow is the day of eight or not and he should do this according to the moon sighting but as he is the Muslim ruler and he has the authority if he decides to go through calculations and neglect the moon sighting and imposes this upon his congregation upon his citizens upon his country then they must obey Him and they must fast when he tells him that tomorrow is Ramadan and they must break their fast when he tells them that tomorrow is eight and this is the most authentic opinion for you guys in India there isn't a Muslim country there isn't a Muslim court but you you must see this is the problem of Muslims they're never united and each faction has its own Imam or leader and it is different parties each one has their own congregation and they may consider the others to be kafir or to be innovated in people of innovation and they might be but we lack unity and this is a big problem the Muslims have to unite so meanwhile if you have a regional Islamic Centre or a judicial authority for the Muslims who are Muslims and they tell you that tomorrow is the first of Ramadan you have to comply and follow them instead of each one saying no no no I'm going to sight the moon and my Ramadan is different than yours because you did not cite it so no this is not the way to go about it and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
