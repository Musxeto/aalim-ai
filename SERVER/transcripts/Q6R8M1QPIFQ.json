  "title": "Gave dawah to taxi driver who had music on, he didn't listen, did I do something wrong Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so zenith dean from the uk he got into a vehicle and the driver who is a muslim was playing music so he gave him advice and explained to him the verses of the quran and the hadiths and the the guy simply did not listen did not comply so he's asking had i done anything wrong the answer is no you did not do anything wrong you did what allah told you to do that is to forbid evil and to advise people however we have to be aware that your fingers are not the same length so not everyone who's called muslim is a practicing muslim there are muslims who are deviant they are muslims who are sinful there are muslim who are negligent they are muslims who are arrogant would not accept anything coming from someone your age or someone who they think less off so you did your duty and you should not expect praise or appreciation other from allah azza because whenever you start to react negatively when someone does not listen to your preaching this means that you're not doing the preaching for the sake of allah rather you're doing it for the sake of yourself or for fame and this is dangerous yeah"
