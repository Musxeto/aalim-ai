  "transcript": "I was wondering about the event event that took place when Hamas attacked Israel this is something that we do not talk about generally in public because any person with intellect and two eyes and ears knows that the Muslims in Palestine have been oppressed killed displaced tortured imprisoned their land confiscated kicked from their own lands that they've been living for thousands of years since 1948 so you do not expect someone who's oppressed to clap and say good job keep up the good work anyone who's being oppressed even if you oppress a an animal it will fight back so there is no reason for the the the occupiers and those transgressors those villains those murderers who occupied Muslim lands to come and play the victim they're not the victim therefore we refer to whatever is happening as a genocide whatever is happening to the Muslims in Palestine at the moment is a clear genocide no one defends it except a a criminal of War who is assisting criminals may Allah protect us all"
