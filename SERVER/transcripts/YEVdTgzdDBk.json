  "transcript": "uh my colleague asked me a question uh it's about an action that is not good for a Muslim to be involved so he says he's married he is the father of three children and he has a girlfriend and now she says that she's pregnant and wants to keep the baby so uh what do you recommend sh first of all this person has committed one of the heinous major sins in Islam which is adultery we know that fornication when a person is not married is punished in Islam if convicted if he confesses or caught red-handed by the testimony of four Muslim male Witnesses his punishment is to be flogged 100 lashes while adultery which is an act committed by someone who is or was previously married is to be stoned until he dies so he committed one of the heinous major sins in Islam now that his mistress and his partner in sin is pregnant he wants her to abort while she wants to keep it he has no right in asking her to abort because she's the one responsible for it with him and she's the one who's going to bear the consequences of having this child does he have anything to do with the child definitely not because this was the result of wedlock of Zena and hence it is not attributed to him as per the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam where he said the child resulting from woodlock belongs to the bed meaning the owner of the bed the husband of the woman her master Etc and the adulterer gets nothing other than the stone he has no relationship no rights nor responsibilities toward this pregnancy may Allah forgive our all sins"
