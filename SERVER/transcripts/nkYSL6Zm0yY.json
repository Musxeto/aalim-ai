  "transcript": "and we're still studying and talking and elaborating on the most important basic aspect of islam and that is to heed and as i've mentioned earlier many people unfortunately get irritated when we talk about to hate not because they don't love allah audible of course every muslim loves allah and if you don't love allah you're not a muslim you can't be a muslim you can be a human being if you don't love allah almighty who created you who provided you with everything you have who gives you the ability to breathe live walk talk eat and drink and do everything you're doing without him facilitating this none of it would have been possible who dares not to love allah but people may be irritated when the concept of tawheed is mentioned due to their ignorance or their arrogance to hate without any doubt among muslims is the first thing we are ordered to do we as muslims are ordered to believe in the oneness of allah and to devote all our worships to allah and to acknowledge allah with his beautiful names and attributes no muslim doubts this it's overwhelmingly mentioned in the quran and the prophet prophet sunnah alayhi salat and teachings so what was the first thing that the prophet assad used to send the messengers all over arabia to call people to tell hate the hadith of jeb and may allah be pleased with him he said to him let it be the first thing you call them to is the oneness of allah and allah as mentioned say al-bukhari focused only on tahit and why is that because this is the essence of all messages of prophets and messengers of allah allah says and we sent not before you any messenger except that we reveal to him that there is no deity except me so worship me that's it this is the first topic the most important topic that all prophets and messengers were sent with yet many people are irritated by this and they don't like the concept of their hate they don't feel at ease when we mention to hate and you can see this in their faces whether they are from the deviant sects or from any other cult in islam and many of them say we have to unite the hearts we must avoid every anything that divides the people and subhanallah this is exactly what the idol worshipers used to object to islam they say islam separates a man from his wife a father from his son a brother from his siblings so islam divides and separates we want something that unites and those who pose or are irritated by the hate use the same logic this is not valid you cannot unite with people who do not abide by the tawheed who do not share your values and convictions that's why when we find people always trying to do this so the only thing that unites them is the prayer in the masjid putting them in swag wearing a short though going out for dawah this is what unites us okay let's talk about issues of dispute among scholars that are necessary to our religion when to pray asar how to pray and put your hand on your chest or under your belly button whether to enforce and call for righteousness and virtue and forbid evil advice or not they said no no don't do any of this this would disunite the muslims and cause enmity and hatred we don't want this and you end up having a political party that you would find bearded mawlana's in masha'allah with the turban and they're joining hands with hindus and christians and jews and raphaela and super sufis what are you doing he said we're uniting this is not the message of the prophet and that's for certain because this goes against the hate some other sects focus only on the islamic government so their whole primary objective is not to hate it's hakimiya it is to legislate only through the sharia which is a valid cause definitely and it's part of islam it's part of tahit but it is not tauhid alone and some of them due to this objective went again to the same issue of uniting so in order to join the parliament we have to cut some loose ends we have to compromise a little the beard is too long it's not representable we have to trim it the hijab is covering a lot we have to compromise maybe show some hair maybe show the whole hair i'm covering my bosoms and that's the most important thing and you find that people are diluting their religion to become another religion all what they care about is to have the government to have the power and we've seen what the pursue of such a government led many countries to end up in chaos poverty lack of security and for what to have an islamic government yes this is a legitimate reason but you can't have it without cementing without setting the foundation through tawheed 13 years alas assam spent in mecca he never ever asked them to form a government or to ask for power nor even to fight defending themselves because they were a minority they were weak and now we see what's happening on the arena when you abandon to hate people would come up with allegations that we have to compromise we have to let go some of the old guard schools so we have to let go of some of our beliefs and convictions time changes and this is not true would you ever shake hands with someone who raped your sister or mother would you join forces would you sit with them on the same table with a big smile on your face hugging them kissing them taking selfies of course not you won't be a man you won't have a spine let alone be a muslim if you do such a thing nowadays people are doing worse we've seen muslims so called quote unquote given condolences to the israelis whenever an israeli or two are killed regardless if this is a terrorist attack or not regardless how you look at it when you give your condolences to the enemy who occupied your land who kicked your muslim fellow and raped your sisters and mothers and nobody dared to say a word nobody gave their condolences for what they had done the crimes they had done yet when one or two israelis are killed whether a person was defending himself or not we get so quote unquote muslims giving their condolences condemning such attacks and turning a blind eye to all the atrocities that are happening to their muslim brothers where is the heat there's nothing i still hate and if you ask these people most likely they would reject islam but they still keep a muslim name muhammad ahmed why they have no problem in shaking hands and kissing and embracing and maybe going to somewhere else with the enemy may allah protect us all so all of this shows us that to heed that the messengers were sent with is not being practiced and people are neglecting it as long as they neglect it there's no prosperity and no victory there will be no success for the umm until they go back to the basics until they abide by the tawhid why so hate has a lot of advantages first because allah ordained it second because all the messengers preached it thirdly because with tawheed allah azzawajal he raises sins and this is our main and primary objective on this earth to erase things to gain good deeds to end up in paradise allah says in the hadith o son of adam were you to come to me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face me ascribing no partner to me that is tahit i would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it even if you kill if you steal if you lie as long as you come to allah with pure tau heed and pure hate would rectify all of these sins will make you repent will make you ask for forgiveness will fill your heart with remorse tawheed is the first thing you asked about in your grave imagine those sitting in the parliament of this so-called government and they're sitting with other religions and feeling cozy about it and having no problem with them having no issues with passing a law that allows selling alcohol or legislating prostitution in the in the land they have no problem in signing it the first thing they'll be asked on the day of judgment is the heat the three questions who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you do you think that they'll be able to answer no even if they have long beards and big turbans and they call themselves mawlana or mufti they will not because they did not live until heat hence they will not be dying on it or succeeding in answering the questions about it allah says in the quran allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life and the hereafter and allah sends astray the wrong doers and allah does what he wills to stay firm in this word world which is in your life in your grave when you're asked this is only given to those who had lived until heed and if you manage to live until heat you will die until heat and if you die until heat you you'll end up in paradise allah says indeed he who associates others with allah allah has forbidden him paradise and his refuge is the fire and there are not for the wrong doers any helpers there is no possibility for other than people without hate to enter paradise there's no way those who associate others with allah those who ascribe a son or a wife or associates to allah will never be admitted to paradise the paradise is not mine it's allah and these are allah's words worship him alone only believe that he is worthy of being worshipped then you will be able to enter jannah otherwise you have no hope this is why it is important to have to hate this is why you have to cleanse people's conviction and beliefs before moving forward to anywhere because this is what counts at the side of allah azzawajal if you fail in promoting to hate calling people to hate making this your main objective then you're not on the right straight path you have to call for the heat even if you get looks of resentment even if you get critiques even if people ridicule you it's not what the people want it's not a show where people call and say i'd like to listen to this song or watch this clip and he said okay some out there giving dawah this is what they want it's a survey what do the people want okay you want to talk about the controversy of the quran you want to talk about the authenticity of hadith you want to talk about the reliability of aquida we can do that subhanallah this is what they are looking for number of followers are they acknowledging me as a sheikh are they acknowledging me as a celebrity a professor an academic or not this is my main objective this is not what a muslim should look for this is not what the messengers and the prophets used to do they would only preach tawheed so the one million kuwaiti dinar question would be where do we get to heat from our sources of knowledge is not through inspiration is not through our peers or our mawlana it's not through jinn our only source of akida our only source of tawheed is through the quran and the sunnah understood by the understanding of the three favorite generations whom the prophet said alaihi salah and he doesn't say anything haphazardly this is a revelation he said alaihis allah the best of generations is my generation that is the companions and those who follow them that is the taberine and those who follow them and those are tabitha bean so to understand the quran and the sunnah through their understanding you would be following the footsteps of the best three generations ever given to mankind which means that the basics in our religion is to abide by the quran the sunnah and this is what we will be talking about in sha allah in coming episodes the importance of the quran how it is the last revelation its miraculous preservation and how the enemies of islam are trying to disseminate that and to undermine that"
