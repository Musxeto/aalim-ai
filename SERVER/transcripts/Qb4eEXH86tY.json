  "title": "Where is the Najd today that's mentioned in the hadith, does it refer to Wahabism? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "avoir or Afzal says could you explain to me about NetID and when the Sahaba asked the Prophet racism about our nejd he said that the horns will appear from there please explain that means Salafism and Wahhabism is that right and refute Iraq being nudged first of all this is an issue if you read the books of all the scholars from the time of the Companions until recently 200 or 300 years ago you'll find no reference none whatsoever to the Najd that people talk about today why is that see gnashed in arabic means a high place so hey jazz Mac and Medina has gnashed relock has gnashed all these places has nudge to them which is an area that is a hill or something that has a higher elevation than them so this is called gnashed now we would like to understand is gnashed referring to Saudi Arabia Riyadh al-haseem and the area in the middle region so that we can understand or is it somewhere else before we go into explaining it why are you asking he says because people say that all deviant thoughts and all evil acts come from gnashed where Saudi Arabia is today and on top of the list is Salafism or salafiyyah and Wahhabism so said okay let us look at the hadith when you look at the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he said may Allah bless our Yemen and our sham and the companion said what about our Nejd o prophet of allah he repeated plus our Yemen and sham and in the third time he said there comes the fittin the trials and calamities come from there and there is the Horn of the devil in a narration the horn of the Sun which means it is in the east so the scholars such as ana we even Tamiya hot Bobby all the whole nine yards of these scholars stated that this is in reference to the area between bahrain and iraq and they said that when the prophet allah saw some condemns or speaks bad about an area this doesn't mean that the people of the area are bad and it doesn't also mean that the area would be condemned for the rest of time any for example the hadith in say hey I'm a Muslim the Prophet said Allison I can see fitna throughout your homes like the rainfall and it will penetrate your homes who's he talking and addressing he's addressing the people of Medina he's telling his companions so is anyone in his sound mind would say oh everything in Medina is bad and evil and deviant and corrupt and the people of Medina are bad no the is referring to a specific period of time and not condemning the area as a whole if you look at Mecca when the Prophet migrated from Italy so Ladouceur was it a place of Islam and Iman definitely not so should we condemn it and condemn the people in it definitely not it's not the land that blesses or curses the individual that lives in it it's the person's own doing having said that let us see when the Prophet said I'll assume that from there all the trials and calamities all the fittin will come from let us see compare Apple to Apple what calamities and fittin came from gnashed which we refer to nowadays as the East the eastern or the central region of Saudi Arabia what fittin came from there to the Muslim world compared to what came from Iraq from Iran and the roundabouts from there we had the Huaraz in her oorah we had elgin ayah who totally ignored all those beautiful names and attributes and worshipped vacuum we had the mortis allah who did what they did to Al Hasan al Basri in Basra in Iraq we had all the tribulations and all the wars and all the bad in deviant ideologies coming from an era until two or three hundred years ago no one ever referred to gnashed as being the central region of Saudi Arabia only when Imam Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahab came who they claim is the founder of Wahhabism and there is no such thing as Wahhabism Mohamed Naguib did not bring any new did not bring any new r√°pida simply he spread the rapido of the Salafi and the cell of our the Prophet Isis on the Companions the terrain and the tabut have a that's it look and study his books and give me one point and say that this goes against Quran or Sunnah he speaks only Puranas from them so who tarnished the reputation of gnashed and is trying to widely spread the idea that the hadith refers to it and this is a blatant lie it's the Shia and the super Sufis all those who are deviants all those who innovate in Islam and would like to divert the Muslims from the Quran and Sunnah they are the only one who used this label if you have any objectivity if you have any logic go back to the Quran and Sunnah and compare Apple to Apple and tell me if what the teachings of Muhammad Ahmad will have what the a leader of the Salaf is telling people is in line with the coronation or not"
