  "transcript": "he says that my fiancee is a drug addict and he doesn't pray so what is my advice I asked her if she ISM is she a Muslim if she's a Muslim how would she get engaged to someone who does not pray anyone who does not pray is not a Muslim he's a kafir so even if you get married to him your marriage is void and you're committing an act of fornication so definitely dump this person because he's bad news he's not even worthy of being related to you or to your family dump him could forget him completely a drug addict and doesn't pray what use is he to you unless he's a drug dealer and he's rich maybe this is why you may consider him but Haram for you as a Muslim to consider such a person"
