  "transcript": "Wafaa says is it true that a husband cannot touch his wife or give her hustle after her death and he's not allowed to put her in the grave as he becomes nan Muharram after her death now this is quite common misconception among the people of the subcontinent and I believe it might be something mentioning mentioned in al Hanafy school of thought and whenever there is a dispute what is a Muslim supposed to do Allah mentioned that in Surat Annisa chapter 4 the antennas are confession for abdullah allah rasool and whenever you dispute and have argument over an issue then refer it back to allah and to his messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam and old scholars say that referring it to Allah and to his messenger Allah salsa at the moment means referring it to the Quran and to the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam so all the answers we need are found in the Quran and in the prophetic teachings the prophets teachings and statements make the roadmap for us that we can abide by and live with so we come to the issue of a woman becomes separated and not married to her husband after one of them dies how valid is this he cannot wash her she cannot wash him he cannot put her and place her in her grave because now she is a nun Muharram he cannot touch her this shows how far people are from the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam why do we say this first of all the Prophet said alayhi salaatu Sam to mother aisha in an authentic hadith when he came to visit her and she was suffering from a headache she was ill and tired so he was joking with her and he said well she was sick and having this headache Oh Aisha imagine if you die and I wash you shroud you and perform Jen as a prayer and I bury you imagine if this happens and Aisha was angry and said no by Allah you will go to one of my co wife's and spend the night there so she did not think of dying or being washed shrouded and prayed janaza and place in her grave but she was thinking of her jealousy that overtook her again so the Prophet is telling that alehissalaam he might have washed her if she were to die before him when the Prophet died are insolent Oh sinner it was the Companions who washed him mother Aisha said had it been - me and my co-wives my other sisters no one would have washed the Prophet Ali system except us not only that when Fatima may Allah be pleased with her the daughter of the prophet our son died it was Adi even ABI talib who washed her and when abu bakr as-siddiq may allah be pleased with him died it was his wife Asma been too amazed who washed him so now we've referred this back to the Quran and to the Sunnah do we still follow this wrong opinion that prohibits a wife from seeing her husband after his death from washing him from touching him some people say your wife died we washed her we're taking her to the Masjid for prayer but you cannot kiss her you cannot see her face you cannot touch her What nonsense is this the Sunnah of the Prophet is awesome is crystal-clear the actions of the Sahaba is crystal clear and as Muslims we abide by that we don't abide by what ever Tom Dick or Harry say in the religion of allah azza wajal because there are so many people who would come and say things that are not related to Islam"
