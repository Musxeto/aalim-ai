  "transcript": "so given the fact that it is not W for woman to attend Juma prayer will she receive the rewards mentioned in had this for those who going earlier to Juma prayer for example uh those who go very early for Juma prayer they will receive the reward of sacrifying a camel and it goes on so if I go to Juma prayer and attended will I receive the same reward like if I go earlier or not the Hadith of the Prophet Alat is General with the exception of the phrase where he says and he comes close to the Imam and listens a woman can't come close to the Imam rather her position as far as possible from men is more recommended and rewardable so the Hadith in general is General however with all this reward that you're talking about when you come to the prophet Hadith saying that a woman's prayer in her home is better than her prayer in my Masjid with me with me is from not from the Hadith in my Masjid so this means that no matter what the reward for men attending the prayer in the Masjid on a Friday and a woman following suit a woman who prays in her home is more rewarded than her hand this does the job inshallah"
