  "transcript": "some love almighty he was saying I'm among all the prophets Mohammad was the last as he's was a mission of the greatest task there was only moral degeneration people come to idle adoration for sanara mana rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallaho se llama para cada abadie he wore a suit amin nabina muhammad in para alla he was Xavier Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh abu bakr abu bakr abu bakr may allah be pleased with him when we believe in something the best we can do is abide by it and maybe some of us would go the extra mile and call others to it we may succeed we may not it is all at the hands of Allah the Almighty Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him he exceeded all expectations the minute he accepted islam some narrations say that he managed on the fourth day of accepting islam to call six of the best companions ever he managed to get them all into islam he managed to get earth man even our fan the third caliph may allah be pleased with him he managed to get sad even a Buick cos he managed to get up the romani been out he managed to get Paul ha even obeyed Allah and zubair Emile awam may Allah be pleased with them and he also managed to get a burro beta amer amnell july six of the best ten companions ever those whom the prophet le salatu salam guaranteed path dice for and gave them the glad tidings of paradise Abu Bakr alone had all of these six accepting Islam and this gives you a hand of his status on the day of judgment in paradise because anything any one of these six ever does in his life will be accredited to Abu Bakr and of course this would be accredited to the prophet alayhi salatu salam he himself sallallahu sand I'm told us that whoever guides people to righteousness he will be rewarded as any one of them is rewarded whenever he this person does this righteousness or this good deeds without deducting without reducing any of their good deeds so if I called you to do something that is righteous and good and you do this the minute you are credited rewarded by allah i will get the same credit and reward because i was the one who guided you so by this we realize that abu bakr may allah be pleased with him is on the top of the pyramid the only one on top of him is the prophet alayhi salatu salam and from this we learn that some of the actions ignorant people tend to do are wrong we find people supplicating we find people performing ombres and saying that the word of this Umbra I dedicate to the Prophet erase salatu salam the Prophet doesn't need your ombres the Prophet doesn't need your good deeds whatever you do is automatically accredited to him salala really selling soap these actions you're doing are wrong they are innovation you do not give the reward of such deeds to the prophet alayhi salatu salam because he's the source and he's the one who guided us to this light we have so Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him was the sole cause of a lot of the Companions to embrace and accept Islam he was honored to migrate with the Prophet Aristotle salam if you recall he at first tried to migrate to Abyssinia but was prevented from doing this by even Dorinda who gave him the protection and asked him to return back to makai which he did and when the prophet alayhi salatu salam allowed some of his companions to go to Abyssinia and they went there after few months a rumor was spread in Abyssinia that the pagans had allowed the Muslims to worship Allah freely so some of them came back to discover that this was merely a rumor and some of them went back to Abyssinia again for the second migration and after going back to Mecca in the protection of liberal Delinda the prophet alayhi salatu salam after a while permitted his companions to migrate to Medina because all I instructed him that this is your migration location and this is your destination so begin start in permitting your companions to migrate ahead of you and abu bakr being him being the one looking always at the top wanting to be the first in whatever good there is immediately went to the prophet alyssa said i'm seeking his permission to migrate to medina where they can worship allah freely without any harassment and without any abuse so the prophet alayhi salatu salam told him don't be hasty abu bakr may be a las our gel would give you a companion don't go on your own and this was like a glad tiding it was like a hint to Abu Bakr that there is a possibility that you will be accompanying the Prophet I racism in your migration this is a one life event well to rephrase that this event will happen once in the history of mankind where the prophet of Allah is a solid to Sam will migrate from Mecca to Medina so Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him took all the measures needed in the sense that he got his ride he got the camels ready feeding them nourishing them making them strong and fit for that journey so the minute the green light was given he was ready to set off with the prophet alayhi salatu salam nyesha the daughter of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with her in him tells us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to come to our house twice a day he used to come in the morning and he used to come in the evening before sunset and this shows us that a true leader does not sit in his ivory tower abandoning his companions and followers a true leader mixes up with the people and feels their pain and shares with them their lives the Prophet I saw some used to visit abu bakr twice a day and on that particular day he came without an appointment at noon and the Prophet Alister awesome was wearing his mask he's wrapping his scarf round his face so that he would not be recognized and Abu Bakr was alarmed he said there had to be something about this the Prophet usually does not come this hour of the day and the Prophet came into the house Ali salatu salam he requested Abu Bakr to get those in the room out of it so that he could have his privacy sobaka said o prophet of Allah they are all your family you know them all and there's nothing for you to be afraid of and this is another lesson we learn from this and that is one should not disclose all of his plans to every Tom Dick and Harry these plans should be strictly to those who are concerned with them because whatever you want to do something you don't have to brag about it the prophet salallahu alaihi salam said that is there a new era in la jolla EG convicted man try to get the support of fulfilling your tasks of doing what you want to do by secrecy and he justified this and he gave us the reason behind this by saying because everyone who is blessed he will have people envying him so this is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that you should do your things in secret and that is why he instructed abu bakr to get those in the room out so that he would have this secret talk with abu bakr may allah be pleased with him we have a short break so stay tuned and we will be right back in sha allah salam alaykum warahmatullahi war ricotta and welcome back so Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him did not get his family out of the room because he trusted them and so did the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and then the prophet alayhi salaatu Sun revealed to his companion the secret that he had and that was Allah the Almighty has given his prophet alayhi salaatu Santa permission to migrate to Medina Abu Bakr was anticipating this moment for a long time so he said to the prophet of allah sallallahu Selim Oh prophet of Allah the companionship and the Prophet approved and agreed to that and said the companionship abubakr which meant that you will accompany me to medina aisha says that abu bakr broke into tears out of joy and she said that I had never seen anyone cry out of happiness except that day so it was set Abu Bakr to migrate with the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet alayhi salatu salam took all the necessary measures to hide and conceal his migration because he knew that the pagans of Mecca are plotting to assassinate him he had Ali bin Abi Talib sleeping in his bed he asked Ali after he had left Mecca to return all the deposits and the things that he was entrusted with back to their original owners he sallallahu alehiwassallaam as well had the camels ready he did not accept it as a gift from Abu Bakr he insisted on paying a blocker for these camels he had the guide to take them throughout the roots and the different passages to Medina and he had the son of Abu Bakr and the daughter of Abu Bakr to bring him food and to bring him news of the things that are happening and taking place in Mecca he did all what he had to do and that is why he had this full trust in Allah soja not in the things that he had done but in Allah the Almighty to protect him and they set off to Medina as they were migrating Abu Bakr did a lot of strange things he used to walk in front of the Prophet that is a son and then he walked behind him and then to his left and then two right and the Prophet as son was amazed by this and he said Abu Bakr why are you doing what you're doing and I will buck her out of sheer love to the Prophet I think it's alotta said I'm said o prophet of Allah I remember the pursuit they are following us the posse that are trailing and trying to catch us so I walk behind you and then I remember that there will be spies looking out for you so I walk in front of you and then I remember that they might come from the right and they might come from the left and i keep on circling were you going from the left to the right unaware of where they will be coming from and this is abu bakr so the prophet alayhi salat salon smiles and says abu bakr would you like to get this harm instead of me would you like to be attacked in my place a worker with the heart of a believer said yes o prophet of Allah I'm only one man and if anything happens to me I'm only a man but if something happens to you the whole Ummah the whole of Islam will be affected of that it is enough to honor a person that allah azzawajal mentioned a blocker in the quran by saying his companion his friend and that is when the prophet alayhi salatu salam was with abu bakr in this small cave underground and as they were hiding they saw the feet of the pagans who were pursuing them and trying to catch them and Abu Bakr whispered in concern to the profit that is awesome and he said o prophet of Allah if one of them looked beneath his feet he would have seen us and the Prophet said Alice or some o abu bakr what do you think of two their third is Allah Almighty and that is why Allah says in the holy quran that the Prophet is telling and saying to his companion do not worry Allah is with us the Almighty and look at the word Latin do not worry do not be concerned and he did not say do not be afraid though it is a position it's a situation that any normal person would be afraid of but Abu Bakr was not afraid fear is when you are afraid of something wrong happening to you abu bakr @ may allah be pleased with him was not afraid of anything happening to him on the contrary he was worried that something bad would happen to the Prophet Ali salatu salam and that is why the word lattice and was used and not the word latter half it was not meant to be fear that what he had felt it was concerned about the safety of the prophet salallahu alayhi what ali he was a lemon and it was reported that once a man said to homer and omar at the time was the Caliph he was the second successor and he was the ruler of the muslims and this was after the death of the Prophet as an abu bakr so a man was praising allah may allah be pleased with him and said Omar blue haha by Allah you are the best man eyes had ever set on after the Prophet Alesana we had never seen anyone better than you after the prophet alayhi salatu salam one of the Companions I believe his name is Alfred nematic if i'm not mistaken started to tremble and shake and said by Allah this is a lie and he said this in front of hallmark the feast homer and all the companions were astonished by this and the man said yes we have seen someone who is better than Omar and that was Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him Omar did not say this is not true did not reprimand this man for saying the truth and seeing it in his face he Nomar may allah be pleased with him started to cry and said by allah i hope and i wish that i had one day and one night of abu bakr which would be equivalent to all what i have done in my life and he starts going about and talking about that night and he says that this night was the night when the prophet of Allah an abubakr reached the cave and they reach the cave at night time and they did not have any flares or any light with them so abu bakr said o prophet of allah remain outside let me go and check the cave so that I would make sure that there is nothing harmful in it so he went in and he found three holes so he tore his garment that's the only thing he had and he put this in one of the holes and he allowed the Prophet Alice awesome to come in so the prophet alayhi salam salam came in and the remaining two holes he had nothing to cover them with except his feet so he sat down on the floor on the ground and he put his feet to cover and block the passage of these two holes and the Prophet Ali salatu salam lied down putting his head on a boob occurs fie and the Prophet slept sallallahu alehiwassallaam and as he was sleeping Abu Bakr from these two holes was stung a number of times some say 17 some say 19 times whether it's a scorpion it's a snake and he did not move an inch because he did not want to wake the Prophet that is also him up he did not move and his tears started falling down from his face and the tears came to the prophets face at his salatu salam and he woke up and he said abu bakr why did you do this and he said o prophet of Allah I did not want to wake you up and he was suffering and he was in pain and he was in agony but he did what he did out of the love to the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam so the prophet salallahu alaihi salam spit on his wounds and they were healed by the grace of Allah Almighty some scholars say that when abu bakr died may allah be pleased with him later on it was because of these poisons and wounds that he suffered from in that cave this is a night that Omar may allah be pleased with him hoped to have gained something like it in comparison to all of his good deeds as for the day our mark says that it would be equivalent to all of his good deeds this day was when abu bakr may allah be pleased with him decided to fight the apostasy and he had what is known as horrible murder Dean who ejected Islam after the death of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they refused to pay this a cat and some of them refused to pray and it was said that only friday was prayed in Mecca and Medina and the rest of Arabia all rejected Islam after the death of the Prophet array salatu salam so Abu Bakr decided to fight these people who committed this oblivious act of apostasy and Omar may allah be pleased with him was confused and he said abu bakr you want to fight those who say la illaha illallah just because they do not pay the car they do not pray and abu bakr firm and said Omar will you be a brave in the time of ignorance in the time of Julia and a coward in the time of Islam by Allah whoever stops from giving the saccade and prevent me from collecting the zakat that they used to give to the Prophet aerosol salam I will fight them because they have committed an act of apostasy how is the religion of Allah complete before the death of the Prophet a little of Salaam and after his death in during my reign it will be reduced this is something I will not accept and tolerate and when he said this I maud may allah be pleased with him realized that allah has thrown his light in the heart of abu bakr and he guided him with this light to the best thing to be done in accordance to the Quran and to the Shinra I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hey"
