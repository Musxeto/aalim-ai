  "transcript": "Shila rahman al rahim Dalila salat wa salam ala rasoolillah he were our heroes are being humanity the buddha assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have with us today inshaallah hadith number 33 from under to a camp and this hadith was narrated by Abdullah ibn Omar that romanovna kebab may Allah be pleased with him said o prophet of Allah can any one of us sleep while he's you know the Prophet said a little of Sam yes if he performs evolution he may sleep this hadith we referred to a while ago and we said that this is part of the etiquette for a person who is in the state of janaba and the Prophet was asked by Omar if it's okay or not to sleep while in the state of janaba and the Prophet said yes if he performs rule if he performs ablution however there are other hadith that stated that the Prophet erase a lot from himself sometimes may have gone to bed while in the state of janaba without performing moodle which made the companions and the scholars differ whether it is mandatory or voluntary of course it goes without saying that it is a higher level and it is far better for your reward and it is best for you to be on the safe side so if a person goes to bed after performing woudl would anybody blame him on the contrary everybody would say you've done a good job but if a person goes to sleep while in the state of janaba and did not perform moodle would anybody blame him yes some of the scholars would say you did something wrong you should have performed ablution so the best thing for a person who is in the state of janaba to perform moodle before going to sleep and does it help well we don't know if it helps or not we know that it is the Sunnah of course I will not be able to pray I will not be able to recite the Quran but still it is a condition which allows most likely the angels to come and protect me 1 I'm asleep if I break the state of janaba with performing ablution and nevertheless this is the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam hadith umm Salama may Allah be pleased with her hadith number 34 who would give us the honor to read it narrated umm Salama may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers poom sooo lame the wife of abu talha came to allah opposite all and said for all as a postal verily Allah is not shy of the truth is it necessary for a woman to take a bath after she has a wet dream nocturnal sexual discharge Allah has a pistol replied yes if she notices her discharge ok this hadith was narrated by o Musa Lama whose Ummah Salama the wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam her husband was abu cinema and he was the brother of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam in suckling so he was breastfed with the Prophet Alyce of Salaam from the same mother and he had another or a third brother of suckling and he was his uncle I'm Zak Ben Abdul Mutallab so these three were brothers in suckling Abu saliva Hamza and the prophet sallallaahu are you salam and when he died the prophet proposed to her she refused in the beginning saying that o prophet of allah i'm an old woman and i have a lot of children and I am extremely jealous the Prophet sent to her and said as for your age I'm older than you so I'm old as well as for your children they are my children and as for your jealousy I will pray to Allah that Allah will take it away and so this is exactly what happened and umm Salama was the least of the prophets wives to be jealous and that is why the Prophet wives were into two teams the team of aisha and half sine and the other wives and the team of Jana be Josh and the otherwise of two team rival teams they collaborate and cooperate against the Prophet Alastair Salam know they all love the Prophet but they take sides and wherever they have dispute they sent home Salama to convey their message to the Prophet why because she did not take part she did not take sides she was not jealous she loved the Prophet Iran but her jealousy was taken away by the prophets dua umm Salama is telling us that all so lame came to the Prophet you remember of course who enemies who is am slain the mother of Anna's and the wife of Abu Talha al ansari so she came to the Prophet and she made a beautiful introduction she said prophet of Allah Allah is not shy of the truth meaning that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala when there is truth it is not something to be ashamed of we have to say it and this introduction was because she was about to say something that women are usually shy to say and declare like in the case of Ali when he was suffering and being one of those who are having this discharge prostatic fluid discharge continuously he was shy to go and ask the Prophet Isis arm so he sent someone else on silane came up front and said Allah is not shy of the truth therefore if a woman has a wet dream nocturnal emission does she have to take a bath like men and the Prophet said yes if she sees the water in the Prophet said RA salat wa salam if she sees the water what is that water the Prophet Anna salatu salam is referring to it is the discharge the semen so now the Prophet is making it clearer a solution that no illusion is mandatory until you have this team and discharge and this brings us to another issue and there is if a person sleeps and dreams that he is having intercourse and that he is ejaculated in his dream once he wakes up he does not find anything no traces in his underwear is it mandatory for him to perform whistle or not those who say yes raise your hands please only one those who say no raise your hands please the majority of the scholars say you don't have to and this is a authentic opinion why what did the Prophet answer home silane he said yes she must have a suit if what if she sees or detects the discharge and that is why the Prophet are they saw it was Salam related muscle to seeing the discharge or to ejaculation now let us reverse this dream a nun goes to bed he wakes up not remembering seeing any dream but when he investigates he finds traces of semen on his underwear is he obliged to make o Sole or not yeah why because he found the discharge but he did not see a dream so how can this be well this is what the scholars looked and collected all the evidences regarding this matter and there are a number of evidences that cover it we will come to some of them after inshallah the third hadith so this first hadith tells us if you see the discharge you have to offer woodson we will elaborate more when we come to the hadith so that we would not distract you even further the following hadeeth hadley 35 who will read it for us please narrated Aisha I used to wash the traces of semen from the clothes of the Prophet and he used to go out for prayer my traces of water was still on it that water spots were still visible and in another narration I simply I simply rubbed it off and he offered prayer was very much comment this hadith the scholars usually referred to it in order when they discuss on the purity of semen is semen pure or is it impure neji's is it power or Naji's those who think it is impure they use the same hadith and those who say that it is pure they use the same honey how is that those who say it's impure they say that had it not been impure she would not have washed it so washing it indicates that it is impure it is not just those who say no it is pure and the evidence is that in this hadith and in other narrations she says if it is wet I used to wash it and if it was dry I used to rub it off with my fingernail so rubbing in rubbing the impurity off with a fingernail does it purify it no an impurity if we have pieces on the body or on the clothes and I rub it off does this suffice or I have to wash it I must wash it so rubbing the semen of the clothes of the Prophet Oh Sam and he going to pray with it means that it is pure and per head and this is the most authentic opinion because it is the origin of man and the origin of man cannot be rendered as neji's it has to be pure and also washing it does not mean it's not just because we sometimes if you have something that is dirty things coming from your nose you wash them not because they're not yet but because it is not clean it is dirty it is not appealing and likewise with the semen we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum and welcome back we move on to hadeeth number 36 and who will read it yes brother another Jedi Buddha the Prophet said when a man sits in between the four parts of a woman and has sexual intercourse with her bars become compulsory al-bukhari in the narration of Muslim even if there is no ejaculation so now the compiler of this book on the telecom is ringing us another cause of useful the hadith of umm Salama was regarding what was what what is it what's the word for it wet dreams or in another word ejaculation so the first part that you have to or when it becomes mandatory if you to make rustle is when you have ejaculation and specifically when it's in nocturnal emission when it is a wet dream while you're asleep now in this hadith of Abu Huraira there is a second cause of hustle and that is sexual intercourse whether ejaculation takes place or not and the sexual intercourse is defined by having the two circumsized areas meet and this is a beautiful way of talking about insertion so once the insertion takes place then the water is mandatory whether ejaculated or not so these are the two causes one ejaculation whether while in your sleep or while you're awake deliberately an ejaculation is defined as gushing the semen with desire with lust because if it comes out without gushing this is an illness it does not require tosyl and if it comes out without desire also this is not considered to be part of the also these two have to be together and whether you are asleep or awake now if a person has intercourse then also becomes mandatory regardless he ejaculated or not and this hadith abrogates another hadith the famous hadith known as water is from water meaning that water of wuzzle is a result of water of ejaculation so in the beginning only if you ejaculate it was all was mandatory but then it was obligated and it became mandatory whether you ejaculated or not providing that you had sexual intercourse okay we move on to the following hadith before that we have any questions or one no one is not enough then we go on to the following hi ready 37 in this case I will read hadith number 37 narrated by abu jafar while my father and I were with Jabbar nabbed Allah may Allah be pleased with them some people asked him about taking a bath he replied a song of water is sufficient for you a man said a saw is not sufficient for me Jabbar said a saw was sufficient for one who had more hair than you and who was better than you meaning the prophet alayhi salatu salam he then put on his garment and he led us in prayer and in another narration jabberin Revilla reported when the Prophet is Aslam took a bath because of sexual intercourse he poured three handfuls of water upon his head Hassan even Muhammad said to him I have a lot of hair upon this Jabbar observed millipedes with him I said to him o son of my brother the hair of The Messenger of Allah was more than your hair and finer and better this hadith is regarding the companion abu nidal ab haram may allah be pleased with them both a man asked him and he was from the descendants of alumina batali about the whistle of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said the prophet used to make a total bath with saw one saw what is the saw a saw is made of four would check we did not know what saris to explain it with for wood what is for wood a mood is what gathers in the two palms of a normal man meaning that he's not from East Asia the Far East where their hands are tiny and he is not a basketball player the NBA where his hand is this big he can hold a ball with one hand he's a normal average person like me and you this is a mood and this is how the Companions used to measure things we now have kilograms we have pounds at the time they used to measure it by size not by weight so they used to measure things by size and the size was mood and slob so if I put water in here and then I put it in this glass this would be one would the prophets water for whistle was for of that so a container that contains four glasses of this this is what the Prophet used to make whistles with and one man and this man is Al Hassan bin Muhammad it Ben Ali bin Abi party so he's the grandson of I leave now Batali but his great-grandfather is not the prophet and this one because he's not the descendant of Al Hasan and Husayn he's descendant of their brother Muhammad ibn Ali known as Muhammad Emil Hannah via his mother was from Benny Hanifah so he objected and said Jabbar one saw is not enough for me I have a lot of hair so Jabbar may Allah be pleased with him answered him in a very strong way he said it was enough and sufficient for someone who was better than you and someone who had more hair than you and his hair was even more finer than yours and who was that the Prophet Allah slaughter now by giving us the size and how to make wudu and how to make muscle we know how far we are from the pseudonym because we consume so much water and yet we are not satisfied and in a weak hadith not authentic a weak hadith but collars use it all the time there is a Shaitaan designated for woudl no matter how many times you make odo he tells you one more one for the road a little bit no me do it again his name is al well Han his name is al well Han but this hadith is not authentic however the scholars use it all the time so from this we learn by conserving water we're following the Sunnah and we were pleasing Allah by using so much water and using it excessively we are not following the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam so do we have questions or shall we go on we have question is our body it was related to the previous Hadees because you touched a very sensitive subject about the semen being pure or not pure tyub or halal and one of the most common questions that are posed by modern Muslims were married these oral sex allowed or not oral sex he said allowed or not first of all oral sex is not something that was known at the time of the Prophet or Sam or the companions or those who followed them or the generations to follow oral sex was only introduced a hundred years or so ago when pornography was introduced so this filth did not come to us through the Sunnah definitely and that is why we don't have a ruling on it in the Sunna however I dare not say that it is Haram I cannot say and at the same time I cannot say it's Haddad but I'll give you guidelines guidelines we've studied you remember that the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam forbade us to touch our private parts while urinating with the right hand and he forbade us to clean ourselves after answering the call of nature with the right hand now a simple question why all scholars would tell you because the right hand is much honored and it's much praised and that is only to be used for the good things such as eating giving and taking while the left hand is used only for the disgraced things for the filthy things cleaning and touching things and etc so I tell you and you tell me what is more worthy of praising and honoring a hand that we take and give that we hold things that we eat with or the mouth and the tongue that we say la ilaha illaallah that we recite the Quran that we say bismillah Allahu Akbar and all beautiful things come out of it what is more worthy of honoring definitely the tongue definitely the mouth and by experience I've noticed that people who do this are not only satisfied by doing it one year two years down the line they would like to explore something more and mainly a lot of those who do these filthy things end up doing annal sex end up doing something that is completely forbidden and a major sin that is agreed upon all scholars why because Shaitaan is making them follow his footsteps like Allah said do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan he comes bit by bit by bit Muslims are far far superior to such filth and such relationship and allah azza wajal knows best I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
