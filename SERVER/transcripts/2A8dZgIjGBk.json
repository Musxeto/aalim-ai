  "title": "Has Mathi (precum) 2 / 3 times a day How to pray if he can't change clothes outside? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes sh my question is as I have little M coming out at any time it may come once maybe twice maybe Thrice in a day so I follow your instructions as you told that to change your lower garments and do vooo before every Salah so sometimes I'm outside my home so how will I pray uh as I cannot change my lower garments as I will be outside then how should I pray at that time I am assuming that you do not have OCD yes sh sh one one minute please I had OCD and alhamdulillah because of your videos that I watched on YouTube it cured alhamdulillah 100% but it's 100% I have M coming out I understand this is why I made this disclaimer in the beginning so assuming you do not have OCD alhamdulillah you don't have OCD in this case we have to understand that impurities are divided into three categories minor impurity normal imp urity and major impurity in the sense that it requires something extra minor impurity is like the urine of a male boy who is still suckling and did not uh eat solid foods yet why do we say minor impurity because if such urine touches clothes or objects we don't have to wash it with water and pouring water all all over it rather sprinkling water that runs over it that's in Easy fashion without squeezing and washing again is sufficient likewise medi medi is considered to be it is slight impurity it's not like urine that requires washing squeezing and ensuring that it is gone no sprinkling water over it over the spots does the job so if you have this when when you're outside the home all what you need to you don't have to change your undergarments or or underwear all what you have to do is go to the toilet with a small bottle of water and look at the spot or two and sprinkle water on that and you do the same with your private part or if you can overwhelm the area with water and your testicles as well and then make W that's it you have no problem uh inshallah"
