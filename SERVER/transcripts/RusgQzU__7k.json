  "transcript": "the question was about the brother thinking that I am encouraging you to be full so he's saying how is this possible when Islam encourages us to help one another by being rich by helping Islam with money correct so if I'm encouraging you to be poor please give me all your money before you leave of course not Islam does not encourage poverty at all at all rather Islam encourages you to be active to be earning and to have the upper hand not to have the lower hand what is the upper hand the hand that gives and the lower hand is the hand that takes so Islam does not encourage poverty but Islam tells you as a form of counseling the poor don't be sad of course you cannot all be rich who among you is rich everybody is putting his hand in his pocket the chef wants our money everybody wants to be rich but not everybody can be rich and this is in the Dunya standard in the Agra standard we are all rich how is that possible a man came to Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father instead am I from the poor Muslims who can take the zakat so he asked him do you have a wife he says yes he said no you're rich because you have a wife you can provide for her you're rich so he said I have a wife and a servant he said you are King you are among the king so islamically those who can have these luxuries are considered to be rich no if I don't have a Ferrari or a Porsche I'm not rich no this is the worldly standard so yes Islam encourages us to be Rich so that we can benefit others with our money the prophet said the best of good money is in the hand of a good man who squanders it in means of Charity and Good Deeds so yes you are encouraged to make a wealth and to become rich through Islamic means through Halal earning and when you spend the money you spend it in halal venues as well and by this you will be safe on the day of judgment and by the way six of the ten Heaven bound six of them were millionaires they are the best of the sahaba six with billionaires not rich billionaires so was this bad for their image no were they arrogant no if you see them you would not recognize them today can you recognize the billionaire when he comes in his suit ten thousand dollars his watch a hundred and eighty thousand dollars once a man told me do you know Rafael Nadal I don't know someone says to me do you know the king he says yes I know the king of course the problem is does he know me no so so I said he said do you know that the watch that Rafael Nadal is wearing is three million dollars three million dollars for a watch are you crazy is his time faster than mine at the same time and by the way I wear an Apple watch if they give me his watch I will not wear it why because his watch only tells you the time my watch tells me the weather the messages it tells me reminders it has uh internet it has a heart beat and everything and this is less than a thousand dollars I think I'm 500 maybe very cheap and I did not buy it I don't buy things I get gifts this is one of the attributes of being a chair if anyone comes and says sure uh I'd like to give you an iPad okay iPhone 14. okay okay thing I have is a gift I don't ever buy a thing people come and give me a gift what should I say thank you so this is how we measure things in this Dunya I can tell a person by the pen by the watch by the car by the suit by the house but this is not what Islam is 10 Heaven bound you could not tell him from a poor man from someone else they all look alike and Allah Knows Best"
