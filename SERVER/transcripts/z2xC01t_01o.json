  "transcript": "imran says is it sunna to eat any sweet food after a meal and the answer is that any such sunnah has to be backed up by a hadith personally i do not know of any hadith where the prophet as assam used to eat fruit or anything sweet after a meal but if there were to be an authentic hadith then it becomes not a sunnah of worship rather a sunnah of tradition and customs and to my knowledge doctors say that it is not recommended to eat anything especially fruits after a meal rather eating fruit would be best half an hour before a meal so that it would not cause any problems in your stomach and allah azza knows best"
