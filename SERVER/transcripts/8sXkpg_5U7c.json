  "transcript": "very sound and very good we know that we are instructed to read or recite particular suras such as every Friday and such as before we go to bed so if a person recites these suras while in prayer for example Sur I go to the Masjid at 11:00 an hour and a half before uh the Imam starts his and I start praying voluntary prayers and it's recommended and Sunnah to pray as many ra as you want you want to pray 50 100 whatever this is up to you and during which in this prayer I recite Surah Al from memory I revise it and I concluded does this does the job does this do the job the answer is yes you have recited Sur whether in prayer whether sitting in the Masjid whether what whenever you've done what you would supposed to do likewise alul so I prayed and after I usually have very little time to sleep because f is early so let me pray night prayer so I pray my night prayers raas and I pray in them does this do the job the answer is yes because the prophet did not order us to pray or to recite Surah Al mul while we are on our bed but he used to himself recite it as he was preparing to go to bed so if you are on your bed or you want to sleep in an hour or half an hour and you're preparing to go to sleep by praying your tahajud or it's not a tahajud it's a night prayer because you not sleep before it and you recite it in your night prayer this does the job without any problem inshallah um"
