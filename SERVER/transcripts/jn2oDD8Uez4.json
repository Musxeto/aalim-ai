  "title": "Can we pray Jumah(Friday Prayer) in any place other than the Masjid?",
  "transcript": "Fahim says what is the ruling about the mandatory place of Gemara jota is it only in the Masjid we will come to a similar question after a while but in short the majority of scholars say that it is not a must to pray Friday sermon and prayer in the message it can be prayed anywhere as long as it is within the vicinity of a town or a city so praying Friday is not permissible for a traveler or for those who are nomads who are not living in a city or a town so we will come to discuss this a little bit later on in Charlotte"
