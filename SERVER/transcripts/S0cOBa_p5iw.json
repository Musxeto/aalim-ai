  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to this 72nd class on islamic we stopped last class while defining and discussing the importance of judging arbitrating between those who dispute and how to solve conflicts and the importance of that and the dangers the dangers of doing that without knowledge or without being fair and we will talk today in sha allah about the manners and values to be observed by judges you see a judge is not a position that you apply to and according to your job description you are selected there are many aspects beyond that and this is why scholars paid a lot a great deal and gave a lot of importance to the fact of selecting a suitable judge bearing in mind that his characteristics his manners and his attributes exceed the job description and we can see clearly why scholars gave this issue great importance one corrupt judge can spoil the whole country and this is obvious in third world countries and sometimes even in the first world countries in the civilized world when you have a corrupt judge that his vote his verdict his ruling can be the decisive issue over a dispute then you have big problems in civilized worlds we know that companies oil companies that are greatly involved in polluting the environment pay a lot an arm and a leg through their campaigns whether over the table or under the table to pass to pass laws and regulations supporting their jobs and they can afford that we know that tobacco companies did the same over the past 40 50 years nowadays we know that pharmaceutical companies are doing the same thing via various ways let alone the political side and how the judges are politicized and they give the verdicts according to the ruling party and what they say if you look at civilized countries where they have the supreme court and how the nomination of one of the the judges in such courts is badly affected by the political arena which party you follow so the president has the right to nominate and he would not nominate he would not approve except those who follow his party and the senate and the congress does the same thing so it is totally polluted and it is a filthy process especially when there when there are politics involved in sharia a judge has to be independent and in some schools it says that the ruler must not be the one who is giving him his salary or his allowance so that his judgment would not be negatively impacted rather it should be taken straight from beethoven and this is something that is way above our pay grade but it gives you a glimpse when you look at how the judges are selected not on their merits or on their religious commitment and the knowledge of islam rather on their political agenda or their inclination to follow whoever pays more and again this brings us back to the hadith of the prophet saw which we mentioned last class judges are of three types two in hell and one in paradise so what are these manners and values number one a judge should have a strong character and be held in high esteem so he has to have a strong personality a person who is not easily manipulated and if there were someone who can be easily manipulated and his decision-making process can be hampered by influence of those standing in in front of him such as when you have a powerful opponent who's pushing towards what he thinks is his rights and the judge is a bit weak can be easily influenced or a woman who cries tears and weeps in front of him and he feels soft this is not a good judge a good judge is someone who has a strong personality without being arrogant nor violent he has to be soft-hearted the prophetess are more soft-hearted and we all have lots and lots of hadiths to prove this he used to cry and weep when one of his companions used to be on the death bed or when one of his grandchildren died but this would not at all mean weakness because he himself said by allah if fatima the daughter of muhammad were to steal i would have chopped her hand for that so he doesn't alisalam become weak but this soft of heart is something needed in a ruler in a public servant in someone who takes care of people's affairs without being weak number two he should be careful and forbearing and this is also important when you have absolute powers when you cut when you are able and you know you can harm someone if you're not careful and forbearing satan can make a big mess out of an impulsive decision so when someone comes and starts to talk in an abusive way and you are the judge and everybody everybody is listening and watching and anticipating what will you do should you throw him in jail for contempt of court should you rule for it for his opponent's favor regardless of who's right and who's wrong this is something that every judge has to have at the back of his mind that allah will hold you accountable for what you say and do so you need to be careful and forbearing so that you're not angered by what parties or of the dispute they may do or say number three he should be intelligent and alert and this is something you cannot get in a cv when we sit and talk sometimes you get a students unable to understand a joke you have to repeat the story twice so that they can comprehend it sometimes they can't read between the lines though they are a students and this is not suitable for a person to be a judge a judge has to be alert has to be smart intelligent capable of reading between the lines understands gestures facial expressions can tell when a person is nervous or he's simply not sometimes a person's being a person's nervousness means that he's lying and sometimes it's a natural thing when you stand in front of a judge and you see the police etc so he has to know how to differentiate you cannot learn this at school you need to get this gift from allah azzawajal yes you can improve it a bit with experience but a dumb person even if he's good academically would not be a good judge and unfortunately we have many people who are excellent academically they're good in research but when it comes to writing um a thesis or a document they're excellent but when it comes to giving a verdict when they speak when they're told to solve or arbitrate a dispute they fail miserably because they're not cut to such work so a judge has to be fair uh he has to be intelligent and he has to be quick to understand and read between the lines and see and find contradictions that would help him reach the true and correct verdict number four he should be a man of integrity and probity so he has to be a person who walks the talk he has to be a man of allah a man of god in islam in sharia ruling not acceptable to have a judge like we have in most muslim countries who's clean shaven who wears western clothes that goes below his ankle who smokes who attends mixed gatherings because the ruler told him to do so where there is music free mixing maybe even worse and this is a deficiency that can't be accepted in a muslim let alone in a man of law who rules by the sharia i'm not talking about secular regimes i'm talking about islamic regimes a muslim judge who runs after this dunya who attends mixed gatherings mixes with unveiled non-muslim women on camera and then we expect him to be a suitable muslim judge giving islamic verdicts this is not believable or possible number five he should be content truthful and able to make his own judgment so a judge has to be a person of integrity he has to be capable of coming up with a judgment decisive not hesitant may allah be pleased with him said no one may be a true judge unless he has five qualities probity forbearance we spoke about those having thorough knowledge of what has passed before him this is similar to what the shaftery so he has knowledge of previous cases in islam and what were the verdicts of true scholars and companions etc ready to consult people of wisdom ah he's not hesitant if he does not have the knowledge himself he should go and consult so if it's an issue of medical error he has to consult doctors surgeons to get their opinion if it's a an economic uh issue he has to consult economists businessmen people of the trade and he has to be brave fearing no one other than allah a judge that is easily intimidated by the ruler by the governor by businessmen he cannot never give a true sharia compliant verdict this is why it is important and this is why this is not applicable it is important that judges have independence and whenever scholars judges students of knowledge are independent and not reliant on the ruler to provide for them to control their livelihood whether to give them the salary or not whether to change their job location from this city that they've been living all their lives into somewhere remote as a form of punishment for not complying with his instructions then you have a problem number six it is strictly forbidden that a judge should speak to either of the two parties to a dispute in secret or to favor one of them over the other or to teach either of them how to make his argument or present his evidences this is an important issue in history we have a number of stories and cases where the judge would do something that an opponent or the person himself would object to it so once it is reported that a jew found an armor or a shield so he took it and when the khalifa the muslim ruler ali mabital saw it he claimed it and he said no this is mine i lost it so the jews say i found it it's mine so adi took the jew to the muslim judge though he was the ruler he could have done anything nobody would have objected to that so when the judge heard about the khalifa coming to court with his opponent when adi came in he said assalamu alaikum o khalif abel hasan so he nicked name him and ali said this is wrong here i'm not a caliph i'm a one of the defendants or the prosecutors whatever they call them here i'm just like any other person you should not say abel hassan to me nicknaming me you should say ali so the judge immediately rectified his mistake and synchronized his thinking with what he has to do which is to rule by sharia not by favorism not because he's a jew you rule against him so he told them okay what is your um a problem what is the issue so adi said this is my armor this is my shield i lost and this jew claims that it is his so he asked the jew is it yours so that you said yes i found it it's mine so the judge looked at ali and said okay do you have any proof to support your claim that's yours ali said no i don't have any proof so the judge said i'm afraid i cannot rule for you because you have to prove that it is yours adi said you're right i have no case here the story says that the jew witnessed this and said are you kidding me a judge rules against the caliph for a jew this is not possible this is unbelievable this can only happen in a true religion of allah i bear witness there is no god worthy of being worshiped but allah muhammad is his servant and messenger so we have to have this ability not to favor people over others and this is why a judge is truly a difficult job to take and it is one heck of responsibility and this is why in the self like 80 percent 90 of scholars would turn this position down would never accept to be judges though they were overqualified but they were so afraid of the responsibility and of the problems that it could bring them when it is with allah azzawajal number seven it's also forbidden for a judge to give his ruling when he is in the state of anger so a judge has to be mentally stable whether permanently of course or temporarily because there are times when a person is temporarily unstable mentally for example the prophet said regarding the issue of anger no arbiter between two disputants may give a ruling when he is angry you should not judge two people when you're angry anything could set you off anything can trigger an impulsive unrealistic unfair judgment so when you're angry if you're standing up sit down if you're sitting down lie down seek refuge in allah from the shape on if it's in a public hearing or in a court and one of the people one of the disputants angers you says something that is inappropriate and you feel angry because of that whether it's a direct insult to your color to your ethnicity to whatever you should adjourn the court and postpone it for another day until you become calm and normal back again and this cascades to anything that can blur your vision anything that would hamper your decision making such as worries fears hunger thirst fatigue illness even hot weather imagine if you are in a court and the acs the air conditioners go off and the technician says it's gonna take three four hours and you are sweating like crazy especially here in arabia the judge must not look into any case no matter how severe his verdict is needed it has to be adjourned and maybe we can add to that why women cannot be judges imagine a woman on her menses and how her temperament fluctuates and changes here we have a problem and this suits her like a glove she must not judge because of her change of mood that would impact her decision making number eight it is forbidden for a judge to take a bribe and islamically this is a well-known established fact the prophet said allah curse the one who gives a bride who gives a bribe when seeking a ruling and the one who takes it so both giver and taker are cursed by allah and this goes without any questioning whether you're a judge whether you're a clerk whether you're a a a paper pusher a public servant an official anyone who gets money or compensation because of his position this is a bribe number nine something a bit similar but different which is to take gifts from both or either party to the dispute so what is the difference between a bribe and a gift if i go to the court and i give the judge an envelope with money in it without any prior acquaintance this is a bride but if i know the judge and i send him a gift either there is a pending case or there's no case at all if there is a pending case and i send the judge who happens to be a cousin a schoolmate someone i know from a long time a neighbor any any acquaintance if i send him a gift it is prohibited for him to take because this is a bribe though i am a friend a real friend of his if there is no case pending and i send him a gift the judge has to analyze am i the kind of person who before him assuming such a position as a judge used to give him gifts or not see i could know abdullah for 20 years never ever in my life had given him or sent him a gift only last year he was appointed as a judge and since last year he's been noticing that i'm giving him and sending him gifts in this case he must not accept these gifts and must return them back but if for the past 20 years abdullah and i were best friends and cousins relatives neighbors whatever and he sends me gifts and i send him gifts whenever i come from a journey i bring him a gift and his children in this case there's no problem for the judge to accept such gifts because they're not given because of his position and likewise wherever there is a possibility of favorism the judge has to cut that out because so many cases and we see this in arabia when someone comes to [Music] a public office he comes in uniform whether he's in the army navy air force or uh even the police so that the judge or the clerk or the official would facilitate things for them quicker so they're using their uniform to influence whether it's the raw or the turn they have to assume or whether to pull some strings here or there therefore scholars say that a judge is unlike any other job so if i were to be a judge in a court it would be a bit embarrassing if i go shopping and i go to the grocery shop next to my home and i buy things and the owner knows me so he gives me a discount why are you giving me oh you're our judge you're our honorable judge we have to serve you we have to aha he's doing this because of my position not because of the length of my beard so if it is best to appoint someone who's unknown in the community to do my shopping to do my groceries to do things where i don't have to get in contact with the public so that noted tapes would be cut number 10 a judge may not rule on any case in which he or any relative of his his party particularly when he cannot be a witness in a case involving such a relative so this is logical more than islamic because people are weak by nature and when one of the disputant is your son or your brother you're a human being we cannot guarantee that you will have the fairness to rule against your own brother or son and this is why in so many cases in schools of thought they prohibit a judge from looking into a case where he has close relatives being involved in it not even not even in marriage contracts we know that the thun and we spoke about that earlier and we said that the thun is the person the clerk who writes and authenticates the marriage contract in saudi arabia even if the thun who's the clerk he's not giving approvals or anything he's just writing the contract cannot conduct the marriage of his own son or daughter he has to bring a colleague to do that for him so that his judgment is not introduced is not affected by his relation so the the if he's conducting his son's marriage and the woman demands conditions and he claims to write them and he manipulates them these conditions are final so he may take sides so this is yeah i need something that um has to be one has to be careful that the judge should not look into cases that are of his relatives not of his enemies by the way so if a case comes in front of you and one of the disputant was someone accused of bashing and beating your brother in two three years ago in a quarrel it went to a court of law etc and it was over you still hold a grudge against that person so looking into his case would be sort of unfair to him and would be dangerous in hampering your own decision number 11 a judge may not rule in any case on the basis of his own knowledge of the event or of the case what does that mean it means that a judge has to be objective has to be i don't know if their word is that impartial must not get involved on a personal level i'll give you an example i saw a man who was totally drunk let me not use this example i saw a man having intercourse with an mahram woman and i saw that with my own eyes so i went to court and summoned the man and accused him of adultery or fornication based that on the fact that i'm a judge and i saw it immediately the man would appeal to a higher court accuses the judge of slandering him and demanding the presence of four male witnesses who saw him committing fornication the judge will definitely fail in doing so hence he will be flogged 80 lashes but i'm the judge i saw it yes you saw it but you don't have the authority to judge people like that it's you you are like anyone else you need four witnesses likewise when i see someone stealing it's not sufficient there have to be two witnesses in sahih al-bukhari if i'm not mistaken it was reported that received miriam peace be upon him and upon his mother jesus the son of mary saw a man stealing so jesus caught him red-handed and he said you stole and the man said wallahi he swore by allah wallahi i did not steal isa jesus peace be upon him let him go and said i believe in allah the one whom you take his name i believe in allah and i falsify my own two eyes my eyes are lying and why did he do such a thing scholars said first because he's a judge he cannot rule based on his own testimony and knowledge secondly there could have been a misinterpretation so the money that the thief took was his father and this is not stealing it could have been the money that someone embezzled him and stole from him so he's taking his right there can be many justifications which to be safe rather than sorry prophet isa peace be upon him let the man go number 11 or 12. a judge should appoint any assistant he may need such as a clerk to write down the proceedings a doorman an interpreter etc so that he devotes himself solely to looking into the cases submitted to him and this is logical such a high position requires assistance and they he requires a driver requires a clerk he requires a guard he requires a billboard to uh uh take messages from and unto different departments etc so he needs a full department to serve him so that he would have his head free to rule and this includes by the way servants in the house a driver so that he doesn't have to answer the question during working hours from his wife telling him not to forget to bring the milk and the eggs this is not my job i'm a judge i have bigger fish to fry so take all of this off my head and take care of it so that i can take care of what is needed in sharia number 13 a judge must give his ruling on the basis of the quran and the sunnah and this is important a judge is not a person who graduated from sharia school or from a college and was appointed and then he looks into cases and gives verdicts right left and center without referring to the quran and the sunnah no he has to be a truly highly decorated student of knowledge and 99 percent of those graduating from islamic universities and colleges are not fit to rule i've had the honor to sit with hundreds of them in wallahi some of them even don't have the basics of knowledge though they have graduated why the reason is that they're good in solving questions at tests and exams but they don't have the spirit to think freely to cross-examine evidences they're not students of knowledge they're simply students if you had put them in medicine school they would have passed if you had put them in engineering school they would have passed not necessarily that they're gifted to such a specific field so a judge in islamic law is different than a law student who graduates and works for a year or two in a law firm and then starts to do his own trials and participates in looking into cases here a judge has to be a person who fears allah who walks the talk who is fair who is mentally stable who is not having any favoritism to anyone and who knows what he's doing he has knowledge from the quran and from the sunnah otherwise he would have ruled cases and gave judgment according to his whims and desires if such a person meets a ruling that is way above his pay grade he doesn't know his knowledge does not reach the level of this case that is being presented to him he must not has he must not have any hesitation to go and ask the grand mufti for example or someone who is way way more knowledgeable than him to guide him to teach him and then he would give the verdict according to his comprehension on understanding number 14 and we conclude with this insha allah a judge must be absolutely fair for both parties and this is the essence of judging people actually it is the essence of this whole universe because with justice with fairness the heavens and the earths were built allah is just one of his attributes is that he's just and life cannot go without justice it cannot go on even in a household if a man is not fair and just to his wife life is unbearable if a father is not fair and just between his offspring the prophet said allah don't make me a witness on such injustice if a person is unable to be fair with his co-workers with his subordinates with his superiors if you're unable to be fair when you buy and sell when you deal with your neighbors when you have a dispute when you quarrel when you fight then life cannot go on and unfortunately this is what we see all over the world pure injustice straight simple and this is why we need justice and fairness if a judge does not have this in him then we have a problem now it is a very dangerous position to assume we go to courts in the muslim world and we see how judges differ you find a judge when you enter the court it's your turn and you say assalamu alaikum and he doesn't reply to you he doesn't even raise his head to look at you when he speaks to you he doesn't even smile this type of a judge thinks that allah had chosen because of his merits because he deserves to be a judge not knowing that there are thousands of people better than him and more worthy of this position than him some judges when you enter and says you find him looking at you with a big smile come in yes what can i do for you you speak first you no no wait for my friend let the other person speak yes please don't interrupt him so polite so discreet so intellectual this is a good judge whether he'll go places or not this depends on the decision from way up but he's a decent person he's a good judge he has a good resume he did good they did well in college he has lots of recommendations from scholars that's a decent person you look at some judges and you find them filthy rich and i'm talking about corruption no way a paper pusher or a normal judge would have hundreds of millions in his bank account most of them are smart they put the money in their wives and their children's in their relatives in real estate but where do they think they will end up life is short so one way of thinking is let's make the best of it and on the day of judgement we will ask allah for forgiveness or maybe when we retire or when we are fired from our jobs we would have secured enough millions and billions we will go to makkah make umrah make hajj allah is most forgiving others would say no this is not possible we have to walk the talk we don't want allah to deprive us of our barakah in our health in our wealth in our offspring in everything we do because of consuming such haram and doing such haram anyhow i think this brings us to the end of today's um session and we have like 15 minutes to look into the questions so the first question i got it's not from the list and by the way i but recommend if possible that you post your questions so that the administration would send me these questions to answer them because i have very little of them every now and then and it's not sufficient to have a full fledged one hour dedicated for questions which i would like to do so if you can search for where to post questions whether on the facebook itself or on the website islamic.net and post your questions so that we can collect them and inshallah designate a full uh day for that so the first question which i got from one of the students whom i or which i did not come across during hunting and foods the question says that we know that the dog's saliva is najis so what's the ruling when we use the dog as a tool to hunt gain and that's a very good question the answer is that allah azzawajal mentioned in the quran to eat from whatever these trained dogs catch for you and remember the name of allah or mention the name of allah so if i get my trained hound and i see a rabbit and i tell my hound catch and my hound runs after the rabbit and i say bismillah and my hound runs and it catches the rabbit i could eat allah did not mention the quran i should wash now some schools of thought said the shafferi school of thought and and one of the verdicts of imam ahmad and others say that you have to wash the area where the dog has bitten because it's nudges and some even went further to say wash it seven times with water and one with soil and the most authentic opinion and this is the second opinion which is the opinion of islam in tamiya and also may allah have mercy on their souls say that this is negligible and overlooked because neither in the quran nor in the sunnah we were commanded to do this though the issue of dogs hunting was mentioned in the quran and as also it was mentioned in a number of hadiths so the prophet had never ever alice mentioned it so it seems that this is overlooked and the tendency is what is halal was mentioned what is haram was also mentioned and what was not mentioned it is something that allah has forgiven us and this is part of what was forgiven so we should not look into it and allah knows best yamina says i need an advice how could i make myself more close to allah and have more barakah in my life well i don't know if we've answered this before or not or somewhere else i get confused to get close to allah azzawajal you have to do what allah mandated upon you and allah says in the authentic hadith to my servant would not get closer to me with things better than the things that i have mandated upon him so do the things that are mandatory upon you big and small stay away from things that are prohibited for you big and small and do a lot of voluntary deeds as much as possible and you will get barakah in your life and you will get closer to allah thomas says is it permissible to eat snails snails that live on earth on in water definitely it is permissible to eat whether alive or dead snails that live on trees that do not live in water or live on earth it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that it is permissible to eat as well and allah knows best madiha says lizards should be killed is it so the answer is yes the jacob not uh this serbian the djokovic the tennis player no the the the house lizards that you see on the walls these lizards are to be killed and the prophet said as some if you kill them in the first strike you get a hundred good deeds if you don't manage to kill it in the first strike because they're too quick and fast and they uh uh run here and there but you hit it in the second and you kill it you get lesser good deeds and if you kill killed in the third strike you get lesser and lesser and there was a hadith inside that when the idol worshipers built a huge fire to throw ibrahim peace be upon him in it all animals and insects try to put it off except for the lizard it helped them ignite it so our enmity and hatred to the lizard is religious not because it's a repulsive insect which is but because it helped against prophet ibrahim peace be upon knows best shabeena says what about grafts used for medicine you medical use i think she is referring to graphs not grafts if she's meaning graphs and the drawings that one uses for medicine such as drawing a skeleton or the digestive system or the nervous system or whatever these are all permissible to do inshallah without any problem angel says what about the use of taser on animal before slaughtered i think she means that electrical shocks what's the ruling on that if this electoral electrical shock is used to [Music] sedate the animal and make it easier to be slaughtered this is permissible because it's still alive after being tased or shocked with electricity it is still alive so slaughtering it is halal but is it is it recommended or not no it's not recommended because it is a form of torturing the animal and this is not permissible but as a halal slaughter it is if the electrocution kills the animal before slaughtering then it is a dead meat uh mubasher says can we pray dua in namaz for kids to be better in sport you can ask allah anything that is halal during your prayer so if you want your child to be good in sports because it's a a healthy thing it is a competitive thing and there's no haram involved no problem in that but if you want him to be a celebrity someone who's famous and we know the negative impacts of sports nowadays on the youth and how money is invested hugely when you get a footballer being sold to a club for 20 million pounds how much would you sell a poor chef like me to an islamic center you would not even give peanuts for that subhanallah the advertisements the money involved the publicity the gambling no one would want his child to be involved in such corruption anisha says at what extent a wife can disagree with her husband she can disagree with him as she wishes see marriage is not a prison sentence a man and a wife they live they're supposed to live a happy life so it doesn't matter this doesn't work it's electricity matters it doesn't matter whether they disagree or agree because this is marriage she disagrees with him when he tells her you have to invite so-and-so friends or relatives he disagrees with the way she says i'm gonna cook so-and-so for lunch they both disagree on what to do with the children and how they should uh study or what they should study etc but at the end of the day there are things that it's the husband's words that must be taken and respected she bears a child she conceives a child gives birth she wants to call the child after her father's name and the husband says i respect your father but i don't like his name she disagrees with him who wins it's not a winning or losing it's who's entitled to have the final word in naming a child the father full stop so the the man says no i'm gonna call him so-and-so when it comes to allowing her out she wants to go and visit her sister he says no don't go she says i disagree i'm going no you can't you can't leave the home without his permission you can't admit someone in his home without his permission if he orders you to to eat zucchini you don't like it you don't eat it you disagree and say but don't you respect the hell with you i'm not gonna eat it this is my life i eat what i wish and i don't want to eat this you can't prevent me from eating what i wish it's not simon says so there are things that are related to marriage and to the responsibility and authority of the husband and then there are things that are not so and she can disagree with him whenever she wants aloha's best a final question is from ashraf he says is sunnah to seek to eat salt before or after food there is no sunnah at all mentioning salt in before or after or during the meal i don't know where these people get these questions from well we have four more questions what the heck let us take it so that we start fresh insha allah from next session abu hamza says what about the animals slaughtered by automatic machine most especially for those who live in non-muslim countries well if the animals are put on a converter belt and the guy comes in the morning and pushes a button at nine o'clock and then pushes it back again at five o'clock to turn it off only the first patch is halal if he mentioned the name of allah and if it was slaughtered with a blade if the machines are set to accommodate for a thousand chickens at a time so they place a thousand chicken there in front of me i'm the one operating the machine and i say bismillah and the blades slaughter them the chickens and they're moved into a place to be processed etc then they bring another thousand and [Music] but if it is something automated and i just operate it in the beginning and by itself it comes in slaughters and goes nobody says bismillah but before the actual slaughtering this is not halal is it allowed to eat uncooked meat if the meat itself is halal yes if you take the piece of beef steak raw and you chew it and eat it something wrong with your head but it's hala likes a sushi when they eat fish which is raw some people like to do that no problem uh can we eat crocodiles it's an issue of dispute some scholars say it's permissible like i think shaykh rafi mean other scholars say that it is not permissible and this is the majority of scholars i tend to take a position in the middle so eating the meat is not halal using the skin insha allah is knows best says how do i know um if allah loves me or not you don't this is something that only allah knows but generally speaking if you're doing what you're told to do and you find your heart filled with allah's love and you abstain and refrain from anything that is haram or not recommended and you live according to the book by the book 100 this is a good sign that allah loves you because allah only guides allah only guides to iman those whom he loves and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet insha allah azzawajal next thursday was"
