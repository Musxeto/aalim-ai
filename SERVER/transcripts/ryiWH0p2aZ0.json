  "transcript": "is it permissible to marry a woman that doesn't wear hijab or doesn't wear uh proper hijab proper the hijab properly because in one hand we know that we can marry woman of the book and in the other hand we know that if someone marri such a woman he will be labelled as a daus and duse will not smell the smell of paradise we need to bear in mind that most of the in France wear a lot of makeup first of all in Arabic means acceptance and this is one of the pillars of marriage to have and so hijab from the father's side is to do the proposal I give you my daughter in marriage and the acceptance is Al from the groom side he says I accept her marriage these are pillars in marriage what you're referring to is hijab with an h and I know in France they don't pronounce the h when it is in the beginning of the word as in otel or Alo but this is an Arabic word so we're Muslims we have to say hijab secondly it is permissible for you to marry any Muslim woman full stop whether she she is wearing the hijab or she's uncovering her hair whether she is um a good proper practicing muslima or a sinful openly sinful muslima the marriage contract as in terms of validity it is valid there is not hij and two male Witnesses Muslims Kal the marriage is done but is it the best thing to do of course not would be the person allowing his wife to go not wearing the hijab labeled as the youth the youth is a very big word and when the prophet saidat there are three who will not be looked at or upon by Allah and Allah would not have mercy on them would not purify them and would torment them severely in Hellfire one of them is the deth so when they ask what is the theth the prophet defined this by saying it is the man who approves Vice and indecency and sins with his women folk so this is a broad OD sense a woman who does not wear the hijab by no means is doubtful that she's sinful there is no dispute she is sinful big time she goes against against the Quran the Sunnah the consensus of the scholars de decency uh she goes against the norm of decent women nevertheless this is not the end of the world it's a sin she'll be punished in her grave she's disgracing her parents and her family she brings the worst of names to her tribe when she comes especially if she comes openly on the media and she shows her uh uh Beauty to everywhere but we do not label and stamp her to be women of Hellfire just like that as well as we do not label husband to be a de youth unless she adds to that premixing traveling with men dancing with them going out on uh uh dinner uh business dinners or what the likes okay now you're not a real man you're the youth and there are many women who are hijabi who know that they're committing a sin but they still have Iman little glimpses of Iman in their heart they give charity they fast they do night prayer some of them yes they're confused by shatan he's mixing oranges with apples but nevertheless we do not cross the mountain and say just because of this sin she is doomed in Hell For Eternity as we don't go to men and say any man who shaves his beard is doomed in Hell For Eternity and we look down upon him and every time we cross it what is this oh he's clean shaven so what he may has have Good Deeds 10 times more than you do don't fall in the mistake of diluting sins because of our mistakes or trying to uplift someone who's openly sinning because I have many mistakes that may put me down no no no I'm not doing this but I'm saying whenever you see someone older than you you say in regret he made so many good deeds much more than I did and when you see someone younger than you you have this regret by saying he's younger than me he did not make as many sins I have done I don't go to them and tell them I don't go to someone who's drinking intoxicant or partying in a club and say may Allah guide you you have many things that only Allah knows of you're better than me no of course not but how do I look at people this is what concerns me and I don't want to waste more of your time"
