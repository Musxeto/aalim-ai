  "title": "40 days prayer not accepted if I consume alcohol, should I stop praying, doing sunnah acts? - Assim",
  "transcript": "yes sir okay so we know that when you drink alcohol your prayer is uh not uh you don't get the reward for 40 days you still have to do it though so does this mean there is no benefit at all to praying sunnah prayers such as whittar taraweeh etc and does that also mean that there is no benefit of doing sunnah acts in the prayers such as saying bismillah or reciting the extra surah we know the hadith that whoever consumes intoxicants his prayer would not be accepted for 40 days this is the punishment it does not say you must not pray or because it's not going to be accepted so what the heck i have 40 days of freebies i'm not going to pray anymore no this is not the case at all you should pray five times a day you should offer your sunna you should offer your night prayer because this is expressing your remorse this is expressing your repentance but if you're defiant and say okay it's not going to be accepted then for 40 days i'm off the hook i don't have to pray i don't have to recite the quran i can watch porn i can do sins i can play on well the prayer is is on without caring because i have like 28 days left okay let's do whatever i want to do no this means that your repentance is not accepted and that you're a big failure on the contrary 40 days of prayers are not accepted i'm still going to strive to please allah to pray on time to offer sunnah to read the quran hoping that allah may forgive this and restore my 40 days of prayer hopefully if he accepts my repentance"
