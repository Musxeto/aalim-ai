  "transcript": "Hafsa says is it permissible for investing in share market my brother-in-law does this and is after us to invest as well when we say about RIBA he says he has found out that investing in interest based companies like banks etcetera is haram investing in oil companies is allowed according to him but we say in the end it's one stock market all the money is mixed first of all have some stock market is a market it's like a mall or a supermarket you go in with your case and you put in your cart whatever you want halal or Haram so if I go to the stock market exchange and I buy certain shares of specific companies with my own money I'm not borrowing I'm not hinging I'm not having any margin I'm not doing all these stuff that the these guys use it's my money I buy shares nobody can force me to sell them in couple of days time before the dead end no I can keep them for 10 years I bought shares their mind and the company's line of work is Halong so it's a daily company it's an oil company it is a company that manufactures washing machines and fridges no problem in that and the company itself does not finance its projects through RIBA interest based loans so why is this wrong because you are a partner you now have part of this company belonging to you so if they deal in river you are on board as well yeah but they didn't take my opinion true but you watch in it so you have to make sure that they don't find Nansen riba they don't deposit their money and take interest in on it the line of work is halal and it's your money that you're buying if this is the case then investing in it is had an issue Allah"
