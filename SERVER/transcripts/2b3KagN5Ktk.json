  "transcript": "what is the evidence first of all is many and many is semen or sperm so is many or semen is it pure or Naji's what comes out of a person is either urine and this is nauseous or the methi which is the prosthetic fluid and this is also not just usual it comes when there is intimacy of or flirting with the spouse and there is body and this is yellowish a little bit thin that comes usually after urinating or when carrying something that is heavy or when it is extremely cold and in all of these three are nudges and then we have semen and this is for men and women however women have something extra which is the continuous vaginal discharge which is an issue of dispute in the most authentic opinion is that it is not Naji's and it does not nullify Woodill it is more or less like sweat so when we come to the issue of semen many we have a hadith which is authentic that mother Aisha report narrated may Allah be pleased with her she said that whenever there are traces of semen on the garment of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam if it is dry I would drop it off with my fingernail which means that if its hard substance rubbing eating rubbing it off does the job and if it's wet I would wash it now scholars from this hadith they learnt that semen is pure because whenever there is an impurity rubbing it off does not make the surface or the garment or the cloth pure you have to wash it but when she told us that rubbing it off does the job this meant that semen is pure now how did this semen reach that area that garment was it mixed with pre-seminal fluid methi was it mixed with his spouse discharge this is something we do not have knowledge of but we have the basic knowledge that is whenever there are such discharges on your bedsheet mixed with semen then this is pure because we don't have details of what mother Aisha did may Allah be pleased with her and the content of what she rubbed off and hence we assume that it is sufficient to be removed and if not removed it is still pure regardless of what was mixed with it and this is the most authentic opinion so whether you have it in your bed sheet whether you have it on your clothes it is pure is it disgusting or not definitely but it doesn't affect the validity of your salat if you have it would it be recommended to wash it yes sure but again it is not a determining factor whether your salat is accepted or not because mother Aisha told us that she used to rub it off the prophets arezzo salam garment"
