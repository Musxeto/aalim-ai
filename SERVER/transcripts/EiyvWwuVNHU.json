  "title": "Hanging ayahs of Quran on walls (Masjids, Kabah) Beautifying Masjid with Chandeliers Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "suhail from malaysia says i've read your post about not hanging verses of the quran so what is your take on quran written on masjids or on the curtains of the kaaba etc the answer is the same this is not my fatwa i don't bring anything from my pocket i am not qualified to give fatwa it's the fatwa of our great scholars like bimbas mean and the permanent committee of fatwa in saudi arabia these real scholars who give the fatwas and we just convey it to you guys in a simpler uh language and fashion so that it can be understood was the quran written on the curtains of the kaaba at the time of the prophet were the verses of the quran written on masjids at the time of the prophet islam or the companions the answer is no not only that the prophet salaam prohibited beautifying the messages with colors and making them uh uh distracting to the worshipers as we see today you enter masjids and you're just looking at the chandeliers you're looking at the carpets you're looking at the marbles and when you pray you don't know what you have prayed so this is something that the prophet assad prohibited and the best is when we get the messages back to square one as it started when it started but now with all these things that distract us we've lost the beauty of the salah itself because of the wealth wasted on such things and allah azza knows best you"
