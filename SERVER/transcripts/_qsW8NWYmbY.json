  "transcript": "and she says how to repent from previous sins this requires a lecture you have to quit whatever sins you're doing now if you want to repent from it you have to intend not to do it again you have to have the Moores eating your heart being sad for doing it and for indulging in it you have to be sincere for the cause of Allah and it has to be before you meet your maker before the Sun rises from the West or before your soul starts to leave your body"
