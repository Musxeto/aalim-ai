  "title": "When should transactions (buying, selling) stop during Friday? Who all must refrain? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "recently i came to know that transaction is prohibited before the fuzzer prayer mainly the zuma prayer now my question is when should we stop our transaction and from when we can start our transaction again this selling and buying on the jumwa prayer is prohibited after the imam enters the masjid and says and sits down and the then gives the adhan transactions are prohibited upon whom upon whom friday is mandatory upon so if a kafir shopkeeper is selling a muslim woman even during the khutbah or during the prayer there is nothing wrong in that because neither one of them is obliged to pray so the transaction is valid especially if we are in a kafir country if we are in a muslim country we would force them to close not because it's invalid no the transaction is still valid but so that we do not encourage muslims to act upon this and allah knows best you"
