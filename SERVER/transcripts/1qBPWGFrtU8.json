  "transcript": "I asked you a question online and um it's about Muslims like uh recording and sinning at the same time so does that mean in general we're not allowed to watch um Muslim women like and we should only watch careful women I don't understand your question watching what what like just Muslim women like giving a lecture or something or like they and you're a woman yeah no problem in women watching other women whether Muslim or non-muslim if they are giving something Halal and permissible a woman can watch other women cook for example even if the woman is not abiding by the hijab as long as there's nothing Haram in that session such as free mixing or cooking with pork and wine and flirting with the opposite gender it's Haram for men to watch other women give such lectures whether beneficial Islamic or non-islamic and I hope this addresses your question"
