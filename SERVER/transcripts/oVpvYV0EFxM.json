  "transcript": "to go on 15 questions let's see faisan from india his grandfather's birthday is coming soon so can he congratulate his grandfather who's really sick and his mom is pressuring him to say happy birthday the answer is no this is not part of our customs this is imitating the west and as a dutiful grandson you should have been calling your father a grandfather at least once a week we have a problem with our own relatives my own nephews and nieces don't call except once every four or five months some of them don't even call once a year and their parents are mashallah raichu is practicing but these children they come from a bad seat maybe they've chosen the dunya over the achara maybe or they're engaged in worldly matters that made them neglectful most probably but it's our duty it's my duty to call my uncles my aunts every now and then my cousins i do this to all of my relatives even if they don't call back because i'm anticipating the reward from allah azzawajal and i always give them the benefit of the doubt they're busy so the youngsters are the one who's supposed to call the elders not the other way around and not once a year so if you were dutiful in calling your grandfather apart every week or every couple of weeks or every even month then you don't need to worry about this"
