  "transcript": "under him handle a helper Alamein sallallahu sallim wa barik alaa al sunnah bi muhammadin wa la la Pietra mein polygamy in Islam is something that as usual takes the five rulings that we've mentioned before which is it can be obligatory it can be recommended it can be permissible and it can also be not recommended and it can be forbidden so it depends on the status of a person if he feels that staying with one wife might lead him to fall into sin or he doesn't feel that he's almost certain that he cannot be fulfilled by his wife due to her illness or due to anything else then it's obligatory for him to get another wife and if he is certain that by marrying another wife he's not going to fulfill the rights of both or he will be unfair to one of them either in sponsoring or in other terms that he should pay attention to then this marriage becomes forbidden so it depends but in short polygamy is something that is found and permissible to to be done in Islam and there are many reasons where a person could have to get married to another wife or to a third wife or even to a fourth wife so it depends on the case of this person in short it is something it's a part of Islam to get married once you have the need to do so Thank You chef and thank you brother for your question let's move right"
