  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah welcome to with a profit I'm Ali Coleman we are joined by Sheikh Azam al-hakim from Saudi Arabia to discuss our subject of applying Islam in our lives and looking at the example of prophet muhammad salallahu alaihe wasalam as an example to follow we earlier talked about the wives of the Prophet and his relationship with them peace be upon them all we will turn now to the offspring of the Prophet welcome to the show Shaikh thank you for being with us but like a la fille comes that unlocking a locker may come let's first of all talk about when we use the term offspring what is the Arabic word for offspring when we turn in reference to the Prophet and his very Korea Duryea and this the Varia can be expanded to include the grandchildren and and so on so any offspring is the rear of the processor but what we usually talk about is his sons and daughters okay so these are the immediate offspring of the Prophet that is awesome alright so we know in our from our earlier conversations that the Prophet peace be upon him had 11 wives correct from those 11 wives how many children the Prophet had three boys and four girls so the eldest among the boys was an awesome and the Prophet s awesome nickname was Abu Bassam so his name was Muhammad and his nickname was I will cause him and it was prohibited in his lifetime for anyone to combine these two names but after his death it is okay for a person's name Muhammad to be called above Qasim without any problem but during his life just not to mistake mistaken him with someone else that was prohibit okay then they had he had the second son and his name was Abdullah and also he was known as a pipe up our hair so hose also this Abdullah had a couple of names as nicknames and they all and both died in his lifetime Alice Waters the third son his name of course these two previous sons their mother was Khadijah yes okay bent waited his first wife the third son was also named as Ibrahim and he died like few months before the death of the Prophet erase a lot of stuff it's awesome buried three his three boards three of his boys no well actually more he buried six of his offspring I see and we will come to the daughters Nara so Ibrahim is mother was Maria the Coptic who was a concubine or a slave woman given to him by the ruler of Egypt al Khateeb a lot be good to me typically yeah let me dear friend that sorry mistake ultimately the optic okay and about they are the Christians of Egypt so she was the mother a brahim now as for as far as the girls the daughters of the prophetess um he had four he had Zeynep he had also Roja and he had uncle tomb and Fatima Xena was his eldest and she married her cousin a Balazs ignore a beer and he was her maternal cousin meaning that his aunt hala and her mother Khadijah were sisters and rakia was first married to her father's cousin rota I been able AB and after the prophet Sam was revealed to and announced that he was a Messenger of Allah Abu Lahab the uncle of the processor ordered his to divorce her so he divorced Ramaiah and she married earth man eben half an the third caliph and they were the best of couples in Islam they migrated to Abyssinia together they when they talked about them they said that we don't know any of any couple that were more in love and more suitable to one another than earth man and rakia unfortunately she got sick when they came back from Abyssinia and in the second year of hijra she got really sick to the extent that the prophetess Alam ordered Othman to remain with his wife and look after her when he went to better to fight the idol worshippers okay and he gave him the same reward as those who participated in the battle because of his services she died and then the Prophet gave him a lesson his third daughter uncle - so this is the third daughter of the professor MK - who was given to earth man as a wife and as well she died in the life of the professor while married to earth man so both of the prophet's daughters a E and M costume were married to earth man and both of them died at the time of and the life of the Prophet exercise it's it's not an easy thing for a parent to bury their children's and the Prophet went through this peace be upon Allah masala Salim Ali and it is not easy to suffer calamities and we know that patience is divided into three types okay patience on worshiping Allah and doing good deeds patience on refraining from falling into sin and thirdly patients over enduring calamities that take place and the Prophet told us I assume that when Allah loves a people Allah would test them so the amount of testing in calamities that the Prophet went through sallallaahu are you seldom is unlike any other human being which shows the amount of Tolerance he had because of his great love and belief in Allah the Almighty so these are three of the prophets daughters the youngest of them all is Fatima and she was born when the Prophet SM was like 41 years of age okay so she was the youngest and he loved her the most and Aisha tells us may Allah be pleased with her that no one was so close to the way the Prophet walked talked or behaved than Fatima nowadays we say a daddy's girl yes but she went far away from that expression to become one of the beloved people to the prophets hearts and one of the wisest as well hmm and that is why she is one of the four perfect women of paradise a very high honor the Prophet SRM gave her in marriage to his cousin Ali bin Abi Talib who was the fourth caliph in Islam mm-hmm okay so we've talked about the four daughters and three sons but unfortunately the surviving children are only two two daughters the Zainab and Fatima correct but also Zainab died in his lifetime oh I didn't catch that so six of them so only one only one yeah that remained after the Prophet a son was Fatima and she died six months after the death of the Prophet a sermon this is why Aisha reports on an authentic hadith that when the Prophet was on his dying bed she came and he whispered something in her ear so she cried then he whispered something else in her ear so she laughed so she told her what did the Prophet tell you I some she said why is he laughing I would not tell the secret of the prophet alayhi salaatu certain until he died after his death it's not a secret anymore so she told hasha that he told me that it is time for him to die so I cried yeah but then he told me that you are the first of my family to follow me up in dying so I left or as she said now that must certainly have been very comforting all right so now we know who the persons are who the people are that are the descendants the immediate descendants of the Prophet peace be upon so what this does for us it it doesn't give us a lot of material to work with in terms of examples of him engaging and raising rearing his children guiding them disciplining them so on and so forth can we start please looking at choosing the names what recommendations does a prophet solo song give us about choosing the names of our children and we can move on from there in terms of discipline and so on well first of all the Prophet Alesana son used to love good names generally speaking so whenever someone came to him who had a bad name you would change it okay whether the bad name is a form of praising a person or discrediting a person wait I'm sorry just just to understand briefly if we can this practice of giving bad names to children was that to ward off spirits of some kind as it was at the rationale behind it some of it yes so nowadays you get people calling their children chahat which means a beggar okay and you ask them why what would you do that writes it so keeping evil eye from him yeah so if I give him a good name people will give him a good evil eye if I give him a bad name people would neglect him some try give the names of animals mm-hmm so you can see people names as wolf V or something that is even worse a snake yeah and they think that by giving them bad you know names like this it gives a good impression that this guy is fearful as a not fearful in the sense that intimidating yeah so this was the practice in the time of the Prophet peace be upon him and so he whenever he encountered these bad names he would with a switch and change it okay and even if it was a name of praising so one of his wives was originally called Bangla which means righteous hmm but when you when I call my self righteous meaning that I am praising myself so the Prophet change the Dallas was I'm into Julia and one companions name was sinner I see her hacia before yes so he changed it into another name as jameelah beautiful so that it would leave a good impact on you if I tell you that my name is I'm sinful or I am Shaitaan or you would have our bed yeah that is why the Prophet used to change bad names and this is why he recommended that we give good names and this is one of the rights of our children upon us I see to call give them good names in the States for example they may call their children of the names where they dated in the first time so you get a child what's your name she says Tennessee why is that said this is where my father met my mom yeah and and it goes on this is not the appropriate way of giving names you give names so that your children would look up you give the name of Allie for example so when you're as a child or someone else named Sally and he thinks of the origin of his nemesis our I'll even Abu Talib he is one of the greatest compan of the prophetess Sam I like this name but if you give it a name of an actor or a singer or a deviant person imagining calling your son Hitler he would look like you know doing bad things to others and killing and looting it the rest so good names have a pretty good impact on the integer yeah good you laid a very good foundation for us to continue after our break we will come back to continue with the shake on the subject of the offspring of the Prophet SAW his own Salam alaikum welcome to with the Prophet we would continue our conversation with Sheikh awesome thank you for continued to be with us okay we had a very interesting discussion about names and this culture the Arab culture of the seventh century and the reasons why parents would give certain kinds of names as a form of protection but the Prophet peace be upon him King and corrected that and he extended it to his to his children can you talk Sheikh about who chose the names of his children was he directly involved a solo a salon and just about the naming process well we do not have any evidence to back any either either way was it the Prophet who chose the name I some mmm was it his wife I said was it someone else we don't have any evidence to back this up but the rule of thumb is that naming the children is the responsibility of the father okay so one would argue it's the mother who conceived the child for nine months it's the mother who went through labor and the pains that accompanied and followed it mm-hmm so doesn't she have the right to choose the name she has the right to suggest but the final word again is to the man in command I see who's the husband who is the father who's the child will carry his name therefore we know that it is part of the process of naming that a spouse asks his wife what are the names you would like and then he would choose whatever is best depending on his judgment for example al-qasim was the first boy of the Prophet Isis Sam but the second one was Abdullah yeah and we know that the Prophet stated in a hadith authenticated by the Buhari and others that the most beloved names to Allah are Abdul Rahman and Abdullah so the Prophet gave his second son this name and the third name the Prophet gave his son the name of ibrahim according to the father the the prophet's father alice awesome meaning the extended father who is prophet ibrahim peace be upon him mmm so you see the relationship here of giving good names with a good meaning so that the child relates to whoever he is named after in the first episode we talked about the importance the historical significance of Prophet Muhammad SAW we saw both within and outside of Islam the part of his legacy is that Muhammad is now the world's most widely used name in the world what about this culture of naming is there a certain time period we know that some peoples have a specific time when the naming happens did the prophets also observe that well he told us that it's Lots them that the Sunnah is to name your child on the seventh day of its birth okay so if the child was born on a Friday yeah the seventh day is Thursday if he was born on a Tuesday a day earlier that would be the 7th yes this is the Sunnah however there is an authentic hadith that the Prophet said RA salat wa sallam said tonight I was blessed by a child and I called him Ibrahim so the naming took place on the same night that the child was born in okay which means that do I call my son or daughter for seven days anonymous or like they do in hospitals baby boy baby girl no you can name the child on the first day but you should not delay it beyond vii hmm okay all right now as we said because the profits children were short-lived we don't have a lot of material to refer back to in terms of examples of dealing with miss behavior and and discipline and this kind of thing so we'll jump to ahead to marriage issues in law's dowry what do we have from the record about that first of all when it comes to girls the culture in Arabia when the prophetess um came was that the love of boys as sons far exceeds the love of girls as daughters and this was mentioned in the Quran the idol worshippers whenever one of them was given the glad tiding of a baby girl his face would turn black and he would feel ashamed and he would hide from people this was the time that the situation that the Prophet came to yes they considered it to be a disgrace and one of their heinous crimes that is idol worshippers was that whenever one was blessed with a girl he would bury her alive yeah so Islam came to change this and to highlight that this is a gift from Allah not only in this life but also in the Hereafter how the Prophet said that is awesome whoever is tested by Allah with these girls as daughters they will constitute they will make a barrier between him and Hellfire so the problem with the condition that you are kind to them so the Prophet is telling us that whenever Allah grant you daughters you're kind to them you up bring them well and you educate them well they will be a barrier between you and hell alone admit you to hell so this by itself it highlights the fact that it is a blessing of Allah this is not existing with the boys because ultimately if we experimenter ever they grow up and become women and get married and become mothers correctly the role of mothers is foundational in society in terms of stable family stable societies kenick so III so I think it's very I mean to compare them as a protective barrier against hellfire you couldn't I mean you couldn't get it more vivid than that what about the so we're so have we did was there anything else on the subject of marriage you see the issue is with boys once they grow up they're on their own they work they get married they divorce they would do whatever they want it's not my business anymore with girls is different yeah I raised my girls I educate them I'm kind to them there is this bond between us once she gets married it's not the end of the day because there is a possibility that she gets divorced and she comes back to me so in a sense we're stuck with one another til death do us apart yeah so that is why the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to choose the best of men for his daughters and this is a responsibility of a lot of the fathers that have neglected it nowadays we wait for a righteous person to come and propose while in the end in the case of the Prophet as Sam he did not find any reason to be ashamed or a cause of hesitation to go and address Abu allows in the rabbir for his Zeynep to Roy and um consume for earth man and to Holly for his daughter Fatima he chose the best of men which indicates that this is something that the fathers should do not only that he even was lenient and kind when it came to doubters it's the man's responsibility to give a dowry for the woman mm-hmm so the Prophet a son did not ask for millions yeah for thousands 400 certainly he was in a position to do so of course because he had the best of women yet he chose a very little amount and justified that by saying the best blessed women and marriage are the least in the dowries so it's not a form of extravagance or showing off the least of the dowry means that this would result in a blessed marriage not only that he used to even help his sons-in-law hmm so a new graduate someone who does not have a good job someone who's poor there's no problem for the father to assist even by buying some furniture this is not a dowry for the husband like in the Hindus do the women give men dowries no this is financial assistance and it's a gift to the girl but she's gonna use it in her house by refridge buyer air-conditioning's by a furniture no problem this belongs to the girl not to the man okay well that should unfortunately that we've run out of time we've touched on some important points I think and hopefully will be beneficial for for us and for the viewer we'd like to conclude this episode and hope to come back to continue with Sheikh Azam in the near future thank you so much until next time Salam alaikum wa rahmatullahu but I got"
