  "title": "Is applying kohl (surma) sunnah for men? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is applying from the sunnah for men applying is part of the sunnah the prophet alaihis wasallam instructed his ummah to apply which is made from a specific type of stone ingredients called ithmid and he said that it strengthens your eyesight and it helps to grow the hair in your eyelashes and he the prophet islam used to apply it every night three times to the right eye and three times to the left eye so is it an established sunnah no doubt it is an established sunnah however some scholars seem to have made a condition and that is it's a sunnah when being applied to strengthen your vision and also to help grow your eyelashes it's a sunnah of beautification for women but when it comes to men some scholars beg to differ in considering it to be a sunnah if that applying it would add beauty to the boy to the extent that he would attract the same gender not the opposite gender but this is something hypothetical secondly it has no limits so we cannot assume the worse in people and say oh just because my colleague at work would be tempted by me if i put an eyeliner excuse me why would i assume the worst in him said because people are different no no same gender we're both men applying would not help tempt him or seduce him otherwise wearing nice looking clothes or calming my hair in a certain way if i had hair or looking handsome would also be questionable which is not so this is a bit extreme and hence it is no problem in applying kuhl as a form of sunnah for both men and women in sha allahu azjal"
