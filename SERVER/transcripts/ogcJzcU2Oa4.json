  "transcript": "uh so basically my question is uh I stumbl upon a video on how to do rle so I realized all this time I'm not sure if I did correctly clean my ears or my nose on my last goel so my goel before this I did make sure to have my knad and I did make sure that the water spread throughout my whole body parts I Tred to make it perfect so it's just now that it came to my attention that I didn't do the way the video demonstrated on how to clean the ear or the nose so does my goel valid before this and will my praise and I all this time counted first of all you do not learn your religion from videos or from Tik Tok this is definitely a nogo people with big beards who who come on videos having a big big beard does not qualify them to give teachings to people especially when you don't know who these people are Fidel Castro has a very big beard and a Havana cigar does he does this qualify him to give you tutorials on how to make and W of course not so you don't learn your religion except from trusted people secondly when you performed rul and you've been performing rul all of your life all of a sudden you discovered that you were making a mistake or Shan casts doubts into your head this is not logical your last when you made it you left the the bathroom thinking that you've done everything correct this is the fact any doubts that come afterwards ignore them now next time you do you have to verify whether cleaning your nose and your ears were done correctly or not and I don't know what mistakes you could do cleaning your nose is like what you do in Wood you try to get the water up your nostrils to the best of your ability and blow it out washing your ears without getting the water into your ear canal rather water ing the inside and the outside this is this is what everybody does so I don't know what is happening to you but you should definitely learn how to do and W properly from the Sunnah not from Tom Dick or Harry"
