  "title": "Is it compulsory to complete the whole Quran in Ramadan? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Fatima says is it compulsory to complete the whole Quran in Ramadan a short quick answer is no completing the whole Quran in Ramadan is not compulsory and this is one of the misconceptions that a lot of the Imams of the message believe and this is why sometimes they hastened to recite the Quran per night in like 14 minutes or 30 minutes one juzu so they're like the Ferrari Imam they recite something those followers behind him do not understand and I doubt that he himself understands what he's reciting what are you doing Quran was revealed to be pondered upon to think over the verses and not just to say it like anything like a song or a poem but these guys don't understand the essence and the importance of quality so it is not a must is it recommended definitely as mentioned earlier in hadith above the live number of no ask me a little peace with him and with his father that the Prophet ordered him alehissallaam to recite the Quran once every month not in Ramadan in the other 11 months this is the norm the minimum but it's not mandatory so when we come to someone wanting to give you money would you like me to give you one euro or a hundred thousand no one would say hmmm euro would do everyone would go for the highest everyone would go for the glory now why is it when it comes to Jenna people say for those paradise no is too far I'd rather stay next to the doormat where they put the shoes at the very lowest level this is not gonna work when a student comes at the end of the year and says all what I care about is the passing grade 50 out of a hundred would do I guarantee you that this person would fail and if a person goes for the glory says I want a hundred percent full mark if he gets 95 that's good enough at least he's still an honor student so why is it when we come to the Quran we say oh no no no no no is it mandatory no it's not so I'm not gonna recite it why not finish it four or five times a month try your level best to gain because each letter is one good deed Aleph is one good deed Lam is one good deed mean and each good deed is multiplied to ten and the ten to seven hundred and to many many more folds so why look down upon yourself and not go for the very best"
