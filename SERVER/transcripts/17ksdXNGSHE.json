  "transcript": "and she says is it compulsory that the quran surahs have to be recited in order during salat we know that the quran is compiled of 114 chapters or what we call surah and these chapters are in order beginning from chapter one surat al-fatiha ending with sur with chapter 114 surat and nas now the question is can we replace the order during salat meaning in the first rakah i'd recite surah 50 and in the second raka i recite surah 49 or 30 or whatever something that is before it this is an issue of dispute among scholars and this is known as a ten keys meaning something that is upright and you turn it up upside down this is called ten keys or to go backwards and the most authentic opinion is that ten keys in a particular word is prohibited and can be counted as an act of blasphemy of kufr so rab you reverse it and say the meaning is different and there's nothing to call for that except to mock and ridicule the verses of allah there is a different difference in the ayah itself think he's in the same ayah so instead of saying rabbinas you say an asrab you have 10 keys in different verses so verse number 3 before verse number 2. so you reverse it and also this is prohibited this is mocking with allah's words and verses that were revealed as taught to us by the prophet when it comes to surahs it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it is not taukefiyah it was not instructed to us by the prophet sallam to put surat al-fatiha al-baqarah then al-imran this was not directed to us by the prophet jesus and this was the doing of the companions and they thought that oh this one is appropriate to be put after this one and the evidence and the clear evidence is the hadith of uh hudaifah ibn al-imami allah be pleased with the man with his father when he prayed and offered night prayer once with the prophet isaiah so the prophet recited in the first rakah surat al-baqarah then surat al-nisa then surat al-imran and we know that it is in order number two baqarah number so this indicates that if it were to be an instruction from the prophet sallam it would have been written like that in the quran but it wasn't so it is the doing of the sahaba and likewise the prophet allah himself sometimes recited in the first rakah with surat uh uh and in the second raka washem and the order is different in the quran and there are so many answers to that and allah knows best rishika"
