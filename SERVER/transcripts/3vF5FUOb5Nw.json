  "transcript": "foreign limbs he said the forehead and pointed to his nose meaning the forehead and the nose the hands the knees and the feet so the Sunnah as we know is to place your hands and put your head in between them in sujud and if you put them a little bit back next to your shoulders that is even fine no problem if someone puts them next to his knees this is not according to the Sunnah but did he prostrate on seven limbs the answer is yes then the prostration is good but he is not following the Sunnah"
