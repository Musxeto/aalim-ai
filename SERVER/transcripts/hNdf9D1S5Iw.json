  "transcript": "um my question is uh that um I made of the fast that I missed due to mensis uh the pre um in the previous Ramadan but um some of my fasts have be made up which were missed the years before the previous uh Ramadan so um so am I obliged to make them up before this Ramadan now when a person has missed fasts we do not record okay I have fasts from day 17 to day 24 of Ramadan five years ago and then I have fast from the first day of Ramadan to the 10th day of Ramadan four years ago and when I make up I check which date I missed no it's a lumsum how many days have you missed throughout your life oh I've missed approximately 25 days she and it doesn't matter which which date were of the last year or the year before or the year before that and so forth therefore these 25 days are considered to be a lumpsum you have to make up these 25 days without designating this day is for that year and this day is for the previous year and so on you have done wrong if you were able in the past 11 months since last Ramadan till this Ramadan you had the chance to fast so many days you didn't so when now Ramadan is next week and you're having panic attacks oops what have I done I have so many days I can't make them up which should I make up in the next 5 six days to compensate of this year or that year or the year before no it doesn't matter fast as many days as you can to make up before this Ramadan and ask Allah for forgiveness for the remaining days after Ramadan finishes try to finish all what you have and Allah Knows Best"
