  "title": "Ruling on Cracking fingers ( before & after prayers ) Crossing fingers - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says what's the ruling on cracking fingers what about during uh Salat cracking fingers is a issue of dispute among Scholars so when you do this or you pull your your fingers and you make a cracking sound it's an issue of dispute among Scholars when you are waiting for Salat nothing Salat when you are during the Salat and when you finished and concluded your Salat the most authentic opinion is that it is disliked and not recommended before the Salat and during the Salat there are Hadith that are not authentic however the jurors who consider weak hadiths better than their analogy or their logic they would consider this to be safer rather than sorry so they apply this and say before the congregation and during the congregation this is not recommended we would not go to the extent of saying it's not permissible but it is not recommended specifically and especially while in the Salat because this is a sign of not concentrating I wouldn't say disrespecting but it is inappropriate Act if you're standing in front of someone of dignity dignitary uh for example or someone who's wealthy that you're expecting him to give you something or you uh someone who may appoint you for a job you wouldn't yawn and look around carelessly while he's talking to you and crack your fingers and do inappropriate things no you would stand in respect Allah has the highest example and we should do this as well after the prayer there is no problem none whatsoever because the jurors who claim that cracking fingers or crossing your fingers is disliked they don't have evidence to back this up rather the Hadith in bukhari when the prophet Islam prayed two instead of four out of forgetfulness in the Hadith it stated that after the prayer was over the prophet went to the pulpit he crossed his fingers and put his right cheek on it as if he was worried or angered by something so Crossing his finger after the congregation there's nothing wrong in that and also uh um uh cracking your fingers as well uh"
