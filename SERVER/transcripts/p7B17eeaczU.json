  "title": "Fajr Reminder - Shaytan our enemy",
  "transcript": "usually a reminder after f is not very well comprehended but I believe in this country the people people inshallah are used to going to work and doing their activities so inshallah we will not take a lot of time and inshallah an hour and a half would be more than enough I'll make it shorter inshallah Allah has warned us of our Fierce enemy which is a Shan verily he is your enemy therefore take him as an enemy it is common knowledge among all Muslims that our enemy is the shatan yet this knowledge if not put into practice it has no value at all you could be facing or suffering for from a chronic illness you know the symptoms and you know the Cure the doctor tells you avoid the following Foods you have to go on this diet otherwise you're going to die you know them by heart yet you still consume them will you ever recover never you know the medication that you have to take every single day but you never take them you will never recover and you will die now the Shan we have to know everything about him because you cannot fight an enemy that you do not see and you do not know anything about and that is why Allah asael explained to us a lot about our enemy how he was created when his enmity started before the creation of Adam it started his enmity with us and the steps he take the steps he takes to lure us to his dungeons of sin and of displeasing Allah there are so many Concepts that we can talk about Shan it is needless to say that he is with us 247 it is needless to say that he knows us inside side out he knows us better than we know ourselves he runs in our veins like blood runs in our veins to the extent that the prophet Alat wasam was once walking with his wife safia he was doing she came to visit him in the Masjid and he was walking with her taking her home when two men of the ansar saw him with a woman covered from Head to Toes so they changed their Direction the prophet said hold on she is sa may Allah be pleased with her my wife they said oh prophet of Allah do you think we're going to doubt you and he said Shan runs in your veins and I was afraid that he may cast something in your heart that would nullify your Islam this is how far shatan would go never underestimate Shan and never overestimate your Iman look throughout the course of history how many people he managed to lure and throw into hell and if you think that you have a degree and if you think you have years of experience on your CV then think again Shan's CV runs from Adam's time to today look at how many people he threw in hell with his seduction and with his bad Deeds so how can we avoid shatan if you know his steps with the grace of Allah you can avoid falling into his straps and Scholars say still have an hour and 25 minutes Scholars say that there are hurdles for Shan Subhan Allah he has a number of phases he anticipates he waits for you the highest for him which is his top Target is what is the highest thing that he wants and other than that this is the biggest Target he has if he achieves this he gets his bonus with his enemy with his uh uh soldiers so he anticipates to the individual now sh is associating others with Allah and this is not the only thing he wants he wants to luny your Islam so whether you become a mushrik you associate others with Allah or you become a cfir a disbeliever someone who denies anything of Allah's rulings or you become a hypocrite aaf a realaf not the type of practical NF but the actual nef that belongs in the heart which nullifies Islam or even if you don't believe in anything if you become an aist all of this is okay with him and this go go without saying that Allah forgives all kind of sins except this whoever comes with something like this on the day of judgment he's doomed in Hell For Eternity but how can we fight this hurdle by believing in Allah by accepting and you all know these types of is to worship Allah by believing in that he is the creator The Giver of life and death that he's the provider that he is the sustainer and the owner of this universe so this is r i Am worshiping Allah believing that what comes from him is only from him is the opposite is worshiping Allah with my own acts so I do not give my own forms of worship whether they are through the heart through the tongue or through my actions except to Allah so I only pray to Allah fast to Allah give zakat for the sake of Allah I fear Allah I hope in what Allah has I have my trust and confidence in Allah all of this is part of to believe and to affirm the attributes and beautiful names of Allah as was reported to us in the Quran and Sunnah so if a Believer does this then I wouldn't say our friend but our enemy would move on to hurdle number two what is the most wanted and sought after shik for Shan if he skips this hurdle where would he wait for us and try to make us fall into R well Ria is part of sh so there is two types of Shar and we would not go into details as you know that there is hypocrisy that is major and minor and there is kufur that is Major and that is minor all of these things are explained elsewhere inshallah but true R showing off boasting would be considered one of the hurdles but it is with a as a whole but B Innovation is true and a lot of us look or belittles the B what what's wrong with carrying you know something that we count the with what's wrong with having you know prayer beads with 1,000 pieces doing Allah Allah 1,000 times I have a a car in in Saudi Arabia it's called GMC Suburban that makes this sound when you turn it on the people said that this is special car for because it it remembers Allah when you turn it so what says what's wrong with a little of innovation here or there well Innovation is one of the greatest sins after shik why is that it is enough and sufficient for you to know that the prophet said Allah has blocked repentance from every innovator he will never repent why what should I Repent of what I'm doing is for the sake of Allah I'm innovating for the sake of Allah so they would never repent and whoever innovates he is actually diverting from the straight path and making his new path that would take him and lead him eventually outside the loop of Islam and that is why the Muslims the scholars the companions the prophet warned us from Innovation small or big and he said as in theith of may Allah be pleased with her that whoever innovates in our religion this is rejected anything you innovate that the prophet did not do Allah will not accept it and those who innovate whenever you do something new in Islam then you are one of the two either you're accusing the prophet wasam of not delivering the message of Allah because you say yes I'm doing this the prophet did not do it because he did not give it to us he concealed it to himself and this is accusing the prophet Alam of hiding and concealing knowledge this is blasphemy whoever says that the prophet did not deliver is a CF or you say no no no no the prophet gave gave us everything he knew but he didn't know that this was good for us and this is another form of kufur because you're accusing the prophet of not knowing a you no more than he does sallallahu alaihi wasallam so Innovation is very serious stuff how can we Counterattack this Sunnah by following the Sunnah the footsteps of the Prophet Alam therefore if if a person is a Believer he's a and he worships only Allah so this is hurdle one and he follows the Sunnah to the letter spirit and to the letter then this is hurdle number two then Shan waits for him in hurdle number three which is major sins major sins what are the major sins what's the definition of a major sin a major sin is any sin that Allah put a prescribed punishment for such as killing stealing fornicating drinking into consuming intoxicant slandering these are all major sins so there are prescribed punishments for that by the Quran and the Sunnah or Allah warned Those who commit this sin with a punishment in fire or by cursing them or by throwing them away from Allah's Mercy some brothers say it's okay if I if I hate my mother why it's not aabir it's not a major sin why if I hit my mother will is there any prescribed punishment in this dun chop his finger or take his eye off no so it's okay no it is a major sin because Allah warned us and threatened us that there is a punishment in hell for that so these are major sins now the majority of Muslims fall in major sin unfortunately whenever you say to someone what would he say I'm I'm afraid of Allah I don't kill I don't drink alcohol I don't fornicate what else you want me to do and they think that major sins are limited in seven IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him says that they are closer to 70 than to seven they are even more so do we make major sense do we such as we are the worshippers mallah we are the people of knowledge we are the people of practicing Islam we take a lot of our time and effort to come and attend these masallah conferences we're the cream of the society mashallah do we make major sense yes such as the easiest thing backbiting whenever we don't have anything to do we just sit two and three friends what do you think of sh so and so what about our brother for our neighbor our so and so our so and so and we start talking left right and Center whenever someone tells us we say we're talking for the welfare of the Society of the community we're doing this for the Muslims that's why we have to slander everybody and if everybody's not with us then he's against us who is your perfect example me I'm the best one all of you have this and that and this is what leads people to hell they arrogance their lack of knowledge thinking that they know more than everybody else so if a person abides byed and if he follows the Sunnah and if he has the fear of Allah inside of him and this is the remedy for major sins what stops you from doing Haram the fear of Allah YF why don't you attend why don't you accept the invitation of the wife of the he he's afraid of whom of Allah this is this is what makes Honey taste like crap the fear of Allah it changes the taste of things so that you can taste them as they are when Shan tries to make things look differently taste differently until he changes your nature Sunnah fear of Allah if he could not get you in major sins he tries to get you in the minor sins and minor sins it goes without saying people have a thousand excuse and a one to legitimize their fall in minor sins among them prayer to prayer Ramadan to Ramadan to they expediate what's between them of major sense so alhamdulillah we pray five times a day so it's okay and these minor sins are the gateway to major sins and no one and these are the steps of Shan Shan would never come to you and say listen how about taking a shot of heroin you crazy you're Shan but I didn't think you're crazy I wouldn't go to that so he would never go to this stage he would come to you and say have a smoke or as you say here have a  and if you go a little bit further he goes to hashish he goes to marijuana if he goes a little bit further a sniff of cocaine maybe some crack if you go a little bit further you take the shot this is how he works he never tells you to fornicate but he tells you to mix with women it's work it's Hal I have to work he tells you to listen to music and you find people mallah putting these iPods and walking in the streets and doing this um okay I doubt myself and I I believe you for what you say he comes to you through what you see and these are the passages of Shan your hearing your sight what you take your intake this is how he controls your heart and then he makes you fall into sin so if you abide by if you follow the Sunnah if you have the righteousness in your heart to overcome the major and the minor sins where would he come after that step number five or hurdle number five to Al the things that are not recommended and what are the dangers of the things that are not recommended we know that if we do them we're not sinful but if we do if we do not we are rewarded like the preferred things if we do them we are rewarded and if we don't we're not sinful so it's not a big deal yes it's not a big deal to normal people not to you because doing the things that are not recommended is part of not following the Sunnah so what you're actually doing is not following the Sunnah and what does this this mean I pray I do what I have to do and I'm avoiding major sins I'm avoiding minor sins what's wrong and not comp uh following the Sunnah 100% well this feeling of not following the Sunnah 100% is one of the steps of Shan the minute you feel that yes I can evade a Sunnah I can escape it it's okay it's not that a bigger issue you start to dislike some of the sunnas without feeling without knowing it and by time Shan would cook you on light fire until you are medium rare a little bit medium and then it's well done so you have to be careful not to do the things thatan tells you it's not recommended to do and you find people entering the Masid with their Left Foot Right Foot is the sun it's okay Left Foot Right Foot who cares you find people M mallah growing the beard for example because it's external but if you look inside you will find disasters and in so many times I go to the gym for example and the the the brothers take off their shirts to change a sweaty t-shirt and underneath the hood you see problems jungles of Siberia under their arms you know all what's missing is some monkeys chimpanze is jumping from one place don't you know that the Sunnah is to pluck your armpit hair come on this is the most important thing is it this shows you the double standards we have you have to follow the Sunnah inside out not only in how you appear but also in how you treat people in how you treat yourself in your night prayer in your voluntary fasting in this in that following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam avoiding the things that are not recommended this is hurdle number I lost count five so if you abide by theed and if you abide by the Sunnah and if you abide by the virtues and and and and and the fear of Allah to avoid major and minor sins and you also follow the sunna in staying away from things that are makr or not recommended he waits for you in hurdle number six which is excellent mallah we call it in Arabic which is the best deeds and the Deeds below those so now mallah you are a perfect person you think I don't do anything no major sins no minor sins no I'm on the Sunnah where can he get me and you don't know he comes to you in choosing and prioritizing your Deeds so you come you have two DS to choose you choose the Lesser one in benefit to you he's he's satisfied it's okay with him Arabs usually I don't I think you also do the same when we go into transactions we shoot for the glory so if we're selling or buying we would put a margin of profit of 50% so if we have a deal of 5% profit it's waste of time Shan is not like this like that he's a bit smarter he's happy with 1% if he manages instead of getting you 100 Good Deeds to get you 90 for now it's good and you can see this Among Us for example on the 27th of Ramadan it's after Isa it's time for night prayer and there's a big possibility big possibility that it is and the brother came all the way from Britain to make and to make and after when it's time for he tells his friends I'm going to visit my uncle why this is connecting to the next of kin I'd like to see my uncle see him tomorrow morning see him after Ramadan you're still in the country so no no no no I have to this is one of the Good Deeds I'm it's it's a form of worship that I am offering to Allah he makes him waste this glorious night in visiting his uncle though visiting his uncle is a good deed but it is not the right time to do it your mother wants you to take her to the hospital and you say I have a d malish Mom you can die another day but tonight I have to take the d all the brothers all the I have to be with them your mother is a priority this is what's must for you the rest is not so this is the hurdle number number six the last hurle there's nothing mallah if you do everything by the book no major sins no minor sins no innovation no sh no not even choosing the best always choosing the best over the thing that is lesser he comes to you in the last hurdle which is the permissible things permissible things yes he makes you indulge in permissible things he drowns you in permissible things so whatever is permissible do we have any hesitation in doing it no you want to eat food yeah food's good you eat and eat and eat alhamdulillah I'm full like desserts desserts is good and you eat and you eat and you eat Halal I'm not stuffing myself I'm not killing myself it's Halal so through this you would find that a lot of the things the good things you can do you will not do that is why if you eat late at night you cannot do night prayer yeah I do not pray at 5 minutes alhamdulillah I make with and I sleep every well this is night prayer for a student of knowledge do you recite the Quran do you memorize the Quran and revise it while night prayer well I can't why I'm too too too full people work in business good making money good but they work 20 hours a day yeah for just to put food on the table you're not putting food on the table you're putting food and desserts and jewelry and so many things so he consumes your thinking he consumes your time through permissible things once you are saturated with the love of the dun with the love of these permissible things he goes on to phase six 5 4 3 and the countdown goes on some Scholars say that there is a last hurdle that no one escapes even if you are if managed masallah to escape even if you escape the permissible hurdle there is one hurdle that you would never ever escape not even the prophets and messengers of Allah escaped that to that extent a hurdle by Shan that not even The Messengers nor the prophets of Allah could manage to escape that and what which hurdle is this the hurdle of the enemy of mankind whether from the gin or from the humans you will never even if you manage to escape the seven hurdles he will always wait for you and he will always put someone among the humans to give trouble to you to make life miserable for you you cannot escape this can you have a nice well I wish you can can you have a nice wife I wish you can you you may have but eventually your wife some of these days would be a little bit annoyed of you and you would see hell incarnation in your house so now you say Subhan Allah I have I'm avoiding I'm avoiding B I'm avoiding the permissible things everything is by the book yes but this is one of his hurdles that Allah tests your Iman with so in short we are Sur Ed by this enemy of ours we know his tactics we know how he works we know his working hours we know that he doesn't take holidays and he doesn't take no for an answer if we abide by Allah and if we abide by the Sunnah if we have our trust in Allah and if we always fearful of his traps and trying to avoid them by following the Sunnah by the grace of Allah we will be saved and I pray to Allah AEL that he gives us a refuge from our Fierce enemy and that he grants us power over him to overtake him and Allah Knows Best"
