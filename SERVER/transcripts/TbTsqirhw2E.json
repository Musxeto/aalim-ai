  "title": "Is Quran recited after Fajr witnessed by Angels? What about at other times? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "another questioner says the hadith says quran recited after fajr prayer is witnessed by angels if we recite quran during the day won't it be witnessed by angels first of all correction the ayah does not say quran recited after fajr rather ayah is 1778 suratul israel ayah 78 allah says what translates to establish prayer at the decline of the sun from the meridian until the darkness of the night and also the quran the recitation of dawn indeed the recitation of dawn is ever witnessed the scholars the companions said the recitation of dawn meaning in salatul this is the recitation that is witnessed okay so isn't it witness the rest of the day you did not get the point the point is you cannot understand the quran without understanding the sunnah and knowing the sunnah and this is the biggest problem a lot of those interpreting the quran fall into they think that they have the tools necessary to understand the quran while neglecting the sunnah not paying heed so they don't want to have any thing to do with the sunnah when they come to interpreting and explaining the quran and this makes them fall into a lot of wrong things and a lot of major errors there is an authentic hadith narrated by uh reported by bukhari and muslim where the prophet said the angels they have shifts they have shifts coming observing you and these shifts in the day and at night they meet at fajr time and at assad time and then they go to allah azzawajal asks them and allah is more knowledgeable than them but this kind of rhetorical question to show the whole world and he uh he asks him how did you find my servants so the angels collaborate by saying we came while they were praying and we left while they were praying meaning fajr and asir they were praying in the day and night in the evening this is one of the evidences where scholars say that the athkar of the evening should be after assa this is one of the evidences they use and it's an issue of dispute regardless so this means that it is witnessed because of the meeting of the angels in the evening in the morning and quran al fajr the recitation of fajr at the prayer of fart of fajr prayer is the one it is witnessed not that they don't witness other times they do witness other times but it's like saying it is most likely to your dua to be answered between adhan and kama when when it's raining at the last hour of friday at the last third of the night into hajju while in sujud okay but if i make dua outside of these times isn't it going to be answered the answer is yes it's going to be answered but it's more likely to be answered at these preferred and recommended times so it has a greater and a better value and allah azza knows best"
