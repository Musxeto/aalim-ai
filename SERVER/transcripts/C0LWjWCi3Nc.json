  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 21(How did Prophet ﷺ‎ deal with Non-Muslims? 1) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Allie Coleman I'm here with our guest from Saudi Arabia Shaikh awesome al Hakim assalamualaikum nobody can sit down but I'll have to lie about okay thank you for continuing to be with us sheikh as we move to another area a focus in our conversation about how the people that the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with during his lifetime today we move to the subject of non-muslims I'd like to start by asking a generic question about forming alliances entering into collaborations doing business business transactions with non-muslims any special teachings from the Prophet on this so now abraham and abraham and hamdulillah salat wa salam o allah so allah why he was so happy he won many today who they're back the topic of alliances is totally different than interactions commerce dealing with partnerships these are total different issue for first of all what is the definition of non-muslims okay so any person who does not accept Islam is a non-muslim okay another terminology is a kafir there is another Arabic word which is mushrik but this is people who associate others with Allah so they worship idols that worship the Sun they worship Satan whatever they worship then there are mushrik kafir is a disbeliever who can be a mushrik or an atheist so anyone who does not accept the religion of Islam and the Prophet as Salam as The Messenger of Allah to us he is considered to be a non-muslim okay now when it comes to interaction Muslims are human beings non-muslims are human beings right so we can deal with them we can co-exist with them no problem in them buying from us or us selling to them or buying from them etc all of these were done at the time of the Prophet era solution remember when the Prophet migrated to Medina with his companions there were lots of non-muslims in a sense of Jews who there had a number of tribes by the arrival Benny I know ah but in Noddy year the people in of hiber all of these were Jews and they were idol worshippers as well so the Prophet Adam did not come and kick them all out they coexisted the Companions had partnerships with some of the idol worshipers some of the Companions used to travel to a sham area which was dominated by Christians or to Persia which was dominated by fire worshippers and they would buy from them and they would sell to them so this was okay when it comes to alliances this is a different ballgame okay Muslims cannot have alliances except with other Muslims in the sense that Allah Azza WA JAL told us not to take the Jews and the Christians as allies hmm this is about political arrangements political relationships and military relationships as well see having an alliance mean that I may fight with them in the same army or attack a Muslim country and this is totally out of the question well that opens a lot of doors [Laughter] well we'll focus on a more simpler aspect of it and that is taking up neighbors let's go back to Medina okay after the migration and as you described just now shake that there were pre-existing communities of non-muslims and so the model that the peace be upon him followed was not to dispossessed these people from their land and to force them into subservient ORS subjugate them he had a lot to say peace be upon him about relation neighborly relationships with non-muslims can we open up that part of it being neighbors with non-muslims it's not up to you to choose who becomes your neighbor hmm you live in your house someone moves in and he's a nun Muslim what to do the Prophet is our son used to always recommend us to be good to our neighbors even if they were not Muslims because see at the end of the day Islam we have to deal with it as a Public Relation matter what counts is not what you and I feel what counts is how we portray our religion in so many times and I always tell people this I may refrain from doing bad things sinful things not because it is Haram this is a great motive sometimes I feel I feel well this is not the right word I fall weak but I refrain from doing the sin though I'm weak and I want to do it because people would tarnish the reputation of Islam through me they would they would say oh the shared did so-and-so they would not say awesome did so-and-so as an individual I could care less what they think but due to the fact that unfortunately I am forced to represent Islam I have to be a Public Relation manager in the sense that okay this is not about me anymore it's about my religion yeah likewise when it comes to dealing with non-muslims if I'm careful dealing with you as a brother I'm twice as careful dealing with a non-muslim because I don't want him to take the wrong impression about Islam I'm the love nomar may allah be pleased with him a companion he whenever he slaughters a sheep in his house he would always rien fost the order in the instruction did you give our Joon a bur from it did you give our Jew name until his family are fed up why do you keep on repeating it and insisting on this he said because our prophet I sure am always reminded us and emphasized the fact that we have to give them so not only you refrain from harming them rather you go the extra mile and you are kind to them very blatant yeah forgiving them by trying to look after them like what the Prophet did I serve with a servant a Jew boy who used to serve the Prophet s Sam he falls sick what does the Prophet do I saw he goes to his house visit him and call him to Islam so the first encounter this is I don't want to open a political discussion I'm trying to hold back but the first encounter between Jews and Muslims was a very different one from what we're being made to believe now the situation in Palestine Israel and the struggle to political rights and lions and all this thing this is something new going back to the beginning of Islam it was a very peaceful it was harmonious coexistence between Jews and Muslims that's is that am I getting that correctly it was but as we know through the nature of Jews they break treaties they cheat they would do anything to reach their objectives and goals at the time of the Prophet has some there were three tribes living in Medina been open okar Banu nadir and bono Kaurava been open up are they were let go and kicked out of Medina because they broke the treaty with the prophet has some when they insulted and harassed a Muslim a Nabi woman and then they killed a man who tried to come to her rescue a Muslim so the prophetess Sam kicked them all out Banu Qurayza been another year they tried to assassinate the Prophet as Sam and the Prophet was revealed to that move from your spot because they're about to throw a big rock on your head and kill you so he went to Medina and they were also made or driven out of Medina and not pay for what they had done with Benny whatever it was it's a different story because you fool me once shame on you you fool me twice shame on me the third this was like the people saying in baseball this was third strike and they collaborated and they took sides with Babineau Papa fan the tribe of what a fan and with the idol worshippers of Quraysh and they besieged Medina for a whole month trying to annihilate Islam in this incident that was the straw that broke the camel's back and the Prophet RA salatu salam had their fighters executed for the treason they had done because had they succeeded in their plotting mm-hmm and the idol worshipers invaded mac medina they would have annihilated the population of islam mmm so a mixed bag i'd like to ask you about this tribe of tribe of dowse am I I hope I'm pronouncing yes Lee that was douse they heard the message they received the invitation to Islam and rejected it why do we need to recall this a tribe of doubts were they an arab tribe well first of all to Philemon Amer ad OC he came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam accepted islam went back to his tribe and he called them to Islam and of them responded to him so in anger he went back to the Prophet alehissalaam and said o prophet of Allah the tribe of dos have or has rejected my Dawa my call and they would not accept Islam prophet of Allah cursed them and asked allah to destroy them mm-hmm so that was an impulsive reaction from this great companion but he did this out of the love of Islam the Prophet sallallaahu Selim turned to the Qibla facing the Qibla raised his hands and everyone around him thought that well this is doomsday for the tribe of dos there over with Hollister they're done and instead of cursing them or making duaa against them the Prophet said that a his salat WA Salam o Allah guide the tribe of dos and bring them to me and few days later they all came embracing Islam and alhamdulillah and no one was harmed and no one was harmed and this this was repeated so many times and that the people come to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they would say o prophet of allah curse the idol worshippers curse those who fight us and the Prophet would say I was not sent to curse people I was sent as a mercy to mankind so this is not my role this is not my job and he used to tell the Companions listen those who curse often and a lot will not be among those who intercede on the day of judgement mmm we're ready for our break shake thank you so much we when we come back I want to ask you about Mahad and more I had my hot ok short break we come back and to continue our conversation as-salaam-alaikum welcome back to with the profit we're here with Shaykh Azam to continue our conversation about non-muslims we're looking at how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with non-muslims during his life we would like to turn to a special category of persons who are non-muslims and is it Mahad Mahad yes I like the way you outline those can you give us those those categories of non-muslims see the non-muslims can be a VIN VIN me is one of the people of the book and who a christian who lives on Muslim territories okay yet he pays Taxation which is known as jizya now the jizya is mentioned in surah 9 sorta Toba where they are ordered to give this taxation in order to remain live their normal lives and no one will say ok isn't this like the Mafia said no this kind of protection is different they live their lives they worship Allah according to their rituals and religions but if an army or an enemy force were to invade them or to attack them they do not fight it's the Muslims role to defend them I see and the taxation they pay this jizya is only imposed about over men so children don't pay it women don't pay it elders don't pay it only the working men and it is negligible compared to what we Muslims pay as a cat so we have to pay a lot where their contribution is not as much so we have the Vimy the other form is or the other description is Almora hat mahat is someone who has a treaty between him and the Muslim ruler so he comes for a specific task perhaps an ambassador who no one no no an ambassador comes in ghost this guy can be a merchant so he takes this permission a visa I see from the government for from the government from the Muslim ruler to stay for a month for a year but not indefinitely like the vin Minami lives here and and has a family and he's like a citizen then we have a hobby and the hobby is coming from the word hub which is war so he is on enmity between him and us so this guy is an enemy like the Israelis for example they are the Muslims enemies they are occupying their land their killing their Brethren's and sisters there so they are considered to us enemies there are no treaties between them and us so one would look at the Muslims and start to wonder because whenever you're away from the Quran and the Sunnah you will definitely goof and make problems and fail a big time why do we say this on one hand we have Muslims who look down at non-muslims and think of them as cockroaches step on them kill them there insects humilate them spit in their faces and take their money loot their belongings in possessions this is Una's la m'q the Prophet stated this is a lot of some he said whoever kills a hat someone who has a treaty who someone who's in the country with the visa this is a treaty whoever killed the more hat would not sense and find the smell and fragrance of paradise yet the fragrance of paradise is recognized 40 years traveling distance meaning that this individual would not even come close to entering paradise this is intriguing me mcmean x' that would the Mahad have proof of his treaty his status his visa were documents being issued was it some kind of a stamp what did he carry around to say that he was long ago those in Medina we're not more than three thousand four thousand men so anyone who came to a village a town or a city would be recognized to be a stranger so he had a he had to have some sort of proof or witnesses so it would be announced in the whole town that this guy who is a Byzantine who is a person who is this or that is under the protection of the Muslim governor or ruler nowadays we have visas right so if I go to the UK I have a visa if they allow me to which they don't if a Britisher comes to Saudi Arabia I cannot stop him in the street and bombard him or attack him or he has a visa and my Muslim ruler has issued him a visa this makes it a sort of a pact or a treaty between his country and my country and hence he's a Mahad hmm all right so this is you know looking at the different non-muslims when it comes to inviting non-muslims to Islam this is something that the Prophet obviously peace be upon him was very concerned about and good manners the behaviors good interactions a very important part of that you've given us some examples of how he protected the woman who gave them water at a time of great need and other kinds of things to draw people but in terms of if we were to look at both passive and active forms of inviting people to Islam can you talk about how the Prophet is in that regard the profit is a lot of Sun tried everything to the extent that even in their places of worship in Mecca where they had their idols he used to go there because these people were kafir so he used to go to their places to their clubs and sit with them socialize with them in order to make them listen to the Quran in order for him to invite them to Islam he used to accept their invitations when they invite him to eat honey this is something that people are not aware of a lot of the Muslims as I stated earlier either treat the disbelievers as insects or they take them as best friends and allies to the extent that they may form an alliance and attack Muslims hmm this is not within the parameters of Islam a Jew woman invites the prophet alayhi salatu salam to eat and she slaughters a sheep yet she filled it up with poison hmm she was attempting to assassinate progress and the Prophet accepts invitation he doesn't say send the food over he goes with his companions and he eats from that sheep but he spits it out because he said that Allah made the shoulder of the sheep which he loved most from a sheep speak to him and say that there's poison in me hmm one of his companions was not as lucky and he ate from it and he died so they asked her why did he do this she said I wanted to know if he's a real prophet then Allah will tell him and if he's not a real prophet then I will kill him and we will be at rest from him it shows you that the prophetess undid all what he can to invite people to Islam he used to go to them he went to the Jew boy and he called him to Islam and he accepted his lemon died and he was happy because he ended up in Jannah he would go out of his way to invite them send them gifts treat them in a nice way Ali the balloon Marilla one of the dignitaries of the idol worshippers who died as a kafir comes to him and tells him that you have said so many bad things about our idols and you have separated between men and their wives men and their sons etc what is it you want you want wealth will make you of the richest among us you want a beautiful women will marry you to the most beautiful woman you want prestige will make you our King and if you have this please jinn if you possessed and you can't help it we will find the best doctors for you now this idol worshiper is insulting the Prophet Allah sorcerer though he's talking what did the Prophet do is awesome lose his temper shouted the man all what he did was saying him are you through is that it listen to what I have to say and he recited or an to him that transformed the man totally went back to his people and said by Allah I've heard the priests I have heard the soothsayers I've heard the magician's nothing is similar to what this man is talking this is not from this earth so the way the Prophet used to address the disbelievers allosaurus Aram was not only diplomatic this is the essence of Islam when we speak to non-muslims that we draw them closer to Islam I can be arrogant I can be abusive I can use profanity but this doesn't go well with Islam so the only thing that refrains me from doing that it is that the way of the Prophet at Islam when given that WA to num-nums and I really like the fact is very wise for us to follow the guidance that we've been given in the Quran Allah says be careful about potentially offending other people's and their beliefs and their religions their gods because in their anger and their refutation in their backlash they may offend me and in the process hurt themselves so we appreciate you opening this up for us we've reached the end of the episode thank you again for being with us Baraka love here comes a common law item that concludes our episode and we want to return to the subject of new Muslims in our next episode in Shaw law to look at a few other aspects of this until then assalamu alaikum"
