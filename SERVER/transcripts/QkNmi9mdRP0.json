  "transcript": "now allah says lawful to you is all water game and whatever food the sea brings forth as a provision for you and for travellers even advanced may allah said water game refers to what we fish and the food refers to what the sea washes off this means that seafood does not required does not require slaughtering so whatever you fish and you grab you can cook and eat no need to slaughter not only that whatever dead fish you find floating on the water which you did not fish it died by itself or it was eaten by another shark you can consume that as well providing it does not harm you to do so and the hadith well-known hadith that a a group of people came to the prophet and said oh prophet of allah we travel by sea and we carry with us little water if we are to use that water for evolution we will run out of water and become thirsty can we do our evolution with sea water the prophet saw asylum said the sea water is pure and its dead animals are lawful to eat this hadith here in our book it says maybe there is another narration i remember it since very long time that it is narrated by even abbas but it can be two narrations i'm not sure um so the hadith was about water again the prophet islam tells us how a wise man would respond to such questions imagine the prophet sallam did not answer the question about water that yes you can use sea water to perform evolution but because they travel at sea so he gave them an extra beneficial information so that if it crossed their mind while they are at sea they would remember that the prophet gave them the uh solution so he said to them and the dead animals are lawful to eat meaning the fish you find floating or on the shores you can use that and eat that so this is the first category of halal food generally speaking which is sea food anything that lives in the sea snails oysters calamari squid all of these are halal to consume and to eat you"
