  "transcript": "to hell says if Allah has decreed everything and written down how we will spend our lives and where we will end whether hell or paradise then what is our role in all this and why should we work hard when our destiny has already been predestined Sohail this question is problematic because one of the six articles of Eman actually the last one of them is known as one took me Nabil Madhuri hai-yah Shari to believe in predestiny whether good or bad so to believe in predestiny you have four things that you must believe in first a laws knowledge of what was in the past in the present and the future and what did not happen how would it be if it were to happen to a laws writing of such destiny three a laws creation of such things that will happen and for a laws divine will so you have to believe in all of that in order for you to believe in predestination we you say then why should we work hard when our destiny has already been preordained question number one do you believe Allah is knowledgeable answer is yes hamdulillah do you believe that Allah is fair and just the answer is yes hamdulillah do you believe that Allah Azza WA JAL owns everything in this universe the answer is yes in this case you should act and behave to the best of your ability because you do not know what Allah has pre-ordained for you because if you believe in destiny then you should know that everything is written down but you don't know whether I'm going to do a sin or I'm going to pray 2 rakaats you choose and the choice of yours is already preordained you have a choice you see but Allah preordained upon me to do this I say go to the highest building in your town 20 30 40 stories high look down it's a long way now you jump if allah preordained that you'll fall on your feet safe unharmed and walk away it will happen but if not you will die will you do that said no of course not am i crazy why not say because I know that I'm going to die likewise if you sin you got to go to hell will you send mmm no I don't think I have to send I shouldn't send okay why why do you cook food so that I can eat if I don't eat I'm gonna die of hunger why don't you say it's already preordained I'm just gonna sit and watch if Allah wants to fill up my own stomach Allah would do that so you have to acknowledge these things in order not to allow Shaitaan to play and manipulate your mind"
