  "title": "Did Sheikh Assim ever promote k*lling the kafirs? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "some said that oh this is the Sheikh who said to kill or kafirun how do you say that this is a blatant lie because anyone who says kill the disbelievers or attack them or be violent to them would be incarcerated and put in jail immediately and alhamdulillah all my teachings all my courses my lessons are online and videotaped audio taped the prophet and this is just to show you how big Liars these people are the prophet said whoever kills a Christian or a Jew who has the pledge meaning he has a Visa he is a resident he has diplomatic ties with our country whoever kills a Jew or a Christian will not find the scent the fragrance of paradise though the fragrance of paradise is detected 40 years traveling distance meaning he will not get close to Paradise so any Muslim who cannot get close to Paradise would not be considered a real true Muslim so this shows you the gravity and the seriousness of killing the Jews and the Christians how do they dare say that we encourage people to do that"
