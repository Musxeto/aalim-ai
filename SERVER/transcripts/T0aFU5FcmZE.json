  "title": "Is ghusl along with shahada required to re enter islam after an act of shirk or kufr assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if someone who has stopped praying completely and has also said words of kufur if they want to reenter Islam um I understand that someone who does not pray their sh is invalid so no matter how much say they still not Muslim so if they if they say and go pray will they be Muslim any person who commits an act of kufur or sh has to say the sh in order to revert to Islam performing is an issue of dispute I'm inclined that it is not a condition for accepting Islam so your Islam is valid you just have to repent and say the shahada and Allah Knows Best"
