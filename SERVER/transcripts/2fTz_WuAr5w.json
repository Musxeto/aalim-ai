  "transcript": "Awesome from the U.S awesome says that he has a friend and his friend when he goes to normal restaurants in the U.S he eats seafood and vegetarian food however the restaurants he dines in they also serve pork so when he objected to that and he showed him my clip would I say that for the fear of cross-contamination one must not eat in such restaurants he said to him that there is a mean that states that because one is not sure then he can eat in such restaurants and he's defiant and he insists on eating so now Asam asks the dangerous question should I labeled label him as a kaffir and should I boycott him because he's neglecting your fatwa you want to put us behind bars or what what are you gonna do first of all we don't give fatwa zahri we convey the fatwas of great Scholars to you we ourselves don't give fat to us we're not qualified we just convey what should benefiting the great Scholars of Islam and into their teachings to you in a very simplistic way in a very simple way and hopefully it's comprehendable now you cannot give fear to someone who differs with you in such an opinion over such a trivial issue why first issues of dispute among Scholars can't be a subject of takfir because there is a dispute only things that are agreed upon if he says no drinking wine is okay give the fear after the conditions are fulfilled show him the evidence says show him the whole nine yards if he still insists but issues of dispute whether the hijab is mandatory or not you cannot give on that secondly if he as he says has a fatwa from foreign who am I to go against that fatwa however you have to first of all verify that what his coating is true and it's not true to my knowledge it is not true the Sheikh may say that if you believe that there is no cross-contamination or most likely as they say in Arabic most likely that there is no cross-contamination you may eat but better not like some Outlets they oblige their employees to change the gloves and change the utensils when they deal with pork and with beef they have to change it okay this I know for a system and a procedure I can eat there himself always coats the Hadith of the Prophet when he was asked by his companions about eating in the utensils of the people of the book The Prophet said no don't eat in it unless you find no other choice only if you wash it then you can eat in it and these are the people this is the prophets so it is definitely best for your friend to avoid it but if he doesn't want to avoid it he has his own opinion he'll be held accountable for you have your own opinion that you'll be held accountable for you have no right in condemning him or boycotting him or even labeling him as a Catherine Allah Knows Best"
