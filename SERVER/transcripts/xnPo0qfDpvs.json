  "transcript": "[Music] the more Baraka Alborosie rahmatan lil alamin nabina muhammad in Wahiawa sabi woman be had weston Ebisu neti he allow me Dean Ahmad assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today's lecture is not an actual lecture as usual you know I don't give lectures it is a hadith and this is what I usually love to do bring an ayah explain it bring a hadith explain it because a lot of talk does not benefit you you usually by reaching the end of it you forget the very beginning but when you have a compass that shows you your direction then you can follow that and feel good about it all the hadith of the Prophet array salat wa salam are beautiful and this hadith especially has an extra edge to it and I will explain to you why after we go through the hadith insha Allah the hadith was authenticated by an imam ahmed himself when he made this hadith one of the sources of sharia a little bob eveness area may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once preached us in a very beautiful sermon which made our hearts soft and we wept out of it because if it was it was touching so we said Oh prophet of Allah it is as if it's an advice of farewell so give us some advice so the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam and this is the advice of the prophet alayhi salaatu some to his companions can we as muslims find any better advice definitely not so what was his advice listen and contemplate contemplate upon his beautiful advice he says I advise you to fear Allah and to hear and obey even if an Ethiopian Abyssinian slave is appointed over you those of you who live will see a lot of differences arise so I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Halawa clench your moral teeth onto it beware of newly innovated things for every innovation takes people astray what a beautiful hadith this hadith constitutes in the times we live in times of calamities times of tribulations times of trials and times of fitten this hadith constitutes a roadmap you follow it you'll be saved with the grace of allah azza wajal so the first instruction I advise you - fear Allah Taku Allah what a beautiful advice Allah Azza WA JAL says in the Quran and we have instructed those who were given the scriptures before you and yourselves to fear Allah this is Allah's instruction so whenever someone tells you ok fear Allah don't be agitated and say me you want me to fear Allah yes what's wrong in that people take it as an insult when you see someone and you say oh I fear Allah they get angry they get agitated which means that there is some hypocrisy and their hearts whenever someone tells you fear Allah you say may Allah make me am old among those who fear him Europe but if you feel agitated and irritated then this means that there is hypocrisy in your heart fearing Allah what does it mean fearing Allah means that you must be a committed Muslim abiding by the Quran and the Sunna inside out it means that you must implement the Sunnah in all aspects of your life and not to be selective I like to grow the beard because people when they see me give me authority so whenever I enter a government department they say please please come in the front row and now with the white I usually bend my back assess my ego and all doors are opened masha'Allah it's good so I'm selective but when I come to verses of charity and giving in the cause of Allah I always put my hands behind my back I don't want to pay I'm not feeling a lot fearing Allah means that you come to your life and implement the Sunnah to the letter and not select what you like and leave what you do not like the same example I give in most of my lectures you want to know if you are a true Muslim Islam is a frame islam is a frame your life is the picture you put the frame on your life and cut the loose ends from your life get rid of it now you are a real Muslim because the frame fits your life 100% like a glove Muslims are not fearing allah as the virgin they put the frame on their lives which is the picture but they cannot compromise this end and there are there is a lot of things that they love and their desires prevent them from leaving it so what they do they break the edges of the frame they bring some branches pieces of wood put some nails duct tape you ho glue at the end they have a frame that fits their life their picture but it doesn't look at all like Islam it's a new religion it's a new frame these people are not feeling allah azza wajal as allah instructed and this is why when we implement islam we have to have the balance which we without knowledge you cannot attain the balance what balance are we talking about some of the Muslims when they get committed to Islam they become violent they become extreme and people run away from them and the other side some think that Islam is to compromise the Deen everything is mallesh halal it's a difference opinion among scholars they have cocktail Islam of cocktail they mix everything inside and this is both sides are wrong fearing Allah means that you act like the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to act he wasn't a violent person but at the same time he wasn't a weak person and this is why I always used this slogan Islam is a religion of peace without weakness just because I'm peaceful doesn't mean that I will put my head down and walk in humility and allow you to disgrace Islam and to slander it and I would not reply no Islam is a religion of peace without weakness a religion of strength without violence a religion of pride without arrogance as a Muslim I woke up I wake let me rephrase that edit please as a Muslim I walk with my head up high but not in arrogance or harming people I do not compromise my deem I implement my Deen to the letter with diplomacy with wisdom with kindness with knowledge this is part of fearing allah azza wajal the second advice the Prophet says RA salat WA Salam I advise you to fear Allah and to hear mean to listen and obey even even an Abyssinian Ethiopian slave is appointed over you so to listen and obey to the ruler the Prophet is advising us a road map he's advising who he is advising the dignitaries of the Arabs the best of the best the cream of all the tribes of Arabia brush he's telling them if a slave who is from Abyssinia who you guys used to buy and sell is appointed as your ruler you must obey and listen and hear from him so the prophet Alice awesome is conditioning is training the Muslims leave all your prejudiced leave all your pride and arrogance behind you because your Muslims now and you follow the policy and procedure rather than you follow your own own normal norms you must obey the ruler now this is quite difficult to many of us when we don't have proper knowledge we become impulsive we become angry we become frustrated of what's happening we want change we demand change we want things to happen as we wish not as in accordance to the Quran and to the Sunnah and this is why we see around us revolts revolutions rebellions and so many Muslims once they see it could they support it they go chanting we see demonstrations in the streets blocking the streets they say peaceful demonstrations all of this is not from Islam so no no no this is democracy it's good democracy is not from Islam to share come on democracy there is Islamic democracy mashallah yeah it's like Islamic belly dancing she covers the head and she what is this this is the new Islam that they are promoting now you laugh but you will see it I was once watching the TV in some Arab country and all of a sudden I find that they're having this so-called Islamic show so you think you can dance and women in hijab are dancing it takes two to tango stuff for lover - really what kind of Islam is this you have the voice you have Arab Got Talent maybe Malaya talent and everybody has talent and they are coming trying to change to make a shift in our society and tell you that this is OK there is nothing ok except through the Quran and the Sunnah so when we see these revolutions we're happy we think that this is going to be positive this is going to be good but it is not good because it goes against the Quran and the Sunnah the Prophet said alayhi salat WA Salam my prophet and your prophet he said you will see after me things that you'd denounce that you hate you will see people favoriting themselves meaning the rulers they will take everything to themselves and give a spinach and this is what's happening when you give peanuts you get monkeys you want good citizens you have to give them a little bit more than peanuts so the Prophet is warning he says you will see this after me so the companions who were hot-blooded Muslims started putting their hands on the swords say ok what do you order us give us instruction should we fight should we rebelled should we denounce this the Prophet said Allison no fulfill your duties and obligations to them and ask Allah Azza WA JAL for your rights meaning you have to obey you have to be dutiful you have to give them what you have pledged in your allegiance and not restrict or prevent that but at the same time they're not giving me my rights I'm not getting my schooling my the same I'm not getting my finance my money ask Allah for that so the Prophet I racism is actually asking us not to revolt not to do something that would have dire consequences to it and if you look at the course of history of Muslims you will find many examples when people were living a good life and just because a handful of impulsive ignorant Muslims they turned the tables and now the whole of the country is living in chaos insecurity no medicine no education unable to provide for themselves and their families unable to travel what kind of a life is this they do not weigh the impact of their choices and this is why the Salif used to say when the fitna comes only the scholars see it the majority of the people don't pay attention to it they're happy once it comes and makes a destruction and leaves everyone sees it and acknowledges of its consequences the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whoever sees from his ruler something he detests something he hates he must be patient for whoever goes a handspan away from the Gemara he will die the death of pre-islamic era of jahiliya and a lot of the Muslims know this and turn a blind eye or do not know it to begin with and that is why it is totally prohibited to go against the Muslim ruler with all his mistakes with all his shortcomings with all his theft and embezzlement and favoritism despite all of this you must obey and you must be dutiful as the Prophet said at a solemn only if this Muslim ruler becomes a kafir and the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam you must not fight them until you one see something that you see with your own eyes not people tell you blatant and not probable crystal clear like daylight go for and not major sins so even if he drinks if he fornicates if he deals in RIBA he still what Muslim but if you see with your own eyes blatant cover something that is crystal clear go for not ambiguous not probable 100 percent and number four you have evidence on that that it is good for blatant cover from allah azza wajal not HD hide from scholars no something that is crystal clear only then the Prophet says you may fight scholars added a fifth element and that is if there is a possibility for you to win ah see if I see his Highness or His Majesty or his eminent the ruler doing blatant coup for where I have evidence and there is five of us and he had of two hundred thousand fully equipped I should I will fight jihad what will happen he will skin me alive no problem changing tone of skin tan it's a new tan but the biggest problem is that he will affect the rest of the country with hardship with terror he will impose his tyranny upon them and they have nothing to do with it it's me and my four friends who acted on our own whims and desires this makes it harm because the result is Haram it says I have 25 minutes but this is the end of the day so even if we go on until 5:00 5:30 we have no problem in sha Allah Sheikh Ibrahim took a lot of time ok then comes the warning from the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam after he tells us to fear allah to obey and adhere he says those of you who live will see a lot of differences arise so now he's giving an indication to what will come you will see a lot of differences and the Companions show that clearly may Allah be pleased with them because things after the death of Umar the murder of Omar the assassination of a man the killing of Ali things went very bad but still they there was a Muslim Ummah yet there was a lot of favoritism and people favored others over here and their companions did not receive their respect as they should so the Prophet is telling them erase a lot awesome there will be fitna there will be calamities and tribulations and trials and fitna is testing is something that alot ESTs us with it can be evil and it can be good but it's still a test the greatest of all fitna is good morning hello the greatest fitna of all is a dead no prophet of Allah came except he warned his people of it every single prophet so when he comes may allah azzawajal save us from this trial it's very scary and there are other types of fitten the Prophet says Allah salat wa salam hastened to do good deeds let us all do good deeds quickly why before there come tribulations like pieces of dark night when a man will be a believer in the morning and a kafir by the evening or he will be a believer in the evening and a kafir by the morning selling his religious commitment for worldly gain would him in a fittin Muharram in Hama button this is a scary hadith what kind of tribulation that makes me wake up in the morning as a believer and by sunset I turn into a kafir this makes me afraid for my own Eman and when the Prophet tells us that people would sell their religious commitment they will sell their religion to the highest bidder we look nowadays at so many people who claim to be there is scholars Muftis and we find that they are selling their religion for the highest bidder nowadays you have scholars who are seriously like a drive-through you go to them excuse me can I have two hamburgers and one shake and three french fries and the chef gives it to you depending you are giving it's a drive-through not proper knowledge not commitment to is to religion and the more corruption there is on earth the more fittin you will see and the more fit and they there are the highest in your reward when you abide by the Sunnah because your only way of salvation is abiding by the Sunnah the Prophet says alayhi salatu wassalam ahead of you there lie days of patients a year of sober during which being patient will be like grasping a hot coal the one who does good deeds then will have a reward like that of fifty men who do such deeds some of the Companions said o prophet of Allah the reward of 50 men of them the Prophet said no the reward of 50 of you meaning that nowadays when we are tested when there is fitna if we do good deeds Allah would reward us as if 50 of the Companions did what we had done and this is Allah's favour upon us may Allah shall make me and use that fast on the truth now the roadmap for facing fitten is to abide by the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and the sunnah of the Halawa are Rashidi the Prophet says I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided Halawa clench your moral teeth on to it clench meaning bite your model teeth the back teeth which is the strongest to the Sunnah of the Prophet Allison and of his rightly guided caliphs and listen to it well he says clench your moral teeth onto it and he did not say on to them meaning that the Sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs is part of his Sunnah and they become one and he did not say salallahu alaihe wasalam and the sunnah of one of the rightly guided caliphs but he combined them all which means that they have to agree so that it becomes part of the Sunnah of the Prophet Ali salat wa salam but if one differs with the other we have to go back to the Quran and Sunnah to evaluate for antennas at home if you dispute in any matter refer it back to the paratha to Allah and to His Messenger which is the Quran and the Sunnah so if they the for guide Lee and rightly guided caliphs agree it is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet as Salam without even blinking but if they differ with one another we have to go back to the hadith of the Prophet Isis alayhi salatu was-salam and why should we follow the ha'la'tha because the Prophet is the one who ordered us they do not invent in the Deen they do not come up with new things rather they make each D hat in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah and the agreement of the rest of the Halawa makes it binding to us the Prophet says alayhi salatu wassalam Islam beget began as something strange but al-islam Oh glory be' and will revert to being something strange so glad tidings to the strangers who are the strangers asked one of the companions may allah be pleased with them all the Prophet said Alice a lot from those who are righteous when the people are corrupt and what an honor to be among the strangers now extreme terrorists consider themselves to be among the strangers secular liberals liberal people say that we are the strangers the masses of the Muslims go against this grave worshippers consider themselves to be among the strangers who are the strangers they are who follow the footsteps of the Prophet Allah salatu salam and his companions those who have the conviction that the sunnah is valid for every era of time and for every location in this universe they are the people who implement the sunnah in all aspects of life without compromising any of it and without being extreme in any of it nowadays the enemies of islam are doing their level best to undermine our religion and they do this by what they they call reverse engineering reverse engineering is you come to a topic or a product and you dismantle it so that you can find out how it was designed the original component and then you can have an idea about its structure this is what they're doing to our religion they are doing reverse engineering so that they can find out how to attack our Islam best since the beginning of Islam they found out that if they attack the Quran people would fight them if they attack the Sunnah people will fight them so they decided to attack the carriers of the Sunnah and they were the companions may allah be pleased with them until today this is a strategy fakers mother aisha they slander abu bakr umar uthman all the companions as traitors kafir except six or seven companion salim salman al-farisi and Marberry acid three four companions they are okay to them the rest are all caffeine now others would criticize our religion so they say that the Sunnah is weak there is weakened fabricated hadith so we neglected altogether other front where they attack Islam from is saying that Sunnah is not sufficient it's not modern it puts you back in the caves of Tora Bora this is what you I don't know what tora bora is but this is what they usually say so it sounds like you know this the source they put with fish tartar sauce the tora bora so maybe no this is how they attack our religion so they start to come and say your religion is not up to the fight it's you need to modernize a little bit it is contradicting with one another it is not suitable for Europe for America for Russia for all the kafir countries and the media especially in the Muslim world they open the gates to anyone who comes and criticizes Islam openly so you get people coming with three-piece suit tie clean shaven and his name is Islamic name and they put that he is an Islamic thinker and I don't know if this is an animal Islamic thinker or what I have looked into it in the in the dictionaries I could not find he's an Islamic thinker it's like the one who eats riba each trip I know he crawls around each River wherever he finds it so he comes and sits with a mug of coffee maybe gin oh no no not gin possessed the jinn that he drinks maybe both and he starts criticizing Buhari Muslim and he sits and says that this is not authentic this is unacceptable this is not logical ah hey where did you study come he doesn't even know how to read the Quran wallah here you give him one paper of the Quran just read it don't memorize it lead it and he makes ten mistakes in a line and there is only nine words subhanAllah so they opened the door the media opened the door for these enemies of Islam why they said we want to rewrite history we want to renovate the sooner we want to have a new understanding to the Quran and to the laws of Sharia we want to modernize and we want to purify the Sunna from whatever came into it these are enemies of Allah doing this who's backing them up Dhaka far and the hypocrites who are plenty amongst Muslims there are special American institutions found today and I'll give you an example grand organization are a and D short for research and development established a while ago by the US Air Force now it's an independent NGO every year they give a report on how to fix Islam a lot varkala look at how beautiful life is our enemies are trying to fix our religion and they come up with reports the easiest to understand their intentions from is the 2007 it's so Google go get it you'll find it in English it explains to you exactly what is happening in the Muslim world you don't have to point fingers all what they recommend one fight implementing Sharia easy as that do we find this in the Muslim world everywhere they're fighting the implementation of Sharia why because this is Islam so do we have point zero zero one percent of non-muslims we have to respect them and what about the ninety-nine point nine nine nine point nine said do not implement Sharia they come and refuse allowing Islam to control every aspect of life including education including the media finance politics our social affairs our marital Affairs the way I deal with my children with my neighbours Islam has nothing to do with that keep Islam away they refuse and object to any Muslim state apprising any government that claims to be Muslim and acts upon it not just claim those who claim are many a lot of governments claim to be Muslims but echo of what we see is definitely not the Islam we know they oppose this they call for the empowerment of women on the 8th of March I think they had the International Day of women in South in some countries they've almost celebrated it publicly women came into the middle of the market not wearing accept trunks suits and just covering their hair jogging stretching dancing BBC comes CNN comes look this is proper Islam next year probably one of them will be the Imam in the Masjid seriously this is what's happening in America this is the new trend change the religion empowerment of women why would you like to be empowered sister I need my rights ok are your rights certified and approved by Islam says yes ok then call for Islam said no no I want something extra then you're not a Muslim thank you when you want something extra than what Islam gave you your Islam is the so we have these calls by rand organization they call for the liberty of women the women to be equal with men honey I get pregnant one year and you get pregnant when you're equal how is it this possible something wrong with them but they infiltrate the Muslim community and managed to put this and they call for the freedom of religion so you want to become Muslim today tomorrow kafir go ahead no problem propagate no problem celebrate shake in the Muslim now this is against my religion so they want to change and undermined the infrastructure of Islam and finally freedom of sexuality you want to become gay hetrosexual quadruple sexual I don't know maybe you never know don't quote me add in the session awesome is inventing things we didn't know of that mmm nice no it's bisexual or heterosexual this is all what they have nothing more so they come and want people to acknowledge this to the extent that they're preventing people from even talking against it according to our religion do you believe that some Muslim guys cannot go to kafir countries and say that homosexuality is haram in Christianity Judaism and Islam and if they do say this they either put them in jail or prevent them from coming to their country what religion are they promoting nowadays if you look around you in the Muslim countries you find that most if not all Muslim countries are engaged or preoccupied by modernization of Islam they want to modernize Islam and we tell them why don't you Islamize you're society's instead why are you doing it the other way around you cannot modernize Islam Islam is a religion of Allah Allah is the one who gave it to us and it cannot be changed you change it you choose another religion they classify the Muslims in this Rand report into three categories that we should take care of the secularist liberals in Islamic terminology the apostates they are covered but they consider them as Muslims number two the haters of the shuuyu they're Muslims but they hate implementing Islam and they give country certain countries that support this and number three the traditional conventional Muslims and who are these they say they who do not find any problem in praying in graveyards Allahu Akbar I'm not gonna elaborate you understand they say that the conventional Muslims are the ones who have no problem in praying in graveyards or worshipping graveyards these are okay never ever you find one of them prevented from entering they encourage their countries because this Islam they promote and they call for and finally three minutes and 54 seconds the Prophet says alehissalaam was salam in the last of his statement an advice beware of newly innovated things for every innovation takes people astray we commented on this last lecture and in the speaker's forum I would not elaborate upon it but I will just give you glimpses of how the companions may allah be pleased with them used to deal with innovation a balarama may allah be pleased with him says every innovation takes people astray even when the people see it as good abdullah al masud as jeff seid mentioned in the speakers forum yesterday the story where he went to the message in Kufa and he saw the people making innovative kind of liquor and he said one of the two either you know more than muhammed ali sjöström our prophet and his companions or you're opening a gate of bilal and taking the people straight they said all about the ramen by allah we only intended good and he said to them how many people intend good but do not attain it all innovators intended good but they would not get it or reach it we all know the reward of offering salat upon the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam yet one person in the presence of women Omar sneezed so is that sure and he said alhamdulillah what solder to us allah rasool allah so good deed even AMA said and I say allahumma salli wa sallim ala muhammad but this is not what the Prophet taught us beware the Prophet said erase Allah sermon ever one sneezes he should only say alhamdulillah now those who claim to love the Prophet Allah saw - some would object and they say there is nothing wrong in offering salutation to the Prophet Ali salatu salam if I tell them if you go to the toilet is it okay if I say bismillah our women l hope they will say by allah jalla wa salam ala muhammad do billah this is wrong what are you doing Touche so it's the same thing you follow the Sunnah you're on the straight path you invent some innovate something you will get people innovating other things as well a man once went into the Masjid of Medina and between a van of fire and a perma of fetcher he started to pray 2 rakaats - rakh Haj - rakh Haj - rakh as so sorry dip nelmieux sahib one of the greatest abilene he said my friend don't pray accept two Rakas anything more is wrong because the Prophet Allah saw some prohibited and maybe some of you may not know this it is prohibited to offer voluntary prayers between adhan and yama of Hajj or any other salat no problem pray 20 records no problem further only the sunnah of rally but will fetcher and if you did at home and you went to the Masjid you do not sit you pray 2 rakat the hater message that's it so the man instead of accepting the advice he said Abu Muhammad do you think I'm praying to Allah Azza WA JAL and Allah who will punish me for praying for him look at the logic Ceridian himself said said to him my friend Allah will not punish you for praying Allah will punish you for going against the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this is the most important thing and even Omar may Allah be pleased with him it shows you how strong they were abiding by the Sunnah he was once narrating a hadith where the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said do not prevent the women of allah the slaves of Allah from attending the Masjid this is addressed to the men do not prevent your women folk if they want to go to the Masjid so his son of the last son the grandson of Umar said by Allah we will prevent them because he seen what the women were doing when they go to the Masjid and go to the mall and buying a Starbucks and you know 13 doing this and that so he said Hollis we will prevent them even Omar was furious and he said I tell you the Prophet says a lot some do not prevent women from attending the Masjid and you say by allah we will prevent them go I will never speak to you till I die and until Rome even Rama was on his death bed his son is coming and apologizing and he gives his back to him and would not speak to him and this is why they earned their pride dignity and honor through abiding by the Sunnah not like what we do compromise after compromise diluting our Deen until it is a new dean there is a lot to say about this topic the hadith inshallah is concluded the time has come to an end but I leave you with this word of advice we are living at the moment the days of patience we must be patient we must be wise we must be tolerant we must abide by the Sunnah to the letter we have to in order to counter-attack this vicious war waged against us by the disbelievers who have these institutions after institution they have the money they have the power they have the military they're waging war against the Muslims accompanied and supported by the hypocrites who look like us who speak like us and have names like us so we have to be diligent we have to remain steadfast abide by your religion abide by your Sunnah proud that you are a Muslim but again it's a religion of peace without weakness a religion of strength without violence a religion of pride without arrogance may allah azzawajal make me and you steadfast on the straight path may Allah make me and you among those who abide by the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam may allah make me a new among those whom the Prophet calls Salah who are you Ali Salim to drink from his pool and from the culture in Hawaii you dannika el carro de veau sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad wada he was so happy he remain [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]"
