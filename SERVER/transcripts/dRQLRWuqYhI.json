Britney from outside www don't bring me your duck call that you care although belonging mean a shape on your mangy bismillah i'm off mon amour here e assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh 7 on the day of judgment will be in the shade of allah azzawajal in the shade of his throne as the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave us the glad tidings does it mean that only these seven will be in unless shade no Allah did not limit this to these categories there will be others who will be in the shade of Allah as scholars have looked into it and wrote different articles about it and published different books on this topic does it mean that these 7 will not be questioned on the day of judgment and still the answer is no those who will not be questioned on the day of judgment can be among them and they may not the Prophet told us are a salatu salam that there will be seventy thousand of his ummah of his followers who would enter paradise who would enter Jenna without any question ability or accountability there will not be questioned and they will not be held accountable and he gave us a description that they do not future eyes they do not ask people to offer rakia they have no bad omens they don't believe in bad omens and they have full dependence reliance and trust in Allah so sure they have food to a call on a lot so maybe the seven can be part of the seventy thousand but we don't have the strong evidence that confirms this so that we can say with ease that yes d7 are definitely not going to be questioned on the day of judgment so who are these seven on top on the top of the list adjust ruler and the just ruler this refers to the one who assumes the top responsibility of the pyramid so he's the one on the top he is the king he is the president he is the one that everybody else is under his umbrella and responsibility and the Prophet described him at his autism to be fair and just and with justice a larger created the heavens and the earth with justice allah azzawajal gives victory to a nation even if they were a kafir nation even if they were disbelievers as long as they're fair and just Alonzo would support them because this is what they're doing in this dunya in if a Muslim nation was unfair and unjust a la sol gel would not support that nation and who is a fair and just Imam he is the one who puts things in their positions so he knows where to put everything in its position without any looseness and without any exaggeration he's fair he's in the middle a just ruler is the father of all he would educate those who are ignorant among them he would compensate and be close to those who are poor he would heal the illnesses and the sickness and the diseases by providing to them the proper health care that would not exhaust their income a strong man at the side of a just ruler is week until he takes what this strong man should give to those who he has transgressed against and a weak person is strong at the side of this Justin fair ruler until he avenged his rights and he takes them for him this just ruler if he is fair and just if he is well the whole nation would be well and if he's corrupt if he's unfair then the body of this nation would fall into fever and would become sick this ruler fears allah azzawajal and this is why he is fair and just he does not abuse his responsibilities he does not abused his authority he does not abuse fine in financial terms the Treasury of the Muslims he does not take from the wealth of the Ummah as if it's his own wallet he gives whomever he wishes and deprives whomever he wishes he does not favor any of his tribe or of his people out of his friends because the prophet alayhi salat was said I'm told us that part of not being honest and fair is to appoint those who are not worthy in positions and deprive those who are worthy from such positions and by the way these are part of the signs of the hour a man came to the prophet at I saw something he said what is the hour and the Prophet said when honesty is lost when Trust is abandoned then wait for the hour so the man said how would I know what are the signs for abandoning trust and losing a manner and then the Prophet said that is awesome when people are appointed at positions and they are not worthy of it then this is losing the trust and the Amana and then you should await for the hour to come look around you you find the right man in the wrong position and you find the wrong person in the right position people are not doing their jobs they're not being appointed due to their qualifications and ability they're being appointed due to their limit ism due to their relationship to the ruler and this definitely does not fall under the category of being fair and just ruler so is this only limited to the head of the state no this can be also applicable to a minister who has people under him a manager who has people under him any type of responsibility that Allah gives to you I pray to Allah social that he makes me and you among those who would be shaded in his shade on the day of judgment assalamualaikum warahmatullahi avocado although the lung amina shape on your g bismillah more money more here e mmm"
