  "transcript": "lyric says what is the ruling of the one who fasts but does not pray at all is his fast valid this is an issue that is frequently asked every single Ramadan first of all is it my job to judge people I see many people in my family and elsewhere they go to someone who does not pray but it's so eager to fast when Ramadan starts they say don't fast why you're a kafir you don't pray so the guy says ok from a kafir I'm not gonna fast why would I fast Han Allah okay what harm would he bring you if he fasts nothing but it is our love to judge people to control others now I've often said this and I'll repeat it again the ruling of a person who does not pray is theoretical and practical the theoretical part is the hadith which states anyone who does not praise a kafir the pledge between us and them is abandoning salat whoever abandoned salat is a kafir between man and disbelief or shirk is abandoning Salah all these hadith are authentic in so he had elsewhere so there's no doubt in their authenticity these are theoretical it is like when the Prophet said Allah so son may Allah curse the one who deals in RIBA and who takes RIBA so this is theoretical I can't go to a person in an interest-based bank a teller or the clerk the clerk or the clerk who is opening accounts and fixed deposits and setting the percentage of RIBA I cannot go to him and say may Allah curse you the Prophet has cursed you you are cursed because this is practical so the theoretical part is anyone who does not praise a kafir the practical part is to identify whether this particular individual named I met for example who does not pray whether this particular individual named Ahmed is he a kafir or not this is the practical aspect of it so what's the difference the Prophet said who doesn't pray is a kafir Matt doesn't pray then he's a kafir ah no practically we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled that he knows the ruling that he's choosing that ruling that he does not have any misinterpretation because he might say yes I know the hadith and I know also that the Prophet said as some whoever says la ilaha il-allah will never enter hell so i'm saying la ilaha illallah so there's a misinterpretation here and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles that is not ignorant that is not forced that is not misinterpreting etc and this practical side cannot be done except by scholars the Muslim ruler the Muslim judge to ensure that this individual has fulfilled all the conditions and is a full-fledged kafir going back to your question lyric a person who does that does not pray and fast is his fast valid this is in the hands of Allah soldier we tried to give him dower call him to pray we would not repel him from fasting or say you don't pray your face invalid no let him fasting will only draw him closer to Allah and some how some way down the line he will inshallah resumed praying"
