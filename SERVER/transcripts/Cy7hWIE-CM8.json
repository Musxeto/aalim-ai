  "transcript": "my question is about divorce in the marriage if the husband says statements like I have left you or I am separated from you when he is angry at his life rather than saying statements like I have divorced you explicitly would it still be considered as divorce that is if he doesn't use the exact terms now the second question is we take only one question so in regards to your first question this is uh known as talakul kinaya al-qinaya and it's not a sorry it's not direct where you say I divorce you or uh you're divorced this is something that's ambiguous that may insinuate May mean and the scholars have different opinions upon this issue this is not the time to discuss them whenever something like this happens the couple have to go to a an Islamic Center or to a Muslim judge or to a learned scholar or a Mufti and discuss this issue with him so that he can interrogate them and know what the intentions were"
