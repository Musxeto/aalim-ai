  "title": "Advise for Muslim YouTubers - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question comes from ibrahim and probably it's a request more of a question he says Ibraheem he says can you please give Dawa or at least a video to the youtubers that are Muslims if I understand his request correctly he'd like me to give an advice to the youtubers and if I also understand his question correctly he probably is referring to those who make Clips video clips on YouTube they have a channel and they have people tuning in subscribing and a lot of these videos are not something to be proud of they do not teach Islamic knowledge or give you added value they do not teach you how to make things or about technology they don't have beneficial knowledge or what they do is just sit in front of the camera eating eating my fettuccine or drinking or making something useless things and among the things that the Prophet used to seek refuge from at his salat wa salam he used to say a llama in yahoo to become an enemy lion feh i seek refuge in you from knowledge that is not beneficial so if he is referring to the youtubers who spend time waste time doing nothing then they should fear allah azza wajal but those who do a service to the ummah by teaching them what is beneficial by giving them something that they can use and utilize in this life or in the Hereafter of course they are doing a great job and they should continue doing it"
