  "transcript": "word of Sal night prayer first of all the prophet theth in Muslim was asked about the best prayers and he said that the best prayers after the five mandatory prayers are night prayers so there is no difference that night prayers carry a lot of weight to them and we have where Allah mandated night prayer upon the Believers and kept this for about six months and then it was abated and it was was made voluntary and the prophet Alam kept on praying every single night night prayers on his own each night W with uh would end up with swollen feet sallallahu alaihi wasallam because he used to prolong his prayer like four or five hours standing and praying to Allah and the prophet had saidat that the honor of a Believer is his night prayer and there are so many hadiths that highlights the importance of night prayer specifically waking up in the middle of the night where the Prophet saidat that and thei is Inari that Satan ties three knots at the back of an individual when he sleeps and he tells him you have a long night to sleep meaning he's giving him hope that there is still time before fuder so if even if he wakes up he tells him there is still time and this happens to us in real life when we want to do something for our for paradise and Shan comes to us and say why do it now wait another month wait another year you still have time so the prophet tells us that if a person wakes up and remembers Allah one knot is untied and if he makes wo another knot is untied and if he prays then the three knots would be untied and he will wake up in the morning feeling fresh and uh uh with agility and power but if he doesn't he would wake up in the morning feeling lazy and feeling um down so it is something that a person should not leave we have sister"
