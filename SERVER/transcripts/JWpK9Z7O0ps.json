wabarakatuh we're still discussing some of the invocations some of the vicar that the prophet alayhi salatu salam either used to say or he instructed his companions to say and last night we mentioned some of that and there are others but you have to follow them and you have to look for them in the books of sunnah and some of the scholars say that the Prophet Adam used to maintain saying la illaha illa llah wahdahu la sharika lah the whole milk what about ham do wahoo ala kulli shayin pedir la hawla wala bhutta illa billah la illaha illallah wala na go to Ilya most loss in lihue Dean voila career al-mushrikun allah houma la maniana maha Pete what I'm out here near M&R what I am father JD mean Cal jet and then you go on to say for example ayatul kursi to say hoo allah hoo i had developed a fella put a whole develop business once after every prayer except forfeiture and maghrib you say them three times each also saying what we will have here in sha Allah subhanAllah 33 times at hamdu lillah 33 times Allahu Akbar 33 times and then you conclude with the hundred la illaha illallah w'allahu josh alcala the whole milk or ham to ala kulli shayin pedir and there are a number of many different other do ass or liquor that you make after that but you have to investigate and you have to memorize them so that you know when to say it and when not to say it so the hadith with us today is hadith number 129 are she can't be read it raghs abu huraira Radel adalah an mo reported the poor amongst the immigrants came to the messenger of allah sallallahu ala salama the possessors of great wealth have obtained the highest ranks and the last thing bliss the prophet salallahu sallam said how is that they said they pray as we pray and they observe fast as we observe fast and they give charity but we do not give charity and they set slaves free but we do not set slaves free upon does the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wasallam said shall I not teaches something by which you will catch upon those who have preceded you and get ahead of those who come after you and no one can be better than you except those who do as you do they said yes messenger of allah salallahu Leo salam he the holy prophet salallahu lustrum said extol allah declare his greatness and praise him 33 times after every prayer Abu Saleh said the poor among the emigrants returned to the message of allah sallallahu wasallam saying i will brother in the possessors of property have heard what we have done and they did the same so the messenger of allah allah allah salam said that is a las grace which he gives to whom he wishes so many are reported I made a mention of this Hadid to some members of my family and one of them said you have forgotten he the holy prophet sallallahu wasallam had said like this extol allah 33 times praise allah 33 times and declare his greatness 33 times he said i made a mention of this hadith to abu saleh and he said say Allahu Akbar Oh Subhan Allah alhamdulillah until you reach 33 from all of them this hadith as you have heard is about an incident it shows you how the companions may allah be pleased with them we're so eager to reach the highest levels of reward that they tried everything in their capacity but they were faced with some obstacles and one of the greatest obstacles to them was being unable to spend money for the cause of Allah that is why the poor immigrants of the Companions of the Prophet of Islam came to him and we know that the immigrants the Mujahideen they have left everything they had when they migrated to Medina they were not allowed to take money they were not allowed to take any of their properties or sell or use them as in the hadith of so hype our roomie may allah be pleased with him when he migrated from Makkah he was met in the middle of the way by some of the pagans of the idol worshippers and they intercepted his way wanting to prevent him from going to Medina and they said to him by Allah we will not leave you go to Medina wealthy when you came to us as a poor person of course when he came he was a slave and then he traded and he made some money and there are narrations that he was a blacksmith so he used to sell weapons and make weapons and etc so they told him we're not leaving you you came to a spore now you go out wealthy know so he put all the arrows he had on the ground with his bow in his hand he said by Allah all of you know that I am among the best of archers and by Allah you will not draw closer to me until I put an arrow in each one of you and if the arrows run over run out and I am out of ammunition I will fight you with my sword until I die so this gives them a glimpse of what awaits them and not only that he gave them another and better proposal he told them either choose this Oh I will direct you to the place where I hid my money and where I hid my wealth they thought it over and thought that I well it's better safe than sorry we'll go and get the money instead and they believed him because the Arabs at the time not now the Arabs at the time did not lie even when they were kafir even when their idol worshippers they would not like Abu Sufian when he was summoned in front of the leader of the Byzantium state of the bazaine Tian's he asked him questions and he kept his companions behind him he said had i not feared that people would say i lied i would have light but it's my reputation though i am not Muslim he says my reputation that I'm protecting I will never lie and he said everything that was in accordance to the truth so he told him where the money was and they let him go the minute he walked in to medina the prophet said ali saleh tura be held by you abaya or father of you here this is his nickname your trade was successful and fruitful meaning your trade of salvation to migrate in return for giving them the money this was a good transaction it is the best of transactions and the prophet alayhi salatu salam told him that he did the right thing so the emigrants did not have money at all and we know this and there are a number of stories but the people of a lance are the people in the natives of medina they are the people of the city and they had money so they the emigrants complained o prophet of Allah we pray we fast and our Brethren's do the same but they give money to charity we don't they buy slaves and freedom for the sake of Allah and we and this also indicates that slavery was there at the time of the Prophet a little absurd and it will continue until the day of judgement but it's not the slavery that we see in the West as it was in America three hundred or two hundred years ago or elsewhere in Europe where they used to go to Africa and they would abduct people three people and enslave them and force them to work slavery in Islam is not like this slavery in Islam is only resulting through wars with the non-muslims legitimate wars with the non-muslims prisoners of wars become to be slaves and this is for their own sake because they live with Muslim families and they eat from the food of the Muslims families and they wear exactly as the Muslim families do these are the rights of the slaves and they are exposed to Islam and the majority of them accept Islam and that is why the Prophet said at a solo Simon the authentic hadith I was amazed to see people entering paradise with chains I was amazed to see people entering paradise with change and scholars explained this hadith by saying that the Prophet is referring Ali salatu salam to people who were enslaved as non-muslims and they were put in Chains how after a while they embraced Islam and they were entitled to enter paradise due to these chains because if they were not imprisoned if they were not enslaved they would not have recognized Islam and would not have accepted it therefore the Companions the emigrants complaint and the prophet alayhi salatu salam instructed them to a supplication to allah to a dickerer if they say it after praying then no one would ever come close to them if he follows and they will over take those who preceded them meaning it is so great that Allah social rewards people immensely upon it what is that the Prophet said that is so awesome you glorify Allah you praise Allah you say Allahu Akbar 33 times in another narration and you conclude that by saying la la la la la la sharika lah lah hmoo Kohanga auto collision career and this is the completion of a hundred and this is the completion of a hundred is very crucial why because they have disagreed whether it is 11 11 11 or 33 x 33 x 33 times and the most authentic opinion is that it is 33 times each but how would we say it would we say subhanAllah subhanAllah subhanAllah until we finish three times or should we say subhanAllah and hamd allah allahu akbar this is once to handle la alhamdulillah Allah Akbar this is twice until we finish 33 times this is what we'll know inshallah after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so scholars differed what is best to say subhanAllah 33 times at hamdulillah 33 times allah akbar 33 times or to say subhanAllah hamd allah allahu akbar once and repeat that 33 times it's an issue of dispute and inshallah all is accepted paul is accepted it depends on what you feel is best secondly they differed the scholars how should we say or what would we begin with some say it is best to say alhamdulillah and then Subhan Allah and then Allahu Akbar and Sam said no you first of all begin with Subhan Allah and in handy why because when you say subhanAllah you're glorifying Allah is our gel and this is better than praising allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and the sky is the limit even has a large palani on his explanation too sahih al-bukhari that is Fidel bury the book the great book known as fatale berry which means that it is the blessing and the favor of Allah I was ill to make me understand and this is one of the greatest books compiled in hadith and in fact it's composed of 13 volumes this big and it's full of knowledge and it took a half of the bin haji lelani about 22 years to write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite until it was in its final virgin and even hazardous kalani as we all know is the compiler of brugal maram which is the second to be studied after i'm the telecom in level or degree and he was one of the greatest judge he was a judge in Ascalon or Egypt eben Hatcher in his book fertile body said that the most authentic opinion is that you begin with subhanAllah and then hamdulillah and then Allahu Akbar so the Companions the immigrants were very happy to learn this from the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they went back home however because they were Muslims because they were companions because they loved that their brothers also share with them in the reward they didn't keep this to themselves they were not selfish they went to the unlock the people with money and they told him that the Prophet told the so-and-so and so-and-so so what do you expect that each people did they also started saying it after salah and then the emigrant said well now we're back to square one if we are saying it and then sort of saying it but they have extra money has no use so they went back to the Prophet Teresa lobster complaining again and saying that our Brethren's have heard about what you had taught us and now they're doing the same and the Prophet said that in salotto Sam Valley cthulhu law this is a las blessing or you can say that this is a loss grace the prophesied awesome this is a loss grace he gives it to whom he wishes so this means that there is nothing you can do and that is why scholars have differed greatly to whom is closer to Allah a rich man who is thankful or a poor man who is patient and even though he may Allah have mercy on his soul discussed this and elaborated on it in his book where he talks about the virtues of patients and the virtues of being grateful as there is a hadith that though is not authentic but it's highly regarded by the scholars and it's being used a lot that a man is to have patience and being grateful an e mono sovereign were shukran it's two halves so a ma'am amina claim brought his book to refer to sovereign weather here are two Shakir in order to a Siberian with the heel of the shackling wrote the two are so brilliant weather here are two a shock here in and he discussed in it the scholars who disputed whether who is best a rich man who is grateful he's spending his money in the cause of Allah or a poor man who doesn't have money but he is thankful and patient he is accepting what Allah has decreed upon him and the scholars say that if they are equal in a man and in subber if they're equal in all of the things then the man with the wealth is better why because he is spending it in the cause of Allah and they're all equal in righteousness some scholars say no we know that by paying his money he's gaining a lot of rewards and has a not but at the same time he will be questioned more where he got this money and that is why the Prophet said a desolate awesome the poor are the majority of Jenna are the majority of paradise and they enter paradise how long 500 years before the rich the poor enter paradise 500 years before the rich and the rich are being questioned at the gates of paradise but they're not in hell that simply being questions where did you get this and where did you spend it even if he's a righteous person he would be asked for every penny he has but after that he will be admitted in sha Allah to paradise therefore this hadith is something that we should abide by and we should always say it and do it because it is a sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and guidance is one of the greatest gifts of alonzo gel and allah subhana allah divides guidance as he divides provisions but he gives guidance only to those whom he loves while provisions he gives them to those whom he loves and those whom he doesn't so if you see people with wealth fame fortune don't think that this is a sign that Allah loves them because Allah only loves those whom he gives Hidayah whom he gives guidance do you have any questions yes brother shaikh you said chitchat and gossiping is forbidden haram so what do you say would face book about facebook facebook is a menace that can be used in goodness and before I used to advise people not to enter Facebook and myself I closed my account and recently people insisted that I should do it and use it for the our purposes but until the moment I'm unable to utilize it due to time constraints plus I do not have the technology and the knowledge and knowing how to block certain things because facebook is good if you're making a page calling people to Islam teaching them clarifying some misconceptions however it is not good because if i visit your page and i read something and people comment on it and i see a picture that I like so I press on the name and then I opened the page of that person a he or a she and I visit the photos and I see photos and I see fitna and then i sent a poke or I send a private message and then relationships develop this is haram so if you are able to maintain a hard line and a separation between Islamic propagation in Dawa and chit-chatting this is good if you're able to block the pictures and not enable people who visit your site to go into friends and look at your friends and then select and visit their web pages I don't know if this is possible or not myself I don't know I need people to teach me how to block these things because I have a page and I have a fan page and i have my own page and i rarely use it but sometimes i just post few things and people may like and people may not like i careless but i'm trying my best to do ford out there for facebook the majority of people usages of it is haram the majority because you find and a lot of boys saying interest girls and when you visit assistance page interest boys and they put pictures that are so disgraceful and so shameful and some of them put their own profile picture as women in their bikinis or men in their showing their six-packs and all of this is Haram this is not part of Islamic behavior so it depends on a lot so jeal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
