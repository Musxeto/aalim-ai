  "title": "How to balance between Family & Ibadah / Worship? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um um my question is about how do you balance between family and I let's say men like U we have children to take care helping our our wife and perhaps we we are taking care of parents right um we have I mean we have different challenges at home but then if we go to sometime there's U that's guilty feeling that if we go to mjid then we're leaving our partner our parents at home right so it's a matter of balance how how do we do that okay first of all I did a lecture maybe 15 years ago on peace TV in in mumbay called the balance in Islam I don't recall anything of it but I advise you to watch it it's a very good lecture now having said that the Hadith I narrated about Abu D and Salman your lord has rights over you your wife has rights over you your health or body has rights over you your guests have rights over you so give each its due right is a formula for Success the happiest man on Earth who can balance between all of these and I've said this before I could be the best businessman I have the logic and I have a very clear logic to know what's right and what's wrong I'm not a gambler but I know how to find Opportunities and to reduce threats and where are the weaknesses and where are the parts of strength I know a good perspective I can manage and Lead but if I do this I will be very rich shortly but it will impact my health because I can't go to the gym regularly and I can't attend my wife uh uh requests and demands and definitely not see my children because I come home late and I have no social activities so of course religion I can't pray on time because I have a business meeting fuder I sleep because I was until 1:00 in a meeting overseas in the Pacific and it's 14 hours 15 hours difference of timing so it was a business meeting so I had to skip fer I can't fast three days every month because I have business lunches and so on I have to compromise my religion because there's a business meeting and there have to be women sitting from the other companies and she's a CEO I have to smile and wink every now and then and maybe she will sign the agreement maybe she drinks and okay I have to pay for the liquor and you get my point okay I'm not going to do business because it's a lot of Haram I'm going to be a Sheikh wow I have the ability you know those who are 60 years and older they know the $6 Million Man gentlemen we can rebuild him we can make him faster we can make him stronger we can make him so I think okay I have the ability to teach to uh uh counsel people to do this to do that and I can benefit people I can change lives I can say things that people are happy which means that I have to travel a lot I have to devote myself you know abdah may Allah have mercy on his soul he used to conduct at least 8 to 12 classes a day he was one of the highest levels of that was the ranking that was 30 years ago 18 12 classes a day before fjer after fuder and then after F until 10:00 from 10:00 to 12:00 he takes breakfast and nap and then before after lunch before after before after till then after you crazy this was his daily routine so where did he get this Baraka this time this ability Allah puts Baraka in him but was he a good businessman of course not he did not have time on the social aspect with his wife and kids yes he had time because he was always home bodywise was he a bodybuilder a good badmington player don't think so um and so on so okay he Masters this but nothing else you can be an athlete I can be an athlete I work I used to work 6 hours a day in the gym on daily basis seven days a week when I was young so I did badmington I did squash I have trophies in squash I have medals in table tennis I do bodybuilding I do lots of sports karate aido and Kung Fu little little little but then what I I have to compromise my business I have to compromise my religion I have to compromise my social activ I can be the best of husbands sitting with my wife I do the cooking I do cook excellent Smash Burgers and steaks and I use a fryer to do the steaks beautiful after marinating it you will not eat any steaks after you taste mine I do this and I can sit with the kids and I can tell them bedtime stories I can do do do do but on the account of many things if I go to the Masjid my wife feels heartbroken I'm going to sit with you I'm we going to pray together I'm not going to the Masjid social activities my mom wants me to go with her to my aunt visit my wife is heartbroken no no I'll take the kids to the park Saudi Arabia it's a desert but we call it Park so I do this I do at the end of the day you cannot master all you have to compromise little little little little but be balanced the moment you're balanced you strike happiness and the happiest man on Earth is the one who can strike this balance is it achievable very much very easy and with with the grace of Allah I've managed to do this a lot yes I travel a lot but I also compensate my wife with the grace of Allah I take my wife two nights every single month to Mecca I get her a suite in the Conrad and I treat her like a queen but I abuse her the rest of the month let's let's be frank she's happy she's happy all my relatives I call them at least once every 2 weeks single younger than me older than me I give them a call that's why we have handsfree in the car so my uh uh uh road trip is 15 minutes 20 minutes traffic jam I utilize my time my cousins my NE nephews my nieces my daughters I call everybody utilizing the time I go to the gym religiously for the past 50 years with the grace of Allah and I work out I try to but the Heart Is Made in Taiwan it's not original it's not Japanese so I do have three stance alhamdulillah but it's working till now alhamdulillah I'm not Tony Stark but it's working I try my level best to have a routine in my and this is between me and Allah with the grace of Allah I have not messed it up till now so I'm constantly on the brink of the normal little minimum things the minimum things but alhamdulillah and I'm happy no not complaining I don't have debts I don't have anybody wanting anything from me financially my kids live like kings and queens yes I don't have a property I don't own a house I pay rent for two houses but I have four cars two drivers and alhamdulillah I'm living a happy life is it achievable I know everybody's achieving it but the problem is with the imbalance the moment you are she but I love my family you're going to compromise your Salat you're going to compromise your business you're got to compromise your health she I love to love to play
