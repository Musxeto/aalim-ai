  "title": "Can I use rich wife's money Is it recommended to marry a woman for her beauty, wealth.. Hadith assim",
  "transcript": "appreciate my question is regarding the Hadith that the woman is married for four reasons either her beauty her wealth her lineage or her being and of course the best one is who chooses her for her being but the other three referring a woman from the other three is also allowed so as far as marrying a woman for wealth is concerned then what if a person starts depending on his wife's income or wealth instead of providing her he expects her to provide him what is that allowed first of all the Hadith tells us about what is happening not what is recommended and this doesn't mean that it is okay like when the prophet tells us about the Antichrist and what Mischief he would do when he comes it is not a seal of approval but this is what's going to happen so usually in men individuals may be attracted to a woman due to her wealth he's a gold digger he's looking for a sugar mummy or for her beauty is a normal uh man or for her lineage he wants to have power and authority and have pride among the people or for her religious practice the prophet recommended to take the woman with the religious practice now if she's from a good family and she's rich and she's beautiful you've got it made alhamdulillah a man who marries a woman for her wealth he's a gold digger and this means that he's not a real man no real man would accept or would expect his wife to chip in the expenses and I get lots of counseling sessions from the U.S Canada and Europe of women saying that we work a job or two jobs and we support the family we chip in the expenses we pay for the rent and some of them say my husband doesn't work work at all and I do all the expenses this is not a real man this is a wimp this is someone who biologically can be male but is not a real man and I'm sorry if you're offended sue me a real man does not allow his wife to chip a penny even if she is a multi-millionaire because he has his pride he would not dream of a nightmare that one day she would say in a fight to him didn't I give you didn't I pay for you didn't I did do this and that for you this is the worst nightmare a real man could face but people who are not men there are so many of them and they're Cheaper by the Dozen um"
