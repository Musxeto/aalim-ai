  "transcript": "I think it's on my website I don't know probably is and I said that a lot of the girls do not face this on their wedding night maybe third night fourth night it will appear some of them don't have it because of playing sports riding bikes uh jumping doing things so this is not something to prove a lot of the brothers call me a I'm sad I'm depressed why my wife is so and so and so I just discovered this so I'm thinking of divorcing her how long you've been married 16 years after 16 years now you're complaining say didn't think of it before no then continue in the next 16 years inshallah and things would take place no no this is not right this is a primitive uh Jah way of dealing with your wife this is not a criteria and it was never reported at the time of the Prophet Alam and nobody complained about it so uh uh you cannot have yeah and and imagine who would allow his daughter to have such a condition in the marriage contract if a man comes to me and says she I'd like to marry your daughter but I'd like to put this condition I said get out and second of all who will prove to me that you are a virgin yourself and those who make such conditions they themselves have a black history that's why they think that everybody else is like them so no this is not permiss Mah alhamdulillah from uh uh ium Malaysia there are 50 plus students Mah they engaged and yeah right now they watching ald and expected 100 to 150 later today inshah alhamdulillah and I'm taking another online I hope it's not mixed uh University I hope they segregate Islamic University of course yeah Islamic so another online question If a person can't afford to marry and is also not able to fast due to health health issue then what advice would you give with all due respect if he cannot marry financially and his health does not allow him to fast then he doesn't have any requirement for marriage someone who's completely out of order and he wants to you know add insult to injury but hypothetically speaking that if this person exists and I believe that he doesn't but if he if this person case exists he should be patient pray to Allah to Grant him Health pray to Allah to facilitate marriage to him and and Allah make it easy for him uh sh you mentioned that the parents will get reward if they have the righteous children and whatever Good Deeds they do yes uh if they have a sinful child does it mean that whatever sin the child do no it will go upon the parents no it does not mean that unless you are the facilitator for that sin so if you yourself encourage your son or your daughter to enlist when they're 7even years old in a school that teaches ballet or that teaches music or Fine Arts or acting if you facilitate it for your 14 years old or 15 years old child to go to Europe for two or three months to study English and to live with an English family or to do this you are facilitating Haram and you say I'd like to to get more experience you are sinful because you guided them if you buy your son an 44 in plasma screen and a decoder and and and satellite receiver and put it in his or her room to watch whatever they want without censoring and then say yeah I'd like them to learn English and lose their religion you are sinful and you will get these bad Deeds looking for spouse to get married within their tribe or their uh uh own native people so it's sometime it's uh getting delayed because they want to get married among their own tribe so in this such a situation can they delay their marriage usually yeah um it depends from One Tribe from one ethnicity to the other but if it was postponed and delayed to an extent that is unacceptable yeah what is your definition of delay I have a daughter and those who propos to her are from hypothetically speaking from different countries and I would like her to get married only from my own country my own City because of traditions because of different uh reasons what or how do I Define the word delay I said oh I have to get my daughter married tomorrow why she had not have any proposal for a whole week and this is delay no this is not delay one month one year this is not delay but if she's like 22 or 23 years old and she's not married because no one from my tribe from my ethnicity from my country coming and we have righteous people coming from elsewhere or different Traditions different but Muslims and practicing this case yes you may consider that uh in Chennai it's difficult to find Righteous Brothers and Sisters what should we do I disagree I completely disagree no place on Earth you will find it no no place uh on Earth to mind uh imagination you will find it difficult to find a righteous spouse it will be difficult for you to look and if this is correct if my understanding is correct then this means that people of chenai must form an organization where they can make uh uh matchmaking so first of all they have to be seniors so you don't want 23 old you know volunteers saying yeah I'll make matchmaking and he keeps on marrying 1 2 3 4 and divorcing and 1 2 3 4 and divorcing no it has to be people who are married senior women should be segregated from men so the women section they collect files of women interested in getting married they take the conditions they take the description they take what they think is uh uh their requirements in the opposite sex men have the same and then the de base is matched then the connection takes place with the Guardians with the Willie so the men contact the father they have no contact of okay can I chat can I send an email can I SMS may just to know each other no this is Haram once you do this alhamdulillah maybe you will like be like Malaysia having 15 or 100 inshallah uh engagement uh I want to get married but my parents are refusing what should I do you person no sh question okay in regard to getting married without the approval of the parents it's a very sensitive issue for men it's not a bigger issue because a man does not require his father's approval or his mother's approval he it's not a must in the contract but it is highly recommended to have it for a girl it is completely prohibited to get married without the consent of the garden that is the father if the mother does not approve of it it's not a problem it's not a problem in the validity of the contract however so many times we put the dos and don'ts which are the requirement of the contract but there are a lot of strings uh uh string attached in the sense that for a man when I say that your father and mother's approval is not required in a contract for its validity I would never encourage someone to go and marry against his parents why yeah they are part of your life maybe you'll marry a woman one year two years three years you'll happy you'll be happy with her away from your parents do you think you can stay away from your parents that long you will definitely go back to them you will definitely kiss their feet and say I'm sorry forgive me and they will definitely hold a grudge against your wife because she's the one who made you go away from them and even if you have children they will not love your children as much because they are the daughters and the son of the so-called wife she's my daughter-in-law I hate my daughter-in-law and she Abus and and eventually this would C cause a lot of trouble so I do not advise it though I it's not forbidden it depends from one person to the other from one family to the other as for the girls it is not permissible at all to go against your parents instruction unless he becomes a person who prevents a woman from being married in this case you have all the right to go against him and this would not be disrespect respectful or this would not be a sin it sometimes might be an obligation that you do this why if I were a girl and every time a righteous brother comes to me my father refuses why he's got a long beard his trousers are short he's practicing he's salafy he's follower of Quran and Sunnah he's not part of our uh maab or um he's not part of our innovative uh sect so he refuses the good guys and only accepts the bad guys or the ugly so this is not something acceptable you have all the right to complain and islamically if he is in this state then his guardianship Falls and is dissolved and it moves to the second one the second one would be his father the the grandfather if the grandfather shares the same opinion or he does not exist it goes to your brother eldest brother so your eldest brother has the right to marry you providing that your father Your Guardian is not a proper one if you don't have anyone to turn to then the Islamic judge becomes Your Guardian you go to the Islamic judge and tell him that uh Muhammad wants to propose to me my father refused 10 before him and this man is perfect practicing Muslim the father brings the sorry the judge brings the father and he interrogates him why and the father says because my daughter it's not of your business I'm the judge and you're saying this not not of my business says yes said okay go out and he marries that girl to that boy okay am I being disrespectful to my parents they will not talk to me no problem you did not do anything bad from your side likewise if he forces you to marry someone you don't want you have all the right to say no then he will be angry let him be angry let him hit his head in the wall with all respect to your father H don't be offended but if he wants to do this thing this is not islamically permissible you are destroying your life by marrying someone you don't like yeah but my father and mother are forcing me do not listen to them they will be angry let them be angry they will not make me go out let them not make you go out but do not accept someone you're not pleased with otherwise you will destroy your life forever so I hope this answers the question uh next question we'll take it online we have a question from Islamic International University of Malaysia how to convince parents that one wants to get married in today's society people marry late especially when parents are influenced by the society deeply well this such a question cannot be addressed to every family alike there is no one size fits all so I cannot say okay you can go your to parents and say 1 two three that's it no it depends sometimes you have to tell your parents head on straight to their faces I need to get married but if a woman goes if a girl goes to her parents and says this what will they say you bad spoiled woman you have no ethics you are dirty you why this is wrong if a girl needs to get married she should tell her mother don't tell your father tell your mother that listen I have a problem I would like to get married if a boy needs to get married tell your father and tell your mother it's it's the same the mother usually is Happy the father is usually the one rejecting this said no no finish your gradu graduate from University work and and and and you know save some money and then get married when you're 50 45 this is not logical where I come from in sou Arabia I promote men to get married when they're 18 years old just after high school or maybe in high school providing huh not any boy providing they are mature sometimes you get a girl who is 15 years old but mallah she is mature a woman on her own she goes and does the dishes no one has to force her she sweeps the floor she cooks food she does her homework all the time you go to her room you'll find the bed is mallah made and her clothes after getting it from the laundry folded and ironed and put in their places that's a proper girl She's Fit to get married sometimes you get women girls who are 25 years of age and still sleeping next to their Barbies so still she's not mature likewise men you find boys who are 18 years of age but but mallah when they speak you find that there's sense there's wisdom there's they're you know mature they're not uh uh always rushing things so these are sensible people to get married sometimes you get 25 27 28 years of age and you find them looking everywhere you not not settled whatever they do they just they're hyper and they cannot make a good decision these are not sensible to get married to so uh what was the question advising someone who wants to get married or yeah yeah so you should go to your parents and and communicate with them tell them I always support this and we have a lot of the families the majority of of family say until he finishes his university this age is the most critical age from 17 till 23 it's very critical and if you tell the boy wait until you're 23 years old his life can virtually change 180° from being praying in the Masjid and going to and so on in the University he goes 180° to girls and drugs and partying and clubbing Etc and I tell the parents a if you can feed your son another mouth would not harm you it's not going to cost that yeah it's it's your daughter so feeding her as well is not going to cost you a lot and but this would preserve your son's religion and Iman yeah inshah take take up the final question before we break up for the break inah one last question I'm reading out the question okay I hope your wife is not here you see yes oh sorry I apologize okay I'm newly married I love the guy and I converted to Islam I love my husband and Islam that's why I'm married but I feel very difficult to live as a Muslim the life is very difficult I love Islam but I couldn't but I couldn't what is the solution how to improve myself this has nothing to do with marriage yeah this question has nothing to do with marriage a sister a revert that is finding life difficult life is difficult you have to admit life is difficult in this life Allah created us to worship Him and in this life Allah created us to be tested so life cannot go on without illnesses without poverty without problems life cannot go on living as if it's beautiful in its Paradise you have to have calamities even the best of creation sallallahu alaihi wasallam had calamities all types physical mental all types he was attacked his teeth was broken in the uh uh Battle of he wounded and bleeded he was mentally also abused when they slandered his beloved wife for one month they were saying that she committed adultery with safan may Allah be pleased with them and he could not prove it wrong or right for one month so it's torturing it's calamities it's testing from Allah to his beloved Prophet you are no better you have to be tested but our problem our biggest problem is our perception of things you find a person with calamities and another person with the same calamities however you find this person very pleased and the moderators of this beautiful seminar are Breaking All the Rules by having mobile phone on now no problem this is not part of the question the answer so our problem is with our perception how we look at things this man with the same calamities he's satisfied the other one with the same calamities he's complaining so the problem is not in life my sister or my daughter the problem is not in your religion which is Islam the problem is in your psychology the problem is your perception to things if you look at the cup when it's this full and say it's half empty you're pessimistic if you say it's half full you're optimistic and it's the same cup so you should look at things in a different way you are only observing the shortcomings you're only observing the calamities but when you look at the whole picture you will see that Allah has blessed you with so many things you seem to neglect sometimes you may think think that I'm crazy huh sometimes I go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and not turn on the lights complete darkness and I try to answer the call of nature in complete darkness why is that to appreciate the vision the blessing of Allah of my sight and believe me I go out and I say alhamdulillah when I go out and drive in the car I observe those around me two days ago I was Landing in the airplane and I passed over the houses in chenai and the makeshift houses and you know I don't know what you call it the slza and as I was passing by a a a thought came into my mind that almost blew it away everyone in these houses have needs have requirements and Allah is fulfilling them one has problems with his children going to school the other one his wife is in hospital the third one is jobless for 6 months the fourth one is looking for food the seven the hundred the Thousand the millions and as I go by who takes care of all of these Allah and this fills my heart with IM to know that I'm I'm worshiping the one who takes care of all of us his knowledge is so vast and huge to the extent that if a leave of a tree falls which is one in a million one in a a billion one in a trillion one in countless number of leaves Allah knows it and knows its trajectory and it's the way it the spiral way it moves and knows exactly on how many particles of sand it falls on Allah's knowledge is not like ours if you look at this way of looking at life you will be satisfied and once you are satisfied no matter how poor you are no matter how ugly your husband maybe this is why you're complaining no matter how ugly your husband is no matter how difficult your life is once you appreciate that Allah has guided you to Islam once you appreciate that Allah has given you health and giving you wealth and giving you everything you wished for except one or two things then you will look at things differently and Allah knows rest"
