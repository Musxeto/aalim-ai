  "transcript": "my question is there is an online educational course consisting of video lectures which is paid so i bought it now after some time it will expire so i saw that some people pirated their videos and uploaded them on youtube so after my post expires can i watch those videos as they are present on youtube or is it much dirty by it it seems to me that as long as you did not hack this course and that you have paid for it fully that you can watch these videos without any problem inshaallah"
