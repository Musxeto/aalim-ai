  "transcript": "foreign if someone became overweight not because he has this sickness but he eats a lot and doesn't go to Sport and because of his overweight he becomes much more lazier and he has more difficulty making it bad that's like prayer where even some people they cannot even still standing in the prayer and they need to sit and they get a higher chance to get sickness and illness so because of such reason does it become for such people mandatory to go to diet and make Sports so they get more fit and gets more healthier and gets less lazier well to answer your question CD I would ask you a question r old fat people who do not watch their diet as you have described yes or no um not no no no which means that it's not a well-known fact that one plus one equals two in these cases I could be overeating I could be lazy I could be not working out and I enjoy eating junk food but I'm as fit and strong as a bull and if needed I could fight six or seven people while other skinny people who've watched their diets and do the whole nine yards simply can't do these things and when they pray talawih they feel pain and and weakness in their knees and in the back and they have to sit and so this is not a fixed case there were many companions who were overweight or at least a bit chubby and having a big belly this did not deter them from fighting in the cause of Allah at Wars and be gallant and and brave and and strong so I cannot or no one can say oh you're sinful for being overweight your sinful for not hitting the gym you're sinful for not watching your diet no would it be a recommended thing to do of course everyone is instructed and advised to take care of his health where did you get this from Sheikh from the Hadith may Allah be pleased with a man with his father take advantage of five before five your health before your illness your youth before your old age your wealth before your poverty your spare time before being preoccupied and another thing I keep forgetting it when I translate into English so there are things that you should make the best of your health before your illness your youth before your old age so many things now I wish I picked up years back so it would have continued with me today now I can't do them I'm too old or at least I think I'm too old so you have to do your level best but would I grade others who are not doing it as sinful no of course not this is not sinful and Allah Knows Best"
