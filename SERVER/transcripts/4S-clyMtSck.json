  "title": "Imam is lazy & makes mistakes in pronunciation (Fateha) what to do? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if the Imam is sometimes lazy or maybe he doesn't know how to decide properly so if the IM recites loely at like and says like so like or that he say sub like so what is the ruling on this there are letters that are close in proximity when being pronounced such as of course the appropriate way is to say but sometimes the Arabs even say and not so the scholar said that because of the proximity of the place where these two letters come out they may sound similar this is permissible it doesn't change the meaning however when it is and he says some Arabs even like from Egypt and the lik no this is totally unacceptable and the prayer is invalid because you've changeed a letter drastically in the Quran when you have the ability this is unlike someone from Bangladesh who is unable to pronounce the letters correctly so his prayer is valid because this is the best of his ability someone who just embraced Islam he cannot say he said not this is totally fine because this is the best of his ability and Allah knows best and we have to be a bit cautious because a lot of the Muslims nowadays are asking these questions and in so many of these scenarios it's only their heads camouflaging to them that he did not say the right uh uh letter in one of the masjids I was praying the other day the IM said one of the people in behind him said correcting him what is this and this guy is insisting that he's right and everybody else is wrong and this is yeah problematic the man's prayer can be invalidated by him interfering in something he has no knowledge also be careful"
