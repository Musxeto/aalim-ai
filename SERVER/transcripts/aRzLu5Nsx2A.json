  "transcript": "brother muhammad from germany uh my question is that i'm just a student and i want to marry and the problem is that the parents of the girl i want to marry want to accept me because as i don't have anything and i can refrain from my desires as i am afraid of committing zina and i really wish to marry and what shall i do okay um first of all if you are unable to get married due to financial reasons or due to inability physically the prophet has ordered you are to sell them too fast so if you're unable to do that financially and you cannot blame the parents of the girl refusing to marry their daughter to you because every father wants to get his daughter married to someone who would take care of her not to bring access baggage and instead of providing for his own daughter he provides for her and for you as well so definitely if you're irresponsible or not fit to take the responsibility of your wife nobody is going to get you married unless unless you look for someone who's like 40 or 50 years of age and no one is interested in marrying her and she wants to get married to fulfill her natural rights so she can be temporarily as your sugar mummy instead of sugar daddy in this case yeah you may find someone who's really desperate and would take you in temporarily until you graduate and can find a job and then provide for her and this is totally fine in sha allah make things easy for you"
