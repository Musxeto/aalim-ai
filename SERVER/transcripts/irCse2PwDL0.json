  "transcript": "uh basically I have two questions first no you can have only one okay okay once I had to lead a prayer as an Imam with a single person an elderly man who was a blind follower of hanafi maab while praying with him I intentionally followed the hanafi practices omiting certain Sunnah like Rising hands placing them on the cheste uh I did this to prevent any potential trouble or confusion on his bir as I was concerned he might from form a negative opinion about my fear or doubt the validity of his own however uh I'm now reflecting on whether this action could be a considered uh shik as a left certain for the sake of it no this is not shik if it was made with the intention to um gather hearts and not distract them and deviate them there is no problem in that you've lost the reward of following the Sunnah but there is no shik in that inshallah"
