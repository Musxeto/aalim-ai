  "title": "Will the appearance of Surayya star on 12th May remove the COVID-19 Pandemic? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we have one question from brother Bilal and Bilal says we came across many audios and videos about Surya celestial object or a star which people are saying that it will appear in the second week of May and covered 19 will go away there is a reference also in motion until Imam Ahmed our question is how should we how should we understand all of this will the appearance of this star remove illness and pandemic though we don't believe in stars well allah azza wajal mentioned that the stars are signs in the heavens to know your directions through and also the stars are known to be signs of time so we know the seasons that they come when they appear or disappear and the hadith Bilal is referring to a lot of the people had made audios and videos about it and it speaks about the uplifting of any defect of any pandemic but it is referring to such defects in fruits so by the end of winter and the beginning of month which is mid of May almost this shows that it is about summertime and most likely the fruits would blossom and it would not have any defect because the time of defect usually is during winter or a bit into spring so the hadith is referring to time that when the season changes then most likely the defects of fruit will not appear and hence you can sell it but some scholars or some people cascaded this to all pandemics and this is totally wrong this is not correct because pandemics have nothing to do with a star or a planet appearing or disappearing the prophet once alayhi salat wa sallam prayed fetcher with his congregation after a rainy night and a man and after that the prayer was over the Prophet Alice Alice I'm said to the congregation allah azza wajal revealed to me that tonight this morning some of my servants has believed in me and disbelieved in the signs or the stars and some has have believed in the stars and disbelieved in me then the Prophet explained those who said we were rained yesterday the rain fell yesterday because of the star so and so these people believe in the Stars and they disbelieve in me and whoever said that we were or we had the rain fall due to a large favor and grace then they believed in me and they disbelieve in the kawaki or in the stars or the the whatever it is so this shows you that this hadith is not at all related to covet 19 we're hopeful that allah azza wajal favor and blessing upon us would uplift it even before that and Allah knows best"
