  "transcript": "uh she my question is like uh are we are we hold accountable for for actions when we are half asleep like sometimes when I wake up and I'm not completely conscious I may say bad words or do some bad actions but like then I stop as soon as I discover what I'm what I'm doing so my question is like what's the ru in on that you are held accountable to whatever you do intentionally half a sleep is different from a person to the other some people when they're half asleep they may wake up and turn off all five alarm clocks and go back to sleep and Miss fer other people when they're half asleep they go to the alarm clock and they set it for half an hour later and go back to sleep knowingly what they had done they know what they have done so this whether you're held accountable or not depends on how conscious you were if you were half asleep which is equivalent to unconscious don't know what you're doing you say I divorce you to your to your wife without knowing turn off the alarm clocks and Skip fer or skip an important appointment or your flight Unknowing ly you're not accountable for that but if you do things with intention and go back to sleep knowing what you had done you are accountable for that and the judge of this is Allah"
