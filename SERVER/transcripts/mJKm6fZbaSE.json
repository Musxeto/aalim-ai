  "transcript": "I have a dead skin on my feet so while doing wudu I washed over the dead skin as it is uh considered to be part of the body but after completing wudu I peeled off some dead skin so do I have to repeat my wudu again the answer is no you do not have to repeat the wudu again exactly as if I performed voodoo and a white over my head and then went to the barber and shaved my head I do not have to do anything in that regard and my order is valid and Elijah Knows Best"
