  "transcript": "from Syria is with us on the phone alaykum I have a question yes sir uh it is forbidden to take a loan with RBA but what about buying things like a house with extra price is it permissible are you buying it from the same owner or through a third party through a third okay I'll answer this inshallah thank you the brother is asking about the ruling on buying property buying items buying a car through installments but not from the owner himself rather through a third party this is not permissible when the third party actually does not have any risk on him meaning it's like shellock the Jew he he just sits there with all the money in front of him and Tom and Harry they both want to exchange something one wants to buy and the other wants to sell however the one who H wants to sell does not want to wait he wants the money in cash so they go to shellock the Jew who is most famous in dealing with RBA with interest with Usery so the one wanting to buy he says listen I'd like to buy this man's car but I can't afford it and he wants 100,000 in cash so this Jew this person dealing in DBA says no problem I'll buy it for you but you will have to buy it from me for 125,000 so it's 25% interest if they all agree then the transaction takes place I give this man his 100,000 and I take the car and give it to that man and I he owes me 125,000 this is completely forbidden because there is no risk on my part it's exactly as if I lent this man 100,000 and he is going to pay it back to me 125 I don't even know what the color is the car is I haven't seen it likewise with your house when is this transaction permissible when there is risk on the third party and how is that I go to the bank and I say oh Bank do you see this house in this street on the street number so and so and the bank acknowledges of it uh we say that I'd like to buy this house only when the bank goes without any obligations from my part when he buys the the house and takes it in his possession and now he's stuck with it only then if he comes to me and says listen I bought it for this and I'm going to take 20% per uh um interest over you are you interested said if I have the free will to accept or refuse this is legit and the the buying and selling is halal but if I was compelled to buy from him because he already took my uh signature or took my uh checks in up in advance so now I'm forced to buy it this is Haram and it's not permissible I believe we have a break stay tuned inshallah we will be right back"
