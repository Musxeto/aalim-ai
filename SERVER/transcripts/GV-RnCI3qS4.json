  "transcript": "foreign 58 placing the deceased in the grave imagine islam governs every aspect of our lives from the beginning of our existence rather before the beginning of our existence what to say when we want to get married when we want to have or to be intimate with our spouses when we are born what is said and what is done and also when we die so life and death they are an ongoing process which we live and believe of it it's not something that triggers the end of the world one of our loved ones dies this is life we have to accept it because inevitably we will be in that position sooner or later but the way we deal with it illustrates the beauty of islam as people die we don't make a fuzz out of it yes it's a calamity we are grieving we are sad but it's not the end of the world we hasten to prepare the deceased body we hasten to prepare the deceased body in a good fashion in a good way and then we offer funeral prayer and then we bury the deceased we don't put the deceased in a wooden coffin we don't put lots of adornments in his funeral or a marble headstone or expensive burial grounds he was created from earth and he shall return to earth what to do when we bring the corpse of a muslim person the deceased just as we are to place it in his grave shrouded in three white pieces of garment with no sleeves we say as in hadith number 163 bismillah and we lay him on his right side facing the qiblah so any cemetery you go on earth you will find that the muslims are lied on the right hand side facing the qibla whether they're in the east or the west south of the the north they're always facing the qibla because this is our direction when we are alive and as well as after death hadith 164 so we place the deceased in his grave and we buried him and as per the sunnah we took three scoops of sand or soil and we participated in the burial by throwing it in on his grave then what the dua in hadith 164 you say oh allah forgive him o allah make him steadfast make him firm this is what the prophet ordered us to say after he finished burying one of his companions he said seek forgiveness for your brother and pray that he remains firm why the prophet says al-islam for he is now being questioned and this is what we should live and die knowing you should live upon the inevitability of being questioned in your grave okay you can help me i can cheat what are the questions so that i can memorize them and say them it's not something you memorize it is something you live by the two angels will come and question you who is your lord who what is your religion what did this man who came to you do meaning did you believe in him did you follow him and these questions are explained with elaboration in the beautiful booklet called the three principle fundamentals by al-imam muhammadin abdullah and you will find it on my youtube channel explained with the grace of allah azzawajal so that you would have a heads up what's awaiting you the following chapter visiting the graves okay now he's dead he's gone what do we do when we visit the graves and are we supposed to visit the great the graves the answer is of course the prophet salallahu directed men to visit the graves and the most authentic opinion is that he prohibited women from visiting the graves so men are to visit the graves so that they can remember the hereafter and remember what they will soon be in and this gives them an incentive to work harder in pursuing and seeking allah's pleasure so what to say when we go and visit a graveyard you say be upon you all o inhabitants of the graves among the believers and the muslims so you are giving them salam verily we will allah is willing be united with you may allah have mercy upon those already called and those still delayed among us all so we acknowledge that you are our predecessors and that we are on your footsteps inevitably we will join you soon acknowledging that i will die soon and then we ask allah for well-being for you for us as well as you know i seek allah's pardon for us and for you as well beautiful dua cements the fact that we are going to die and someday we will be six feet under and people would visit the cemeteries and read the dua and give as-salam as we are doing for you today this helps fix the way and the style of living we are enjoying so that it is in sync with what allah wants of us and we do only what pleases allah the almighty allah foreign"
