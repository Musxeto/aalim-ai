  "title": "Was the prophet Muhammad saws illiterate?",
  "transcript": "and he's asking was the Prophet Alice or some illiterate and actually as definitely it's the consensus of scholars at the prophetess of Salaam did not know how to read nor write Allah so Allah says in the Quran that you did not recite the Quran before we gave you it's this revelation when you were 40 years of age before that for 40 years nothing of this sort of knowledge that you have brought after the revelation nothing appeared on you and you did not even write it with your right hand so the Prophet Allah is telling us that the Prophet had no prior knowledge before reaching the age of 40 in being revealed to and that he did not write anything with it with his right hand which means that he was illiterate and there are other verses of the Quran and also in the hadith so the Prophet as yes was illiterate probably what would confuse people is that in the Battle of Ashford a beer or the Treaty of the hood a beer when the Prophet asam was having a dialogue with the idol worshippers representative so hey Lieb Namur may Allah be pleased with and he was at the time a mushrik the Prophet said to Ali who was the writer of this treaty he said right this is what Muhammad the prophet of Allah agreed upon with the Sahara grammar the representative of the idol worshippers Sohail says wait if I knew that you were the prophet of Allah I would not had this had this treaty with you I would have admitted you to Mecca so the Prophet said ok remove the word prophet of Allah this is what Muhammad the prophet of Allah has agreed she says he says to rally scratch it out and and he said by Allah I will not do that you are the prophet of Allah and I will not cross it off out so the Prophet looked at it as some and he crossed it out himself some people said that the Prophet knew how to read and write and this is no evidence at all any illiterate person after signing and stamping his name would be able to recognize his name and so did the Prophet Elisha Salaam so his crossing it out does not mean he can read and write only that he can recognize his name solo Selim"
