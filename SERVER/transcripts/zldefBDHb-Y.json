  "transcript": "[Music] under what emergency circumstances can one break a fault fast you cannot break a fart fast unless you have a legitimate reason and these legitimate reasons were mentioned in the Koran being sick or a traveling other than that you cannot break your fast unless it is something that is out of your control like what check someone holding a gun to your head and say eat in this case you're forced to and eating by the way when forced would not be something that nullifies your fasting you serious so yeah if someone threatens you either to kill you or to harm you or to cut you into pieces or to flog you something that is harmful Allah gives you the permission to eat out of force being forced you compelled so this is not your own choice so you eat and eat until he's stopped and said tell us okay now I'm convinced that you're not fasting and he leaves continue fasting what about the millah just had you did not have it out of your own choice and this is why the things that nullify your fasting they have to be done when you are knowledgeable you are remembering and you are choosing so if you do something without knowledge I never I never knew that a cappuccino could break your fast I thought it was only food and water seriously well I am a new revert I did not know that in this case your fancy is valid no problem a guy accepts Islam in Alaska and after Ramadan was over he heard that food drink and intercourse breaks your fasting he comes to me as a sure I didn't know that intercourse with the spouse breaks fasting I thought only food and drink seriously said well like I didn't know said your fasting is valid because you did not know so knowledge is one of the conditions required so that your fasting would break by consuming or doing any of the nullifiers of fasting to remembering what do you mean by remembering people forget one of my sons in law called me one day and he said uncle today I'm fasting I went to work before I went to work at seven o'clock I opened the fridge made a sandwich drank a glass of milk and took an apple and after I finished the Apple I said I'm fasting that's it no problem your fasting is valid the Prophet said that is awesome whoever forgets and eats or drinks while fasting Allah has fed him and Allah has provided him with water he should continue fasting is exact Allah here uncle in the afternoon he calls me he said that was at work and the boys at work went and bought albick which is a very well-known brand of fried chicken in Saudi so they said come and eat and I went and ate and ate garlic and drank Pepsi and after I finished I smacked myself dope slop and said I'm fasting what should I do ok come on breakfast ok lunch tomorrow what else but again the ruling is the same it's between him and Allah did you forget it will lie I forgot and then your fasting is still valid but man with such forgetfulness I wish I have this in Ramadan every single day to have two full meals and didn't claim it's for utter forgetfulness this is between you and allah azza wajal so alhamdulillah knowledge and remembering the third is choosing so if I drink and eat out of my own choice this nullifies my fasting but if I was compelled and forced to do this and if I don't harm will catch up with me or I will be killed or tortured or injured this is a legitimate reason to eat until this threat is uplifted and then I have to refrain and continue my fasting likewise may Allah protect all of us if a woman was raped while fasting she's resisting she's fighting but she was overwhelmed does she break her fast no if a wife was forced by her husband she resisted she continued to fight till the end does she break her fast answer is no her fast is intact and valid and there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah on her [Music] you [Applause]"
