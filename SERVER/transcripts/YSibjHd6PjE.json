  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillahir rahmanir rahim or salat wa salam ala rasulillah and Kareem alhamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we were discussing child rearing its benefits its virtues its many ups and downs and most importantly how can we return our affairs back to Allah Soprano to Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam which was left for us as a road map in all of our endeavors so anything we do in life we always return him back to Allah and the teachings of the prophets on them so they can be correct and we can receive their great reward a lesser penalty either I said no Quran for second camera omerta be upright as I commanded you so when it comes to out raising children correctly we have to do it in accordance to a loss penalty either so the first thing we were talking about that the child should learn is to be Romania to acculturate them towards the correct belief what is the correct way to understand and know Allah seprieono to Allah and know the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu asylum to help us with these endeavors we have Shikha Assam Luqman Hakeem who was a teacher at that Academy and KIU and Annie ma'am and teacher for over 30 years bismillah ma sha allah without further ado we agree and introduce our that that guest sheikh osman and hack him and Ali Khan why are they coming to LA what a catch ok so let's get into this madness Charla to Allah are we talking we're talking about Sola and tying the child's heart to the message it as we have the hadith which inshallah like you to mention about the ones who are under the shade of allah spirit Allah I was thrown on the day of judgement she never I never him at home didn't hear a bit and I mean was all along was under Mubarak I let my Borussia rahmatan lil and I mean nabina muhammad in wanna early he was so happy he remain the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam told us that there will be seven under the shade of allah azza wajal on the day of judgement where there is no shade but his and of course the shade of Allah Azza WA JAL is an issue of dispute whether it is almost Jade or it is the Thrones shade or it is a shade that Allah creates and the most authentic opinion is that is is one of the attributes of Allah Azza WA JAL so we leave it as it is the Prophet said Alice shades then we have to believe in that as it is and he mentioned among these seven a young man whose heart is connected with the message meaning that he finds no tranquility except by offering his prayer in the Masjid and staying there most of his time if we want success for our children we usually think of how healthy they are we think of their education and we select the best of schools we think of what clothes they're wearing and what stylists they are having and this is not what Allah wants us to only focus on rather the priority should be to get closer to allah azza wajal all of these things are okay take care of your child's health and wealth and education this is cool it's fine but what is more important is whether your child is bound to go to Jannah or bound to go to Nara and whether you have written the strategy that he should follow so the strategy is done with the implementation is the problem so what is the strategy the Prophet said eroticism instruct your children to pray when they're seven and beat them if they don't win they're ten so you have to up bring your children to pray on time and this is not difficult when there are seven years of age you instruct them five times a day three hundred and sixty days a year and for three years so this is 4,000 plus times you say go and pray did you pray pray in front of me mashallah you're doing well mashallah my son my daughter is praying all the time masha'Allah is that give them words of encouragement but no beating no force just give them encouragement reminders reminders and this goes for Federer as well as Asia some Muslims may think that well I'll just tell them to pray Malorie or the two out of five is good no it's not good you have to instruct them to pray even at an early age so even the child is seven years of age you work walk you're your child your son and take him to the message with you even at this early age it is a little bit difficult but come on you would do exactly the same when it comes to his school without any problem you would force him you would shout at him to go to school because you know that his degree is dependent on it but don't you know that paradise is dependent on his prayer so you have to fix this into him and if we look into the Sunnah we would find that the Prophet Isis am used to accompany his children his grandchildren to the Masjid umama bent a Balazs his granddaughter he used to carry her in prayer al hasan would have seen many times they come and interrupt his sermon sometimes he would carry them and deliver the hotbar while there next to him al hasan in one incident was next to him and the Prophet is preaching the people in looking at Hassan then looking at the people looking at the Hassan he loves that the child and he said that this son of mine is a saying yet he's a master and Allah would reconcile between two big factions of the Muslims and would stop a war and this is what this is what had happened so encouraging the children to go to the Masjid where they feel that this is the origin of Islam where they can see that the Muslims are gathering whether they're black or white whether they're rich or poor whether they're locals or immigrants they're all Muslims no differences the first straw is not for the locals it's for anyone that comes first unlike in other places where you give priority to the locals or to the people who are a wealthy or influential in Islam is it different the house of Allah this message it is for everyone so they can see the beauty of Islam manifested in front of them they are also taught at an early age that everything is dependent on your prayer how is that the Prophet cetera sort of said the first thing a person is held accountable on the day of judgment is salat his prayer so if it is fixed and good then all of his good deeds are passed and if his prayer is invalid or not good all of his good deeds are cancelled so this shows the child from an early age that prayer is important now one would say what is the importance of prayer and he Muslims pray five times a day this is the minimum this is the prerequisite of being a Muslim and when they pray five times a day it's energizing their heart it's keeping this connection with allah azza wajal so even if you fall weak or fall behind or maybe a bit heedless when you pray all of this is gone unlike those who pray on once a week they go to their temple go to their house of worship once a week and the rest of the week they are heedless as one of them said that the Christians for example a worship God on Sunday and they worship Barclays Bank the rest of the week this is not true for all Christians of course there are good and bad like in this in Muslims there are good and bad but the vast majority are going away from the houses of worship in Islam we put this into them from an early age and this would pay off later on so yes we teach them to pray when they're 7 and when they're 10 if they neglect prayer we beat them up and when they're an adult we can't beat them we can just remind them and if they go astray salat will bring them back to Islam 5-10 years later on so even if they divert a little bit even if they forget a little bit inevitably with the dua of the parents and with the prayer that these children continue to pray yet they're heedless they do sense but they pray it will inevitably bring them back to the straight path just for clarification because in a Western context when we say beat them up that implies like bloody nose and broken ribs this would beat them up means but I'm sure that's not what you know the prophet alayhi salaatu some explained to us as did the companions of the Prophet that such beating up is not with a baseball bat so you don't break the head of the child say go and pray I'm gonna smash your head no the beating up is to be done so that it does not break a bone it does not shed any blood it does not leave a mark so the beating is not a painful physically process rather than it's a sentimental sort of punishment so this is the child that I cuddled that I Mushin kids that I I love and express my love when it comes to a point where the child does not pray I spanked him so this is a good thing to do and show him that what he's doing he's crossing the red line rather than just say may Allah guide you and leave him so you have to the beating process is there in Islam but it is not a violent action and it's not an act of transgression rather than it is a divine instruction from allah azza wajal to help and reprimand this child before it goes out of hand yeah so we're talking about taking disciplinary actions has different stages as well it's not always directly going towards beating discs of our mind there I should it saying taking away things you know different ways a person their discipline yeah by the way this is maybe less than a 1% there because throughout the three years from seven to ten the constant reminder would definitely make that child grow up to pray so in rarely less than 1% that you may differ once in a lifetime to just bring the child back to track yeah and to clarify your point is what has happened to me once in my life I got a beating for fooling around okay you didn't do it afterwards no I did what a lot fewer gonna pause for a short break and we'll be right back to discuss more issues of Tobi Romania and raising children with correct consciousness of Allah Soprano to Allah that they may be firm in their adulthood upon knowing Allah spano to Allah and knowing and following the Prophet Muhammad SAW of the heart asylum stay tuned we'll be right back assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] Miller assalamualaikum warahmatullah welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we're talking today about Derby Romania and raising the children in a way that is according to the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad our solemn and what a lot came with in his key type in his book we talked lastly about Salah its importance the child having a connection to the Masjid and I would like to sort of emphasize a point which I just remember it many times I remember when I was younger and I would be instructed to pray prayer felt almost as a burden as a duty like to do your homework you know clean your room so I would say okay I'm going to do my homework wash the dishes and they're not want to pray it didn't feel I didn't have a connection to Solaria I didn't know the sweetness of prayers so how is it important not only to teach the action of the matter but also a spiritual sort of connection a love of the action a reasoning behind this action as well well unfortunately it is a package deal yes why do I say unfortunately because I do the same mistake see I come back home frustrated from the way that people drive and the way we drive in Saudi is whoa it's a Wild West and problems are there in my life I'm not perfect so I come into the house two of the children are fighting the coming to me shouting at one another complaining to me and I'm frustrated so I reprimand them on the spot by saying you always shout you're impolite you are not brought up in a good way did you pray so it is becoming as an insult it's becoming as a duty rather than something that you can taste the sweetness of and this is wrong so I always encourage parents not to use prayer as a form of punishment or a cause of punishment so if I want to beat my child I say you shout a lot you always fight with your siblings did you pray uh sir No then okay I will I will spank the child this is wrong because it will stick in the back of mind that prayer is a punishment and so many times I get my own grown up children when they sit together and they laugh and say you remember when when when Daddy used to wake up for Federer he wakes up us up for failure and he goes to wake the other sibling and come back to us and we say yeah yeah we prayed and we go to the bathroom and just put some water on her hands and and they were like seven years eight years of age so they are confessing we used to lie so I ponder upon that why is that and the reason is that we are not taking the full package we're just taking the part that deals with Salah okay what about the part that deals with watching Allah and be aware that Allah is observing us and watching us what about the part of finding the sweetness of salat and how it gets us closer to Allah as ocean what about maybe this would bring us up later on to another way of instilling in them the fear and love of allah so JAL what about duaa so it's a package that we fail to deliver and this is why children feel that it is a burden but when I take my son with me to the Masjid and every time we go i buy him ice cream it's good for the dentists not good for his teeth but I I do something that would help my child love the process of going to the Masjid when the elders in the Masjid encourage the children when they see them instead of frowning in their faces or telling them what to do this do that like so many elders do when the elders are wise and when they see the children they greet them they kiss them and they say encouraging words to them the children appreciate prayer and they would start to love it and do it without being forced to do it but this package deal is not only limited to Salah it is also found in every single aspect of Islam you have to have the full package so that you would have the best effect insha'Allah that you can see and this definitely goes in to another point which we want to talk about now is there are I remember and I'm just being completely honest perhaps Mike and learn and you know for my mistakes I would only make the ayah when I was younger when I was in trouble that's the only time I made the aisle and I really needed a lot and by the way this is something that's not only limited or exclusive to children I think many adults never ask Allah for anything except when they're in a dire need or it makes a lot and then dire need and as you said as a package deal so Ali learned later on in life that you could just make the I you should McDonough and all situations when you're pleased with forlorn or tada when your life is going good to say thank you do I as something as essential so how do we in great this and from a very young age where just just don't make doha when they're beating is coming when bad grades are coming or something as bad as happening well do I is a very white topic and to be honest with you a lot of the Muslims fail in the field of Dora and this failure is due to their ignorance number one and to Satan number two the devil shape on a please knows that Dora takes them straight to Jenna the Prophet said that is awesome at dois ooh who will a bad no do i calling allah azza wajal is the best the ultimate form of worship because it's a direct connection the beauty of islam you have something you ask a lot directly you don't have to come to the priest or to the Rebbe or to the monk and say Oh Father forgive me forgive me for I have sinned you don't have to come to me and ask me to make dua for you know you ask allah azza wajal directly this connection makes you god-fearing it makes you aware of allah azza wajal so usually we have to put this in our children and this is exactly what the Prophet used to do in a well-known hadith even our best may Allah be pleased with money of his father he said I was riding behind the Prophet I saw some on a mule and this shows you that it is permissible to have two riding on a beast if the Beast can take it so the Byul was a strong meal and it was kanga prophetess Sam and his companion his cousin they be nervous any bad bass was like 10 years 11 years of age so a young boy but look at advice given by the top by the head of the Islamic state the real Islamic state not these wannabes by the messenger of allah to his young cousin he said yahoo damn any orally mocha cream at oh boy I'm gonna teach you a few words and he was a learner boy so he was putting it at the right place for the Lahiya father observe Allah and Allah soldier will protect you either sir LTFS Allah when you ask ask only of Allah and when you seek guidance seek guidance only from Allah Azza WA JAL and acknowledge that whatever happens to you it was prescribed as long as Allah prescribed it no one can prevent it the hadith is long and it has so many we can learn from but the biggest lesson is that the Prophet had a son in his 60s taking the time off to teach this child something that helped in making this child one of the greatest scholars of all times he Barabbas was the hubber of his this Ummah and he was the translator of the Quran and he was among the great scholars of the companions may allah be pleased with him so this is what we should do with our children okay we do not communicate with our children and I'm guilty as charged I'm not saying that I do communicate my children I have so many things on my plate which is not an excuse but their mother tells me that if I spend with my children 10 or 15 minutes after a meal she says this has a positive impact beyond recognition she tells me you remember the time we sat after dinner and you told them about an experience you had or an incident that took place or something you shared with them they spoke about it for days learning from it getting lessons from it she says you can change the children more than I do and this is true because she sits with them 24/7 well while I don't so putting this into their children whenever they want something and I can give it to them but I say make dua for Allah so them they would relate that ok I made dua Allah made it happen and this is the truth so many times as as ungrateful Muslims we tend to say yeah I made two or three drys Allah never responded to me Allah never answered I've been asking Allah for ten years for something it never happened subhanAllah can you please count the things that you ask to happen and if you put your mind to it you'll find that there are thousands of things that allow me to happen to you but because you're ungrateful humans are ungrateful by nature we don't remember the good things we only remember the bad things so yeah I ask Allah so just for this and this and this and it never happened though I ask Allah for thousands and thousands of things and it all came through it hamdulillah so we have to put this in the children ask Allah Azza WA JAL to make it easy for us to go to the to the fun fairs as collateral to make it easy for us to find the brand of ice cream you want in the supermarket say me Allah so I'll make it easy to buy a new car and the child does this and I've seen this hundreds of times children of five or six years of age when they're talking to you they would do this you're up do this in that you're up we go we manage to go to Mecca or to Medina I'm looking at this is what is this child doing they know that the way to answer their needs and to attain it and obtain it is Rudra if we manage and succeed in putting this in our children's hearts so that they relate to Allah excuse me this would definitely add a lot of value when they grow up yeah we even learn that is that the dignity of the Muslim is in being free of people's being only able to only rely on Allah Soprano to correct so this is a very crucial point and how they does that okay for another amazing session may Allah reward you we're going to stop here unfortunately this time to end our segment but thank you so much for coming and sharing your knowledge viewers thank you so much for joining us we hope that you benefited greatly in this program until next time assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh [Music]"
