  "transcript": "nor says when getting up from the first shot we have to do roughly a Dane raising of the hands so when should we say Allahu Akbar should we say it while getting up but if we do this then we would say it before rising our hands can t explain first of all you said that we have to do or evaluating and this is not true raising the hands is a Sunnah it is not mandatory so if a person stands bhau's rises from Recor and does not raise his hands his prayer is totally valid and correct number two raising the hands in prayer is done in four locations two of them happens only once in the prayer and the other two happens in every rakah so the first place where it happens only once in takbir at Allah Haram in the beginning of the salat you say Allah Akbar which is a pillar to say Allahu Akbar but raising the hands is not it's still a Sunnah so if I am in the message and assist oh I tell you Lou and I look right and left and the congregation are already and I say Allah Akbar without raising my hands my prayer is totally valid no problem so this is number one happens only once in the prayer number two is when I'm in the first shot whether it says the ass or MRIB orisha all of these four salats have to tisha out the first one is after the second raka when I'm about to go to the third raka I always say Allahu Akbar and I raise my hands and this happens only once in the Select it doesn't happen in fire at all the third time where I raise my hands happen in happens in every rakah and that is when I go for Roku and I say Allahu Akbar and I do my record and the first time also happens in every rakah and this is when I raise my head from rock whereas a semi Allah who Liman Hamidah that's it now when I met Tasha hood there are two schools of thought some say when I finish my tisha hood and I want to go to the third raka while sitting I say Allah Akbar and I stand up and this is followed by Shia Albanian his students the vast majority say no you stand up and while you're standing up you say Allahu Akbar and once you stand up you raise your hands shake this means that we raise our hands after we say Allahu Akbar that says yes three types or three ways that the Prophet was authentic upon reported about him between raising the hands and saying Allah Akbar so in the beginning you can do this Allah Akbar it's simultaneous and you can do this Allah Akbar you're raising the hands before saying Allah Akbar or you can do this Allah Akbar so you say takbir before so you can have three ways either simultaneous or before or after and all was reported by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so you to answer your question I'm inclined to say that you say Allahu Akbar between the sitting position and standing up so you have to say it in between not while you're sitting and not while you're standing up as for the raising the hands you do it when you fully stand up and Allah Azza WA JAL knows first"
