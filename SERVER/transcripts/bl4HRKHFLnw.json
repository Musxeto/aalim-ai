  "title": "Working in a company that sells (military) products that can be used against muslims (Isr**l) #assim",
  "transcript": "how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah just a quick question uh I've seen in different videos saying that uh it is permissible to work in a company that has Haram and Halal projects as long as one only focuses on the Halal projects Etc but my question is a bit more specific because basically uh in Engineering in many engineering companies um more specifically to what I study is everything to do with electronics and developing new technologies uh they these companies develop uh Technologies for all different kind of sectors so they develop Technologies for electric cars uh renewable energies etc etc but generally in these companies um um very generally uh they also have a sector uh that is dedicated to developing Technologies uh for the military so developing like electronics that would go new technology that would go into military airplanes Etc and so as this is a careful country it is possible especially in our context right now that they would then sell these Technologies to Israel you know to kill Muslims Etc may Allah pres preserve them from that it is true but it's also possible that 15 Muslim countries would buy the same technology for their armies and for their defense so it's like selling a knife you can cut throats with it and you can cut meat and bread with it so this is too farfetched that okay I work in a water desalination company and this company sells water and it may sell it to companies that produce wine so this means that I cannot work in in in desination companies or plants of course not likewise with electronics this is too generic they have at the end of the day you will not be able to work anywhere so as long as your project is generally speaking in halal it might be used in Haram very small percentage there's no problem in in doing that it's like programming I make a program for managing your finances maybe a broel or a pub would buy this program to organize their material I'm not designing it for them I'm designing it for the public who who uses it is open for all there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
