  "transcript": "sh born in a Muslim family and now kind of agnostic theist who believes in a God but not sure whether Allah is that God or not he studies about Islam and other religions for many many years offer Salah five times in a day and fasting and other good deeds knowing that all these are rewardless but hoping that Allah might not seal but open his heart is there any other things he can do to ask Allah for hi this person needs counseling he needs to sit with with a Muslim psychiatrist who knows Islam or with a Muslim counselor who would sit and open her his eyes to the truth because it is not possible for someone to be agnostic and praise five times a day and read the Quran and fearful of Allah that he would throw him in hell and still is on shaky grounds this is not logical either he is a full-fledged hypocrite deceiving people and himself and pretending to be a Muslim which is a little bit difficult or his head is messed up big time by Shan trying to infiltrate it trying to insert these Whispers convincing him that no no no you're not convinced maybe there is another religion maybe there's another God and this or these are Whispers of Shan he must ignore avoid and in my opinion he has to cement his Iman and how to do this it is by going through Allah's beautiful names and attributes studying them and enforcing and cementing the belief in Allah Asel reading about the day of judgment reading about The Messengers trying to build up his Iman so that it would counter touch Whispers with the grace of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala"
