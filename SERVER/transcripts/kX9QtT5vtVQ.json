  "transcript": "so a few years back in the classroom there was a call creator and i took it um but right now like to find the person who owed it i would have to come contact many people and it would be embarrassing also i would contact the opposite gender as well and um maybe more than one person was the calculator so i wouldn't know who's it asked do i have to like give the value of the calculator in charity or should i give the item itself no you should estimate how much the value of this item and give it in charity because giving it as it is the value has depreciated and you've used it and utilized it so you've got the value to go down giving it out would not serve the purpose of paying the amount estimate how much it costs and definitely is going to cost more than what it is valued today so it's brand new for maybe ten dollars if you were to sell it now you will get two dollars no you give ten dollars to charity and keep that calculator and you can use it insha'allah as a word you"
