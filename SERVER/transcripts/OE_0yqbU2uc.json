  "transcript": "uh my question is uh sometimes when I pray I feel I feel like a pop coming from my back but I didn't hear anything and I didn't smell anything uh do I have to redo my wudu or it's okay are you certain um uh What uh what do you mean certain are you certain that you passed wind or it's just a doubt uh doubt if it's a doubt move on and ignore it because only when you're 100 percent not 99.9 only when you're 100 certain you past wind is when you redo your wudu if you're doubtful if you're 99.9 doubtful then the prophet tells you you need to hear a sound or find a a foul odor and if you fail to do or to have any of these two reasons that elevate the doubt into certainty then the prophet says ignore it and move on and Allah Knows Best"
