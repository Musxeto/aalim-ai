  "transcript": "so Shake we know that women must not go out without any reason frequently so I try my best to stay at home um and sometimes it happens like uh five or six days pass and I don't go out um and I don't have any relatives or friends here with whom I can meet so like uh after six or five or 6 days I feel suffocated at home so is it permissible to go out with my parents sometimes even if there is no work outside if the intention is only for refreshment there is no problem none whatsoever even if you go on daily basis with your parents to loosen up and to refresh there's nothing wrong in that what is wrong is for a person is for a lady to go to the malls to the markets without any purpose just to look around being there is a FNA for some and without a purpose no it is best to stay home as Allah mentioned in verse 33 chapter 33 remain in your homes if there's no reason but if you want to refresh if you want to go to the uh Garden to go to the park if you want to go shopping if you want to visit friends there's nothing wrong at all in going out"
