  "transcript": "I was born into I devious uh family but Allah has gotten me to the true path of Allah I'm planning on telling my telling my family about this soon and I'm more than certain what I tell them they were preventing me from praying to the Masjid uh what should I do about this he has guided you to the right path and saved you from being deviant and all now if you are certain that they would prevent you from praying in the Masjid not a child and you're not a girl so you can go out to attend school to buy things to do errands Europe you're a man therefore there would be some resistance if you deal with such resistance with wisdom diplomacy knowledge and kindness they it will take some time and then it will all go away alhamdulillah so don't allow shaytan to whisper in your ears that they're going to do this they're going to do that because this is what shaytan promises us promises us with poverty with insecurity with instability so don't believe in that and Trust Allah azzawajal and go ahead with what you're doing and Allah would guide your way now if your fear is eminent and real and genuine and your parents or your family are so hostile and abusive and can harm you physically in this case alhamdulillah and this is for sure not something you doubt if this is the case then alhamdulillah you can hide your Islam and try your level best to be independent from them as soon as possible by separating or to be financially independent and to move on with your life where you can practice Islam freely and may Allah make you steadfast on Islam and make things easy for you"
