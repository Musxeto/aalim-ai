  "transcript": "Hamidah says what are the conditions under which it is permissible to pray while sitting on a chair you're not allowed in for prayers to sit on a chair when praying unless you're unable to stand why because standing up in for prayer while being able to stand is a pillar so if you neglect this pillar and you sit though you're able to stand your prayer is invalid a lot of those who are elders in the community are negligent of this rule you find them walking and Danny doing everything on the feet without any problem once they come to the Masjid they immediately make takbir and sit down uncle aren't you able to stand he said yes I am able but you know I'm old and but you're able to stand you're not allowed to do this in voluntary prayers it's a different issue the Prophet told the saddest time in an authentic hadith that the prayer of a person sitting down is half the prayer of a person standing up so this is up to you you want to pray sitting down no problem although you are able to stand but you want still to spra sitting down no issues but let it be known to you that you would only have half of the reward of a person praying standing up so what are the conditions the conditions is inability if a person has a problem and he's unable to stand whether he broke his leg whether he has back pains whether he gets sick and drowsy whenever he stands he's unable to maintain his balance have the permission to sit down you are enable you are not capable of standing up this is a legitimate reason someone says I can stand up but I cannot prostrate or I cannot bow in this case you have to pray standing up when it comes to the pillar of bowing or prostrating which you are unable to do on the ground in this case you may sit on a chair without any problem in doing that insha'Allah"
