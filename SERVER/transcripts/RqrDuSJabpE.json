  "title": "Does inhaling steam nullify your fast? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i would like to ask what level of certainty do you need to nullify your first for example there was a day that i was fasting and i know that stem breaks fast and i had a hot summer with hot water and there was stem in the bathroom there was what stem steam in the bathroom steam yes okay and i saw stem steam in the other part of the bathroom but i'm not sure if there was stem exactly in the spot where i was having a shower and i inhaled i i was breathing did that invited my fast so does are you married abdullah no okay do you have a mother yes so when your mother cooks food and she smells the food and the steam coming from the pots is her fasting valid or not yes because it is a necessity maybe no no it's not a necessity she can buy food from outside the steam doesn't break your fasting those who work in desalination plants or in factories or elsewhere they are bound to smell the steam if i walk in the super and in the market in the souk and they're this guy doing barbecue and i sit there ah have i eaten and the restaurant owner comes said okay you have to give me uh five euros for the smell no this is not eating this is not drinking take a shower as much as you want this has no impact on your fasting"
