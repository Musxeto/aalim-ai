  "title": "Marrying a Shia Boy or a Shia Girl - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the second question was that uh someone is intending to marry a shia a girl is this permissible answer is no we don't say that the shia has all are kafir no there are muslims among them but there are definitely a lot of kafirs from them and this is why a person should select and choose the best in-laws possible because they will be responsible for bringing up uh his children their children his children will mix with them so by having someone most likely who is cursing the companions and slandering mother and saying awful things like the shias do this is definitely not something advisable if not totally prohibited so he must not go through such a marriage"
