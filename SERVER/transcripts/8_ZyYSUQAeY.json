  "transcript": "an imam while reciting in the Fox got or mispronounced some verses and noticed that and took a pause hoping to be corrected but no one from the worshipers behind him could correct him what should the Imam do in this case what if the same scenario took place in a nun for salat usually when I lead the prayer and I make a mistake and I know that there's a verse missing and I pause so that people would remind me but no one behind me knows the verse that was missing if no one can correct me I simply go for record it's not time bound those oh sure we have like 30 seconds before you can make record fill it up it's not air time that I have to put advertisements in it haleh's I don't know the ayah I must not improvise I must not make something up Allahu Akbar and go for rock or and no harm is done"
