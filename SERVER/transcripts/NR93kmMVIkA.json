  "transcript": "Allah from Nigeria says that whenever I pray in the Masjid I get this feeling of boasting and showing off and this is everybody's problem we're all in the same boat however the more you struggle with it and fight it the sooner you will get inshallah to h a conclusion and to safety because this is where Shan works best he comes to you so he says Ah you're pronging your prayer because people are watching said maybe what to do he said shorten it make it quick be Hasty in it so you make it quick and you lose the reward of the prayer you heard his advice and you did not perfect your prayer so what to do when he comes to say this to you say I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast uh uh Shan and fix and meant your intention so yes maybe I did intend to prolong it so that people would not see me pray fast in a fast way but now I'm going to change my intention and I'm going to pray slowly with concentration and submissiveness for the sake of Allah not for anybody's else so by this you would hit two birds with one stone you would uh um seek refuge in Allah from the Shan and you make would depress him and make him sad because you're not listening to him and at the same time you would obey Allah the almighty also"
