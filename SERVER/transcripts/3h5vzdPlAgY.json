  "title": "How to raise children and instill fear of Allah in the hearts in this internet age - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Oh Misha says how to manage children when the world has become so open in front of them via Internet how to incur fear of allah azzawajal in their hearts when there's so much temptation and fitna all around them this requires a long lecture but let us look at it as long as the time permits inshallah the children not only the children even the grown-ups are under great tests of Allah dodging these trials are ongoing and they are progressing and developing the fitna is everywhere forty or fifty years ago a woman singer would come on the theatre repeating the same part of the song ten times and everybody was in joy and happiness though she wasn't beautiful that though she wasn't attractive but this is what they had nowadays it is much different today the media has went has gone into different fields in order to lure you and tempt you so now it's not this old ugly woman singing a song repeating it it is this blonde or this brunette or this redhead you want to see her on the beach or on the bed or working in the garden or working out in the gym you want to be a billionaire you want to be a bus driver you want to be the milkman every fantasy that might have crossed your mind they will put it in a video clip with music with a song and visually attracting you so it's not only the children it's even the grown-ups to the extent that the Prophet said a lesser option there will come a time and inshallah this is not the time yet but there will come a time where the best wealth of a believer would be few of his sheep at the top of mountains where he stays away from the people and the people stay away from him worshiping allah azza wajal alone which shows you that there will come a time where trials and temptation would overwhelm the people so coming back to your question um Aisha what to do if you're talking about the internet per se this is something unfortunately even our educational institutions at an early age our children in the elementary school their teachers and the management encourages them encourage them to surf the net which is awkward they say no no this is part of modernization yes but the side effects are huge but they don't understand because they don't have religion in their hearts they're not religious oriented religion oriented so nowadays we have a situation what to do if your children are bound to use the Internet I highly advise that you channel it rather than ban it because banning it is not feasible at the moment at least not in one household out of 10,000 so the best thing is to go with the flow but to channel it by having the PC with a big visible visible a visible screen in the living room where anyone coming in can see the screen so the operator back is not to the wall but rather to the people and the screen is to the people so your child can surf the net can check his emails can browse if he has a research to do for school and can also play games or do something that is recreational providing everyone else can see and every once in a while once he crosses the red line we reprimand and we bring him back to course by trying to fill up his heart with the fear of allah azza wajal so in order for you to use the PC for an hour you have to sit with us for 10 minutes recite an ayah with a tafseer or read a hadith and comment on it this is our daily dose maybe if we manage to do this and to use the carrot and the stick method so that we would balance them maybe that would be good you have to devote time during the day for them to get closer to allah azza wajal either by a lecture or by a research or by them themselves if they are a little bit you know intellectual and wise by their them preparing the tafseer of an ayah or the ruling of folk or the explanation of a hadith they search and they find it and they present it to the family so that this would be beneficial for all and they would feel that they are living in a Muslim household maybe this would help Allah knows best may allah azzawajal protect all our families and children"
