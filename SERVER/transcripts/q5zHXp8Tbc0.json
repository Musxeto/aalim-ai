  "title": "Hanafi contradictions with hadiths. Is she sinful for following ambiguous opinions? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah as you guide people not to cherry pick but follow someone they trust if a woman has access to limited Scholars and she comes across the scholar originally from India Kashmir for residing in Saudi Arabia Sheikh he was a student of uh Sheikh Ravi Khali and been guiding this woman and knows her situation for a very long time however the problem is since the woman has read enough material on Islam QA and your videos too some of the opinions seems too wrong uh to follow which deviates her trust for example he said if a person has anxiety with the crowded situation we have gotten Hajj done on behalf of many people and this is doable plus he thinks we cannot say that Namaz offered at hanafi Zohar time or Isha after midnight or without covering feet would be invalid a person cannot be a hundred percent right but since these are major matters to be concerned about would she be sinful if she know if she knows is following an ambiguous opinion she read she read something else about first of all this is an issue that a person has to be clear when looking into it that is a Layman does not have the tools that enable him to distinguish whether this is right or wrong this is why we say a Layman must find a particular individual preferably among those who can advise him and give him live advice if not then among those who have passed away and they are trusted not to deviate because they're dead and this individual is ordered to follow this person who him whom he trusts his knowledge his religious commitment his track record why do I say track record because there are so many scholars and students of knowledge and that is who keep on flipping and changing all their colors and their affiliations according to the highest bidder Mela protect us and there is there are those who are consistent who've always been saying the same things according to the Quran and the Sunnah so their understanding is quite clear if you find someone that falls under this category you should follow them all the way now if you come to find through clear crystal clear evidence that this particular thing that this scholar said is not correct because no one is infallible the prophet Islam is but normal people are not so you tend to follow the correct opinion and authentic opinion based on the Quran and Sunnah despite the fact that this scholar you follow or you've been following all the time said otherwise there's no problem in that because you're following the dalil you're following what is authentic and is crystal clear that Allah will ask you about on the day of judgment you're not ordered to follow this scholar blindly and if he says Simon Says throw yourself in the ocean and you do this no this is not Islam you follow him within reason as long as you still trust that he his opinion is in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah but once you discover that it is not then there is an obligation upon you to do follow the Quran Sunnah and I hope this answers your question um"
