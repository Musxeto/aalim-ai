  "transcript": "Abdullah as he says we have started the Lada about this month of the Islamic calendar the 11th month is called al-qaeda he says this month includes respected months Ashville home so whatever good deeds are made in this month it gets doubled similar to how bad deeds get doubled am i right okay first of all let's do some defining what is meant by ash whole harem - whole harem are the sacred months in Islam we have four sacred months these months beginning from the first month of the lunar or Islamic calendar shahrullah Hilma harem harem number one then number seven Shahar the month of Rajab then number 11 and 12 will Qaeda and little Hodja these are the four sacred months are they mentioned in the Quran the answer is yes allah azza wajal says in chapter nine surah at-taubah verse 36 indeed the number of months with Allah is 12 lunar months in the register of Allah from the day he created the heavens and the earth of these four are sacred there is the correct religion so do not wrong yourselves during them to the rest of the ayah so in short this is the ayah ayah 36 that Allah mentioned in surah at-taubah it stated that when Allah created the heavens and the earth since day 1 Allah created it to follow 12 months and these are the 12 lunar months among them there are 4 sacred months which I have just say stated and mentioned for you now the question of Abdul Aziz is that our these sacred months the good deeds are doubled and the bad deeds the sins are also doubled the doubling process is not there then why are they sick sacred ah the size of the sin is greater than the size outside of it for example if you sinned in London definitely then if you do the same sin in Mecca Allah says 1 my unit fee he bill had him little Luke who may not have been any whoever intends something that is wrong there is sinful in Mecca allah azza wajal will make him taste the painful torment so when allah prohibits something if you do it in a place or in a time that is not sacred definitely is worse when you do it in a sacred time or a sacred place so if you sin in the month of Rabi al-awwal in the month of safar the sin in the month of the third day which we are in is greater not doubled it's one sin but it is greater when my friend says to me you're out of your mind so I can take this he's my friend but when my son says to me Father you're out of your mind it's say it's the same phrase but with greater impact so this is different the doubling of sins and good deeds is not there but definitely the size is different and this is why scholars for example used to love to perform Umrah in the month of Valera why it's like any other Umrah they said no as anis may Allah be pleased with him said that the Prophet before all his Roma's in the peda and a lot of the scholars like to perform Umbra in the beginning of the month in the month of rajab some scholars used to love and recommend fasting it though there is no authentic hadith but they depend on the fact that this is one of the sacred months of course we know that Muharram which is the first lunar month of the Islamic calendar that the Prophet as-salaam highly recommended fasting it even fasting it all of it because this is the best fasting after the month of Ramadhan so from these sayings and hadith and evidences scholars came up with the conclusion that the sins are heavier and more serious in the sacred months than other the Adam eight months and the good deeds are more valued and rewarded than in the other months and Elijah knows best"
