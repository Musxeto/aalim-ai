  "transcript": "can we give the cattle fitori by cooking it or should it be given raw in India there are many daily wage earners striving and have no shelter due to lockdown so can I collect old as a cattle footer from our family and cook it and distribute it the hadith of even OMA of Abu Sayyaf Adri and other companions who reported the obligation of the cattle Fattah it goes round the following words the Prophet Alisa lobster mandated the cattle filter to be once our of food and they give examples of food of staple food that the Companions had at the time wheat barley dates dried milk etc so the hadith did not stipulate a condition of it being cooked rather the majority of scholars say that it is best to be given raw so that a poor person would not get only two point one two five or 2.25 kilograms of rice then that's it usually lots of people give the poor there the cattle feta or sada cattle fit or so if they and you imagine all provided it in the form of cooked food it will spoil the following day or the following week while if it's straw I can save it and eat from it for a whole month or maybe six months because rice can stay that long it's straw so I would highly recommend that you give it in the form of raw staple food unless you take the authorisation from the poor himself so if they are daily wage earners and they are homeless for example they don't have shelters you don't have places to cook so you tell them a day before 8:00 that listen we have this much of food for you would you like us to cook it and make biryani for you and if the poor person says yes for God's sake for Allah's sake do that I need to eat then this is an authorization which allows you to do that and allah azzawajal knows best"
