  "transcript": "You said the lineman should not choose between and do but how can I know if I am a layman or in if I books on my own watch videos of shik do courses read on my own? Can I choose between fwa? What qualities do I need to choose between fwa? This is too generic because there are things that are crystal clear in Islam. The prohibition of wine intoxicants, the prohibition of fornication, zena, the prohibition of stealing, of killing, of lying. You don't need to ask a sheh for this these things. But there are things that are detailed and not a lot of people know about and layman for certain are not qualified to choose and pick which is the right thing to do. And this is why it is extremely dangerous for laymen who don't speak Arabic who've not done courses of uh comparative to come and jump the gun and say okay I'm going to choose this why it looks nice or the sheh who presented to us on YouTube was excellent his presentation was nice you're not qualified as you're not qualified to talk to a neurosurgeon and say to him the procedure you want to operate through. Uh why did you choose this and not something else and explain it to me? This is illogical. You haven't done any medical school. You haven't done any research. You have no knowledge. Therefore, it is dangerous for a layman to just go and scroll fatwas and choose what he likes because this is called cherry-picking. You must ask people of knowledge. Allah says twice in the Quran, ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. So, you don't know. Ask those whom you trust. And you cannot keep on jumping and hopping from one sheh to the other asking for a specific answer that you're looking for and then you grab on to it and next time you ask the other sheh and you grab on to his answer because this is again fatwa shopping or cherry-picking. You need to follow one individual whom you trust in his knowledge, moral conduct, his uh uh religious commitment, his righteousness and whatever he tells you, you follow that and that would cl clear you in front of allahel."
