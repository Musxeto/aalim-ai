  "transcript": "I have this um I have this um problem that I've been thinking maybe it's because of my past things that Allah is delaying my prayers my duas and because maybe have not been practicing Islam but it was not my fault it was there are some had I had the opportunities to to learn um Arabic language but it was negative due to my due to Black Magic so um I I would like you to advise me in this situation because I'm a little bit depressed on because of my situation sir first of all this fear of previous sins can be positive and can be negative so if your fear from your previous sins cripples you and makes you stay where you are without advancing without seeking knowledge without seeking Allah's forgiveness without doing good deeds this is negative fear and it is from Shan positive fear is whenever you be remember your previous sins you get energetic to repent more to seek Allah's forgiveness to show your remorse and to do good deeds so it is a progressive fear not a negative one it makes you go forward and closer to Allah and closer to jenah so this is what you should have and this would relieve you from your depression inshallah"
