  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments where we are discussing childrearing its virtues its benefits its many ups and downs and most importantly how do we return this crucial endeavor this affair back to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and the messenger muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam we know that one of the most crucial matters that parents are concerned with is child rearing and we're talking about the issue of akhlaq as the prophet saw assalam said in name that have not been sent except to perfect to complete good moral characteristics so in this way we would like to return this matter of akhlaq in raising children back to the prophet muhammed how do we raise our children in a way that is according to the o'clock of the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam to help with this endeavor we have sheikah asim recommended hakeem who is a teacher at zad academy nkiu and has been a teacher and an imam for over 30 years okay let's get into this matter of we know that many times you find youngsters and the worst is to find a child a child with bad manners uh something that's very difficult to see in someone's child and likewise if you see a person's child with good manners you make the eye for the parents you're pleased to see this so it's crucial so how do we raise children in a way that that have moral compasses that are in line with the quran and sunnah is not an easy task and everything you do is governed by allah's will so you do your level best and you don't know what allah has willed for you so you cannot sit back and relax and say whatever allah wills will happen you have to take the necessary means and measures so that your child would be classified and labeled as a person with moral with good moral conduct with good ethics and with a good character it brings great joy to any of us to be complimented that masha allah your child is a well-raised child he's good mannered but we have to be careful how to classify our children of being good mannered or not because nowadays we've get we get so many people affected by the media thinking that the western type of culture moral conduct ethics is what should be sought after and followed how so see we believe whenever you come to a door you should open the door and say women's first but if she's not a mahram and you are about to enter a place and there's a woman who's about to enter it you should go first rather than allow her to go and you're looking and not lowering your gaze and maybe courteously smiling back to her what is this take her number and take her for dinner maybe that would complete the whole circle so what is considered to be part of etiquette in the west cannot be part of islam because we have boundaries so what governs our movement and reactions is islam not what people consider to be rude or ungentlemanlike this is why we have to bring up our children to be people with good moral conduct and this cannot be unless they have role models when your son hears you say every time you thank someone he will also adopt this yesterday i was in my hotel room in in the restaurant and the grand chef breakfast time came and saw me so i asked him a question random question no no he's not a waiter so he did something and he showed me to do something with the food out of a habit i said to him may allah forgive you and have mercy on your soul and on your parents soul the guy almost broke into tears he said allah how beautiful your words are i was i took a step back and said what did i say this is what you usually say to people whoever does me good or does me a favor i pray for him and for his parents this is how i was brought up so i went on and increased it a level so i said may allah bless your health wealth and guide your children and grant you a good life amen and the guy was totally finished he got me hooked man and he took his business card and said please i beg you anything to do for you i want to help you i want to serve you i didn't do anything i've never heard such beautiful words may allah azzawajal make all the people like you so the story for allah then we would have a catastrophe in this world so good words have a magical impact on people if we manage to teach our children this they will grow up to be miracles walking on earth the famous story a man with his child were hitchhiking well hiking in in the mountains area and the child tripped so he cursed damn so he heard the echoing saying damn so he was agitated he said who are you and he heard who are you she said you're a fool and he heard that back beautiful and he started you know getting really agitated so his father smiled and said son why don't you say good words and hear what happens so the child said you're a good boy and he heard in return in reply you're a good boy thank you very much and he said thank you very much the essence of the story is that this is a story but our children children do learn from this when they come to you complaining that a a neighbor's son or a sibling took their toy and you tell them it's okay it's a toy give them another one and they're shocked of this reply and they do try and give another one and they find that the other child is reciprocating and giving them one of his hairs then they learn how to forgive how to pardon and how to share things with others such characteristics such ethics when you try to put them in your child at an early age have magnificent impact when they grow up yeah certainly there's even a story about a young boy that was instructed given a group of students they were all given an item and instructed to hide the item and a place where nobody can find this item and all the children went out and they hid it you know in the grass or in the mountains in the hills in different places and there was one of the students who never came back so the teacher went and looked out for him and finally found him and he said what happened to you everybody returned except you and he said i couldn't find a place to hide it where allah didn't know where it was subhanallah subhanallah so i would like to firstly begin with having adap and having ikhlas of course this is something that we have to teach our children to have how to have ada with allah in prayer by not moving and and and looking sideways when in prayer how to have adept with allah when asking and begging allah while doing how to praise allah azzawajal how to remember allah subhanahu ta'ala how to refrain from praising him when we are answering the call of nature or we when we are in an inappropriate thing how to attribute everything to allah it's part of adam good moral conduct to attribute everything we do to allah azzawajal's power so so many times this is a breach of the heat when we hear a ceo or a cfo explaining on the charts powerpoint saying that i manage in the first quarter to exceed the target by 67 and i opened a number of projects and they were successful i managed to generate so much profit to the company and attributing everything to himself this is disrespecting allah now his intention was not disrespectful but this is how it sounded we should attribute everything to allah this is part of our moral conduct and appreciation to allah because he the almighty is the actual doer and we could not have done anything without his guidance and assistance yeah this is beautiful um even having having uh good manners and morals with allah it teaches you from a very young age you know like we talked about to hate uh i remember being very young and i even outside of our parents we see students in school like young girls we went to like islamic school madrasa and going to school they would have hijab one and things of this nature but as soon as the bell rang and they were coming out the hijabs went flying the kufi won't fly and the jelly bear came off because no one was around to supervisors on the way between the school and home but there were some students that said whether my parents or teachers are watching me or not allah always sees me you know so this is like the adap until to be some of us some of the students had at a very young age unfortunately this is the problem with a lot of the muslims we we see this when we find that our muslim born muslim women when they are in their country they're abiding by the hijab the moment they board the plane even before taxiing even before taking off then the hijab is gone the western clothes appear the makeup then you in the biggest problem is that they are with their fa with their parents with their husbands sitting next to them these are what is this can't you see that this is haram don't you have any jealousy the problem is that they were not brought up to believe they were they grown up to they grew up to just follow the herd so whenever the pack is doing whatever the uh the posse is is is doing and going we will follow they go to hell we go to hell who cares we don't believe we don't have the conviction this is one of the shortcomings of upbringing your children on other than islam we are bring our children on taboo so whenever a child wants to do this in arabic meaning that no this is taboo this is inappropriate what will people say okay if i go to europe no one knows me so who cares but what people say because they won't say anything so we believe that it is the borders of our country it is the culture we live in corrects and falsifies whatever we do so is it right or wrong this is not determined by the quran in the sunnah the religion has nothing to do with this it's only salah and fasting this is religion but what i wear what i believe how i behave this is governed by the community by the society by the norm of the people i live among if i go abroad nobody cares and this shows you that the vast majority of us are muslims through an identity card not through conviction and this is why when riverts accept islam their islam is stronger than ours because they've transformed their lives shifted from darkness to the light with their own will unlike us who were born muslim and everybody's around us is muslim so okay we're in rome do as the romans do but when i'm out of rome then definitely you will see breaches of your own islam that's a very crucial point masha'allah and having we're going to pause here for a short break and we'll be right back to continue this discussion on adap viewers stay tuned we'll be right back insha'allah [Music] and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we're discussing tarubiya with discussing how do we rear children in a way that they have a good manner and good moral conducts and we left off talking about that with allah we would not like to talk about having added up with the parents insha'allah um this is a very crucial report we found in a religion even in the quran we'll find that allah will come combine uh his tahite worshiping him alone with viral validate with being good and having good conduct and good end up with the parents so i know this is a topic within itself that can take segments but inshallah let's try to begin okay first of all i'd like to reverse it yes usually people talk about how we should bring our children up to treat the parents now we are in the phase of bringing up our children in an islamic way so it is us who are supposed to deal with our children in adapt so the right approach would be yes we should teach our children how to respect be dutiful obedient and kind to their parents but at an early age this is not logical when a child is four or five years of age and you expect him to say yes sir yes ma'am and do the whole thing of respect no this is not you know logical what's logical is that the respect you give is the respect you'll get so the parents must learn how to deal with their children in respect they must respect the children's privacy they must respect the children's integrity they should not take their children for granted and just consider them as nothing or access baggage no these are your investment as stated before this is your capital so it is how you deal with them and this is how you treat them that would reflect in their upbringing we mentioned before the story of anas of malik may allah be pleased with him when the prophet isam sent him on an errand and he told him that this is a secret when anna's mother saw him and told and asked him why he was late and he told her that i was on a secret mission and she said what was that mission when he said it was a secret she respected that and she gave her son a lesson by telling him if it's a secret do not tell a soul about it and so did anas he never told anyone about the secret this is empowerment this is trusting your child and making him conceal such secrets so that he would not betray others it is the parents duty to take care of their children and to treat them with honesty the prophet so a woman telling her child come come trying to drag her child so that she could put your hands on him so come i'll give you the prophet did not let this slip allah because every incident there's a lesson so he said what are you going to give him so she opened her hand and there was a date and she said oh prophets of allah i was going to give him this date the prophet said alas islam had you not given him that date it would have been registered as a lie this is something that we as parents fail big time if i'm going out and my child says daddy take me with you no no i'm going to the doctor to take an injection this is a double lie so the child would grow up feeding doctors and he would be terrified of injections because of my life daddy uncle so-and-so wants to talk to you tell him i'm not here tell him i'm gone i'm teaching the child how to lie so where is the respect this is what the parents are doing when the mom is frustrated from her husband and she's chit-chatting with her daughter who's young said ah your ugly father is coming in an hour time your fat big father is coming he's this he's that the girl is going to grow up disrespecting her parents whether the mother of the father because this is what we what i have learned from my mother so this is an important and a crucial part of upbringing the children and instilling in them moral conduct ethics of course it goes without saying that we have to teach our children how to respect us when they're young so it's very beautiful to see the children coming kissing their parents hands and forehead whenever they come in or go out this is beautiful we have to do this the prophet used to do this as son with fatima his daughter and he used to do that to her so it's not only one-sided it's both expressing respect and love we have to teach our children not to answer back so many times the mother fails big time when she allows her daughter or son to answer back when i see this in my house i'm frustrated and i clearly make this obvious to the mother and telling her it is your mistake to allow your children to speak to you this way and later on they're going to speak to me like this and this is not something to be tolerated you have to draw the line respect obedience being dutiful not looking to the father and mother straight in the eye when they're angry because this is the biggest sign that you are not happy yeah yeah and this is the worst of all types of showing how un dutiful you are to your parents when you just look at them in in a strange a strange and strong way so there are so many things that we have to work on but again without disturbing the scale so not always bad things negative things always we have to balance this with love compassion and encouragement yeah i really admire the approach that you have taken uh many times it's always a one-sided thing where respect your parents respect your parents respect your parents but the opposite isn't true uh i remember one time i think i forgot it was something that my father asked me for and i said oh you know this is mine or something like this and i said it in the presence of the imam he said you mentioned the narration or something where he said my father never forgot this hadith this is a favorite hadith anytime he he requests something of me say you and ever whatever you have belonged to me uh but you know again this had this hadith by the way a lot of the people are confused yeah so a lot of parents would just come and take everything that the son has and this is wrong the understanding of the hadith is that whatever is in access to what you need and the father needs it and he's not going to use it for the benefits of your siblings otherwise if the hadith was understood like the imam explained it to you and your father understood it if you were to die your father's inheritance would not be one-sixth he would have taken the whole thing but no he has a percentage simply because this is what allah has given him so the hadith is understood in this context if your father is in need and you are a wealthy well-off person your father can take from your wealth whatever suffices him providing that this does not harm you and your family so he should not take from you what would make you short from uh uh giving your wife and kids two he should not be well off himself a lot of the millionaires still go to their children and take their money you got enough no i'm not in i'm not obliged to give you a penny because you're rich thirdly that he should not utilize what he takes from you to spend over his siblings because then you'll become envious and you will hate your siblings like the brothers of yusuf not your brothers like the brothers of prophet you have peace be upon him hated him yeah i have five brothers i mean um something this is a very crucial point as well i remember when i was younger and i used to go to places my mother that she wasn't born and raised muslim she converted later so certain times in her tibia she would teach us things that wasn't necessarily from the quran or sunnah by word but in in its application it would be so she would always say whenever you go to a place the first thing you unpack is not your clothes it's your manners so be mindful of your management so i remember one time i traveled somewhere and where i was staying an item went missing so they called my mother and said well you know yusuf is here and something went missing we don't know if we're not accusing him of anything and my mother right away and i could hear her on the phone speaking she said right away she said my son he does many things he has many mistakes that he makes if you told me that he's messy his clothes all over the place that's yusuf however yusuf he does not steal so whatever is missing you're going to find it and wallahi until this day decades later i never forgot that so because i heard her defending me in this way it stuck in my mind yusuf doesn't steal you know until this day it's something that i've like invested in my mind so so where did you hide the item it was in my pocket but sometimes your parents validating you it goes a very very different way definitely encouragement ask the children at school they will say my fifth grade teacher he said something that resonated with me until i finish my phd and you remember things words of yani for example imam al-bukhari was in the class of abu s depending on who is pronouncing it and he said if you guys were to yeah any compile something that connects the authentic hadith of the prophet allah he said this resonated with me until i came up with the idea of the sahih al-bukhari and so many things words that people hear when they're young that impacts them positively when they grow up we're going to stop the segment here insha'allah as always thank you for your immense knowledge and great wisdom benefit from you a lot uh until next time insha'allah thank you so much again viewers thank you so much for joining us we hope that you uh receive great benefit and merit from this and may allah allow us all to be better parents and raise our children well and for us to be better children as well uh until next time assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] oh"
