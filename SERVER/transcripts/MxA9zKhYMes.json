  "transcript": "Shareen says is it necessary for a Muslim woman to be a part of a group of people who take part in Islamic Dawa or do Tabler in short is every Muslim obliged or obligated to participate in the work of Dawa if one does not involve himself in the work of Dawa what will be the consequences according to Islamic Shariah when you believe in something you usually act upon it and it is wrong to limit Dawa to giving talks and seminars not everyone is qualified or capable to give talks like us not because we are superstars or superheroes rather we were fortunate from allah azzawajal to have this platform and for the people to trust us but not everyone can just all of a sudden shoot for that so that way is not limited in speeches leading the prayer giving lectures it can be through social media I know a lot of my team may Allah bless them all that are involved a lot in Dawa so a sister that runs my Facebook account the Q&A do you think that she is less in reward than me who's giving levette was no she is exactly the same whatever I say she gets the reward a sister who channels my videos and lectures and transcribes it in towards for those who are deaf and cannot hear so they read the lecture and they benefit from it she's getting this same reward a brother who drives me from the airport or from the hotel to the conference area anticipating the reward that I'm taking the share to deliver a lecture he's rewarded exactly as I am so that way is not limited you can make that way through the internet social media Facebook you can gather women if you are a sister in your community and give them two three times a week a class to seed in Rio de Sala hane in anything you can give their way through the way you walk and talk my presence in a room is a dowel by itself your hijab is it our by itself now joining the tab Leary Jamar is not something that we advise off I have many friends who are from this jamar they are among the kindest the most generous the most helpful people you'll ever find they never curse their sweethearts seriously but their practice of the Deen is not correct and they have a lot of innovations so is it mandatory for a woman or a man to join the answer is no it's not only not mandatory it is prohibited to join them because they are not based on knowledge or what they focus on is their sick soul and their growing the beard shorting the table using the miswak praying in the Masjid that's it if you talk to them about anything of knowledge they say these are issues of dispute and dispute divides the Ummah and they would not allow this to take place so generally speaking people must not join this Gemara because they are not following the right way of the hadith or of the Sunnah or the way of the Prophet SS Ram but they are kind don't be hostile to them they're kind they're loving their generous Dawa is so white the sky is the limit you can do so many things in terms of that way that complies with the Quran and with the Sunnah"
