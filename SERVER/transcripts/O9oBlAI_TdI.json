  "transcript": "we will attempt to talk about two of our mothers two great women whom the prophet alaihis salatu lived with and impacted their lives profoundly the first wife of the prophet salallahu salaam is jewish was not her original name azim and abbas may allah be pleased with him and with his father said that her real name was barra and barra meant pious or righteous and it was a habit that the prophet salallahu would change most names that had self-praise to them and he used to not like people saying he left righteous or pious when he leaves the house instead of saying he left hint or he left fatima which is a normal name because it insinuates that he has left righteousness and piety and this is why scholars say that it is not recommended to call or to name your daughter as tukka or iman so that when someone calls and says is iman there and he said no there is no email meaning that it's a double edge a sword that can mean the person is not there but also it can mean that there is no iman there is no tuka there is nothing as such so the prophet islam used to change names bad names into good names names that imply praising one's self into normal names so for example he changed the name of hasan one of the companions name was hasan which means difficult and he said no your name is sal easy so he used to change such names now we don't have a lot about the wives of the prophet salallahu and the books of sira only highlights what was important what had an impact on the life of that mother of the believer or generally on seerah itself and the life of the prophet sallallahu wasalah and the lessons that can be learned from it so what's the story with jewelry jewelry was the daughter of al harith and banil they were a tribe that assisted the idol worshipers being themselves idol worshipers they assisted the people of quraish in their battles such as the battle of uhud and they kept on intimidating the muslims and expressing hostility towards islam so when the prophet heard alaihis that they were preparing their armies to attack the muslims the prophet allah had to take a preemptive measure and he went with the muslims to attack them and they took them by surprise being the enemies of islam an open enemy and there was a fight where men were killed others fled while the women and the children were taken as slaves and captive captives of war so juwairi abintelharith was given as part of the booty of war the spoils of war to one of the warriors and he was may allah be pleased with him and thrabbit himself has a history with the prophet allah because he was the orator he was the spokesman of the prophet whenever tribes came and they met face to face they would appoint someone to give a speech praising his tribe and their achievements so he's known as the khatib so the prophet allah had thabit as his spokesman due to his loud voice and due to his fluency and beautiful language so she was appointed and given to him being who she was a woman of great honor and social status the daughter of the tribe's leader so she was a princess and not a common woman she could not live with the thought of being a slave in islam there is an option for slavery they can buy themselves out a slave can go to his master and say listen i would like to buy myself out how much would you like and the guy would say if i were to display you for sale i would get maybe a thousand dollars so a thousand dollars is good for me so the slave goes and work depending on his expertise and knowledge and gains the money and gives it to his master and he's free to go so she went to thaab divine place and she asked him for such a transaction and he agreed but she was penniless she had nothing no money no wealth and her father fled and all the men in her tribe ran away with the lives so she thought that the only alternative is to ask people to assist her by that time she had already accepted islam and this is logical and normal most people have resentment to islam due to what they see in the media and you can't blame them the media brainwashes them if they don't put some effort to research and read objectively on their own they are like the rest of the herd if the herd leader goes left they all go left even if it's a cliff that they're going to fall off they just follow the herd leader so those who liberate themselves from the effect of unbiased or bias media and research it would find the truth joeyro was one of them yes she was taken as a prisoner aware of war yes she was enslaved but when she saw islam and she realized that all what she was hearing from her father from the other tribesmen about islam was false she accepted it so she went to the prophet to seek his financial assistance mother aisha narrates the hadith and she says that when she came seeking permission to speak with the prophet the moment i set eyes on her i hated it this is what mother is saying she says she was beautiful charming and cute any man would set eyes on her would be captivated by her beauty so she said i did not like this i hated it she's a woman she knows so when she talked to the prophet al-islam she said o prophet of allah my name is the head of his tribe and their leader and you have seen what had happened to me and i was given to thabit ibn kais so i bought myself from him and he agreed so now i am here to seek your assistance in paying off my debt so the prophet alaihim gave her a choice so he said to her would you like something that is better meaning that i can give you money to set yourself free but would you like me to give you something which is an offer you cannot refuse she said what would that be oh prophet of allah and the prophet said i'll pay off your debt and i'll marry you now being who she was the daughter of the leader of her tribe the princess and being the one proposing to her is the prophet of allah the strongest man in arabia a messenger a prophet from allah who can come close to him no one so she immediately on the spot accepted this offer that no one can refuse and she says of course o prophet of allah i would take this offer so the prophet said i have done that meaning that i've paid your dues and i married you and the news came out to the people to the companions that the prophet was so the people who were with the prophet allah who had prisoners of war under their control which was money they said how is it possible that the prophet's in-laws are enslaved with us this is not befitting we set all the captives under our control free for the sake of allah and after that for the sake of the prophet's new wife imagine how many people were set free the narration says by setting joaries free and marrying her she was the most influential she was the most favorable or she had the favor and the blessing over her tribe no woman could have done this to her own people she got a hundred household hundred families all freed and set free from slavery because of her marriage to the prophet alaihis salatu more blessing can there be now people who do not have iman who do not believe they would criticize and say oh the prophet married her because she was beautiful and charming as if it is an insult when you as a human being want to eat something would you eat trash or would you eat a beautiful and tasty meal would anyone condemn you if you were to drink something that is sweet and cold instead of taking something that is bitter or bad is the prophet a human being or not he is a human being and he likes to eat to drink and he likes women he himself told us about himself that from your world allah made beautiful to me women and perfumes he loves to smell good things so only the idol worshipers criticized the messengers of allah long ago that they eat food and they walk in the markets they're normal human beings and this is insane no one said that the prophets are not human beings they are human beings and the more they have this urge to natural things the more perfect they are it is totally wrong to think that being celibate is something positive or something natural this is not natural what is natural is what allah has put in us this attraction to the opposite gender so that we can get married and we can reproduce so the prophet islam was a perfect man with desires but when you compare him to others you will see that the difference between the heavens and the earth he was extremely strong as a man yet he was satisfied with a woman 15 years older than him from the age of 25 until the age of 50. never ever had a second wife or anything of the sword and then he married someone his age who was in her fifties and was saudi benzema may allah peace with her and he stayed with her for three more years we know that the companions used to talk and say that the prophet isam was given the power of thirty men he's not like us he's so strong especially when it comes to issues of intimacy he's the perfect man yet with all his fasting with all his night prayer with all his obligations which would normally wreck a normal person the prophet had the power of 30 men so it is not shameful it is not something that is bad to seek what is halal through marriage and look at the consequence of such a choice the prophet would not let someone who's like joarie who is a princess to be given as a concubine to one of the companions she would not be happy in her life her master would not be happy with her and she may cause problems and trouble to him she must be given to someone her equal or more superior so that she would be satisfied and fulfilled and this is what happened when the prophet married her allah and her barakah and her blessing of such a marriage was cascaded to all of her people who were set free and they were all freed how old was she she was 20 years of age when the prophet married her how long did she live with the prophet salallahu not more than six years and the prophet died afterwards and this is also important to pay attention to nowadays girls and women fail to weigh things properly and their parents as well so if a person proposes to a girl they look at the age difference and he says no no no he's too old for her why because he's 10 years older or 15 years older what's wrong in that so no this is a big gap this it should be like three or four years difference this is not realistic a man at the moment graduates when he's 23 or 24 years from college then he joins the private sector or the workforce he needs like three four more years to collect money in order to open a house and get married so by the time he's 28 years of age which is the average he will not look for someone who's 28 years of age or even 25 years of age he would look for someone who's 17 or 16 or maximum 18. and if women and girls continue to refuse they'll grow older and older and the proposals will get less and less the demand is far less than the supply for every man there are like 15 or 20 women candidates so she cannot pick and choose he can pick and choose i know a friend who's over 60 years of age healthy masha'allah and capable of getting married he's trying to get married to anyone that accepts him we propose to women in their 40s imagine and she says no no no he's too old for that for me he's not a patient that you will take care of he is a healthy man but still these misconceptions ruin our lives they hinder women from living their lives what's wrong if you marry someone 60 or 65 years of age who's still fit and capable of earning and oh what you need is a husband you're not going to be his nurse what's wrong in that the prophet married her son when he was 57 years of age and she was 20 years of age and she lived these six years with utmost happiness women don't think like this and they keep on postponing and delaying until it is too late for them so julia made the right choice a choice of a lifetime she became the mother of the believers and she loved the prophet alaihis was like all of his wives her father al-harith came to the prophet after a while after the marriage was done so he said to him in a truce where he came and said oh prophet of allah jewelry is my daughter and i am an honorable man my daughter cannot fall into slavery so ask whatever you want and i'll give it to you if you want a hundred camels which is a real big fortune i'll give it to you so the prophet said to him how about i'll give you a better proposal keep your money and i'll give her the choice if she chooses you so be it but if she chooses to stay with me then you will honor that and her father said well i you you leave me no other choice than this beautiful unfair and just choice so he goes to his daughter and he says to his daughter in a doubtful manner because he senses something fishy and he says to her juarea do not disgrace us your family and tribe the man has given you the choice so what do you choose without any hesitation she said i choose the prophet of allah and her father said by allah you've disgraced us you choose this new man who killed your people enslaved your families and took you as a prisoner of war as a slave woman over me your father of course that would be the logical choice where would you find someone like the prophet to serve let alone to get married to so she made the right decision and she was one of the righteous practicing wives of the prophet alaihis was narrated that ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him said that juarez told him that once the prophet allah left her house to go and pray fajr prayer and she was in the place of her worship where she prays her night prayer and fajr etc so the prophet went and came back like an hour and a half later when it was morning and she was still where she was so the prophet asked her are you still in the same position i left you she said yes meaning a whole hour and a half so she said yes so the prophet said allah i said four words for sentences that if they were to be weighed with all what you had said today meaning this hour and a half it would overweigh them i said these four phrases three times what were they the prophet said subhanallah as many as creations allah has said as much as allah is satisfied with was in as heavy as the throne is as much as the ink which allah's words and commands are written by so the prophet acknowledged her devotion to worshiping allah azza and he directed her to what is the best bukhari reported in his sahih that the prophet allah came into juria's house on a friday while she was fasting so the prophet asked her did you fast yesterday she said no are you going to fast tomorrow she said no the prophet said to her then break your fast meaning that it is not permissible to isolate friday with fasting unless you fast the day before and a day after this was jewelry bin a beautiful name rarely you will find people calling their why their daughters joaria one of my daughter's names is joarie and i remember going to a hospital once and the receptionist was taking the information so he says what's the patient name i said joaria and she said you what i said you and she's a muslim she said why what did she do wrong you call her this name i said subhanallah the mother of the believer your mother and you don't know her name she said i've never heard this name before in my life she's the wife of the prophet arizona yes she said i know only of khadijah and that's it and subhanallah about the ignorance we have been one of the mothers of the believers and one of the wives of the prophet and unfortunately"
