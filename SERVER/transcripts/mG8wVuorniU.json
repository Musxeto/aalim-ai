  "transcript": "foreign okay I'm dealing with a complex situation now where alhamdulillah through hard work and uh prayer and Dua I have reached Medical School my father has paid tuition but then I kind of relapsed and we went to preliminary year again and so yeah I'm I do not feel happy or passionate in this position alhamdulillah it's a very uh prestigious you know schooling to go to medical school but I don't feel the happiness in it and I prayed and I looked into other professions but will I be sinful for giving up uh uh relatively clear path to like Financial stability and wasting my father's money if I do change professions not everyone is cut to a specific profession we as fathers fail to understand this son I'd like you to be a medical doctor maybe he's not cut for medicine School maybe he is more driven to engineering or management or a handicraft I cannot and I should not force my child to choose something I want rather look what he's inclined to that would make him happy and that he would perfect rather than what I want or that would make me happy even if my son chooses to be a janitor it's a good job if he likes it so be it so don't put yourself and limit yourself in this profession if you don't like it and what's gone a year or two a few hundred thousand here and there is better than continuing to four or five years more and more money is wasted and then you come to the Rock where you say I can't go any further so it's best to take your decision now and do what you want to do"
