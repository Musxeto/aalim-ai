  "transcript": "snob manova he al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Nibiru theorem attend Liliana me novena muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in and my dear brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of women around the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam our guest for tonight is a woman unlike other women a mother of the believers who is someone to stand on her own a companion that is known for things that other companions did not have a wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam whom allah azza wajal sent his ark angel jibreel peace be upon him to rule something of her destiny something that was essential in her life Gibran who does not come down to earth except for mega things and important things came for this important issue and that is that the Prophet alleys of Salaam revokes her divorce reconciles with her for a reason that we will come to discuss later on Isha Allah she is our mother sir may Allah be pleased with her her father is Roman and hubbub the second caliph and the second closest companion to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam her mother is zeyneb bent mother owned Hafsa was born five years before the Prophet Allah so salam was revealed to which means that when she migrated to Medina she was 18 years of age and she is the eldest of our modern hot tubs children may Allah peace with him which indicates the falsehood of the story that so many people talk about when Roma allegedly said may Allah be pleased with him that he once buried one of his daughters alive and while burying her alive she was cleaning his beard from the dust that was coming from that grave and he used to cry whenever he remembers it having Hafsah is a clear evidence that such a story is false and not befitting of someone such as Omar may Allah be pleased with him and Hafsa was older than the other son of Rome are the great companion of Allah Abdullah Huebner Omar the great narrator the great scholar what we are to talk about women around the Prophet is awesome and not his companions Hafsah was very young when she got married to hone a signal whose ever may allah be pleased with them they both accepted Islam together kinase went to Abyssinia in the first migration and he was with earth merimna fan and the daughter of the prophet Alessandro pea and there were about 12 men and four women then he came back with those who came back from Abyssinia then he took his wife and they both migrated to Medina so hafsa was among the first to migrate to Medina who nice may Allah be pleased with him was one of the great companions of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam he fought by the side of the prophet alayhi salatu salam during the battle of better only to suffer serious injuries which led to his death and he became one of the martyrs of the Battle of Badr of course being a 20 year old young woman widowed at such an early age this brought a lot of sadness to her heart and no one can blame her for that this is only human romanovna hot pop her father whenever he saw her in such a state his heart was broken so he did what any wise man would do he started looking for a potential suitor for his daughter now being in his shoes one would feel proud how do I go around and look for a spouse for my own daughter they should come and this is partly true but here we have to weigh the pros and cons would you want to wait for 10 20 years without getting any proposals for your daughter and watching her become older and older just because of your pride Omar may Allah be pleased with him had the the the interests he has he had the interest of his daughter coming first so he went to earth man and earth man was recently widowed as well his wife R'lyeh had died while the Prophet I saw son was at the Battle of Badr and it would be more than logical to look for another wife so he approached hearth man and said earth man how about marrying my daughter have some sort man told him give me a couple of days I need to think about it and few days later he said with a kind apology that I'm not interested in getting married I'm I'm still mourning my beloved wife and this is a different issue it was a true love story known to all of Quraysh the marriage of earth man and the daughter of the prophet Isaiah may Allah be pleased with them they were the most handsome and beautiful couple but this is unless destiny Allah willed it that she dies so he was depressed and he did not feel like getting married at that moment did your mother give up nope he went to Abu Bakr now Abu Bakr was at the time about 51 years of age so he was much older than earth man and he's older than Homer himself yet a father looks for a real man that can protect his daughter what do I as a father look for a rich person no someone with influence know someone who is an athlete no I look for all of this if possible I look for a real man who can be my daughter's Rock she can depend on him he can respect her love her and have mercy on her so Homer went to the second candidate that he thinks that would be best for his daughter he went to Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr was his best friend and he was the best friend of the Prophet I saw some at the same time so he went to his best friend and said to him a Booker what do you think of marrying hafsa would you consider that and to his shock abu bakr may allah be pleased with him did not even apologize did not even reply to him he just left him and went Omar may Allah be pleased with him said that I felt stabbed betrayed I felt so hurt more than what I felt with earth man because of man at least apologized and this is demand and supply I don't have any ill feeling towards the earth man if I proposed to you that doesn't mean that you have to accept my proposal its demand and supply but with Abu Bakr it was a different story Abu Bakr did not even reply to me few days later the prophet alayhi salatu salam proposed to omar so that he would marry Hafsah and of course Omer was more than happy to give his daughter to the prophet alayhi salaatu son who can be better than the Prophet rasulallah then he met Abu Bakr so Abu Bakr started saying to him Ramar did you feel bad towards me not replying to you Omer did not hold back he said yes by Allah I felt hurt then Abu Bakr explained to him what he could not understand at that time Abu Bakr said Oh Omar oh my brother oh my dear friend I heard the prophet alayhi salatu salam few days ago mentioning Hafsa now remember Abu Bakr's daughter is married to the Prophet Ali salatu salam aisha is married to the Prophet yet the Prophet was mentioning getting married to have son in front of God and caught his father-in-law and that was normal to Abu Bakr because they know that marrying more than one wife when you're fair and just and when you are a real true man that this is your right there is nothing wrong in that so Abu Bakr said to Omar Omar I heard the Prophet as I'm mentioning Hafsa and his interest in marrying her and then you proposed to me and by Allah I would not have disclosed the secret of the Prophet as a sinner how can I tell you that the Prophet has mentioned her how can I even say such a thing or apologize from such a thing without exposing what the Prophet Elias awesome has entrusted me with therefore when the Prophet allas allas Aram proposed now I'm telling you what had happened by Allah if the prophet elisha wasallam did not propose i would have accepted her marriage to myself she's a good woman and you're a good friend and what can be better than us being bond by such marriage and subhanAllah the Prophet again married someone who was a widow was in need and married her to strengthen the bond between him and his companions so he married the daughter of Abu Bakr he married the daughter of Umar the second caliph he gave two of his daughters as we will come and see insha'Allah to earth man the third caliph and he gave his own daughter Fatima to the fourth caliph which was I leave now with all that may Allah be pleased with them all all these marriages have a reason and a purpose marriage is not done just because she's beautiful or just because I have the money to get married again and again marriage is done for a purpose for a wisdom to have more in-laws which strengthens your position in the society and allows you to do good things and transmit these good things through your in-laws to know people to know the community you live in the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam married Hafsah after butter and some say he married her on the third year of hijra which is the year of the Battle of a hood now this is truly a magnificent lesson for us fathers if you have a daughter and she's in need of marriage but there is no one proposing there's nothing wrong in going and looking for a good proposal for her and it is extremely important to lower your bar many girls stay without marriage when she was 18 a man proposed who was 28 she said 10 years difference he's too old I want someone close to my age so she reached 23 and the one proposing now is 35 said no no no this is too much I don't want to get married and rejected so many proposals now she's 28 or 30 years of age all those who come are either widowed with children or wanting a second or a third wife or someone who is over 60 and looking for a nurse to take care of him don't raise the bar too much unless you are Miss Universe but if you are a normal person marriage is not about the looks marriage is not about the ability to go to Marbella or to go to code azul every summer for a month vacation marriage is about respect about love about affection about protection even if he is poor even if he's not that handsome what counts is the life in the house the marriage itself unfortunately we were brainwashed all over the past years with movies TV series soap operas so our perception of life has different women may fight not to become a second wife they would rather stay unmarried rather than marrying someone who was divorced or has a wife or has children then what end up biting their hands and wishing they had accepted that it's too late so we have to be realistic and we have to weigh things according to their reality Hafsa was a knowledgeable woman among all the companions the female companions she was among the very very few who knew how to read and write and this is this was really rare among the women of Arabia at that time and she used to be involved in poetry and literature and whenever she spoke her words were few but profound deep throughout the years she lived in the prophets house had in salat wa salam and she lived for eight years only she learned a lot from the prophet Isaiah saw to Salam and she conveyed to us how he lived his journey generosity the way he treated her she learned from the prophet alayhi salatu salam so many things that she told us that the Prophet used to fast the first three days of every month Monday Thursday and a Monday from the second week and she used to say that whenever the Prophet used to sleep he used to put his cheek on his right hand and say Arab opinion Arabic Iannetta bathory baddack oh allah protect me from your torment when you resurrect your servants she narrated more than 60 hadith and these are found in the sahi and also in the Sunnah and she conveyed to the Muslim Ummah a lot of great knowledge that all of us are benefiting from till date may Allah be pleased with her now mother Aisha was known for her jealousy and so was mother Hafsah and so was mother Zeynep what is this when you married to one man all of them fight to be his favorite and to gain his love and attention more than the others and this is human nature this is natural that women become jealous and this is how Allah Azza WA JAL created them mother aisha told us that the wives of the Prophet Isis Sam were divided into two parties one party led by Aisha which included Hafsa soda sofia and another party led by own Salama which had Zeynep bent Josh on Habiba etc so you can imagine the plotting the hidden diplomacy the strategies that these righteous pious practicing mothers of ours used to do and how the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to live amidst all of this it wasn't an easy right and the Prophet suffered alayhi salatu was-salam and he suffered willingly because he knows that this is the nature of women and we know that they had done so many things that we nowadays would not ever accept but the Prophet is awesome accepted it calmed the people and he said your mother have become jealous don't worry yes she broke the dish yes she made the food spread all over the floor it was her jealousy don't worry about that now for one reason or the other the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam divorced hafsa and that was a huge shock to her father the close friend of the Prophet Isis Salam to her family Adam and earth man even him of her own her maternal uncles and to herself of course the prophet's divorce irresolute Salam for Hafsa was not due to hatred he loved her but it was to reprimand her for something we don't have knowledge of speculations are there maybe because she spread the secret that the Prophet told her is awesome not to tell anyone maybe it was because this it was because that this is none of our business but we have to acknowledge that it took place now due to who have saw was may Allah be pleased with her Allah sent down his arc angel jibreel peace be upon him and he told the Prophet are yourself Salam o Muhammad revoked the divorce and reconciled with Hafsah get her back as your wife for she is a woman that fasts all the time and prays night prayer every night and she is your wife in paradise full stop the directive came to the Prophet immediately Alice wasn't complied look at the description for in the house away Merton hawawa she is a woman who frequently fasts and frequently praised night prayer these attributes make her a gem that should be preserved so regardless of the reason that you had divorced her for get her back and the Prophet is Lam complied with that command immediately and got her back now in this we can also learn that divorce can happen even among the pious even even among the righteous in practicing this is not something that is prohibited it is not something that the laymen say often that the throne of allah azzawajal is shaken for divorce in that it is the worst halal thing to allah this is not true sometimes divorce is mandatory if you don't do it your sinful depending on the scenario sometimes it's recommended sometimes it's permissible sometimes it's not recommended some accrue and sometimes it's totally prohibited a wise man was contemplating on divorcing his wife so a man came to him and said why are you contemplating on divorcing your wife so he said Subhan Allah a gentleman is not asked about such things a gentleman does not tell how do you want me to expose my wife's shortcomings to you and after a few months or years after he divorced her the same man came to him and said why did you divorce your wife so the wise man said looking at him and this is none of my business she's someone's else wife now why would I tell you so concealing the secrets is very important and hence we don't know why he divorced her for but we know that divorce is something that is mentioned in the Quran Allah Azza JAL made a whole surah a chapter by the title of divorce and the rules are mentioned in Surat al-baqarah and elsewhere to tell you that this is something which is part of religion such as marriage such as reconcile reconciliation after divorce now one of her greatest attributes that she was chosen to keep the copy the first copy of the Quran collected as we know at the time of boubakr may Allah be pleased with him a lot of those who memorized the Quran were martyred in on the battlefield so it was suggested that they collect the Quran and put it in one master copy so that they can go to it whenever there is any fear of error so that the Koran would be preserved Allah pledged to preserve it so they appointed Zeta Biff Abbott may Allah be pleased with him and he started the mission of collecting the Quran and putting it in sewers I after I as they have all memorized it all of them memorize the Quran so they just wanted to collect the written portions of it in a book as Allah described it in the Quran that it is a book and then one once it was completed they kept this copy with a mother hafsa may Allah be pleased with her and it stayed with her until the time of birth man even - may Allah be pleased with him when he made four copies from that master copy also appointing the mission Tuesday to inhabit may Allah be pleased with them all and she lived her life after the death of the Prophet Allah worshipping Allah reviving her night with night prayer reciting the Quran revising a teaching knowledge to those who come and seek it until she died in 41 the year for the 41st after the Hegira and some say she died on the 45th of hijra may allah azzawajal be pleased with her and may Allah Azza WA JAL make her and all of our mothers with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam pleased with them and may allah azzawajal give our women a role model to follow like what they had lived and did Heather Allahu Alem when especially L merely Aslam sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad water early he was happy he had me"
