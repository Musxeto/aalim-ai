  "transcript": "[Music] What is the concept of change in Islam? Change the evil action you see with your hand. And this of course is limited to those who have power over the people who are doing this evil. So I have power over my children. I can change it with my hand. I have power over my subordinates in my company. So I can change it by hand. I cannot change this evil action by hand. I should do this by advice. I should speak out and say this is haram. This is a sin. This is forbidden. You are doing an evil act. You should refrain from it. Shehim will address us on the topic the concept of change in Islam. A brief background about the sheh before I invite him to take to the podium. Shehim al-Hakim is a graduate of the King Abdul Aziz University in the field of linguistics. He holds a high diploma in Islamic studies which he achieved at Omul Kural University from Mecca Saudi Arabia. He has fulfilled the role of imam for the past 21 years in various massagids where he has taught extensively on many Islamic fields and going in depth to various Islamic books. He has taken part in many conferences not only in India but also in the UK and various other countries. He is a regular presenter and speaker on peace TV, Huda TV, various channels within Saudi Arabia and also radio channels within the kingdom. So I would like to invite to take to the podium to address us on the concept of changing Islam, Shehim Alakim from Saudi Arabia. Oh, heat, heat. Alhamdulillah. It is without no doubt that we live in a changing world. 20 years ago, the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain fell down. And no one had ever anticipated this. The Soviet Union does not exist any longer. So many changes that had taken place. We live in a world where things are taking place in a very fast pace to the extent that in some cases it is difficult if not impossible to catch up with these changes. Everyone around us is asking us to change. Long ago when there was only radio, it was said that we needed 50 or 40 years to reach an audience of 50 million. And when TV came, it took about 14 years to reach an audience of 40 million. And with the internet it took only four years or less to reach this number of audience. So we are living in an everchanging world and everyone says we have to adapt. Muslims have to change. So what is the concept of change in Islam? Change from an Islamic point of view is neither negative or positive. It depends on the context this change is taking place. For example, one of the most positive changes that the world has ever encountered was the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam. the catalyst of change whom Allah the Almighty sent to the worlds to transform them and to get them out from darkness into light. Sallallam Allah the Almighty sent him to change the world but also to improve and develop as well. The prophet tells us about himself. I was merely sent to perfect the moral conduct to perfect the ethics of the people. Which means that before he was sent, the Arabs had moral conduct. They had good manners in a sense, but there were things missing. So the prophetat wasallam was sent to complete develop and improve to change these conducts to go in line with the Quran and Sunnah. Among the positive change that is instructed and requested by Islam is the change of evil and the enforcement of virtue and good. The prophet says, \"Whoever among you see an evil action then let him change it with his hand.\" So the prophet is ordering us change the evil action you see with your hand. And this of course is limited to those who have power over the people who are doing this evil. So I have power over my children. I can change it with my hand. I have power over my subordinates in my company. I can change it by hand. I have power over my subjects. If I'm a ruler or a governor, so I can change it by hand. The prophet goes on to sayatam if he cannot then with his tongue by speaking out. So if I don't have control over a person I cannot change this evil action by hand. I should do this by advice. I should speak out and say this is haram. This is a sin. This is forbidden. You are doing an evil act. you should refrain from it. And the prophet goes on to stage number three where he saysam and if he cannot then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith. So if you see something that is wrong you must not sit down. You have to leave. If you cannot change it with your hand and if you cannot speak out then you must change it with your heart. And this is done by leaving away from the place this evil act is taking place. [Music] to unite your heart, to unite your family, to unite the nations, and to unite the world. The world, but how? Not east, not west, not my way, not your way, but the way of Allah. [Music] Unity is in Islam. To know more, watch my program, Unity in Islam, only on Peace TV.

Narrated Anus bin Malik may Allah be pleased with him. The prophet may peace be upon him said, \"None of you should wish for death because of a calamity befalling him. But if he has to wish for death,\" he should say, \"Oh Allah, keep me alive as long as life is better for me and let me die if death is better for me.\" Sah al- Bkari volume 7 book of patience hadith number 5671. [Music] Where truth is hidden and misleading quotations create confusion. Where truth is hidden lack of knowledge and wisdom cause upheaval and commotion. Where truth is hidden, manipulated scriptures and twisted facts emerge. This very hidden truth creates false propaganda, mayhem, chaos, disorder and turmoil in our lives and the world order. But is there anyone with courage and [Music] wisdom? What is the truth and who has the courage to expose it? [Music] Because it's your right to know the truth. Watch truth prevail and lies perish in truth exposed by Dr. Zakir Naik next on Peace TV. The prophet says, \"Whoever among you see an evil action then let him change it with his hand.\" So the prophet is ordering us change the evil action you see with your hand. And this of course is limited to those who have power over the people who are doing this evil. So I have power over my children. I can change it with my hand. I have power over my subordinates in my company. I can change it by hand. I have power over my subjects if I'm a ruler or a governor. So I can change it by hand. The prophet goes on to sayatam if he cannot then with his tongue by speaking out. So if I don't have control over a person I cannot change this evil action by hand I should do this by advice. I should speak out and say this is haram. This is a sin. This is forbidden. You are doing an evil act. you should refrain from it. And the prophet goes on to stage number three where he saysam and if he cannot then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith. So if you see something that is wrong you must not sit down. You have to leave. If you cannot change it with your hand and if you cannot speak out then you must change it with your heart and this is done by leaving away from the place this evil act is taking place. A lot of the Muslims unfortunately when they fail in stage one or two, they say that leaving this or changing this evil act by sitting down idle and not speaking and they claim that they're changing it with their hearts. You're not. When you participate in an evil act by sitting down, this is part of the evil act. Some watch programs on TV where they insult Islam, insult Quran, insult our prophetatam and the people are watching it. What are you doing? You're neither changing this evil with your hand nor with your mouth. You're not talking. So why are you watching it? He says, \"What can I do? I'm just watching it.\" There are films that insult Allah the Almighty. People come to me and tell me that we saw this film that insults Allah, makes fun of Allah, makes fun of Jesus Christ peace be upon him. And I tell them that there is a possibility that you have nullified your Islam by watching that film by watching that program. And he says why I pray I fast. Well, allahel answered this question of yours by saying and it has already been revealed to you in the book that is in the Quran that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and mocked at then sit not with them until they engage in a talk other than that. But if you stayed with them certainly in that case you would be like them the hypocrites and the disbelievers. So we have to change an evil act when we see one. Muslims are known to participate. If you see a woman being attacked in the street, others may sit idle and watch or turn to the other side. Muslims do not do this. They're active and they defend the people for the sake of Allah and also for the sake of peace. They have to change the evil otherwise Allah the Almighty will punish them. Allah the Almighty says to those who are good in themselves they pray, they fast, they give zakat, they give charity, but they are passive. They do not change evil actions when it happen in front of them. They're passive. They don't do it. Allah warned them and he said that the punishment when it descends on those who do wrong, it will also include those who are passive. Allah says, \"And fear the affliction and trial. Fear the fitna which affects not in particular those of you who do wrong but it also may afflict the good all the good and also all the bad. So when you sit idle allahel will include you in the punishment. The prophet warned us from thisatam warned us from not changing the society and he said that whenever a minority of people do wrong things amongst the majority who are proud who have the power and dignity yet they fail to stop them from doing this evil and they do not change this evil. Whenever this happens, Allahawel would have his wrath, his anger over all the good and the bad. Islam came with the concept of change in a number of things. For example, the prophetat wasam used to change the names that were not in accordance to the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. So he would change bad names and he would change names that would praise oneself. For example, he changed the name of to Zab and B means a pious woman, a woman with virtue and this is praising oneself. So the prophet changed the nameatam. He also changed the name of a person's name Shan. So he changed it and he changed the name of a crow. All bad names he used to change thematam. And of course this also includes if the name is being a servant and a slave of other than Allah. So if one's name is the servant of Jesus or the servant of alat or al gods that people used to worship before the time of the prophetatam he used to change these names and one may ask if I accept Islam do I have to change my name and the answer is no. If your name is not insulting Islam, you don't have to change it. If your name is George or Michael or George Michael, you can keep this name and you don't have to change it. But it is recommended. It's better for you to change it so that people would identify you as a Muslim. So when someone comes and says, \"My name is John Smith.\" He might be Muslim but most likely he's not. But if his name is for example Ahmed Smith then definitely I would know that he is a Muslim. The prophetat wasam also instructed us to change and he recommended us to change the appearance of a person and this is not mandatory as in the case of the father of Abu Bakr Sudik. May Allah be pleased with him. His father's name was Abu Hafa. And when he was brought to the prophetatam on the 8th year of Hijra, when the prophet conquered Mecca, his hair, his beard was all white. So the prophet told him, told his son, change this white, dye it, but avoid black. And this we learn from it that it is forbidden to dye with black. It's haram. You can do brown, you can do red, you can do any color providing it is not black. And is it a must? Scholars say no. It is not a must. It is recommended but it is not mandatory. We have to believe and understand that change happens from allahel and that it is Allah who change situations from one to the other. It is Allah who honors people after they were humiliated and it is Allah who humilates people after they were honored. How many people we know became sick after health and how many sick people were cured by Allah to become healthy once again. How many people lost their wealth after being rich and how many poor people Allah blessed them and tried them with wealth and money. It is Allah the Almighty who has the power not to change us but to change the whole universe. On the day of judgment, Allahel would change the earth into a new earth and he will change all the heavens. But it is he who does not change. Subhanah Allah the Almighty as our recited Allah says verily Allah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves and that is by committing sin and by being ungrateful and disobed. obedient to Allah. When we look at ourselves, we always would like to change ourselves from poverty to richness, from illness to healthiness, from being bad Muslims into being good practicing Muslims. But this change does not happen and it does not take place unless we do something. And that is what this verse means. If we want Allah to change us, we have to change ourselves. If we want allahel to forgive us and not to be angry with us, then we have to repent. We have to ask Allah for forgiveness and we have to offer good deeds so that Allah would be pleased with us. But if we do not, if we insist on sinning, if we insist on not being humble to Allah, not humiliating ourselves to Allah, not to be submissive and feeling in need to Allah the Almighty, then this is dangerous and we are facing a great danger if we insist on this. The Almighty Allah says, \"Verily I am most forgiving to those who repent, believe and offer good deeds and then they are guided.\" So if you want Allah's repentance, you have to change your status. You have to change yourself and you have to change your environment and community. [Music] [Music] Oh. Oh. [Music] Oh. Oh. Oh. [Music]"
