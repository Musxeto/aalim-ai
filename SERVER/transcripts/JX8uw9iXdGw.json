  "transcript": "one another now ask yourself this how many times do you initiate salam to other muslims whether you know them or not of course if you know the shape he'll definitely the minute you see me you say salaam alaikom said i'm a celebrity you have to give me something the problem is not here the problem is if i see you when i initiate salaam to you or when I walk in look at you I'm waiting for you to start Salam why are you are you sure if not giving Salam is the one who's supposed to give Salam for me first this is a big problem because it deals with the heart it deals of what you think of yourself are you arrogant or a true Muslim this to whom you know is understood I see someone I know definitely I'm gonna give Salam - I see my boss I see my relative I see my neighbor as-salaam alaikum no problem because I know him the upper hand is to give Salam to those who do not know this means that you are a true and real Muslim because you're not expecting any return I can give Salam to my neighbor because I always parked my car in his parking area so I'd like to soft in his heart so he would not object but someone I do not know I know he's a Muslim I've seen him in the Masjid I don't know him personally I don't want anything from him why should I give him Salam this is what signifies your good Eman that you want to share the word of Salam that you're getting a lot of reward and benefit you say salaam-o-alaikum this is ten good deeds Salam alaikum warahmatullah this is 20 good deeds assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh I hear you giving a speech Halas move on you get thirty thirty DS so long but who does it and this is why the Prophet warned against giving Salam to specifics meaning that we are all here sitting about 20 of us and someone comes and says assalamualaikum Assam he is specifying and neglecting the other 19 this happened with Abdullah and miss Ruth a man came and said assalamu alaykum other Abdul Rahman now the normal thing is to be happy and say I think you Salam he said this is what the Prophet warned us from he warned us from giving Salam specifically to a person and neglecting the others so the issue of Salam is not easy and this shows you that there is no class there is no grades among Muslims you're a ruler you're a peasant you are a manager you are a subordinate you wrote together a ceremony for all but two specifically single out this person just because I know him and I don't know the others this is something that is wrong the Prophet said alehissalaam spread as Salam you become Muslims after Salam to sleemo and this means that it is part of my deal to spread Salam of course in the case of a Muslim that you know he is a Muslim if someone you're doubtful whether he is Muslim or not then you don't give Salam but if someone his looks are definitely Muslim or you are in a Muslim country for sure there are no cafes in your country so you give Salam without any problem Abdullah happiness Aram who knows him who was a rabbi and he was among the first to embrace Islam he said when I heard of the prophet alayhi salatu salam coming to medina i went out to meet him and look into his eyes look at his face because by looking at the face you can tell if the person is fraud or real so he said the moment I saw him I knew that this was not the face of a liar and the first statements that I heard from him he said yeah Johannes oh people she said spread the word of Salam Salam aleikum well promote Pam and feed the food was little our ham connect your next of kin was hollow bill ale when a Sunni am and pray at night when people are asleep Ted to Fallujah net epicenter and you will enter heaven and paradise in peace so these are the first things that he took from the prophet's mouth sallallahu alayhi wasallam and finally the Prophet said alehissalaam was salam the most stingy of all people is the one who's stingy of giving Salam when he meets them so always spread the word of a Salam and Allah knows best yes right now part of a man and proper Islam is that you have what's between you and your community fixed I could have what's between me and Allah fixed by praying by fasting by doing what Allah wants me to do yet with the others I have the worst of a lot I'm rude I am abusive I use vulgar language but I pray in the masjid and i fast from a bond in mondays and thursdays that i'm trying to be a good muslim between me and Allah Islam comes to fix also what's between you and the community so islam teaches us to spread goodness among ourselves to love for one another what we love for ourselves first he told us to refrain in the hadeeth refrain from using your tongue verbally to abuse others and to harm others with your own actions refraining is okay is it a lower level or a higher level can we have something saying in question whenever I ask us a question so that the people are awake I see a lot of the brothers are asleep brothers do not sleep because I am looking for a pillow and a mattress if I see you asleep I'm I feel sleepy as well then it's a lose-lose situation again the question when Allah tells us to refrain from abusing others verbally or by action is this a lower level or a higher level correct I didn't forget you lower no do not repeat me say yes or no lower okay higher it's a difference of opinion among scholars and handle 11 refraining from doing bad is a lower level the higher level is to refrain and to do good so this hadith is the higher the Lord we took we spoke about now this hadith is about being favored faithful and having fully a man if you love for your brothers what you love for yourself but this hadith is not to be taken literally why why this is a good question I'll tell you a secret I smoked how do we learn so I meet the brother and I have a cigarette what are you doing what are you talking about is this acceptable why because there is a word that is embedded but you cannot see it there are narrations that mention it you mean who I had o come hat you hit by a female Hebrew in f c/e mineral high-heeled there has to be this addition so I love to my brother's what I love to myself of goodness only but if someone who is drinking wine or doing sins and he said let's share well less today I saw a movie who this is a DVD try it and I love for my brother ah telephone no this is sinful you'll not be a Muslim at all yeah now you are falling in not refraining from spreading evil verbally and by actions so this is important that you know this now part of the importance of this hadith loving for others what I love for myself communities will never flourish communities will never progress unless we have this Islamic characteristic in us when we refrain from harming others when we learn how to forgive and this is something we as Muslims really need forgiveness I see it in households when sisters fight together sisters siblings and they never forgive one another I received a letter once in my Masjid and she was a girl of twenty-two or twenty-three years of age saying that my mother who is in her 70s or 60s did not speak with my uncle who is in his 80s for 30 years or 40 years why because of a dispute that took place when they would young and children and they boycotted one another how can they raise a family with such hatred how can they give their own children love and compassion and teach them how to spread salam among others this is why as muslims you have to love for your brothers what you love for yourself of goodness do you like people to forgive you that you have to learn how to forgive you have to learn how to visit the sick how to compensate those desperate and in need how to sponsor an orphan how to take care of a widow how to meet people with a smiling face with a clean heart why is it the more you become serious in Islam the more grumpy you are it's very strange I see I know people who were not committed to Islam well and all of a sudden they started practicing and ham they left but they start to frown in my face wherever I see them this so serious going to the Masjid coming out I crack a joke is guys very funny where is this Airy smile do something there is something wrong in us we have to start to make ourselves all over again according to the Sunnah the Prophet Allah saw salaam used to smile the Companions used to sit in the Masjid talking about the times in jahiliya is it before Islam I used to do this and they say oh I used to do with that and the Prophet sits there listening to them in the Masjid talking about things in jahiliyya and simply smiles what would we do Oh in the Masjid you don't feel a lot and things about jahiliya you can attend the course would share awesome initially know that there are branches of a man this is not good for this is not even sinful the Prophet approved it arrests another Sam there was nothing Haram in it but we have to freshen up smiling in the face of your Muslim brother caring for their feelings giving them way especially when you're coming out of the parking lot tonight insha'Allah when you leaving home you don't have to run them over or you came first give the way feel feel like a Muslim formula Zach Allah hey this is in dunya of course in akhirah you don't allow people to come in front of you the salat is given a comment in the first row there is a spot and brothers spend half an hour please please please you do not allow people to come in front of you go oh shoot no it's not true this is Jenna would you let someone enter Jenna first in the mall be my guest enter first but in things of good deeds and getting closer to Allah do not let anyone come before you so this hadith by the way again it does not mean it is only for Muslims even for non-muslims Sheikh this is too much we have listened to you before and but this is too much do you mean that I have to love to non-muslims what I love to myself yes this is given as in general but even for non-muslims would you like to be guided to Jenna you have to love for them as well and this is one of the best incentives for you to call others to Islam because the Prophet says that you will not believe until you love for them what you love for yourself the prophecy that is also in an authentic hadith love for others what you love for yourself and you become a Muslim love for others what you love for yourself and you become Muslim Jonnie you will not become a true full-fledged Muslim until you love for others Muslims and non-muslims alike until you like goodness for them and this is why the manifestation of the companions in the tambourine when dealing with non-muslims they would even advise them especially in transactions when they're selling than something a Muslim comes and says how much is this said wandering it but it's not good it's not good and another Muslim comes this is five ringgit top-quality this is haram then the companions and Atteberry would also give advice to the non-muslim and this is how people accept Islam how did the Muslims Islam comes to come to Malaysia to Indonesia through the traders but were they like our traders today how the will of Allah they would have abandon Islam forever they were really Muslims they used truth they had trust and people accepted the way they dealt because of their Allah and this is how a real Muslim must be when dealing with Muslims and also double that when dealing with non-muslims because you are portraying Islam I am under the microscope if I do a single mistake no one will say awesome did a mistake they will say the share did a mistake Islam made a mistake if he was if his religion was good he would have behaved well but it is not good and this is why he's corrupt so each and every one of you is under the microscope calling people to Islam behaving as a Muslims do you think that I do not want to abuse people who say bad things to me I don't have the feeling I want to hit them I have this I'm a human being but what makes me stop its Islam one of the brothers is over here on Twitter was saying that sharehouse may Allah bless you and make you steadfast for exposing the people of deviation and you have to be harsh because this is from the self and you have to be audible now is it from the self that I have to be harsh with the people of elevation does it say in my religion that I have to be harsh and rude and abusive this is what he's saying saying to me I'm a Salafi but I never in the book I never knew that this was part of Islam it is not part of Islam those youngsters the youth who are growing up they thinking that part of being a selfie or abiding by the Quran and Sunnah or fighting innovation part of it is to be lewd to be abusive to say a word and not care not to be diplomatic this is totally an Islamic and my role model is the profit that is salah salem and his companions with all respect to the surf but I take my religion from the Koran and the sinner so how did the Prophet deal adding a solid wassalam with the Christians with the Jews with the wrongdoers people come due to their ignorance urinate in the Masjid he fights with them he talks with them with diplomacy ignorance need to be taught but to be abusive or to be aggressive this is not part of our religion and this concept of what he likes none of you will have faith until he likes for other what he likes for himself this was manifested by the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet appoints highly demeanor elite as a ruler he appoints companions to the regions as rulers when abu dharr affari one of the first to embrace islam and very very old sinner he has seniority he comes and says o prophet of allah appoint me to be a ruler on one of the regions what does the Prophet say honest officer he holds his shoulders and he said Adam you are weak however I love for you what I love for myself and this is part of the way of the Prophet Ali salatu salam do not appoint yourself over to people and do not appoint yourself as ruling over to and do not take charge of the money of an orphan why when you take charge of the money of the orphan who will hold you accountable no one so you will abuse it if I have my nephew his father died and he was a millionaire and I'm appointed by the government or by the family to be his guardian I would abuse it if I don't have fear in Allah so the Prophet is telling him not to do this Holly his salat WA Salam even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him he gave us an example he said by Allah I read the ayah of the quran and i know so much knowledge about it and i wish i can share it with everyone else the knowledge you have do you have the enthusiasm to share it with everyone else no I don't have time I don't want to teach people I don't enjoy teaching people this is problematic when you have something that you love and people do not have if you don't want to teach them and share it with them then you're a man is under questioning and also who happened to be last year of the Tiberi he once wanted to sell a donkey so the man buying it he said do you accept it for me would you allow me to buy it and he said if I did not accept you I would not have sold it I implement and I applied this hadith I would not sell something unless I approve of it for myself so now what you sell your car what do you do some of the brothers goes to the tyres with black tea so it becomes shiny takes it the carwash fixes anything that and the inside is corrupt its rusty it's bad he never tells how is the car wash off in Saudi when you go to the car market the man who's auctioning the car so that he would not be accused of cheating but does he say this car is 2017 model doesn't go forward doesn't go backwards doesn't fly doesn't that's in sale it has no engine it has no oil oil is in water water is in oil the windows do not work her car is pregnant almost brand-new but he's saying all of this so that's when you come see the car has this fault anything I told you he lies and this is happening no in Islam you do not do this you show people what is happening fight move on yeah I know we have ten minutes but can you stop or do the second this is an addition not only father and children but all mankind this hadith is one of the proofs that you are a believer that you should love the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam those who do not love the prophet raise your hands good good so they all love the prophet alayhi salaatu a sinner but this love requires proof so when you say that you love the prophet alaihi wassalam we ask you to - what prove it and proving it is not by simply claiming it is by implementing his Sunnah in every single aspect of your life and this love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is it a condition meaning that a person has to love the Prophet and some more than his children his father and humankind otherwise he's not a believer yes or no wrong No yeah why see the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said that you will not believe until I am more beloved to you than your father your children and the whole human race you will not believe this is a negation and the negation means one of three either the existence there is no love there is no email at all meaning you're a kafir or the validity meaning there is a man but it is invalid or the perfection there is a man it is valid but it's not complete so when we say that for example there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah when we say there is no God we're talking about existence or validity or completion existence there is no God Hamas there is no God at all you don't even doubt it there is no God worthy of being worshipped but when the Prophet said Alice - as-salaam yes mrs. Annie he night well this is s-trans anything it is problematic so we will go to something else laughs a lotta believe you do there is no prayer without to do existence validity or completion validity because I have prayed it exists but it is not valid and when the Prophet says Ali Saleh - Sam laughs so that be how Bharati forum there is no prayer while there is food being served there is no prayer existing no I prayed and the food is in front of it Brioni is in front of you can see the steam and its meat I don't eat chicken panini it's okay is it valid it is valid is it complete no it's not complete so this is the negation in all of the Quran and Sunnah either the existence or the validity or the completion so now we come to the Prophet s Onam no one of you none of you will have faith so I would not have faith meaning existence probably I don't know how do I know by looking in other a hadith such as Roma was once with the prophet alayhi salatu salam and all of a sudden Omar said by Allah o prophet of allah you are dearer to me than my family my children my father everything except myself you are more beloved to me than anything on earth except until I'm more beloved to you than your soul between your in your chest so I took a few seconds thought of it is it by Allah you are more beloved to me than my father my children than the whole human race and then myself the prophecy now Rama you have become a full-fledged so the Prophet said to me except myself did not tell you let me none of you will have faith then the existence is not there which means that yes a man is there but the validity or the completion are doubtful until you complete it and this is why the scholars say that loving yourself is natural loving the prophet of a sorcerer or someone else is by choice and you cannot be sincere in loving the Prophet Allah so Allah said up until you give priority to following him believing in him and implementing what he said over every aspect of your life and if you look at it logically you will understand it your love to your father your love to your children you love to anyone is subjective to natural love and what they provide for you don't me find children saying I hate my father true don't you find fathers saying I hate my kids they've displaced me they have done this and that so this is subjective with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam it is not it is unconditional because anytime you feel in its form of hate or lack of love this takes you out of the folder is not because you cannot no one hates it so even those who do not acknowledge it or know it like Rama in the beginning you may think that I love the protest but not to that extent he's not thinking straight he loves profit Ursula more than anything else but he's not thinking straight because what did the Prophet do to our Sonics officer he got us out from darkness into the light there is no possible way of entering paradise which is eternal 19 eternal enjoyment except through him and there is no way we can stay out of Hellfire except through him and avoiding what he told us not to do so our love to him so Allah is unlike any other human being monitored regardless whether he's a father he's a son or he he is one of the spouses even sandy may Allah have mercy on his soul says in the Deaf seal of the ayah and Mina Mina music Allah says the Prophet is more worthy of the believers than themselves how can someone be more worthy than myself this is possible they denied him know he was captured and he was taken to Mecca to be executed and while he was brought to be executed Abu Sufian who was a camera at the time relativism told him say would you like to be among your wife and children in Medina and the Prophet Elisha saw the serve is in your place being executed What did he say is it by Allah I would not like to be in Medina between my wife and children in my bowl and the Prophet is Abu Salam is in Medina in his home and there's a storm coming to his foot little would be executed not even a thorn coming into his foot and harming him in Medina no I'd rather be executed rather than him getting this this is true love to the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam he is the most beloved to our heart and he is worthy of us than us to ourselves that is why whenever there is a contradiction between what he orders us to do and what we want to do we always if president we always give priority to what he commands us to do and the scholars say the love that people have to others can be of three categories one loving and praising such as loving of parents nothing of scholars loving of rulers it can be the love of mercy and this is manifested when you love your children and grandchildren thirdly to love someone who is in the same level of you such when you love your spouse or you you love a friend or a colleague the prophets love sallallahoalyhiwasallam has to be more than all of that [Music]"
