  "transcript": "so hype says we go to college on Fridays and they do not allow them to pray in the masjid and the professor warn them that he'll flunk them in the course if they miss it so what to do should we pray Lord the answer is easy according to the previous question you can pray Friday anywhere so after the class is over or before the class begins if the time of laura's do you can easily join two or more of your colleagues one of you gives the sermon and the two sermons and then prays the Juma prayer two Rakas and you can go back to your classes without any problem as long as you have a legitimate reason as this where your professor who's a kafir most likely doesn't want you to pray Juma and doesn't want to find a way out for this then hamdulillah Allah made it easy for all of us you can pray in any of the classrooms or on the park or in the garden or whatever to two of the congregation and one is giving the hotbar and leads the Salah so three or more and alhamdulillah humor is valid"
