  "transcript": "sh since we don't speak Arabic it's hard for us to understand translation and keep concentration in congregational prayers especially during Tavi at congregation which takes one hour daily for 20 Raa the IM is fast and it's hard for us to keep focus our mind gets super busy with many worldly dunia things is it a form of humilation I mean is it still good to pray behind im or it's better to pray tabi at home with small chapters likeah ET ET alhamdulillah the reward is fixated if you pray behind the Imam this half an hour or one hour Allah would reward you as if you prayed the whole night while if you pray at home for 3 4 hours that would not be equivalent to praying in congregation so my advice to you is to pray with the congregation try your level best to ponder upon Allah's greatness Allah's uh uh beautiful names and attributes Allah's uh um favors and blessing upon you and inshallah you will be rewarded for that"
