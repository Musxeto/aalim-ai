  "transcript": "brother Yusuf basically was asking about the hadith the hadith was graded by sheikh al albani to be hassan and the hadith talks about that the person's affair if it were to be good in his grave then what's after the grave on the day of judgment should be better and vice-versa and this is not the general thing because we've stated before that the torment of the grave is not related generally speaking to the torment of hell and likewise being blessed in the grave is not necessarily the same on in the hereafter though the norm is so those generally speaking who will be punished in the graves would probably have more to pay for on the day of judgement and those who are not punished in their graves are most likely to enjoy heaven more but it is not related the torment in the grave is dependent on a list of sins if a believer is lucky enough to skip these sins and not do any of them he will not be tormented in his grave but that doesn't mean that on the day of judgment when the scale is put and his good deeds and bad deeds are there that he would not be punished for other sins not related to the sins of the grave so it is possible that a person comes with great great good deeds and he dies it is grave it is possible that he is punished for backbiting for sins such as lying or sleeping over a salat though he has trillions of good deeds nevertheless the torment of the grave are for these specific sense that this individual had done and likewise it is a possibility that a sinful Muslim who avoided these sins would not be tormented in his grave but when he comes on the day of judgment and the scale is brought and his good deeds and bad deeds are weighed and he has a lot of bad deeds that he might be punished for that if Allah does not forgive him so I hope this answers your question Yousef"
