  "transcript": "while I was urinating a few drops fell on my jeans pant so I'm at office so I can't change the so I poured a little water on the place of urine where where it fell but it more than the nais then I prayed the three for for the prayer because Allah said fear Allah to the best of your ability in this situation what I need to do Shake do I do anything wrong any remedy Shake you should have taken off your pants your trousers your jeans and pinched the area that had urine poured water on it squeezed it pour water and squeeze it and that's it pouring water while still wearing it if you've overwhelmed it then this is okay why the prophet told the companions to pour a bucket of water over the the urine area where the Nomad came into the Masjid and urinated usually the urine of such an individual would be like maybe 150 to 200 milligrams milliters that is so it's it's this much and the bucket most likely would be like 2 liters in average so the ratio is 10 to 1 if we have one drop of your Ur in and we put 10 drops of water it dilutes it it makes it pure so if the ratio of the water you poured on your trousers or your jeans was 10 to one or more inshallah this purifies it but don't do that next time inshallah"
