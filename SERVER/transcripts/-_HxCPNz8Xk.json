  "transcript": "what are the legitimate reasons for which one can break their salah is responding to parents calling etc included included in this first of all prayer is divided into two types fart prayer and voluntary prayer fault prayer you do not break unless it is something of a necessity so if i'm praying for prayer let's assume i don't live close to the message and my alarm clock is set off and it's far so i say okay i'm gonna break my prayer and and and turn it off and then pray again no this is not a necessity if the phone rings this is not a necessity if the doorbell rings this is not a necessity so fart is different than voluntary if someone is dying this is a necessity if someone is about to fall a blind man is about to walk into a well and fall this is a necessity if someone has a heart attack and no one to take care of him except me this is a necessity in voluntary prayers it's much easier so even if you break it it ranges between disliked and permissible but in far no it is haram you have to continue unless it is illegitimate you"
