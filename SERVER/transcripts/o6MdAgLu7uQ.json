  "title": "During prayer should a woman put her hands under her Shawl Scarf & cover them or not assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Chef I had a question before you start before before you start your question the prophet Allah said in an authentic Hadith whoever begins you with a question before giving salaam do not respond to them this is an authentic Hadith therefore you have to give Salam so that I can take your question what can I do for you I'm from Pakistan and I've seen women pray in two different ways so let's say I'm very gonna buy a while praying and I have a shop so the shawl is big enough to cover my chest and well let's say there are two sections of women some put their hands under the shawl and they cover them with the shawl not in the rest of the prayer however others keep it out of outside the shots so which one has to be done the best is to keep it out of the shawl meaning that it can be visible if there are no Nan mahram men around you why because all Scholars and schools of thought say that a woman must cover all of her body during prayer except for the face and the hands so this is the norm so a woman may not in the comfort of her own home decide to pray with the niqab this is not permissible a woman may not in the comfort of her home or among women decide to wear gloves this is not permissible so she has to uncover these uh the face and the hands if there are no none mahram men looking at her that is the norm therefore putting it above the shout is what should be done in Allah Knows Best"
