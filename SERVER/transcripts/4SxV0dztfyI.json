  "title": "The Imam doesn't recite the Fateha properly, is my Prayer invalid? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says that in their local Masjid or he went to a Masjid and joined us a lot only to find that the Imam does not recite the Fatiha well so is my prayer valid this is an issue of dispute among scholars why the Fatiha is a pillar of salat and if you make a simple mistake that might be accepted but if you make a serious mistake then you have a problem especially with the Fatiha so the scholars say that whoever does not pronounce the fatiha well his prayer is invalid this is one opinion how what do you mean by doesn't pronounce it well whoever says instead of saying iya can aboot Yaka with stressing it he says he Akana would be akka and this is different if he says yaki na'budu wa iyyaka nastaa'een this is feminine and you cannot be addressing a line in a feminine form may Allah be exalted so they said that such mistakes and errors nullify your prayer altogether and those behind him other scholars they elaborate they say if the Imam if the individual leading is capable of reciting it well but he made this mistake then the prayer is invalid but if the Imam himself is unable to do otherwise he says surah tolas inna unarmed and anti alayhim Serritella zina it's not cervical Lavina and anta is it Ananta Ananta now this is totally distorted in arabic in arms listen to this and they laugh their heads off what is this but if the individual due to his language or ethnicity is unable to say this he can't say a all lien is a darling what do we do with him shoot him with an 8 gauge know what we do is we apply a las beautiful words where Allah says let you kill if allahu nafsan illa llah allah does not burden a soul beyond its ability and if the man is unable to do anything better this means that his prayer is valid and those praying behind him they pray is valid however he should not come forward and lead he should look before he leads and if there are people who pray better than him he should let them lead otherwise he would be sinful for that"
