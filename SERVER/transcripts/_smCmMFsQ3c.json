  "transcript": "Romar says can we use hair fibers that are available in the market this new product which contains powder that connects to the fibers of the hair to fill the parts of the hair which is thinning and turning bold and as this effect also and boodle first of all I have no idea about such fibers but if it is something that people apply they spray on their heads if I take off my top you will find that there are so many empty places this comes with age and usually people either shave it or they trim it with the trimmer so it would look presentable there was a substance that people spray on these empty spots on their head and it is sort of a color that would reach the scalp so instead of seeing the skin the scalp itself you could see the whole thing in the same shade of color so it looks like he's not bald anymore or there are no bald spots if such substance can it be easily washed when you perform in whistle this has no impact on your purity so if I take a shower it immediately rinses off no problem of using it what about water shell model is a lighter case compared to ocean meaning that if I have normal hair and I apply hair Jill which is a heart shiny substance that would make my hair stick together like a form of glue and it gives it some I don't know glitter or shine to it now this is definitely a barrier that may block water from reaching my hair in performing wouldl there's no problem in that meaning that if I perform model and I wipe over my head which has this Jill on it the wood is okay but if I perform hustle and the water does not reach the scalp and it does not remove this then the ocean is invalid because there was a barrier in Woodill I don't have to wash I only have to wipe over and this is why the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam when he went to Hajj he used to EULA bid rasa meaning to put a certain material on his hair that would to keep it intact and protected from the sand and the dust etc this is known as still beat and he used to perform wood or normally by wiping on it so if these fibers make a layer on your hair yet it is easily washed off when doing also there is no problem in it and definitely if you wipe over it in wood oh you will find traces on it on your hands the color itself has to wear off when you wipe on it with water again this is okay not a problem now one little problem is that if you have white hair and by applying these fibers your hair looks black then this is considered like dyeing your hair with black and this is prohibited for both men and women but if the color is dark brown if your hair is all black and you apply this to hide these bald spots then there's no problem in it insha'allah who adds a gel"
