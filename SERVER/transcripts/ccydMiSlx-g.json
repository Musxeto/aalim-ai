  "title": "Suppressing the urge to pass wind or using the toilet while praying - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "asks a question and he says is it allowed to prevent oneself from passing wind during Salah like from the back passage and stiffening his back passage this question is a little bit strange because this is human nature when you have to answer the call of nature or you have to pass wind this is normal however if this feeling or urge comes to you when you're praying no one would say cut your prayer and go or pass wind and go and repeat your rule and as long as you can tolerate it and you can suppress it then this is the only logical thing for you to do and Allah knows best"
