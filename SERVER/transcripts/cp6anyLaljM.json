  "transcript": "Arabi from Bangladesh I have this question that I pray my Salah the first Salah but Salah or with Salah I don't pray so my mom or my dad sometime tell me to pray or force me to pray does obeying them is any kind of prer because we have less knowledge take I'm asking you and would you please explain the Ria more clearly R is to do something seeking the pleasure of others while not intending to please Allah so if your parents order you to pray Sunnah prayers and you don't want to but they force you and you resent it you fight it yet you pray it to please them while having no intention none whatsoever to please Allah this is and you're sinful for that what to do change your intention what they're ordering you to do is for your own benefit and to please Allah so go ahead and make it for the sake of Allah it was reported that two men once were walking funeral being carried to the graveyard so one of them said to his friend let's follow it so that we get the reward of one carrot of Good Deeds so his friend said wait let's go so he said why did you tell me to wait he said I wanted to rectify my intention when you said let's go I wanted to just go because you told me but then I wanted to make it for the sake of Allah so he changed his intention likewise beautifying your voice while reciting the Quran why are you doing this there so your is good you're a good to get more followers you have a problem but if you're doing it because you love the Quran and you love to make it lovable to others and this is for the sake of Allah then there is no R in that Abu musar says the prophet said to meat oh Abu mus had you seen me last night passing by your home waiting and listening to your recitation Allah has given you pipes like the pipes of David peace be upon Him Ma so Abu mus said oh prophet of Allah had I known you were listening I would have perfected it more for you now he wanted to perfect it more for the prophet Alam to get his praising of course not rather he wanted to make it more appealing because this pleases Allah and hence when they are satisfied with how you're reciting it then Allah is also satisfied so this I hope makes some sense to you from"
