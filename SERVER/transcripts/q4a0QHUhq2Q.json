  "transcript": "Shahana Brahim and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala rasulina mean nabina muhammad in orally he was a being a Jemaine I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato we're still studying the book of under to a calm and we are still in the chapter that deals with a salat with prayer and hadith 89 this hadith was narrated by an assembly Malik may Allah be pleased with him and who would give us the honor of reading it yes brother Ana's bin Malik reporter I never print behind any imam who was more brief and more perfect than the messenger of allah so allah values and same Allah who are you said in the hadith Ana's is giving two characteristics of the prophets pray or salallahu alaihe wasalam one is that his prayer is brief to being brief does not mean it is imperfect on the contrary he's saying that though it was brief it was also perfect and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prayer is the ideal prayer because allah instructed us to follow him and to learn from him and he told us Allah pray chimera item unio solidly as if you had seen me praying and therefore the best of the Sunnah is to follow the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam also among the lessons we learned from this hadith that it is permissible for someone who is better than the imam to pray behind the imam meaning an asymptomatic was one of the greatest companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam yet he prayed and he used to pray behind people who were less than him who were less important knowledgeable and from this we learn that it is permissible to pray behind someone who is less degree than you in knowledge and therefore one would not object why isn't the Imam of so-and-so message it the great scholar why is one of his students praying the Imam because this is permissible it is not a must that the best man always prays though it's recommended but it might not be the case all the time we move on to hadith number 90 yes rather Baba Malik evening who aileth came to this Masjid of ours and said I will offer the prayer in front of you and my aim is not to lead the prayer but to show you the way in which the Prophet used to offer the prayer Salah listen I asked about Abu colaba how did he use to offer the prayer he replied like this share of ours and the share used to sit for a while after raising his head up from prostration before getting up from the first raka albahari meaning abayas eat a meal or even Salama alger very well this hadith is referring to an action in prayer that scholars have disputed whether it is recommended or not recommended what they did not dispute on its permissibility what is that it is known in Arabic as jealous at all Easter aha it is the pause that a person does when he sits before going into the second raka or to the fourth raka so abu Colaba says or abu pallava says that Malik in Hawaii F who is a companion may Allah be pleased with him came to them and he told them I do not intend to pray but I will do this so that you would learn from me how the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to pray and he prayed a prayer so the companions of abu Colaba asked him how did he pray and he said that his prayer is exactly similar to the prayer of the Imam of our Masjid who is not a companion and this person is Abu Yazeed Amram Salama alger me and he is describing that the prophet sallallaahu l'm Malkina hadith and this Imam used to sit when raising their heads from the prostration and this as I said before it's referring to jalsa Alastor aha now what is the ruling on this scholars have different an imam shafi'i and this is what is prescribed in his school of thought went into saying that this is a highly recommended ssin why first of all because of this hadith malik am in hawaii is describing he's not praying for himself meaning he is careful in showing exactly how the Prophet Allah saw some is supreme therefore he would not add anything or take out anything unless this is how he saw the Prophet to it and that is why scholars say backing up Alabama Schaffer is opinion scholars say that he did this in the presence of the tabi rain and some of the companions and no one had said no no no this is not the way the Prophet used to do it a little officer so all of the scholars agree that it is permissible to sit this short pause again which records do we sit in it the first and the third because after the second prostration you supposed to stand up the Sunnah is that you sit for a short pause and then you stand up now the Sunnah according to Lee mom Schaffer and according to mannequin in Hawaii other companions said no it is not part of the Sunnah maybe the Prophet had done it Holly his salat WA Salam due to an illness due to his age due to any other reason but we know that the prophets Isis I'm one of the descriptions of his prayer that if when he stood up he stood up quickly so they said that this is probably due to the fact that he was old however there is a rule that we always have to keep in our minds in this rule says whenever there is a possibility then you cannot use this as an evidence whenever we say the word maybe this is thrown away why everything in Islam you can say maybe so it cannot be an evidence that you reject or refute another evidence with for example the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam instructed the blind man to pray in the message with the congregation he said I do not have any excuse for you now some scholars said maybe this was because the old man needed to learn about Islam so the Prophet forced him area salatu salam so is this sufficient to reject the evidence obliging us to pray in the masjid the answer is no because maybe comes in everything imagine someone says that allah azza wajal made intoxicants made whiskey alcohol forbidden because at the time of the Prophet arizim they did not have locks on their doors so maybe it was forbidden then because people would go out when they're dry and do foolish things but now hum delay we have blocks so if you drink and your door is locked you cannot do harm to anyone so it's hard and that is why this is quite important because when you debate with someone when you were telling someone this is Sunnah he said maybe it was not reported to us for example someone is arguing I'm not saying debating arguing about moded said the mobility of the Prophet is awesome is the Sunnah it's a good thing we say that the Mawlid was not done before and therefore we consider it to be better it's an innovation he says why isn't it a good thing I say no because the Prophet did not do it and the Companions did not do it he then argues and says how do you know that the Prophet did not do it maybe he did it maybe the Companions had done it and then I say when maybe comes you trash it and throw it in the dustbin in the arabic they say either a topical HTML bottle is still on whenever there is a possibility then you cannot use this as an evidence you have to throw it away you have to be certain about this thing and besides we know that Allah says in the Quran a glioma of mal telecom Dina come I have perfected today your religion so if it was perfected at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam it definitely had reached us and whatever did not reach us is not considered to be part of the religion so it's very simple it's very basic all what you have to do is apply this to your argument and then you will find everything to be cleared insha Allah for you therefore we come back to jealousy Telesur aha or to the pause of resting is it Sunnah or not the most authentic opinion is it is Sunnah is it something that we should fight over and my brother does not do it my Imam does not do it I go to the Imam why don't you do it you should do it you should know if he doesn't want to do it he has a group of scholars that back him up not only a minority but a huge group of scholars saying that yes it is not part of the Sunnah that should be maintained and if he follows this Sunnah he has the hadith in Albahari and elsewhere proving that the Companions used to do it such as medicament Hawaii if therefore we should not make this as an issue to fight or to dispute among scholars we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back Salam alaikum and welcome back and if he follows this Sunnah he has the hadith in el-bahari and elsewhere proving that the Companions used to do it such as Malik in Hawaii if therefore we should not make this as an issue to fight or to dispute among scholars we move on to hadith number 91 and if you haven't does anybody have questions after now ok one or two this is sufficient we move on to the hadith Hamid a man can you read it please narrated abdullah IBN malik evening vahana whenever the prophet sallallaahu holly was salam offered prayer during prostration he used to separate his arms from his body so widely that the whiteness of his armpits was visible very well again this is one of the descriptions of the prophet's prayer sallallahu alayhi wasallam whenever he used to prostrate he used to separate his arms away from his body so that in another hadith if a small goat wanted to pass by from underneath it could have because there is enough place for it and this is a way showing the strength and the enthusiasm and prayer unlike those who pray as if they are dying there are people when they pray they offer prayer as if they are almost dying not because of the fear of Allah because of old age maybe because of they are so tired so they pray like the sin and remodel the Allah and who whenever he went to the Masjid and so people praying like this he used to hit them with with his daughter daughter is a stick with some type of growth normal growth at the end of it so it hits and it's very hard so whenever he saw people praying like this you used to hit them while they're praying and say do not kill our religion do not kill our religion by pretending that you're dying this is not sign of hosh or kosher is not only in your movement submissiveness and concentration and prayer is not only by not moving by also by the heart so if you pretend that you're not moving this is good but if you pretend that you are dying or that you're so weak and this and actually or not this is not part of the religion that is why the Prophet s lamp used to separate his arms away from his body and to the extent that the companion says I used to see the whiteness of his armpit the Prophet was praying without a shirt no he was praying without the shirt but the shirts had long sleeves and sometimes you can take a look at a person's sides or shoulders throughout the opening if you have a white opening and also this is a description of the prophets Isis Aram uniqueness because we all know that due to the fact that we remove the armpit hair it may look a little bit darker skin than your usual normal skin the Prophet s son did not have this on the opposite it was even more beautiful so even his armpit was not darker in skin but it was also white sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wasallam now what does this tell us when you separate your arms from your body it tells us that the seven bones that you are instructed to prostrate on they should each take their full position and what they need and require to fulfill a perfect suit as stated before some people when they prostrate they prostrate on their fingers others they prostrate on their elbows and this is forbidden the Prophet described this alehissalaam to be the way of a beast or of a dog the way he sits not only that some people when they put their forehead on the ground they don't touch it fully they just lightly touch it why some brothers have heard saying that I don't want to have a mark in my forehead like those people who pray a lot today sometimes it gets weakened the forehead skin gets weak and there is a mark on it he says no no no I don't want people to know this so when he prostrates he doesn't fully put his forehead and nose on the ground he simply touches the hair of the carpet for example slightly and this is not permissible this is not considered to be suitable why because the full code you have to prostrate fully in having your hands away from your body your forehead touching not only touching pressing on the ground and likewise your knees and feet and hands before we go on to the following hadith let's see if you have any questions yes brother Shaikh as you said that regarding jalsa that we have a hadith the Prophet waited for some time and then he stood up but as you said that we should not argue on that but can we go to such an extent in saying that you are not following the Sunnah because as you said they are following a group of scholars but what we learnt is that when you have a sahih hadith and no matter how big the scholar may be so we should not you know agree with the scholar rather we should follow the hadith so now if this person is following the group of scholars so isn't he doing wrong we should point it out to him first of all it is very important for you as a student of knowledge not to prejudge people do never ever prejudge people and start classifying them and labeling them he's not following the Sunnah he is not following the Sunnah he's doing innovation I'm the only one who's following this one second of all we mentioned before in our classes that even Tamiya may Allah have mercy on his soul wrote a very beautiful book called referral malum how to remove the blame on whom on ma al-alam on the prominent imams and scholars how to uplift the blame how not to blame them and if you recall we stated that in this book he gathered the excuses that we give to prominent scholars when they make a mistake and we say among these reasons maybe the hadith did not reach them and that is why he did not say you should do this or should do that and give an example to a hadith that reach them and they forgot it from Burma hop up and I'm modern yes and may Allah be pleased with them when they both had neck ternal omission while they were outside the borders of the medina and could not offer oasl they did not have water Romar did not pray amar turned on the ground forming a Imam as a beast and when they want to the Prophet the Prophet said know what you have done was wrong you only should have the ground once and wiped your face and hands Omar did not remember and he is Roma he did not remember the incident though he was there so it mean Tama says that if Roma did not remember maybe a lot of the Imams got the hadith and forgot it maybe the hadith did not reach him as in the case of Rahab when one of the Companions came and said assalamualaikum our whole three times when he did not answer he left Omar came out called him why did you leave he said because the Prophet said you make three times requests and you leave he said by Allah you bring me two witnesses our our beat you and make you an example and the man was terrified he went back to his companions what's wrong with you he told them that this is what happened with me and homework they all laughed and they said Rama does not know the ruling that's funny we will send the youngest among us with you will not send someone who's old we will send the youngest companion to testify with you and he went and testified in front of Rama Rama said I did not falsify what you had said I'd not accused of lying this is something I did not know imagine and I did not want the Prophet Alistair salams hadith to be taken slightly and easy everyone says the Prophet said the Prophet said he'd not say so this is an indication that it might not have reached him and that is why we always give them the benefit of the doubt we know that this is hadith stating that the properties to do it maybe they had another explanation to it maybe the hadith is not authentic to them so we cannot accuse them by not following the Sunnah and a large surgeon knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
