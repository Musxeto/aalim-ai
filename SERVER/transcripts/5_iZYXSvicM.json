  "title": "How often must we meet or call in order to maintain ties of kinship? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "calls sarmat says what exactly qualifies as keeping ties of kinship can i just call or text saying hi how are you and then not ask about anything else and hang up what else do i need to ask or do allah azzawajal has ordered us to honor and connect to our kinship and prohibited severing kinship ties and we were told that it is part of the corruption on earth to sever our kinship ties and the prophet alaihis salatu salam promised us and gave us the glad tidings that whoever shall connect to his kinship allah would prolong his life and would increase in his provision in his risk now having said that we don't have tangible time frame or what to do or what to say in order to be among the category of those who connect their kinship so it is up to the customs up to the traditions up to the norms in societies where they would consider this to be honoring your kinship or severing it some places it may be once or twice a year other places once a month it also depends on the relationship so calling my siblings once a month is unacceptable at least i should call them once a week if not every other day to check on them and to see that everything is fine however maybe calling my cousins once a month would be appropriate if i have a second or the third or a fourth cousin who's not that related to me a cousin of my father or the son of a cousin of my mother then this is different so it depends on the culture it depends on the norm and it depends on how people perceive you and whether you are staying and keeping your distance from them or they would like you to call them quite often at the end of the day this is an investment that you're doing in order to fulfill allah's command to you and also to increase your provision increase your good deeds on the day of judgment and allah azza knows best"
