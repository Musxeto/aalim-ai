  "title": "Ruling on using pots & pans used by non muslims that have stains on them? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mahmud says when we buy secondhand cooking pan from non-muslims we have to wash it but even after washing several times with soap stains remain in nonstick pans these stains are from oil fat or food cooked previously right so what is the ruling after washing so many times is the pan Pure or impure can it be used for cooking so generally speaking eating and drinking in the utensils of Muslims and non-muslims alike are is permissible because these are cups jugs plates pans and the likes so there's no problem in eating in them because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ate from it as in the Hadith of the Jewish woman who invited him to eat from a ram him and his companions and he ate from their plates as in the Hadith of a Jew boy inviting the prophet to some uh um lar or fat with barley that had a smell to it and the prophet ate from itat and of the Hadith of the woman the idol worshipper who the companions borrowed from her uh uh um container water skin um bag or container and performed W so this is generally speaking permissible there are hadiths where the Prophet instructed the companions not to use it if there is an alternative and if there was no alternative then they should wash it and then eating it but Scholars combined all these different evidences and said that only when there is doubt that is close to certainty that they've used these utensils in consuming Haram such as wine or pork or dead meat Etc in this case yes we have to wash it and then eat on and drink in it so generally speaking if you buy a pan that was already used by non-muslims the default it is pure until proven otherwise but if you have doubts that this might be from pork or Haram meat then you may wash it thoroughly the stain that remains is just a color sustain that has no Mass to it and hence it has no impact on the permissibility and the purity of that pan and Allah knows best finally"
