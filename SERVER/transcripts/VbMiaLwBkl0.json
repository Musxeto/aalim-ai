  "title": "Investing in Gold Scheme Business in Islam - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mostafa says is it permissible to invest in a gold scheme business the process is that one can buy gold in that company and they can deliver to the buyer if he wants it physically and if one wants to invest in the company one current can invest therefore they will sell the product and give you the profit but one has to pay the company such a fee as storage fee etc I personally do not believe that these schemes are legit first of all we know that the condition for dealing in gold in Islam is that one do you buy it it has to be hand to hand simultaneous so I cannot buy gold online this is not permissible at all or silver this is totally prohibited so in order to be an investor I have to go physically to the company's headquarters or outlets and I give them a thousand euros and they give me in gold physical gold X Y Z grams now the transaction is over Palace I can give it to them so that they can invest in it by selling and buying through this way hand to hand simultaneously though I know for certain that there is no company at all that does this physically it's all done on done on the screen by a thousand kg cell nine hundred the difference deposit the money X take the money etc so this is all totally prohibited but on a small scale if I go to a goldsmith a shop in the market and I buy the gold from him and I give him the physical gold after a quiz acquiring it and and possessing it and I tell him okay you invested he says I'm gonna make a bracelet and few rings and a necklace and I'm gonna sell it for a margin of profit of 30% and it's 50/50 between you and me no problem because he's actually doing it and selling it simultaneously take the gold give me the money there this is legit what you're describing is not permissible and Allah knows best"
