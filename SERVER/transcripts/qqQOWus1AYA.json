  "transcript": "He said, \"I would like to know if it is upon the wife to stay her ida period in the first and second divorce.\" And he said, \"Why if she has to stay the ida period as well for the third divorce?\" Regarding the first and second divorce, Mhm. it is mandatory for the divorced woman to remain the period in her house. Mhm. Allah stated that in the Quran where he said, \"Do not get them out of their houses and they should not get out of their houses.\" Mhm. And Allah called the houses their houses because the marriage is still valid. And Allah gave these two periods. Mhm. In the first and the second divorce, the so that they may reconcile. And in so many cases, in over 95% of the divorce cases, divorce happens all of a sudden. Mhm. Out of rage, out of miscommunication. And the minute it happens, 10 or 20 minutes later, the man and the wife start to weep and cry and they try to fix what was broken. Yes. Now, in the case of the first and second divorce, this is possible because he can get her back into his custody by telling her that, okay, now you're my wife again. She is his wife until the uh period is over and done. Mhm. Okay. And that is why if one of them die, if one of them dies at the time of the other will inherit him. Subhan Allah. But if the third divorce takes place then she is completely the minute it he utters it he becomes a stranger to her and she becomes a stranger to him. There is no relation between them and they should separate. In this case she should not have uh she should not stay in the house. She should leave and he does not have to support her or provide her anymore because she is a stranger to him. But she has to still complete the after the third divorce. She has to complete the not in the house. Okay. She has to leave. But the is still not the same as the first and the second. The most authentic opinion is that when a a woman is divorced for the third time her is one monthly period. Not like in the first or the second it it is three monthly periods, three menstruations. No, it's one minstruation only. Okay."
