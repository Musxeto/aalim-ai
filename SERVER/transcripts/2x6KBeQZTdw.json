S.I wasallam as the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was sent as an example for the entire world and the best of those who followed him were the companions the sahab the companions were constantly in pursuit to achieve the higher status and closeness to Allah and his messenger sallallah alaihi wasallam through striving to the best of their capacities Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala he testifies in the Quran and inshallah I shall recite a portion from the ninth chapter of the Quran ayat 99 and [Music] [Music] 100 Allah in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] f but among the beduins there are others who believe in Allah and the last day and take what they spend as a source of nearness to Allah and of prayers from the messenger it is indeed a source of nearness for him it is indeed a source of nearness for them Allah will admit them to his Mercy surely Allah is the most forgiving the most merciful and the first first and foremost of the immigrants the muhajirin and the supporters the ansar and those who followed them in goodness Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Allah and he has prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide forever that is the Supreme achievement today we have with us our honorable Sheikh Dr Asim alakim to Enlighten us on this very topic best of the best Companions of prophet Muhammad sallallah alaihi wasallam a brief introduction to Sheikh Dr aimim who graduated from the prestigious University in Makkah and also attained his bachelor's in linguistic from the King abdulaziz University in jeda Saudi Arabia he is an Imam of a Masjid in jeda a role which he has been held for the past 22 years where he delivers the weekly Friday sermons and lectures on various Islamic Sciences sheim Alim frequence to several National and international conferences and also participates regularly to spread the message of Islam via online radio and television programs he appears regularly on Saudi radio channel Saud the second Channel Huda TV channel and peace TV besides this he holds a position of human resources and public relations director at a leading multinational company in Saudi Arabia brothers and sisters please welcome sheim Alim for his presentation on the topic best of the best Companions of Muhammad s indeed it is a beautiful night coming from Saudi Arabia the WEA the weather is fine the food is fine the people mashallah are fine and everything is fine so may Allah Asel as he gathered us here to listen to something that may soften our heart may Allah guide us on the day of judgment in Paradise under the flag of our Prophet sallallah alai when we come to speak about the best of the best the cream of humanity it is not an easy task when I was asked to speak about the I thought that was an easy lecture for me to do probably because I had already presented in 2012 well actually 2009 with the grace of Allah asael series on the companions of the Prophet alham including the four rightly guided Cals on peace TV so I had the material but when I sat down to try to compile a talk I found that it was mission Impossible five I don't know if they made four or not but you guys in Dubai should know it was impossible simply because each one of them requires not less than 3 hours just to read and go through the virtues of that individual not to explain so if I'm going to say a story or to report or narrate a Hadith in this Hadith I can get like 10 or 20 lessons and this means that the whole night is gone it is an extremely difficult task because there are so much much knowledge and information and things that draw you closer to Allah once you let go of everything you take off your shoes you relax you sit down and fly with the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam you forget your debts you forget your expenses you forget your household you forget your job and relive how they lived it becomes impossible to come back to reality once you taste that when Allah asael grants you this flavor and favor and blessing of Allah asael nevertheless it's a beautiful night and we will try to go through whatever the time allows us with the grace of Allah Asel but why talk about the past so many times people negatively look at us and say you Muslims live in the past you say we had the best of doctors the best of mathematicians the best of inventors we Muslims conquered this and that we Muslims that was in the past tell me what you have presented to humanity at the moment tell me about your achievements and this is a dilemma well actually it's not because we dive in history to know our heritage to know our source of honor and dignity that comes from our history to know that Islam is a practical religion it is never ever or was ever a theoretical religion every single thing in Islam is implementable so you read things you say oh this is impossible no it wasn't and it isn't the companions did it may Allah be pleased with them because sometimes we come to the prophet Alat and we hear that he did this and that and we say no he is the prophet no one is like him okay it wasn't only the prophet it was also the companions may Allah be pleased with them so the more you read about their biography in s the more you find yourself connected to this religion because they're not all the same they are not clones of each other each one is identified for his own character this one is strong this one is soft this one is this this one is that and you can relate to that because we are not all alike we're not all the same we have our own differences so when we come to the companions we know that Allah has chosen his prophet and Messenger s wasam over all other Messengers and Prophets he's the chosen one and hence he chose to him the best of companions the best of generations and this is why the prophet saidat the best of generations is my generation and the generation that follows them and the generation that follows them three generations the companions the and they are the best of humanity after the prophets and The Messengers and the prophet said in an authentic Hadith the Stars I don't see any maybe I have to check my eyesight do you see stars mallah Dubai has so much light it has taken the light of the Stars the prophet said the stars are a safeguard to the heavens so when the stars are gone then the heaven or the S or whatever is on top of us will get what Allah has promised which is destruction when the St stars are gone it's a day of judgment and the prophet said I am he's talking about himself I'm a safeguard to my companions so when I'm gone my companions will get what Allah has promised them meaning the tribulations the uh uh uh the apostasy of the people in at the time of Abu bak and the tribulations of the who came to killman and kill Ali and the rest of that and the prophet said finally and my companions are a safeguard to my umah so if my companions go then my umah will receive what Allah has promised them meaning the Innovations the killings the destruction the disunity and all of this is as the prophet has explained sallallah wasam now if you look at the companions you will find that they were the flag bearers they took the message after the prophet Alat wasam and they spread it all over the world and this is why they are the generation that it is not permissible for any individual to speak negatively on any of them no matter how differences we have or they might have had which with one another you have no right to speak negatively about any one of them so when you look at this generation and when you look at How They Carried the dean to humanity and how they were the idols and the well let me use another word how were they were the role models and the symbols for Humanity you cannot hold yourself from loving them from praying to Allah that he would make you be resurrected on the day of judgment with them and if you go to each one of the companions generally speaking each one Allah has favored him with a characteristic that is not shared by others or maybe he excels in it more than others Ann Malik may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet saidat wasam the most merciful one from my umah to my umah is Abu Bakr the most merciful companion to the umah is Abu Bakr and the strongest in the religion of Allah is Omar and the most sincere in in bashfulness in shyness isman may Allah be pleased with him and the most knowledgeable and rulings to judge cases in court is Ali may Allah be pleased with them and the most knowledgeable in reciting the Quran is and the most knowledgeable in general terms is zbit or actually mu jabal and the most knowledgeable inheritance and how to distribute inheritance Is Zade IB thait and every um has an am a trustworthy and this um's Amin is Abu so each one was a school of his own and to go into and study his biography and the things that he had done you would definitely need a lot of time to do this however the prophet wasam named 10 of his companions and he said that Abu Bakr is in Jen Omar is in Jen is in J Ali is in Jen AB is in JD is in is in is in is in J and is so the companions all the scholars all agree that these are the best 10 Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and they agree without any difference of opinion that the best of the best are the four companions in the order of their historical Reign Abu Bakr Omar and Ali may Allah be pleased with them and why were they the best of the best this is something you cannot answer in a lecture but when you study their biography when you study their history you find that they had everything under balance and you find that they were the best in everything they did we have our weaknesses so I might be a good businessman I make a lot of money but I have my weaknesses when it comes to taking care of my health and my sports it comes to a a time where I have to choose between a business meeting and running my business and taking my wife to a lecture I'm I have to admit I'm weak I have a deficiency when it comes to the companions it is not like this at all they were perfect in every single thing they do so go they go to Jihad they the best of Fighters okay then this is an indication that physically they're fit they give in sod they give all of their money they don't give like you know one dham maybe let me cut it into half I may need the other half no they give everything literally everything we it comes to worshiping Allah they fast as if you think that they never break their fast and they pray the whole night or most of the night and in the morning they are in the market selling and buying and they are among the richest of all so everything is balanced and Allah gave blessing and Baraka in everything they do in addition to all of that they were the best propagators of Islam and they were steadfast they would not change their opinion like we do now you find someone praying in the Masjid for 2 years masallah in the first row after a while he doesn't show up what's wrong he says well I spoke to one Sheikh he says it's not mandatory and another Sheikh told me no the Imam you pray behind is a cfir or at least the Imam you pray behind you don't know is he a Muslim or not so best to pray in home and then after a while he changes and says no I'd like to do this and I'd like to do that they were steadfast on the Quran and Sunnah never changing never giving up no compromise so again half of the lecture time went and we did not speak about any of them yet nevertheless it is important to study their biography to have a glimpse of who they were may Allah be pleased with them because whoever loves them this is an indication that he is a True Believer he's a and whoever hates one of them or speaks negatively or feels that his heart is declined on looking down a little bit or criticizing them he is a hypocrite he is a maaf and it's a sign of belief to love them unconditionally may Allah be pleased with them so we begin with them from the runner up and number four is Ali AB Talib and Ali AB Talib is the most of the companions may Allah be pleased with him that the books of history and the books of Hadith spoke about so if it were about quantity we would say that he should be number one but in accordance to Quality he is number four why do we have so much about him because the Muslims have divided into two extremes people who exaggerate and makeu thinking that he's a god he's a messenger he has he had should have been the messenger and they go into extreme and people who go to the far left criticizing him speaking against him and they go to the extent of executing him as the kwar did may Allah have his wrath and curse upon them so that's why but he is number four he was born 10 years before the of the Prophet which means that the prophet became a prophet when he was 10 years of age and he was the first child to accept Islam and some say that he was the first person to accept Islam altogether and this is disputable but among the children definitely he is the first one the prophet saidat praising Ali if I am someone's W or MAA then Ali is his MAA too if I were to be your one of your friend then you have to take Ali to be your MAA and to be your friend meaning that if you speak a little bit negatively about him or think of him in a bad way you're not the Moa of the Prophet Alat wasam he was raised in the house of the Prophet Alam why because the prophet was raised in his uncle's house Abu Talib but then Abu Talib had so many sons and he was broke so when the prophet Mar and she gave him her house and she gave him him her wealth he took Ali so that he would ease the financial burden on his uncle so Ali was brought up in the house of the prophet and he is the man of wisdom if you go into the books of history and read his statements and quotes you would find that it is so close to to the prophet's Hadith because he learned firsthand from the prophet not only that even the greatest of companions whenever they had a a problem to be solved even Omar he would used to say no one can find an answer to this except Abu Hassan and they ask him and he gives them this knowledge so he was a f he was a real juror and a scholar and if anyone would boast about his self himself it would be Ali who is like Ali I am the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam I am the husband of his daughter so I'm his son-in-law I am the nephew of ham the master of all Martyrs my uncle ham I am the brother of jaar the one with the two wings flying in parad jaali he's my brother I am the father of alassan and Hussein the masters of the youth in Jenna so no one can come close to him as when it comes to his courage this needs volumes and volumes to be 23 years of age and willingly accepting to sleep at the night of assassination of the Prophet Alam in his bed knowing that 12 or more of the toughest men of qu will come and assassinate the prophet thinking that you are the prophet Alam and he agrees to sleep in his place to save the prophet Alam this by itself shows you his courage I'm talking about myself if someone tells me this is a deserted house she I'd like you to go and turn on the lights I believe in Jin I Believe In Black Magic I believe life is short I'm not crazy to go into that house he gave his life for the protection of the Prophet Alam trusting in Allah when it comes to courage he was in his early teens in the Battle of bad when this huge Army of the mushin came to fight and they said bring us three of your best to have a duel with our fighters from qur so three of the ANS come and the prophet said no no retreat and three of the muajin step forward and one of them is Ali with one blow he ends the duel and he wins he participated in all battles with the prophet Alam except in the Battle of tabuk and the Battle of tabuk was on the ninth year of Hijra and it was hot it was mid August and they did not have enough Provisions they did not have camels to take them so the prophet traveled about 800 kilm to the north to fight the byzantian Empire but Ali did not go and he started to cry and he was almost in his 30s huh early 30s and he said oh prophet of Allah you leave me behind with the women and the children the prophet left him behind not because he doubted his strength he left him behind because he wanted him to be the Amir of Medina and to protect Medina while he's gone with the Companions and the prophet told him don't you like to be from me like Haron was to Musa you're my cousin Haron was a prophet you're not a prophet but there is no Prophet after me but to me you're like harun to mus you're my beloved cousin I love you and you are my son-in-law Allah loves Ali and this needs no uh uh proof the prophet said Alam in a long Hadith you all know because I'm have to make it short tomorrow I will give the flag to a man who Allah and the prophet Alam loves him and he loves them Omar says I never ever wanted to become a leader or an Amir except that night because this is a testimony from the prophet that whoever is given then Allah loves him and I wanted to have this look at the humbleness of Omar Omar still doubts whether Allah loves him or not though we all know that he does so when it was morning the prophet gave it to Ali Allah be pleased with him unlike all the other companions Al Talib was one of the poorest companions ever I wouldn't say that he had no luck with trade and business we know that Abu Bakr was extremely rich Omar was yeah Fair middle classman was a multi-billionaire andu all of them were really rich good businessmen Ali did not even try to become a businessman he was like the prophet Alam one date was be would be enough for the night two days three days alhamdulillah he would not go and pursue dun and he used to look at gold and silver and he us he used to address gold and silver in the presence of his companions he say try to cheat someone else I cannot be cheated with you so he gave the Dunya away and he did not ask for anything of it and he reigned for about six years but there was a lot of tribulation while he reigned because of the because of their doings of their fightings and killings as we see today they are the source of corruption wherever you look they are the on who kills the Muslims who Slaughters the Muslims they're Professionals in doing this but they don't do any of that to the real enemies of Islam he was killed and assassinated by one of them and this abdurahman mulim killed him while he was about to pray and to lead the Muslims in prayer he stabbed him with a poisonous dagger and he died as a martyr and he died among those whom the prophet Alat died and passed away while he was satisfied with them may Allah be pleased with him the third runnerup isman IB may Allah be pleased with him known as the one with the two lights why did he have two flashlights with him no he was blessed to be the son-in-law of the Prophet Alat not once like Ali but twice so whenever you hear someone praising Ali saying he was the son-in-law of the Prophet he's better than anyone else tell him thatman had two of The Prophet's daughters sallallahu alaih wasallam he was married to R and the companions say we did not see any couple more beautiful than and R they were the best couple in meca they loved one another they had the best marriage ever they both came from the best families in qur and they were fitting one anotherman was the first to embrace Islam and he was the byproduct of the Daw of Abu Bakr our winner of today and Abu Bakr this this needs nights and nights to speak about his virtues may Allah be pleased with him imagine someone accepting Islam we make dawa who comes in Islam because of our dawa normal people Abu Bakr who comes to Islam through his Daw all types of people even the highest levels of dignitaries of quray but this is not our topic not just yet so he accepts Islam among the very first and the prophet gave himat his daughter R and and the prophet had how many daughters four he had rum Z andum were married to the sons of ABAB so they were married to the cousins of the Prophet but when the prophet was revealed to Abu lahab forced his sons to divorce them and they were divorced so he gave R to and they were happily married but she fell sick and when they migrated andman by the way is one of those who migrated twice he migrated first to abasia to alhas and came back and then when they were allowed to migrate to Medina he went to Medina with his wife who fell sick and then shortly died at the time of the battle of Badr and that is why why he did not witness bad because the prophet ordered him to sit and nurse and and to be with his daughter until she died but the prophet gave him from the booty of War as if he was witnessing the Battle of bad and after she died immediately the prophet Alam gave him his second daughter umum whom he married and she died afterwards and the prophet said if I had a third daughter I would given her toan and this shows you the caliber you don't give your daughter you don't give your uh sister to anyone except that a person you know that he is a man that is worthy of being related to you don't throw your flesh and blood to dogs you give them to a man who would honor them who would take care of them nowman was unlike Ali meaning that he was into this duny he was not like Abu Bakr and Omar who would be yeah sufficient for them to eat one meal for a whole month because he came from a very rich background and we're talking about the Forbes uh uh 500 he would become in the first three he was yeah totally Rich Beyond imagination to the extent that okay someone tells me she you're very generous your believer give us a donation I will take 50 Dirhams and give it and maybe have a heart attack afterwards he wasn't like that it is astonishing what he used to do with money and this is the difference between him and us the dun was in their hand in our problem that the Dy is in our heart so if we take it from it we will have a heart attack to them you throw it and you catch it again and there's no problem in that so he used to eat good food he used to wear good clothes he used to enjoy life is it haram is it haram if I have money and I pay zaka and I give money to charity to Islamic schools to p people to orphans to needy and I still have money what's wrong in buying an expensive car what's wrong in living in a big house nothing is wrong with that alhamdulillah Allah made it Halal but do I feel arrogant when I drive my BM or my Mercedes and if it's going to the workshop I have to drive my uh Hundai or my Kia do I do this so that people would not recognize me ah then this is in your heart a real Muslim he's not affected by his money or his car this does not define you what defines you is your heart is your Iman is your actions so may Allah be pleased with him was into dun because it was Halal but he utilized it utilized it for the service of Islam so he was the most knowledgeable among the scholars of the Hajj rituals and that is why he used to do Hajj every single year he was not only into good food and good clothes he used to fast a day in and a day out so when he was martyred and assassinated he was fasting by the way he did not break his fast and he was so knowledgeable of the Quran that he used to pray almost all night with the Quran it was reported in an authentic Hadith that in the season of Hajj who performed Haj here let raise your hands mashallah masallah may Allah make those who did not perform Hajj next year inshallah among the first to perform Hajj and accept it from them in ha you know it is difficult huh the nights of mina the nights ofif people are worn out they're tired you know with the rituals one of the the T says I pray is in mecah behind the Kaa and after I finished my prayer I sawman he stood behind Mak ibim and said allahar and he prayed just until F prayer one ra he finished the whole Quran he read the Quran from Al to in one in Mina in in the seasons of Mina in nights of mina in h season so he knew the Quran as they say like the back of his hand so he was not only in business I'm business I do selling and buying what do you know can you recite a this is a Hadith what what what is it I saw a clip in an Arabian country a man going around asking youngsters in the University uh uh uh he's reciting an ay in he's saying what is it in which Surah it is and you hear like 10 or 15 of them one saying this is inah Al Bak one of them this is inat and none brought the right answer and then we sit on our couches lean down down and say yeah was thisan was that Subhan Allah what are the virtues ofman may Allah be be pleased with him his generosity his giving to Islam the prophet was with the Companions and the people could not drink water it was famine it was drought and there was only this Ruma uh a well that the people used to drink and it belonged to a Jew so so they tried to buy it of the Jew he would not sell so went and the prophet said who would do this for the Muslims man went and made a trick on the Jew he said listen I'll buy half of it and he gave him like something a very high amount so the Jew said okay so when it was the day ofman he said it's sail all Muslims come and carry whatever ever you want and in the day of the Jew nobody come but the water is almost gone so the Jew sold the rest of his share for peanuts the prophet Alam then saw said oh prophet of Allah The Well of Ruma is for Allah and the messenger and he paid a lot and in the J on tabuk people did not have camels they did not have rides so the prophet said who will finance the Army may Allah make him with me in Jenna soan said oh prophet of Allah 300 camels fully loaded are on me 300 camels this is more than having 300 yokin XL Denali 2015 rooftop everything this is too much not only that when the prophet Alam was happy and satisfied more to it on me more to it on me and then he came to the Prophet this is done H the camels are done he brought a big sack of gold and he poured it in the prophet's lap all of this to Allah and the messenger never look back when you give to Allah and the prophet said nothing would harm whatever he does after today this is card blanch do whatever you want nothing will harm you this isman the one they talk against and they say bad things about W he nobody speaks negatively about man except a hypocrite wall a man of this nature so close to the prophet he was the most truthful in being bashful he is so shy but not shy to the extent of not socializing or not being a man no he his shyness in not doing something that is sinful to the extent that the prophet was once sitting and part of his knee was exposed Abu Bakr said can I come in he came in Omar came in whenman wanted to come in he sat properly and covered his knees said oh prophet of Allah you didn't do this with Abu bak and Omar why do you do it withman who's she she said shouldn't I be bashful of a man that the Angels themselves are bashful of what kind of of of yeah character did he have may Allah be pleased with him Abu mus in a long Hadith said I am today the gatekeeper of the Prophet Alam the prophet was in a garden on a well so he didn't want anyone to interrupt him Abu Bakr came what do you want I want to see the prophet wait I'll go and seek permission the prophet said let him in Omar let him in the prophet said let him in and give him the Glad Tidings of J on a Calamity that will befall upon him the prophet knew that he would be executed and he would be uh uh having hardship before he dies among his virtues may Allah be pleased with him he is the first one to collect the Quran and distribute it to the country and the Quran we have today is from the grace of Allah preserved and through because we know that the first collection of the Quran was at the time of Abu Bakr the first and we will get to this inshallah if FJ does not call so but they had only one Quran and when the Muslims started to expand and people people came into Islam a lot of mistakes started happening so came said people are making mistakes because they are in Persia and here and there and they're they're not Arabs like us so he collected zabit he told him to come once again to do the same same task but with the collaboration of Zu abdah Zu and other of the quis and he made four or five copies of the Quran on the uh uh the tongue of qur and he distributed to aam to uh uh Egypt to meccah Etc so that people would follow it and burnt all the other copies and this is the copy that we have alhamdulillah preserved until today he's the first to make a naval fleet which is something that the Arabs did not do they were so scared of coming close to the sea because they are people of the desert but he in his Reign may Allah be pleased with him managed to make the first naval fleet and defeat the Romans or the bantian in a naval battle known asari he may Allah be pleased with him expanded the prophet's Masjid and decorated it and beautified it in and this was the first expansion there are so many things but we all know that he was assassinated cowardly because the came with the instruction of the Jew Abdullah Sabah who orchestrated it and they besieged his house and all the companions were confused in Medina what to do whenever they wanted to defend him he would tell them don't until it reached the limit with Ali may Allah be pleased with him so Ali took his sword put on his turban took alassan Al Hussein and took a group of trustworthy Companions and went to Def to defend him and he penetrated all those besieging his house and went and spoke to him he said khif you are the let me intervene and he said Ali what does a man who is over 80 anticipate I'm over 80 what do you think I want to live any longer and he says I pray to Allah that I will meet Allah with not a single drop of blood in my neck I'm not responsible for the Bloodshed of a single drop and he told them please do not fight and do not do anything and leave and this shows you how much they feared the Bloodshed of a single drop and how nowadays Muslims they solve their problems by killing as many as they can so if I differ with you I'll blow up your house I'll blow up your neighborhood I'll blow up your country I will assassinate you and I claim that this is part of Islam W it is not whoever Does this does not know Islam but the people are ignorant they're away from the Beautiful s and he died may Allah be pleased with him the second runner up Omar and this is a man that most of us maybe call his son Omar so many people I know what's your name Abu Omar why I love Omar Omar is a strange man now he was late in accepting Islam do you know that when did Omar accept Islam in the first month month or in the first six month or in the first year he embraced Islam on the sixth year he was a fierce enemy of Islam and of the companions for six years yeah Omar yes he was a man of night like all the people of qur Boo and partying and fun he was the ambassador of quray whenever they had to have someone to broker a deal or to mediate between tribes they would send Omar because he was young extremely and I mean extremely strong and he was articulate fluent could read and write and these features at the time of Arabia to be all collected in one person wasn't anything that was normal the prophet Alat wasam called him Abu ha and HS is the son of a lion and his nickname is Al far when he embraced Islam the divider because Allah with him divided between wrong and right between false and truth so his name is Abu Omar Al may Allah be pleased with him we know the story of his Islam and how were the Muslims so so secretive worshiping Allah in nobody was allowed to come and expose themselves until he embraced Islam and he looked at them and said oh prophet of Allah why why are you sitting here let's go to the Kaa and everybody said huha you crazy they will kill us on the spot he said no we will go in two lines on one row Hamza on the second row Omar anyone who approaches us we'll kill him the prophet liked the idea so and they went into the Kaa in marching in two rows of course maybe 20 30 men only but still with Hamza and Omar leading these rows the mush did not utter a single word with their hundreds and thousands they could not even open their mouth said no ham and Omar forget it this is a different ball game altogether before he accepted Islam he was fighting with himself and he saw the wife of just as she was traveling to ABIA and he felt sorry for her and he was a mushrik so he said so you're setting off to travel and migrate she said yes you did not leave a place for us to worship Allah it's all because of you so he said astonishingly may your journey be safe and he left when her husband came she said did you hear what Omar said he wished me that my journey would be safe I think he's thinking about Islam and her husband said do you even believe that he is thinking about Islam W his donkey will accept Islam and he will not because he was a fierce enemy of Islam to that extent the companions never anticipated him becoming a Muslim and in the sixth year of he came Allah opened his heart and he became a Muslim therefore never ever give up hope don't look at a disbeliever at a cafer at even an enemy of Islam and think that he cannot become a Muslim wah you never know when Allah wants to shed the light in a person's heart he will become a Muslim but it is not your job your job is to call to Allah Allah's responsibility is to open his heart it is not yours the prophet we know that he said that I saw a palace with a maid of making W outside of it and when I asked whose Palace was that he said they told me it is's Palace may Allah be pleased with him and we know that uh how how much time do I have time keeper 1 hour oh they're okay uh we know that his Reign was much much much longer than Abu Bakr Abu Bakr reigned for 2 years plus Omar reigned for 10 years and 6 months so the prophet saidat wasam in a Hadith once while I was standing by a well drawing water from it Abu Bakr and Omar came Abu Bakr took the bucket and draw one or two buckets only but there was some weakness in his drawing may Allah forgive him then Omar came and the bucket turned into a very large one in his hands so the bucket all of a sudden became so huge that he's drawing water like crazy I had never seen such a mighty person as he is doing such hard work till all the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there so the prophet interpreted this as working for Islam working for Dean Abu Bakr did not do anything wrong but he was out of time he only lived for 2 years and few months months while Omar had five times this amount and that is why Allah gave him a lot of Victory where he went and conquered Persia and Egypt and the Islamic empire expanded in a way that was similar to none in his Reign because Allah blessed him with this they say Abu Bakr did not want Dunya and Dunya did not want Abu Bakr but in Omar's case he did not want Dunya but dun wanted him it came running after him but he didn't want it and this is found some of us work hard for Dunya and they worked 11 12 15 hours and they could not collect anything of it and some of us Subhan Allah Allah sends them the D to their doorsteps deals and projects and money and he's not working I don't want it and it comes so this is from Allah a test he was generous it was reported that once he came out of half of his wealth and gave it to Allah and the messenger so imagine if you have two cars and all of a sudden you say half of my bank account one of my car if I have two houses one of my houses this is all for Allah can you do that this is the difference between us and them and this is why the prophet saidat one Durham overtook 100,000 dham you know when racing a car overtakes another car one dirham the prophet sayam overtook 100,000 a man had two Dirhams so he spent one for the cause of Allah meaning he gave 50% of his wealth and another one who had had lots and lots and lots of money and he took 100,000 and gave it away didn't affect him a bit so it all depends on what the percentage you give not the amount if you look at a multi-billion he gave mashallah 10 million R for the orens so what he had like 60 billion extra it doesn't matter in in 5 minutes the interest rate will make him regain more and more but when you find someone who has only 10,000 dirhams and he take 5,000 of all what he owns and gives it to the orphans ah this at the side of Allah is far greater than the other he came to the prophet and said prophet of Allah the best money the best wealth I have is my share in you know when kber was occupied by the Jews and the prophet conquered itam he gave certain lands to the companions and it was very uh uh fertile and always fruitful and producing so it was very productive so the prophet gave him a piece of land he came to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah this land is the best wealth I've ever possessed in my life and I'd like to give it to Allah and the messenger the prophet said no keep it but make it as Endowment in Arabic we call it w so the land is not in your name anymore but it cannot be sold it cannot be given away it cannot be inherited whatever comes out of it is being spent on what you decide look at the endowments in the Muslim world we come here in the center please give us money we have this project okay here is 5,000 here is 10,000 here is 100,000 and it's gone and next month please give us next month please give us next year please give us if you were to make a building or a shopping center or a any any endowment and say this is for Allah make all the revenue go to the Islamic Center this is known as you die and you're buried and your children are buried and the meter is running with good deeds better than 100,000 you pay once and it's gone so this is what Omar may Allah be pleased with him uh uh did now we heard in the beginning that Omar was the strongest in the religion of Allah what do we mean by the strongest he was tough the prophet came Alat checking on his companions one night he found Abu Bakr reciting the Quran in a very low voice you cannot hear it so he asked him Abu Bakr what are you doing yeah why is your voice so low when you recite the Quran he said the prophet of Allah the one I am speaking to is listening to me me he hears me is it right Allah is listening to him so he went to Omar and Omar was reciting the Quran loudly and he said Omar what are you doing he said oh prophet of Allah I am waking those who are asleep and I'm kicking away the shatan that is why the prophet said oh Omar whenever you walk in a road the Shan takes another road and no one one the prophet ever said this to except Omar if the Shan fears him then might as well the humans would fear him and that is why a a group of women were once sitting with the prophet Alat singing or chanting because of the the the the defeat of the mushrik army and all of a sudden Omar said can I have permission to come when they heard his name they all started wearing the hijab and everything hiding everything and the prophet broke into laughter so Omar came and saw the prophet laughing said Prophet why are you laughing he said Omar if you had seen what they had done the minute you came everything changed 180° and he said oh you enemies of your own selves you fear me more than you fear the prophet Alat wasam and they said yes you root not like the prophet Alam and this shows you how strong he was in the religion not that the prophet was weak but he was always crossing the extra mile in whatever pleases Allah and we know that he always spoke with wisdom this is why the prophet described him once he said that in every nation there are people who are inspired yeah it's not a revelation but you have this gut feeling that Subhan Allah always comes true and in my um if there were anyone who were inspired it would be Omar and Omar may Allah be pleased with him in three incidents the Quran came verifying his suggestions verifying his advice to the Prophet The Prophet would think something and Omar says no Prophet it should have in this way and the Quran comes verifying that the advice of Omar is correct when he became aifa when he became he did not relax now if I were to be given a position of a CEO or a director or something big I would lay down put my feet on the desk and drink cappuccino day and night I'm the boss Omar when it was daytime he used to sit and Rule and judge cases Amir he took 100,000 of me uh what should I do Amir he killed my son all cases were displayed and he was the judge so when it's night time one should go and sleep he used to spend the night praying half of it and the second half he used to take his stick and go around the Medina streets patrolling and this is known as and it was practiced until recently in all Arab countries where you have certain guards who Roam and go around the streets protecting the people where there asleep he used to do that and we have so many stories about him listening to women trying to cheat on mixing the milk with water because of the provision or feeding their uh uh children and trying not to breastfeed them so that they would give Provisions from B Mal all of this he hears and he corrects it's all about check and balance he corrects everything that is wrong in his Reign may Allah be pleased with him he was very strong in fighting bid he was very strong in fighting shik unlike us nowadays is it's a difference of opinion he's worshiping grave he's wearing a cross he's doing it's okay no it's not okay when he heard that the tree ofan you know which year was it raise your hand no no which year our history huh no no no it's way be behind the Hijra after the Hijra it was in of the fifth year of the and this is when the prophet went to make and they blocked him in they call it and they blocked him said no never ever it was done in entire history of meccah to block someone coming for rra unless anyhow it's not our time so they blocked him no no omah so he sent an an ambassador to speak to them so he told Omar go and try to delegate with them and tell them that we are only here for om and going back Omar said listen if I go they will kill me on the spot you know how harsh I am with them but sendan Usman brothers and cousins and uncles of bani umah they're dominating qur send him so he sentman andman went there and they honored him his family his relatives and he told them come make omah he said no I cannot make omra without the prophet Alam so he didn't go back immediately because there were so he was trying to talk to them and the companions felt that they have assassinated him so the prophet Alat wasam when he heard this he said okay call all the Muslims give me the pledge to die fighting and this is so they all came and gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet wasam under the tree this is the tree they call it now in Omar's time he heard that the people are going to that location and they're praying two rakas and coming back why seeking Allah's blessing but this is an innovation we're praying for the sake of Allah this is Haram this is like someone who comes and prays and this was another incident when may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the greatest was in the Masid of Medina came between of and he started praying two s told him hey come my uh uh nephew you know the elders always call the youngsters nephew and they call them uncles so he said my nephew don't do this because the prophet Alat wasam forbade us from praying between thean and the of except the two ofnah that's all and of course you all know this inshallah you cannot pray voluntary prayers this is Haram other prayers you can it's open but only F only the two of that's it so the boy looked and said do you think I'll pray for Allah and he will punish me for praying for him look at the attitude I'm telling you the prophet is saying this and you're asking me about logical the prophet is saying don't pray and you say do you think I'm praying for Allah and he will punish not punish me so he said Allah will not punish you for praying for him Allah will punish you for going against against the Sunnah how many people when we go to F prayer the IM is praying and we find people coming and they pray two what is this he says is namas namas namas namas my with all du respect the prayer is going the Imam your prayer is invalid pray 10 raat pray 20 Allah will not accept it I guarantee you because the prophet said that there is no prayer acceptable when the prayer is on so this is not our issue issue so Omar when he heard of this he said no this is inovation this is B how can you seek blessing in a place that the prophet never directed us to us he said chop the tree off and likewise if they tell us that this is the house of the Prophet when he was in mecah and people go and pray and wash uh uh the walls and say bar bar mallah de demolish it the prophet did not preserve it himself as when he came in the conquest of Mecca he did not say okay put a fence this is a place where we should visit inshallah every week no he even said that this is not my house took it I have nothing to do with it may Allah be pleased with him sent to conquer Egypt and in one year there was drought and the Nile became less and less in water the people of Egypt said we have a ritual we have to do this what is your ritual we take a virgin and we put her in a boat and we throw her in the Nile take my wife this is this might be even more blessed no no no seriously she doesn't she speaks English but she's not going to watch this so alhamdulillah don't uh relay this on on online H so wrote toar said what do I do the people are shouting and crying we're dying we need water so he said no problem take my letter and throw it in the n so receives the letter and it says from to the great Nile of Egypt if you run by yourself in a way in Arabic the hell with you in this is hard translation but if you run by the grace of Allah Allah will make you run and and of course read this was Omar addressing the Nile was he definitely not he was addressing the people who had this convention so read it to the people of Egypt and he threw it and Allah made it train and everything was okay when making ta look at while people were behind him he came comes to the black stone he says to the black stone W I know that you are a stone that holds no benefit and can protect from no harm had I not seen the prophet kiss you I would not have kissed you he's talking to a stone he's talking to those watching to know to know that this there is not nothing in it compare this with those who come and take a shower to the Blackstone wash it and and do this and exercise or they do this when they come to the Chamber of the prophet in the grave they do this with the windows and they carry a piece of cloth ibraim washing it and cleaning it and taking it back home and then they wash it and the water they drink itah what are you doing he says no this is remedy from uh TFO and and cancer and and kidney stones and where where are you getting this from all of this is nonsense Omar was protecting Islam may Allah be pleased with him with this he would not leave an incident without bringing the attention of the others when it's against Islam when he he was stabbed he's dying kalas on his dying bed a man from the ansar comes and gives him greetings and condolences and inshallah you are a Shah and so on so as the boy is leaving Omar looks and he finds his th His Garment below his ankles you're dying come on Omar what are you doing he said bring him back bring him back and the boy comes and says Omar tells him gently my son raise your garment because it is more fearful of Allah and it is best for your garment it will not worn off it will remain more months or Years to you it is more fearful to Allah so even at the darkest moments just about when he's going to die he does not leave may Allah be pleased with him and this brings us to the winner of tonight's Festival the best of the best Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him he is the most beloved person to the prophet said oh prophet of Allah Who Do You Love among all the people you see he said he said Abu Bakr first he said AA he said not from your household I mean from the men he said Abu Bakr Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him is aik he's the one who reached the highest level of belief he's the one that when everyone said that a prophet is a liar he said no he is telling the truth and he believed the prophet Alat wasam IB Omar says at the time of the Prophet we used to evaluate the Companions and we always said Abu Bakr is better than Omar all the time without any doubts Abu Bakr Omar thenan he was one of the most knowledgeable Companions of the Prophet alisat wasam once the prophet came and he recited when comes the help of Allah and the conquest of Mecca and you see that the people enter Allah's religion in crowds so glorify the praise of your lord and ask for his forgiveness verily he is the one who accepts the repentance and forgiveness the prophet recited this Surah and he said to the companions a slave of of Allah was given the choice between this dun and with what Allah has and he chose what Allah has a normal statement Abu Bakr started weeping and crying and he says oh prophet of Allah we give our lives to you and the companion said what is wrong with this old man the prophet is talking about a servant of Allah and he's crying and IB Abbas Omar all the great companions said after the death of the Prophet we realize that this was an instruction from Allah to his Prophet that his death is drawing nearer so Abu Bakr was the most knowledgeable of us all the only one that the prophet Alam prayed behind was Abu Bakr there is a Hadith that ABD rman in one incident led the prayer because the prophet was late and the prophet came and pray prayed behind him but not like Abu Bakr Abu Bakr was appointed by the prophet wasam to be the leader of the Believers whenever he left when he fell sick he ordered Abu Bakr to lead the prayer AA was afraid she was smart she said oh prophet of Allah Abu Bakr when he prays he cries a lot let Omar she said he said let Abu Bakr lead she said AB Abu Bakr cries let Omar twice three times and then says no Allah does not allow it neither the Believers they all want Abu Bakr a woman comes to the prophet Alam and the prophet tells her to do this and that and to come later on she says if I don't find you what to do he says come to Abu Bakr and this is an indication that he with the consensus of all the companions was the khif the successor of the Prophet if we were only to reite the hadiths mentioning his virtues wah this would take us hours but among the most well-known hadiths the prophet said everyone who did a favor to me I have repaid him except Abu Bakr I cannot repay him and only Allah allel would repay him and if I were to take a a close friend and companion I would have taken Abu Bakr but your friend the prophet is no one ever received such praise from the prophet Alam like Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr had balance in all of his life in a way that is not human Muslim the prophet prays f f is the first prayer of the day and the prophet saidat wasam who among you in this morning is fasting Abu Bakr says I am who among you this morning fed a poor person Abu Bakr raises his hand I did who among you visited a sick person we're talking about F he he said I did who among you followed a funeral until it was buried Abu Bakr said I did the prophet said Wallah these four are not collected in one person individual in the same day except that he will enter Jenna Abu Bakr did all of this Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him with all these great virtues and characteristic was down to earth the prophet comes to him or he comes to the prophet and says oh prophet of Allah teach me something I should recite and say in my prayer he doesn't tell him oh Allah increase my wealth Pro improve my health give me Offspring he says Abu Bakr say these words he said oh Allah indeed I have wronged myself greatly and there is none who forgives sins beside you so grant me forgiveness from you and have mercy on me for you are the all forgiving the most merciful this Dua is being given and taught to who rank number one seeded one in the umah asking for forgiveness when was the last time you asked for forgiveness when was was it the last time you sinned and went and made W and prayed two repenting to Allah we are so deep in the ground Our Roots are so deep so when it is time to die it is difficult to take us from this Earth and it is painful for us because we dug oursel deep in this world Abu Bakr immediately hears that the prophet comes comes to him and say I have been revealed to and I was ordered not to worship any idols and to worship Allah the Mighty the Creator the provider the sustainer he said I believe you immediately he doesn't say can I have a six-month course in or can I give da immediately he goes and collects six or seven of the 10 uh uh uh rightly guided or the 10 Heavenly bound companions so he goes and gets AB he brings them all he calls them to Islam and they Embrace and accept Islam so imagine when you have in your scale of Good Deeds on the day of judgment seven of the 10 Heavenly bound who can come come compare to you or come close to you may Allah be pleased with him and if he wants to boast about himself he is the only one described in the Quran as his friend His companion Allah says no it says Allah is with us you Abu Bakr and me and Allah described him as His companion so how dare people come and say no Abu Bakr is kafir Abu Bakr is this Abu Bakr is that Abu Bakr kafir W he whoever says Abu Bakr kafir wah he is a kafir he has nothing related to Islam Abu Bakr who gave his daughter to the prophet alisam who was the best of the Companions and you dare and say something negative about him when Allah says permitted the prophet to migrate to Medina and the prophet came and told Abu Bakr that I'm migrating to Medina the pro Abu Bakr said oh prophet of Allah companionship allow me to accompany you give me the right and the pleasure and the privilege to have this companionship and the prophet accepted AA says I never had seen anyone cry out of Joy except that day he broke into tears out of Joy because he will be accompanying the prophet Omar was sitting once and they mentioned Abu Bakr and he cried and he said I wish that I had one night of Abu bakr's life and one day of his life the night is when he migrated with the prophet he used to walk in front of him and then go behind him and then walk on his right and then walk his on left and it's only two of them and the prophet says Abu Bakr what are you doing he said oh prophet of Allah I remember that there are spies ahead of us so I walk in front of you then I remember that there is a posy coming behind us so I come behind you to protect you then I remember that there are tribes here and there so I walk on your right I walk on your left I don't know what to do they hid in a cave and the prophet was so tired he put his head on Abu bakr's thigh and while the prophet was asleep there were holes in the caves so Abu Bakr tore his shirt and he tried to put and block these holes but there were four or five that he could not block and he can see scorpions and snakes coming out so he put his feet in them and his hands and the Scorpions started biting him stinging him and he did not move because he did not want to wake the prophet Alat wasam the prophet only woke up up with the tears coming from Abu Bakr falling on his face and the prophet woke up and said Abu Bakr what is this he said prophet of Allah my life is for your life and this is why Omar cried he said this night I would take and I would love to have had this night in Return of all of my life and the day is the day when Abu Bakr decided may Allah be pleased with him to fight those who apostate the the fight of apostasy when people rejected to pray when people rejected to give zakat Omar said Abu Bakr how do you fight Muslims they say and Abu Bakr stood firm and steadfast and said Omar in Jah you were Fierce and strong in Islam now you're weak and coward by Allah I will fight anyone who differentiates between Islam if they used to give a rope that was was tied to a camel to the prophet and then they stopped giving it to me by Allah I will fight to them I will fight anyone who separates between zakat and Salah and Omar says I knew that Allah is guiding him Abu Bakr who's Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him even in the toughest and hardest moments Abu Bakr was steadfast in which we have mentioned they wanted to have a treaty with the prophet Alat they said this year no way don't even dream of it so they wrote a treaty and the treaty on the surface was unfair to the Muslims it seemed it was not it was unfair but we are Muslims we have to comply with what the prophet Alam tells us so what was in the treaty imagine in the treaty says that you do not perform omah now you go back next year you come and not only that any Muslim coming from quray from Mecca migrating to Medina he's Muslim migrating running with for his life you return him back to us and any disbeliever coming or committing an act of apostasy from the Muslims and going to Mecca we keep him and the prophet signed on this so Omar was out of it he went oh prophet of Allah aren't we on the right track aren't they on falsehood why should we give in our religion he said I am Allah's servant and he will not let me down he didn't still you know Amar is hot blooded he went to Abu Bakr usually people would think you're right but U I don't know Omar Abu Bakr did not do this he said Omar stay with the prophet Alat follow his footsteps hold on to his saddle his saddle on the camel hold on to it whatever it takes you you follow he says Omar by Allah I gave so much sodak I freed so much slaves because of what I had said on that day Abu Bakr never ever compromised whatever the prophet did he was steadfast and the biggest example is when the prophet died he was in his in his um property in so when he died he came to the Masjid he found the people weeping crying and Omar standing and threatening all those he said W whoever says that Muhammad is is dead I'm going to chop his head off he did not die but he went to his Lord and he's coming back like MSA went to get the tablets from Allah Abu Bakr went in to the prophet's uh body uncovered his face kissed him in the forehead and say how pure you are Al and dead and then he went out and he said Omar sit down Omar's feet could not carry him he sat down and he said oh people whoever worshiped Muhammad Muhammad is dead but whoever worshiped Allah Allah is alive and never dies and he recited the AY from chapter 3 and this is an ay saying that Muhammad is just a messenger like all other Messengers if he dies or to be killed will you go back on your uh uh heels Omar says as if I did not hear this verse except that day Subhan Allah so all the companions whatever they were lost it was always Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him there to be with them he's the first to collect the Quran because the Quran was not in a book it was written in leaves on Bones on rocks and one of Allah's Miracles that when the Quran was revealed to the prophet Alat it is always referred to as a book but when he died it was not compiled which means that Allah is giving us a prophecy that it will become a book and this is the book we have the only Revelation on Earth the only religion that has a book that had been preserved for 14 centuries any Arab any Yemen any Syrian any Egyptian any Iraqi you come and show him the Quran illiterate and read it to him he understands it because the language is still alive and spoken unlike English if I give you 200 or 300 years novel or play of Shakespeare I I'm I'm a linguist I did this in University well I cannot read this what are you talking about because the language change not like Arabic the language of the Quran so he compiled it into the mus may Allah be pleased with him and he's the one who in his reign of two years plus executed an army to fight the byzantin empire led by us Z who was 18 or 19 years of age with Omar Ali all the great Companions and under his leadership why because the prophet before he died he ordered an army to be set off to fight them with the leadership of Usama the son of Zade Hara the one who was marted while fighting the byzantian it shows you the significance of Abu Bakr that the prophet wasam took sides with him no matter what no matter what always Abu Bakr was right in um Al bukari Abu D may Allah be pleased with him said once we were with the prophet Alat when Abu Bakr came and he was doing this with His Garment you know when you do this you are in in in in in a hurry and and there something wrong so the prophet saidat wasam said look at your friend he is close because it's almost revealing his knee and above the knee is the thigh and this is so there's something risky about it something wrong so Abu Bakr came and went went to the prophet Alam he said oh prophet of Allah there was a dispute between me and Omar and we're human we have differences so there was a dispute between me and Omar and I was wrong I'm the wrong door so I went to Omar's house and I sought forgiveness for from him he would not forgive me so I came straight to you to complain I'm the wrongdoer but please inter let Omar forgive me anything wrong in that nothing wrong Omar says after Abu Bakr was with him he felt bad about it and he's my brother how can I not forgive him so he went to Abu bakr's house he knocked and they told him Abu Bakr is not here he went to the prophet so Omar entered to the prophet's Court sallallahu alaihi wasallam the minute the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam saw Abu Bakr uh saw Omar his CH his face changed it became red he sat straight on his place sallallah wasam and he looked harshly at Omar when Abu Bakr saw this he fell on his knees he said oh prophet of Allah I'm the wrongdoer I'm the transgressor it's not Omar I am the one who's mistaken and the prophet wasam said Allah has sent me to you so you said you're a liar only Abu Bakr said you say the truth he compensated me with his wealth with his family and he gave me family meaning his daughter wouldn't you leave my companion to me won't you leave Abu Bakr for me and he repeated it twice or three times this companion said after that no one ever spoke against Abu Bakr so even when Abu Bakr was the wrongdoer that gave no right to anyone to say anything bad to him not even Omar may Allah be pleased with them all Abu Bakr was among the few that gave fatwa in the lifetime of the Prophet so only Abu Bakr and Omar would give fatwa and the rest of the companions would not speak how dare you speak in the presence of the Prophet only Abu Bakr and Omar would give fatwa he of course was a businessman and he utilized his money in the service of Islam and that is why he used to buy slaves and set them free and his father was angry with him and he said my son you're wasting your money on buying slaves who are weak buy slaves that are strong that can defend you that can be good for you you and he says oh my father I do it for the sake of Allah he as reported by Omar may Allah be pleased with him he said every time I compete with Abu Bakr Abu Bakr wins every time I compete with Abu Bakr Abu Bakr wins once I said to myself today I'm going to beat Abu Bakr is it doing it for the sake of D they're competing for the sake of Allah says inah and in this those who compete must compete in seeking Allah's reward what did he do he said today I came to all of my wealth and I took half of it and I came to the prophet Alam and put it in front of him I said oh prophet of Allah this is for Allah and the messenger of Allah uh the prophet said may Allah bless you Omar what did you leave to your family he said exactly like it 50/50 so he said may Allah be uh bless you a while later Omar Abu Bakr comes with a bigger bunch of wealth and he puts it in front of the Prophet Alam and the prophet says Abu Bakr what did you leave for your family he says I left Allah and the messenger of Allah this is 100% of what I possess on Earth it's all for Allah and the messenger imagine that you give everything and just leave your th on you for the sake of Allah who can do this Abu Bakr did it not once not twice but three times in his life during the 10 years of Hijra he did it three times giving all his wealth his trade his commercial registrations everything three times because he trusts Allah and Allah rebuilds it again in no time there is trust in Allah how long are we going to live where is Abu Bakr now he's dead where in Medina next to the prophet wasam what good was his money for him what did he leave behind by the way when he died did he did not leave a single Dirham or dinar nothing the minute he was appointed as aifa the second morning he was going to the Suk Omar and ABD say where are you going you're the Khalifa he said I have to eat I want to sell and buy I'm a Trader I'm a merchant said no this is not possible anymore you're the Khalifa you cannot sell and buy so what to do so he they told him we will estimate and they looked around and they estimated that he should be awarded so much provision from B Mal and they allocated this amount for him uh uh and he became that we can go on and on with mentioning these beautiful stories but these are at the end of the day authentic stories these are these events did take place however it is our responsibility to act on this knowledge what are we going to do are we going to stay as we are or are we going to follow their lead are we going to implement these beautiful lessons in our lives are we going to check how long do we pray night prayer how many fasting days a month do we offer for Allah voluntary how much sod do we give if we can excel in business some of us might be a businessman he says no I'm going to leave business and come to join maybe staying in your business making money and making 20 teachers of worldwide a month is much beneficial and fruitful for you at the side of Allah than you joining at at circle of so each one Allah has given him special treats and special virtues and talents utilize this to the maximum so that you would be with the best of the best may Allah make you and me among those who are joined by the companions under the flag of the prophet inshallah we'll have uh a quick round of questions but then just before that I want to point out to tomorrow session inshallah is an open question answer session an opportunity for all of you to bring your questions and insh we'll start we'll start nearly at 7:30 inshallah so that we have maximum number of questions that we can take tomorrow and and inshallah now we will have questions only on the topic of today which is best of the best Companions of wasam so if you have any questions from the brothers we will entertain one question from the brothers one from the sisters inshallah for your amazing talk I'd like to know if you can tell us a bit about how the the companions used to use their time like the you know the question is how did the companions utilize their time now this would take maybe another lecture but when what I have mentioned to you they did not waste a single moment so even their resting time would be in worshiping Allah Muslim and he different than he met Abu Bakr and Abu Bakr is saying what's happening of course in Standard Arabic classical Arabic soah said I have become aaf said why he said because when we are with the prophet he remind us of Jenna and hell as if we can see them we feel so good and when we come back to our homes and we mix with our families and with our trade we do not recognize our hearts Abu Bakr said by Allah I feel the same let's go to the prophet so they went to the prophet and and said the same statement to the prophet Alam and the prophet told told them if you are in your homes like you are when you are with me the Angels would come down and you will see them in Broad day lights and they will shake hands with you but 1 hour and 1 hour meaning that an hour is for total worship and and and and an hour for refreshing refreshing yourself and entertainment in halal now the companions looked at the hour which was in entertaining and Halal in things that were utilized in the sake of Allah such as archery such as swimming such as horse riding such as wrestling so even the things that they use for entertainment can be also utilized and accredited to the uh you have another speaker should be more interesting uh they used to do this for the sake of Allah now how would they utilize their time this needs um a thorough a thorough um study you know collecting the Hadith but definitely someone like Abu Bakr F time he has already done four things that we maybe take we may take a month to do you feeding a poor person uh fasting visiting a sick person and going after a funeral and this is only F then what about the daytime so this shows you that these people are yeah not like us and it is not difficult to be like them yeah I know a lot of people who when they go to the gym for example and I've seen them and sometimes I do this I go to the gym I work out for an hour two hours I use my headset and I listen to a whole of on and then I want to study inheritance so if I go every day and I listen to an hour and a half wall in 6 months time you will become a scholar I'm telling you because you got the sheh with you and you're listening to something you did not know but who does this no I'd rather listen to the news I'd rather listen to this I'd rather to I'd rather just chitchat so if we utilize our time in our cars when are we playing even when we are shopping okay we do shopping like tce twice a a week and it takes us maybe 45 minutes to an hour what do you do while shopping on your own nothing just listen to something that is useful read learn utilize your timei one of the scholars of Islam the fth uh Century of Hijra the compiler of z uh the compiler of of many great books uh one of the hamali scholars he says that life is so short and I have to utilize this but there are things in life that are inevitable among them is people visiting you if somebody someone knocks on your door you cannot look as I do oops I'm not here I put a plaster I don't want to meet him no the real Muslims would open and host those guests who come so he says they come so often relatives friends acquaintances but time is so valuable so I'm in a dilemma I'm a scholar what to do he said then I came to an idea that when they come to me I do things that do not require concentration such as fixing the pens filling the ink shredding the papers so I'm sitting with a relative with a friend and he's talking and I'm doing all these things that take time but I'm utilizing my time Al imim he says that his whenever he used to uh um eat he would not eat anything except cakes that are dipped in water so that it would not take time to shoe because of his pursuit of acquiring uh knowledge some of them even when they go to answer the call of nature they would have students read to them so that they can listen not the that the reading so that they maybe this is a little bit extreme but you can do this to go and find and discuss this about the companions it requires a lecture maybe inshallah soon and Allah know best so just before we take a question from the sisters I'd like to call upon she ABD to inshallah present a momentum of appreciation to our beloved I can take this on the on the paint no problem hopefully we'll take the question from the sister inshallah on the topic I wanted to ask this question considering Omar who was as you mentioned before he accepted Islam he was an enemy of Islam and he used to indulge in many wrong activities so what about the imams or the speakers uh like who speak on Islamic topics they curse the wrongdoers and the enemies of Islam today they curse the rulers who are unjust to the Muslim umah my question is are we allowed to do that or should we make Dua for those leaders who have killed millions of Muslims that may Allah forgive them and guide them or should we join and curse them if I understand the question if correct me if I'm wrong that what is our stance from the rulers of enemy uh who are fighting against Islam now we know that Omar may Allah be pleased with him was against Islam for six years and then became one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet Alam so can we curse the enemy of Islam and and say that they are in hell and say all bad things about them it's a yes and no question and the best answer would be no it is inappropriate meaning the Jews used to come and greet the prophet Alam by saying and in their language means death so unfortunately some of our brothers in in Egypt and they see but this is colloquial they don't intend it they should correct it so the prophet used to say mother was a Youngster and hot-blooded she heard it once twice the third time she could not tolerate herself and she said May death and destruction of fall upon you you Jews and the prophet said what is this stop see she said oh prophet of Allah didn't you hear what they say and he said didn't you hear what I said they say something and I say and Allah accepts my supplication and does not accept their supplication a Believer does not use vulgar language and does not curse so it is unbefitting of a Muslim to say uh XY Z of the leader of the caer country may Allah have his uh uh curse upon him and may Allah destroy him may Allah no he's an individual it is befitting for a Muslim to refrain from that however can we curse the enemies of Islam yes but this is a a general curse so we say may Allah destroy the enemies of Islam say I mean may Allah curse the enemies of Islam nobody can say this is unbe this is not fitting of you Jesus Christ taught us how to love not how to hate this is not true even if you go to the Bible you will find that Jesus Christ is also promoting The Sword and this is not the time to do this but you can watch any of yeah those who talk about comparative religion and you'll find it you can even ask she Google he will tell you the uh uh verses of hatred in the Bible so we do not come to an individual John Tim uh David and say may Allah curse him may Allah take him to Hell may Allah no we don't do this but generally speaking all the enemies of Islam whether Christians or Jews or uh uh Idol worshippers we say may Allah curse them and Destroy them there's nothing wrong in that so I hope this answers the question inshallah I'd like to stress again that tomorrow's session inshallah is an open answer question and answer session you're free to ask any questions inshallah to the shik inshallah we'll be here tomorrow 7:30 we should start the program and till the time we meet again"
