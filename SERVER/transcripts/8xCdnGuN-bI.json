  "transcript": "subhan from turkey and i think that you should change your name subhan because this is not a good name he says is it true that there is no barakah there's no blessing in food that is hot no this is not true there is a hadith which scholars differed whether it's authentic or not authenticated the hadith where mother aisha i think used to cover a pot while it is boiling hot and she would wait until it cools down and when she was asked she said that the prophet told us that this is greater for the baraka to it to cool down but it doesn't mean it is without any barakah if you eat it when it's hot that's why we drink coffee and tea when it's hot we don't wait until it's cold otherwise it would be iced tea and we'll put ice cubes in it but if it's not harmful for you yes you can consume it while it's a little bit hot and if you don't if you consume it while it's still hot this doesn't mean it has no barakah the greater baraka is when the food is a little bit cooler and you can eat it without any problem in allah zojol knows best"
