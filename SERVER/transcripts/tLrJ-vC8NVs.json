  "transcript": "Shake if a person has a habit of sitting at random time of day and asking Allah for all that he needs can this person make a checklist or a list of things he needs so that when he makes Dua he doesn't forget something or will it be an innovation if someone writes it down to remember that's fine but if he's making a timetable and like some PE some folks have okay before two afterwards and after each one he checks a a box and then recite six pages of the Quran check then say Subhan Allah 100 times check no this is an innovation just do it because this is not part of the Sunnah what you're doing and even worse it's not part of the Sunnah to share it with your group of yes I've done my Sunnah na I've done my night prayer I've done my J of the Quran and you make a list out of that and Allah Knows Best"
