  "title": "Am I sinful for cutting contact with bad friends or friends that I dislike? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign I was a born Muslim but before practicing Islam I used to have some friends which were not good okay so am I sinful for leaving them okay so the question is I have friends and one or two I don't like anymore whether they're bad influence or simply because there's no chemistry anymore they're too aggressive they're too critical of what I do I just don't like the guts anymore regardless if I'm practicing or not practicing if they're practicing or not practicing friends there are no strings attached so am I sinful if I abandon them the answer is no as a Muslim in my contact list on my phone there are like ten thousand fifteen thousand peoples and maybe 95 percent of them I don't know them so am I sinful not for not calling them no am I sinful for not picking up when they called No but if I see them face to face I cannot turn my face to the other side I have to say salaam alaikum and if they say salaam alaikum I have to reply but I do not have to call them even after 10 or 15 years or to be in contact with them simply because I don't like to there's no problem with that inshallah"
