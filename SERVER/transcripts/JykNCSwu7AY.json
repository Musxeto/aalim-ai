  "transcript": "sure I've had three questions the first question regarding seeing Allah the Almighty and authentic hadith the Prophet tells us about a vision he saw and he says that I had seen my Lord coming to me in the best of form in a dream and he put his hand on my chest and I got knowledge from means I did not anticipate and he asked me a question what are the highest level of angels are disputing upon and the hadith goes on so here in the dream in the vision the Prophet stated Allison that he saw his Lord in the best of form and in the night journey with the Prophet Adam was ascended to the seventh heaven and he spoke with allah azza wajal without any mediators he was asked did you see allah azza wajal and he said how can I see him it is light it is beyond my ability to see so he's confused about how to reconcile between the two hadith and Hum Dil a there is no contradiction Allah Azza WA JAL cannot be seen in this world by any human and Allah veil if we're to be lifted no matter what Allah looks at it would be burnt because of the immense power of that light and of the greatness of allah azzawajal while in the vision in the dream the prophet Alison saw allah azza wajal and this is not what allah azzawajal is seen as subhana wa ta'ala on the day of judgment where muslims believers all would see allah subhanahu wa thailand that would be the highest level of reward favors and blessing anyone would get in paradise so the vast majority if not the consensus of all scholars that allah azza wajal cannot be seen in this life and that the Prophet as your son did not see his Lord when he ascended to the seventh heaven he saw a las ocho with his heart and not what with his eyes and likewise when musa peace be upon him moses requested to see allah azza wajal allah told him you cannot see me but i'll show you something look at the mountain in allah azza wajal showed himself to the mountain and the mountain got floored it crumbled in it it came down and Moses fainted because of what he had seen happening to the mountain and then he realized that allah azzawajal cannot be seen in this life therefore i I think that this year nischala removes the confusion"
