  "transcript": "um now she said what's the truth uh about intercession by some great men now basically she's saying that in some parts of her Society um many people go to elders and they ask for their intercession in certain Affairs she says does this is this taking back from the intercession that we we know about in Islam that's fully for the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam intercession in Arabic means shaf and this is derived from the word which means uh uh even numbers and mostly it means two and the origin of of this is that when I have something that I want to take place and happen and I know someone that knows someone so I bring this friend of mine to intercede with me so that this thing could come and happen in a quick manner so both of us are two and this is shaer so if the sister is asking about going to the elderly because for example if if I need something from a neighbor tribe or from a neighboring friend and I'm not at on on good terms with him so I go to a third mutual friend and ask him to intercede this is permissible but if she is me what she meant was interceding on the day of judgment this is completely unacceptable in its form of associating others with Allah you may not ask anyone to intercede at the sight of Allah nowadays except from Allah because the dead are dead if you pray to them you are associating them with Allah they can they cannot hear you and if you go to someone who's alive and you ask him to intercede to at the side of Allah this is exactly what the polyst used to say as mentioned in Surah zumar that we did not worship our Idols except that they would intercede for us at the side of Allah and this is associating others with Allah shik that Allah would never forgive"
