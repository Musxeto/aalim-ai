  "title": "How to pray sitting in a chair? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Scizor manish says can you please explain the procedure of praying while sitting in a chair now this question has two two parts let's assume one the part that deals with an individual praying on a chair - the part dealing with an individual praying in the row in a masjid for those praying alone if you are unable to stand up then you pray sitting down you say Allahu Akbar I'm sitting on a chair at the moment and I'll go a little bit back like this so I hope the camera does not it's not affected so whether I'm standing or sitting I pray my normal prayer when it comes to rock or if I'm standing I offered my normal rocker if I'm unable to offer my normal record because of a bank back injury so I sit down I say Allahu Akbar and I bow like this a little bit inclined to the front Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah I raise up and in sujood again I say Allahu Akbar but I make it a little bit more steeper now a lot of the Muslims ask about the position of the hands because sometimes you see people doing this as if they're Superman pause what is this saying I cannot put it on the ground so I put it in front of me others bring a pillow a third portion bring a table and they put their hands on it all of this is nonsense this is innovation the way of doing is putting and placing your hands on your knees or on your thighs and keep them there all the time when you bow and you prostrate so I hope this clarifies things you do not put it in the air or on a table or on a pillow secondly when I am sitting on a chair where should I place that under Oh because sometimes we find people when they pray standing up they are like a footer or a half or two ahead of the row so that when they sit for prostration and for tisha hood they sit in line with the others is this valid the answer is no if you're praying standing up this is scenario number one you should be standing up with the rope and your chair should be at the back okay sure this would affect those in the second row this is not my business Allah will ask me about my place in the row if I am a foot or two ahead of the row Allah will ask me why did you advance so I have to stand at the same level of the row but if I'll be praying the whole prayer sitting down then I have to move my chair forward so that when I'm sitting my back is exactly in line with the shoulders and of the people in the row so I hope this answers your question"
