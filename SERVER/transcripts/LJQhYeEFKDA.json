  "title": "Why did Umar deny Prophet ﷺ‎ Pen & Paper on his deathbed? (Hadith explanation) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "deny profits a note during his death that ashtiya's claimed that this was to get the control or something and all could you please clarify this Abhishek the Hadith is very crystal clear the prophet Allah in his on his deathbed he gathered the companions that were close to him among them was Omar and some others and he said bring me a pen and a paper so that I would advise you to write something he would he wanted to give them an advice in writing so they wanted to do this Romar was afraid he wasn't sure whether the prophet Allah was in his Sound State of Mind in the sense or he was on his deathbed and maybe he was saying something that most humans may say and not intended so in order for Aroma to preserve the Deen thinking that it was possible which was definitely not possible thinking that it was possible that the prophet may say something that is not in relation to Islam and that would impact negatively Islam and its preservation so he thought it would be safer not to do this and this is why the companion is disputed and this is why the prophet Islam when he saw their dispute kicked them all out so this was an ishtihad of Omar and definitely if the prophet is to say something Allah would protect him and preserve him from saying anything that would negatively impact the Deen as we know he doesn't say anything except in accordance to the revelation of Allah and if he did say something that was wrong Allah would immediately correct that knows best"
