  "transcript": "you work for an NGO in the financing Department yeah then what so when it comes to the procurement or when it comes to procurement yes yeah my colleagues now that you are working together they do their own things so when it comes when it comes for tender opening for the bidding for the billing date we all start together and we just signed the documents so am I sinful of taking part such things and what's an advice we could use Disney your question is not clear but I believe that most likely from previous questions if you're in the financing department and the colleagues and the procurement department they issue tenders for [Music] um people to apply and sell them and they are supposed to be secretive and not telling people how much but some of them may take payments under the table to favor one over the other this is not your Duty you're not an auditor you're a person who gets a paper and sign it if you don't have proof and concrete evidence that they're being bribed or there is Foul Play you have no right to hinder or stop the process this is a problem of the procurement people and their supervisor and their manager and the CEO as for your duty you do your uh Duty by signing the paperwork that's legitimate and according to the policy and procedure and unfortunately that this is prevailing in procurement departments and unfortunately a lot of those engage in such Department take bribes and things they think that this is their god-given right to take bribes and accept bribes and the likes which they are cursed by Allah for doing so so as long as you're not participating in Haram and you don't have concrete evidence you have no reason to stop this and Allah Knows Best"
