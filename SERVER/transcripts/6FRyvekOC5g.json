  "transcript": "if i understand your question you go to a hindu school and they impose upon you every thursday that you engage in some sort of mourning prayers that is usually practiced by doing yoga or praising ram or saying um and and whatever these uh kuffer practices may entail so what's the ruling on that number one it is totally prohibited for you to participate and if you're forced to participate the best thing to do is to leave the school and do homeschooling or better more go to a school that is an islamic school if this is not possible then homeschooling would be your best option if this is again not possible you can be there but hate it with your heart and not participate in whatever they do so be there physically but don't say or endorse or like what they do because you are in a kafir country and these are practicing their own religions and you must not join them and allah knows best eve"
