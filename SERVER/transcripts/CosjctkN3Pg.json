  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim 13 Dua before the night prayers (1) Prophet  ﷺ‎ used to say - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign salallahu salaam used to pray night prayers and night prayers have their own [Music] majestic feeling because you pray it in the middle of the night when everyone is asleep and no one is knowing that you're standing there facing your lord supplicating invoking making the care asking him for what you need so one of the famous duas that the prophet used to open the prayer with was this beautiful supplication creator of the heavens and the earth knower of the seen and the unseen you are the arbitrator you are the judge between your servants in that which they have disputed guide me to the truth by your leave in that which they have differed and disputed for verily you guide whom you will to a straight path what a beautiful dua what a way to begin your night prayer you express your helplessness to allah azzawajal by praising him o allah the lord of jibril mikhail and israel who are these these are the three greatest angels of all the archangel jibril israel and mikhail they are all responsible of things that give life so jibril is responsible for wahi revelation of the quran and this is the life of our hearts israel is the one who is responsible for blowing the horn asur which will resurrect people from the dead on the day of judgment the prophet told us he has put the horn in his mouth and did not blink for so many years anticipating the instruction of allah azza to blow in it so he's the one responsible to giving the life after death and resurrecting the people while mika il is the one responsible for rainfall so he's the one who gives life with the grace of allah to the earth so that plants would grow these great angels of allah azzawajal the prophet is indicating that allah is their lord who is the greatest of everything subhanahu azzawajal so he asks allah as he is the lord of these three angels as he is the creator of the heavens and the earth as he's the knower of the unseen and the seen so what you see this mug this pda is seen what's in the next room is unseen to me but it might be seen to others what's out of this world is unseen for everyone what's underneath the earth what happened in the past what will happen in the future how things are these are all unseen and allah is the only one who knows the unseen so when i ask allah azzawajal in the beginning of my prayer with these beautiful glorifications of him and his attributes i go into my quest so i say ihidini guide me to whatever people have disputed upon because you are the one who arbitrates you are the one who judges between the people in what they have disputed in so guide me to the truth with your leave or by you leave because you are the only one who guides to a straight path what a way to begin your prayer and this is how every one of us should start praying unfortunately we don't do this and that's it what happened in between is negligible this is nothing we can't relate to it unfortunately and this is a very downfall of our ibadah because the weaker our connection with allah the weaker we are as human beings among the beautiful duas that the prophet used to say in the beginning of the salah which the most of us don't know is the following dua allahu akbar allahu akbar allahu akbar alhamdulillah the prophet used to say allahu akbar allah is the most great or allah is greater the greatest so this is superlative way of saying allahu akbar he used to repeat it three times then he used to say and he used to say much praises for allah three times and then he says and glorify is allah the almighty in the morning and in the late afternoon three times and then after that he begins to seek refuge in allah which indicates that he is going to recite the quran afterwards but seeking refuge in shaitaan we all know as boom that's it yet there is another way of saying this that the prophet used to say so he used to say i take refuge with allah from the devil from his pride his poetry and his madness so these are three things that shaitaan is known to be associated with pride neferihi so i seek refuge in allah from the evil of satan that he would not throw pride into me and from his poetry nephihi so poetry is good when it's good but the vast majority of people who use poetry use it for bad things whether in arabic or in other languages so you have rap you have music you have lyrics and it's all in disobedience of allah azza and finally and his madness and this in a way is talking about madness seizure because seizure is because of a malfunction in the electrical currents in your brain and this is medically treated or because of the issue of jinn possession and this is treated by rookia and by reciting the quran caused by jinn by the devils so the prophet in this beautiful short inauguration seeking refuge in allah azzawajal acknowledging and telling us how shaytan can negatively affect and impact us may allah protect us from his evil this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave [Music]"
