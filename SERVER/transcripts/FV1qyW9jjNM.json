  "transcript": "Uh she I have question for for many years this question and we know that if Muslim does not make on kafir he becomes kafir but when does who said who said so who said so lash who said so we know this from Islam I don't understand I don't hear you knows this from 10 nalifiers of Islam okay the 10 nullifiers of Islam is not Quran or sunnah it is from scholars. So not every statement we take we just label people or stick it on people and have conclusions and yeah and you think that it's like a house of cards that you take one everything collapses. No there are conditions there are obstacles but what is your question? My question is when should we make tapir? When you don't first of all you don't make takir. It's not your job. Allah did not send you to judge people. Oh this guy's kafir. This guy's let me see. Uh maybe I should give him a test. No. Someone who says he's not a Muslim. I don't have to be a rocket scientist. You're not a Muslim. You're a kafir. Full stop. So there is no ambiguity. Hi. Hello. What's your religion? I am XY Z. Oh, you're not a Muslim. No. Okay, thank you. He's a kafir. No doubt in that. None whatsoever. Now someone who is a Muslim or says you cannot give without fulfilling the conditions that he nullified Islam because he did 1 2 3 4 and the conditions of knowledge choice no misinterpretation or ambiguity no confusion are there it's fulfilled the guy committed kufur wholeheartedly and knowingly then you And after ensuring that there are no obstacles and the scholars say yes this guy is a caffer but generally speaking I'm in a non-Muslim country the inhabitants of that non-Muslim country are either Christians Jews atheists they're not Muslims and I meet Tom Dick or Harry good or hab bonjour bon whatever they are not Muslims. I do not doubt maybe. No, no. The default is that they're kafir. I go to a Muslim country. I go to Pakistan. I go to Indonesia. I go to uh uh Turkey. Uh hi. Hi. What's your name? My name is Muhammad Abdullah. The default he's Muslim. I don't have to give him a quiz to make sure that maybe he's a grave worshipper. Maybe he has problems with maybe he's No, no, no. The default is he's a Muslim until proven otherwise. So, I hope this makes sense."
