  "transcript": "and welcome to this monthly q and a session which we promised to deliver in ramadan and we are in shawwal finished a while we did one now we're doing the one for the devi and we have a huge number of questions uh from the backlog so we will begin inshallah and try to make it as short and informative as possible imran says which animal is best to slaughter on the day of eid a sheep or a camel and why now we know that it is a highly recommended sunnah for those who can offer the sacrifice known as the and some scholars say that it is mandatory upon those who are financially rich so when it comes to [Music] a person who is capable financially some scholars say it is mandatory but the majority of scholars say that it is a highly recommended sunnah and we know that a man can sacrifice a sheep or a goat on behalf of himself and all those who are dependent on him especially those who live under his roof and each fro and eat from his kitchen so even if a person has like a father who has four or five sons living in the same house grandchildren wives and they all share the food from his own kitchen and from what he provides for them one sheep would suffice for them or one seventh of a cow or of a camel meaning that i along with six other people can share a camel or can share a cow instead of each one of us sacrificing a sheep so one cow is equivalent to seven sheep one camel is equivalent to one two seven uh sheep so now the question of imran is which is better to sacrifice a cow a camel or a sheep scholars say that the prophet alaihis salatu sacrificed a sheep for himself and on behalf of his family and this means that this is the best to do however when these scholars looked at the permission to share in a cow or in a campbell with one seventh they said that definitely offering a whole sheep is better than sharing one seventh in a cow or a camel but if i were to sacrifice a whole cow that would be far more beneficial in terms of price in terms of meat in terms of the food that the poor would get in this case yes a cow or a camel is better than one sheep providing i do not share it with anyone but if i'm going to have a seventh of a cow or a camel in this case a sheep is far better because this was the doing of the prophet amina says can someone call the 99 names of allah every day see calling the names of allah azzawajal without asking allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala is not from the sunnah so if i just say yalatif and i repeat it it has no impact it has no meaning while if i call allah with his names and ask him so i say ya notif make things easy for us ya samir answer my call ya rani pay off my debts ya with an appropriate name of his associating it with something i want from him this is totally permissible and highly recommended because allah loves to be called by his beautiful names but to come and simply say like the sufis do repeating it a thousand times or a gazillion times this is totally unlike the sunnah and it has no benefits you're not doing anything ask allah for something while doing this ask allah when you call him but when you just call someone this would be on the human level irritating if you just say awesome awesome asan and i look at you yeah duh and you just keep on repeating my name i'm gonna probably smack you because this has no benefit so you're mocking me what are you doing to do ibaadah to please allah you praise him you glorify him you invoke him make dua but not just simply repeat his names khadijah says what of blanket permission that is if a husband says okay to go out when and where needed within a town is it okay definitely it is okay if i tell my wife when she comes and says listen i'd like to go and visit my mother and i tell her han i don't need you to seek my permission you know the ins and outs of what i like and what i dislike so you're going with a mahram or you're going with my driver with other people in the car so that there would not be any seclusion so you're going with my daughters you're going to visit your mom which is something that i always like and i recommend you're going to visit your sister you're going to visit your brother you're going to visit your friends whom i have no problem with i don't need you to come and ask me for permission so you have a blanket permission you have the green light to go this is totally permissible and it shows the trust and the love that a man has for his wife tribe says how to get rid of uswas about islam i have been having a lot of counseling sessions alhamdulillah with muslims from all over the world complaining of uswas and the common denominator in all their cases is that it is obvious that satan is messing with their minds and all of them not most of them all of them with the grace of allah say that we cannot utter these things which by itself is a sign of strongly man so how to fight these usuals one of the best ways of fighting it is knowledge you see shaytan does not mess with people who have knowledge because it's difficult for him he can play with people without knowledge like children play with the football so he uses them he manipulates them he does different things and they are trapped they don't know what to say what to do the moment they call someone who's knowledgeable and ask him he cascades to them in steps what to do and how does and how satan works and they immediately are able to see and subhanallah this is this exact meaning of the ayah at the end even the most pious people they get tempted by shaytaan they get whispers of shaytan but the difference is that they immediately remember after the afterwards they remember allah azzawajal they rely on the knowledge they have to fight this menace so immediately they are able to visualize they're able to see for either mobile they see what's right and what's wrong and they can defeat satan with that so in order for you to get rid of the whispers of shaytan you need first to learn your religion you need to read more quran you need to sit with with scholars ask them not about yourself never ever go to a sheikh and say i had a thought why allah so what allah so and so and did so and so why islam why no this would be exposing your sin rather say to the sheikh a friend of mine had whispers and he asked me to ask what's the ruling on thinking like so and so and so so the sheikh would address it as if it's someone uh else as if it's a third party not you asking him and allah knows best says is right to stay at home and and don't work if husband care about what she need but when he lives in saudi and his second wife lives in europe she needs to work to have money how she care for her children and get father if she doesn't go to work and also her husband does not give her any money some questions don't make any sense in the beginning she said is it right to stay home and don't work if husband care about what she needs if he cares about what she needs why does she say in the at the end her husband does not give her any money this doesn't make any sense unless unless she's asking about a wife whom her father is taking [Music] good care of her let me rephrase that she's asking about her husband who's providing for her a house food taking care of her children um and that's it and at the same time she has a father who is in need and who is unable to make ends meet so he is requesting her to work and to help him financially what's the ruling on that if my understanding is correct it is not permissible for a woman to work against her husband's will so if he's providing for her she must stay home if he doesn't want her to work if he's not providing for her children this means that he's not providing for her properly so it is his obligation to provide for his children if he refuses then she has the right to file for a divorce and to file a case against them at court where they will force him to provide for his children on monthly basis if he's providing for her and for her children but her father is in need of financial assistance and she doesn't have a job well this is not her responsibility what allah obliged her with is that she stays home takes care of her husband and of her children and her father allah azza would make a way out for him but for her to divorce her husband or to work against his will this is not permissible even if he allows her to work but she has to work in a mixed environment with men and women working together mixing chit chatting sometimes flirting this is not permissible no matter what the circumstances are the protection of a muslim woman is more important and allah azzawajal knows best waka says nowadays everyone is encouraging me to watch er girl drama please give us a fatwa subhanallah this turkish soap opera or tv series a lot of the muslims are asking me about and i keep telling muslims that islam as in the authentic hadith islam isolated estranged not familiar to the to the to the people and this is how islam began in a cafe in a mushrik environment where everybody had their own culture and customs there are totally opposite to islam and the prophet says islam and islam shall get back to that stage of being a foreigner a stranger as it began meaning now alhamdulillah all what we see around us is muslims and practicing muslims but there will come a time where a muslim would feel as a stranger among his own family among his own people in his own country and this is obvious and and i had made i believe a lecture about this hadith and a number of friedmas in english as well you can check it on my youtube hopefully so the prophet told us that it is part of islam to feel like a stranger when you abide by the quran the sunnah so a muslim is a stranger among all the nations of disbelief and cover christians jews buddhists hindus seed all of them he feels stranger when being among them and a muslim feels like a stranger among the muslims themselves who are indulging in riba fornication sins openly abandoning islam and trying to imitate the westerners and the disbelievers he feels a stranger even among the practicing muslims he feels like a stranger because he's abiding to the letter to the sunnah of the prophet while others clench to their innovation to the bidder and some to their shirk and some to so many deviant things and also among the people of tawhid he feels like a stranger when they are on the akida of taheed but their blind followers and so yes their is good but they refuse to abide by the quran and the sunnah my school of thought says so and so so i won't get into details a muslim does not budge to pressure and he is indeed flexible but he abides by the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations and he has the guts to stand firm and to fight tooth and nail defending the sunnah of the prophet so nowadays i see a lot of the so-called muslims not your normal day-to-day muslim even the elite guys scholars some of them have budged and this is sad when you get a scholar talking about movies and saying that gog and magog are like the zombies what are you talking about man change the type you're smoking it's making you say weird things when you hear about people saying or imam masjid or he's saying that yeah the turkish drama talking about the ottoman and period and what happened and i say this is brahma it's not history it's not something authentic to believe in first of all second of all as muslims can we watch these things does it have women so yeah yeah they have women but little subhan allah so this little is halal nowadays does it have music of course it's old music how can you even justify it everything around us has music and mixing it so do i change my islam to cope to adapt so that people would say that i'm flexible the most dua that the prophet used to call and say alice is [Music] turner of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion this is the most dua he used to say and he's the prophet isabel so when you see people falling left right and center and retreating from true islam budging and bending and shaping their islam according to what the majority want what the majority need then you know that we have a problem i personally did not see even one single clip of it alhamdulillah because i believe that this is not permissible and it never stops here people would also say yeah yeah it's better than the omar series i and i'm shocked did you see our mercedes he says yeah i saw amma series he's a companion it's not permissible to be depicted he said yeah yeah i know but you know i don't have a lot of things to do and somebody sent it to me and i was drawn to it so i saw the whole season just to be able to give fat ones go home and sleep it's better for you don't compromise so in a nutshell yes it is not permissible to watch this drama due to the haram involved in it and some of the brothers even told me i don't know did someone tell me or i got it from an email asking about it saying that they have they have shirk in it so they have to whistle by the prophet salam they have innovation when they do their afkar like the present day sects who innovate in the religion so they are portraying the origin of this when did it start at the early 200-300 years ago when they used to visit graves and when they used to uh worship graves like the super sufis this is the origin of it so people watch this and take it for granted and this is totally haram for those who want to remain steadfast on islam jashim when we pray to allah can we make dua by any language or only arab arabic please inform me well if you are making dua outside the prayer so i'm not praying i just want to say oh allah make it easy so i say it in arabic i say it in english i say it in spanish no problem no problem but the issue is to ask allah azzawajal in other than arabic during salat this is where scholars differ some say this is okay in voluntary prayers not in fart some say that this is not okay at all some say it's okay totally permissible no problem and the most authentic opinion is whether it is voluntary or fart it doesn't make any difference if you want to make dua you have to do it in arabic if you do not know how to do it in arabic you can do it in your native language so while in sujud i want to say o allah forgive me i know in arabic i can say allahumma so i have to say it in arabic but if i want to say o allah make my daughter pass with honor degree in her university there's a duh i don't know how to say that in arabic man it's too difficult i don't know even the vocabulary in this case say it in your own language and there is nothing wrong in that insha says my father died two days ago due to covet 19 will allah count him as a shahid and what should i do for him to go to jannah i pray to allah azzawajal that allah forgives his sins expands his grave fills it up with light and fragrances from jannah and to make the day of his death the best day of the rest of his life as for martyrdom we have an authentic hadith where the prophet listed seven types of deaths that are considered to be martyrdom which none of them is to die in the or on the battlefield so die on the battlefield is martyrdom without any doubt in that but the prophet told this hassan that the one who dies drowning or under a collapsed building or in fire or due to the plague or due to an illness that comes inside with the intestines or dies if a woman dies while in labor among others the prophet said that they have the status of martyrs so now covered 19 an illness that kills its victims with respiratory diseases where they cannot breathe and they suffocate and die some say that this is a plague of this generation and it's not a plague it's a different illness and also we know that the prophet told us allah is that the plague cannot enter mecca and medina and we have seen fatalities in medina with the covet 19. so definitely it is not a plague but due to the nature of these deaths that are considered to be martyrdom covet 19 shares the symptoms of the symptoms of drowning when it suffocates its victims and causes their death so some scholars say that insha allah those who die with covet 19 are considered to be among the martyrs if they were patient and did not complain to what had happened to them lyric says how can we apply this hadith may allah be pleased with her said when a man complained of pain the prophet said to him pointing pointing his saliva and mixing it with dust this is the dust of our earth mixed with saliva of us so that our sick is remedied with the permission of our lord the hadith lyric is pointing to is an authentic hadith it is narrated and reported by bukhari and muslim in the sahih so it is it has the highest levels of authenticity and now we said that this is usually done with pimples or wounds where the prophet used to do this with his finger wets it with his saliva then puts it at the soil of the earth and then says bismillah and he used to put it where the area needed healing whether it's a wound it's a pimple it is a place that is aching so even if you have something that hurts internally but you cannot see it you may also do this process to it some say that this is only specific to the soil of medina and to the saliva of the prophet salam but this is not authentic because this was a general incident and had it been something special for the prophet he would not have done it without notifying us telling us and the scholars would have stated this that this was only for the prophet you know was is also worth not noting that the saliva itself has a lot of cure embedded in it and unfortunately nowadays we come to the fork of the road where our japanese our belief and conviction is tested big time the covet 19 proved to the world that we tie the camel and we tie the camel well but it also proved to the world that we don't have true trust in allah when the arab nomad came left his camel outside entered the masjid and said to the prophet allah i left my camel outside should i tie it up so it would not run away or should i have trust in allah and the prophet says he said tie your camel but also have trust and dependence on allah don't depend on tying the camel alone but at the same time don't leave the camel untied and claim that you are trusting relying and depending on allah so now we've tied the camel we have social distancing we have masks all the time we're looking for vaccines we're looking for a cure all of this is masha'allah tying the camel but where is the trust in allah this is what most people are unfortunately not doing and this is why we have to revise what's going on by panels and panels of scholars who are independent from any government influence and who are backed by truly practicing muslim scientists and not the who or the cdc no i'm talking about muslim practicing doctors physicians uh scientists who can collaborate forces with the scholars and come up with something that would enable people to live rather than to be in quarantine islamically i'm not going to talk about issues that i don't have knowledge in but islamically this hadith do you think that the wh so would approve of that oh this is contamination putting your saliva with soil and then put it on your one this is totally out of the question i don't care whether islam says this is true or not not interesting when we do cupping for so many years muslim doctors opposed it but this is an essential means of healing in our religion now lately few months ago even the footballers are doing it and the athletes are doing it now the doctors are saying oh okay now i think this is a good means of healing so why does islam come second or third class instead of being at the forefront would you look at rookia so someone is sick someone is ill i'll make rookie and do i spit on them no you can't do that you have to wear your masks subhanallah what about doing water and drinking from it oh that's a taboo what about in my religion it is part of my religion to all of us eat from the same plate oh this is totally out of the question social distancing you're gonna die in the millions what about using the swag and give it to someone else whoa that's gross man what is this so i can go on and on and on to show you that this is my religion now when you as a physician or a doctor start crossing things out which led us to seeing now muslims praying six feet apart in the masjid and not attending funerals yeah okay till when till this epidemic is gone what epidemic so it's covered 19. okay what about if covered 20 slash a slash b c appears this year what about if coffee 21 appears are we gonna dismantle our religion no umrah no hajj no nothing come on we need this collaboration and we need this clarity we can't be led by physicians in the absence of true real scholars taking the back bench and not being allowed to voice their opinion in this we do need this collaboration anyhow this is not our subject corey says how to know if a woman i want to propose to has good character now you have two ways corey either you opt for dating and this is un-islamic and it would not show you the truly reality of a woman and she cannot see your true nature couple of dates so this is out of the question for a muslim as a muslim you have limited resources and one unlimited resource so the limited resources are to investigate your mom your sister your aunt can ask those who know her at school her friends her family if she's a working woman her colleagues sh they ask they do their due diligence and they investigate and they come up with almost a perfect portrait of what this woman really is the unlimited source is trusting allah depending on him and relying on him totally so i did my due diligence i ask around everything is positive i praise the hara i ask allah azzawajal for permission to marry her and if there is any good in it that he the almighty would facilitate it for me that's it but to say that okay i need like three four months to talk to her to chit chat to impersonate someone she doesn't know on her social media and try to uh communicate with her so i see that if she's a straight girl or she fools around etc this is not done by muslims definitely so you have to abide by islamic sharia and all those i know in the muslim world and i'm one of them with the grace of allah i married my wife and we've been married now for almost 37 years 36 years who's counting and i didn't know her i didn't see her my mother and wife told me about her and they described her to me i asked around her family and they asked around about me i spoke to her father he gave me an appointment to visit i went alone to visit him i sat with him for like half an hour then he admitted his daughter in to sit with us she sat for another hour giving me and her the time to chit chat and to talk and to look at one another so that to know if there is chemistry or not alhamdulillah after that we've discovered that we have chemistry physics math geology and every single uh science that we have and it's still kicking like the energy hazard handling so this is like one example in my family in my relatives and the people i know we do not have what is known as love marriage when you go and date people and you fall in love and you marry afterwards these type of arranged marriages that follow the islamic rulings because in that initial interview if i did not like the way she looked or the way she talked i would have called it off and so would she but alhamdulillah it will it all went okay and this is the result so i hope this answers your question uh kuri fatima says after sneezing should we say alhamdulillah a bit loudly indoor in order to enable the person near to us to hear that meet and pray and reply this is up to you two men sneezed in the presence of the prophet one of them said alhamdulillah loudly the other did not say so the prophet replied to the one who said alhamdulillah loudly by saying allah have mercy on you so the other man objected so the prophet of allah you made dua to him but not to me and we all or we we both sneezed at the same time the prophet said i saw yes he sneezed and praised allah so i said you sneed sneezed and did not say alhamdulillah so i did not say it to you and we learned from the sunnah that if this man who did not say alhamdulillah was wrong or sinful the prophet would have corrected him at a salah but he didn't which means that it's your preference fatima if you want to gain reward yes you have to raise your voice and there is a lot of reward in it when you say alhamdulillah someone says [Music] this exchange of dua is highly praised and loved by allah but if you don't want to you just simply say within yourself nobody hears it this is permissible afrina says is this permissible to join in a combined group of male and female in on facebook whatsapp or any other social media or the girls should be only in girls group well to be in a group that involves participation from your side it's a step towards free mixing so it is not permissible not recommended at all if you're joining a group like a mailing group where you receive beneficial things without your participation without chit-chatting either private or publicly there's nothing wrong with that but to be in a group on facebook and you put your likes to what a man says and he knows that okay afrina is the one who gave me thumbs up and maybe directly directly messaging you about a hadith or about a sunnah or something like that this is not permissible and safest for you to be alone uh in a an old girls group can we say the atkar of the morning and after the sun rises the answer is yes the car of the morning begins straight after the break of dawn so even before fajr prayer you can say your afkar of fajr because the fajr has started now most people say it after the prayer itself so that they can hit two birds with one stone and this is done by saying that which includes that god of the prayer so instead of reciting ayatul kursi twice i recite it once instead of reciting the last three pulls once for the prayer and three times each for the fajr i just simply recite them three times each and this would include the ones of the prayer and so on if you fail to say the fajrev car until the sunrise rises or afterwards this is totally okay bearing in mind that you would not be protected from the break of dawn until you actually say it so you can delay it but you won't have the protection while when you say it as early as possible you will be protected insha'allah [Music] if a man marries a widow who got who has a daughter does the daughter becomes mahram if not how to interact the vast majority of muslims according to the ayah in surat and they say that the daughter of your wife is forever mahram for you she's your stepdaughter you can never ever marry her whether after divorcing her mother her mother dying or for any other reason she is immediately becoming your own wife after marriage so this is according to the ayah and surat so i won't go into details but this is the ruling some scholars say that the word waraba ibikum indicates that she's a young or small girl who grew up under your custody while if you marry someone who already has a daughter who's 22 years of age this is not a rabbiba and this was the opinion of a couple of the companions i think may allah be pleased with them but the vast majority of scholar of companions and the vast majority of scholars say that this is not the authentic opinion because generally speaking rabib is usually when a person marries a woman who has young daughter this is why allah described it as such but there can also be exceptions when someone marries someone who's old and has a grown-up daughter and she would yes not be considered to be aviva but she would take the same ruling of it being haram for him for life his second question is if a person is a potential threat is warning others permissible like the story of yahoo peace be upon him or it becomes backbiting i don't know about the story of yahoo what are you referring to [Music] but yes if there is a threat a potential threat from an individual and you know that someone else is going to be visiting or asking or whatever in this case yes you have to avoid uh you have to warn that person so for example if i know that a friend is learning from someone who's deviant someone who teaches innovation or shirk so i have to warn him and i got a question yesterday about this from a brother here saying that there is this convert who is impressed with a deviant super sufi in america who has an institute and he has a huge number of followers it goes to indonesia to malaysia and the sufis love him and he's an american individual but he is auntie salafia auntie tohit and he's someone devoted to sufism so i said yes you have to warn him but the problem is that you shouldn't warn people except if they are susceptible to your advice and would listen but if someone was sufi to the core and you come and try to give him an advice you say no no no you are someone who's envious you hate him because he's famous you're this i'm just giving you a word of advice this is the quran this is a sunnah this guy is taking you out of the path of the way of the prophet he says no no you you this your that in this case it's best not to get involved but if someone who trusts you like most of the people that follow me on twitter or on on my website they trust me they don't care what agenda i have because they know i don't have an agenda so they trust my judgment they trust my teachings so such people and they come and ask me i say yeah don't follow this person because he's out of the straight path and the way of the prophet isa they know that i have no beef with them i don't want money from him or from them so they trust what i say because they know i don't have any political agenda any economical agenda or any other agenda i have a few months maybe a few days maybe a few years left in my timeline and i'll be making meeting my makers alhamdulillah they trust me and i trust them but someone who is not like that you have to be careful najiba says my friend is always asking why muslim men marry four wives are females weak our superior than women why women can't marry four men at a time how can i answer her please answer me first of all it seems that your friend is not a muslim and because muslims simply don't ask such questions otherwise they might as well doubt the existence of allah they might as well doubt why was the prophet muhammad islam the messenger why wasn't it abu bakr or umar what kind of questions is this muslims don't ask such questions they have submission they have belief and conviction non-muslims on the other hand may ask and this is their right you can't sell the sell them something without them being convinced with it however the problem is not in selling the problem is not in the details the problem is in the fundamentals this religion was given to those who believe in it so those who do not believe in it may find a lot of questions islam tells us this is not the way to answer the questions so why is it men are not allowed to wear gold while women are why is it that music is haram why is it that women must cover while handsome men don't cover why is it that women can't travel without a mahram and women inherit half of what men inherit why is it that a man is obliged and supposed to provide for his wife and to give her shelter and food and clothes even if she's a multi-billionaire this is his obligation why would i have to do this these questions can be answered through logic some of it can't be answered through logic because this is an instruction of the one who created us so we have to comply and follow even if you don't see the legitimacy or the wisdom behind it but islam tells us no no no you're not allowed to you're not supposed to answer these questions then what to do go back to the fundamentals these are all trivial issues small issues let's go to the core of the problem all people of the book jews and christians come to a common term between us and you that we do not worship other than allah and we do not associate others with him so the first thing to do is to call such a friend najib to islam by talking to her does allah exist or not usually christians will say of course he's the creator he's this is that so many things in common then we come to the quran do you believe in the final and divine scriptures no no we have our bible we have our new testament so what do you follow king's james version or the douay virgin for the catholic or the standard revised version or what kind of virgin you i see a lot of bibles and they're different from one another in the quran we have one virgin 15 centuries ago the same quran did not change a single letter spoken by more than 400 million arabs who know how to read and understand what's in it and it's preserved nothing's changed so you call her to islam at least to reach a level where she says yes i believe this i believe this i believe this then afterwards things would come out naturally but hypothetically speaking this might take a lot of time to answer her questions she says why can muslim men marry for and not women marrying four men well this was the norm since allah created adam and eve that men can marry more than one woman if a man marries three women and they conceive we know who the mother is she's the pregnant one and we know who the father is he's the husband but if a woman marries three men and she conceives we know who the mother is but who can tell which one is the father this is not possible therefore this is how allah made men and women men die faster than women and this is why we always have this sort of imbalance between the number of females versus males and this is why it is easier and more logical for a man to get married to two or three in order to compensate the losses of men on earth either due to wars accidents to high blood pressure to heart attacks to diabetes which proves the point that women usually are better assassins than men they kill men much easier and we can see the results and as far as the superiority of men over women this is something that muslims believe in worldly matters not in religious matters so at the side of allah at the sight of allah they're equal men and women but on earth men are superior than women in so many fields and men women can be superior to men in other fields but in generally speaking yes men are more superior and allah azzawajal knows best and this brings us to the end of today's or this month's q a i hope it was beneficial and we hope to see you with the grace of allah azzawajal next monday which is in two days from today in our weekly uh regular sessions until then i leave foreign"
