  "transcript": "if a non maharam female gives salam is it haram to reply or maku if there is no mahram of mine or her around and my other question is al-nawawi in his book of atkar said that it is makru for man to reply so if i believe it is not mathura it is a sin if i reject his opinion it's uh if you're gonna take me out of out of the world of islam and now so rejecting what he said would not be committing kufur because he's a great scholar of islam and he was opposed by many other scholars so rejecting his opinion is taking the other scholars opinion and that would not be kufur so get the issue of kufr out of the way if a man or a woman gives salam to the opposite gender and there is no fitna there's no problem in returning and replying i'm saying but if there is a fitna if you're alone in seclusion and this bombshell comes in and she says and you look at them what the heck and you say keep your salam to yourself and leave this is shaytan setting you for a trap and allah knows best"
