  "title": "Will a muslim who committed suicide be in hell forever? Can we make dua for him? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh question number one it is from afrina Tony she says salaam alaikum is this allowed to pray for anyone who commits suicide so if a Muslim killed himself can we ask Allah for forgiveness for him well we know that whoever kills himself he is Bound To Hell Fire and the scholars disputed upon his fate some said that he will abide he will go to Hell Fire forever and some said which is the most authentic opinion is that he is destined to go to hell but at the end of the day it is Allah's Divine will so whatever Allah Wales will happen to him because he did not commit shirk he did not associate others with Allah he was not a kafir he did not in an infidel so if Allah wishes if Allah wills it he can forgive all of his sins and admits him to Jannah or let him spend and do time in hell until he's purified and then admitted to Jannah in the Sunnah whenever the prophet Islam was present presented a corpse that the person killed himself so that he would offer janaza prayer the funeral prayer the prophet would refrain from praying on it and he would say you pray upon your brother so he made a person who killed himself a brother he did not make him a kafir and he ordered the Muslims to pray but not him and him not praying illustrates that the gravity of that man's sin and that the prophet as the Muslim ruler and leader cannot offer Salat upon him but it is an obligation upon the others so yes you can ask Allah for forgiveness for a person who had killed himself and you can make Dua for him as well"
