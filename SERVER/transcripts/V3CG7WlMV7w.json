  "transcript": "alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD heosu amin nabina muhammad en voila re he wasabi woman Teddy honey he was television lady he nao Medini ammiraju assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the world we live in is changing in a very fast-paced and it is also demanding that we as muslims change to co-op with the changes happening around us however as muslims everything has to go through the quran and sunnah so that we can relate is it permissible or not this is why we are muslims we submit our our will to allah azza wajal so the question would be is change positive or is it negative those who say that change is positive raise your hands please ok masha'Allah masha'Allah they all want to change from fasting into breaking the fast good ok those who say that change is negative raise your hands ok very few well none of you both are correct because change can be positive and it can be negative depending see when you look at the message of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet was sent so that allah azzawajal would take the people from darkness into the light through our prophet allah masala wa suleman optical rosalie gonna be in a muhammad so he brought change to the whole world but did he change everything no the Prophet said himself sallallahu Sam I have only been sent to perfect good characteristics meaning that before he came the Arabs were generous were truthful were kind we're happy were courageous they had so many good things in them it's not did not come and changed this on the contrary it reinforced it so the Prophet did not change everything so Allah who are you salem however change can be positive in a long hadith you all know about the person who killed 99 people and went to a worshipper and he asked him i've killed 99 people can i repent to allah and the man said do you crazy you kill 99 you want to repent there's no repentance for you so they said 99 let me finish a hundred so I have three figures so he killed him and after a while he felt remorseful he asked about the most knowledgeable person on earth they told him this scholar is so he went to him and the scholar told him of course who prevents you when who stays between you and repentance however you are residing in an evil village and you must change your environment so go to that village where there are righteous people worship allah azzawajal with them and Allah will accept your repentance so the change here was negative or positive was definitely positive therefore it can be positive but it also can be negative if someone says okay I've tried to become a Muslim for forty years and didn't work so I'm thinking of changing into Christianity it's okay change is good it's positive it's not positive the Prophet said that ISM whoever changes his religion kill him and the killing is not for us as individuals huh don't go to your office tomorrow hey what are you Muslim a kafir and with trigger-happy a finger no there's the killing the execution is only to be done by the imam by the ruler not the imam of the masjid it's even worse no the imam meant is the ruler the muslim legitimate ruler so the prophet told us that this change is unacceptable even change on small scale that people consider to be small but it is great at the side of allah the prophet said alayhi salatu some whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected so any innovation Allah does not accept and it is rejected and we have tons of innovations in the Muslim world in my Masjid where I pray there is a brother whenever he finishes a surah he puts his head his hand over his head and who are you afraid of flying because of so much Amman that you'll be elevated what are you doing some of the brothers kiss their thumbs when they hit and then and they rub their eyes three times when they hear the salat on the Prophet awesome what are you doing they said whoever does this would not be would not have trachoma and he would no never go blind come on we will close all the hospitals then and and and I doctors with this is if it was true or authentic I would be the first to do it who doesn't love to do something that is beneficial but when it is innovation when it is something that is not in accordance to the Sunnah of our prophet Isis around how can we in no how can we invent how can we introduce something and unfortunately those who are facing and practicing innovation they are far away from Allah's repentance Allah would not repent to them the Prophet said allah so salam allah has blocked repentance from everyone who's an innovator who is the owner of the buddha why what would you depend from if you think that you are doing the right thing yeah this is with our nose it's not better it's right now he repent why should i repent you should repent so this is a big a big problem when you think that change is positive and it is negative and therefore one should always ask allah azza wajal not to change the good things because good things when they change they change into bad and this is why we always supplicate to Allah and this supplication was frequently said by the prophet alayhi salatu salam more than anything else the Prophet would not make dua more than saying llamo callable elope that bit he'll be al Edenic or turner's of heart make my heart steadfast on your religion because if it changes then it changes to innovation it changes to another religion so the 1 million dinar question would be how would we know that if this change is positive positive or negative the answer is very simple the criteria that we judge things by is or an and Sunnah and we frequently repeat this brothers and sisters we always emphasize or and and soon because with the Koran alone this is not enough aji it's a perfect book Allah read it yes Allah revealed it I believe in it and I embrace it and I love it more than I love my children however if it was sufficient by itself Allah would have revealed it without the need of Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam but Allah did not do so because the prophet alayhi salatu salam is the role model number one the prophet aerosol option is the best one to understand what allah azzawajal wanted from us from this book and he explained it to us through his deeds and teachings those who claim to be a Quran 'yes they don't believe in the sunnah magrib three raka raka raka where is it in the Quran the 2.5% of zakat where is it in the Quran to marry a woman and her aunt is prohibited in Islam you cannot marry a woman and her aunt at the same time where is it in the Quran if we want to talk about the rituals of Hajj if you want to talk about fasting so many things of restricted things in fasting they are not mentioned the Quran Quran mentions three things eating drinking and sexual intercourse other than that is not mentioned the copying the the masturbation things that take over or take the place of eating such as nutrition and nutritious injections etc all of this is not mentioned the Quran but the Sunnah indicated to it so without the Sunnah we cannot understand the Quran and we would not be proper Muslims so change is not positive and it's not negative its dependent and that is why allah azza wajal blamed and criticized those who were stagnant those who refused changing so it's not always best to be steadfast on drawn it's best to be steadfast on truth but if you're not on the you must change otherwise you will be blamed by allah azza wajal allah says in the quran and similarly we sent not a warner before you o muhammad sallallahu wasallam to any town but the luxurious ones among them said we found our fathers following a certain way and religion and we will indeed follow their footsteps do you hear this quite often when you go back to your countries it's a blessing from Allah that he brought you to this land because he you learned the proper ikeda here you learnt about the Quran and about following the sunnah when you go back to your countries and you try to change the misconceptions the wrong worshipping of allah azza wajal that the people have introduced the culture of peers and awliya and shake what do the people say we have found our forefathers on this religion and we will follow them actually they are taking you to help we will go with them all the way so this is a negative attitude change here is required and it is a must so now we know change can be positive can be negative how can we determine by channeling it through the Quran and Sunnah once we know and this requires continuous audit you know what the auditors do you have to continuously audit your house how you treat your wife how you treat your children how you treat your colleagues is it in accordance to the parents in LA no change it is it in accordance to the Quran Sunnah yes masha'Allah keep on the good work and in order for Muslims to change themselves to the better they have to start individually so many times you sit with youngsters with brothers and they say I think we have to change this country is not ruling by Allah's rule we have to do this look at the countries around us okay Annie you are climbing a 100 step ladder from step 9 and 99 and 100 you cannot you cannot walk until you crawl and you cannot run until you walk so begin by the basics that Islam tells you Islam does not tell you change the top the rulers the government the army Islam tells you change yourself look at yourself in the mirror in Maya proper Muslim no but they do this they do that is none of your business are you doing what Allah is telling you to do no but don't but Victoria Queen victory is to say but me no buts and you don't say but to Hollis give me a statement without any exceptions so if we managed to practice Islam through the Quran and Sunnah we will rule the whole world but we have to begin individually each one of us must be his best critic we have to criticize ourselves by ourselves and try to evolve not as Darwin says we were monkeys now we're humans tomorrow we're gonna be monkeys again no this is not the evolution we're talking about Islam is modern religion it incorporates everything it does not conflict with science someone says ok I have a new watch that is synchronized with my mobile I want to build up better take it off and give it to me now this is this this is not the way of doing it what are you doing this Islam say anything bad about this in the Quran and Sunnah no keep on the good work so Islam involves and accepts everything as long as the Quran and Sunnah are you or compass that tells you halal or Haram if we manage to do this if we manage to abide by the Koran and listen and avoid innovation wallahi by incorporating the moral conduct of our prophet eyes on his o'clock we will win the whole world with the grace of Allah so John now change cannot happen unless we change ourselves crystal-clear eye in navaja now yo-yo ma bi qawmin hatta yo-yo maybe emphysema allah says verily Allah will not change the good condition of a people as long as they do not change their state of goodness themselves by committing sins etc so this is your role as an individual when you see the different calamities worldwide what can you do jihad yeah yes you had but jihad has ways and steps and means and different meanings to what people think people think that jihad is only colors and I've committed jihad blow yourself up this is jihad no jihad can be jihad against Satan and this is one of the greatest jihad because Satan runs in our blood veins jihad against your own self jihad against the sinners among the Muslims we have to make jihad not killing them but giving him that were helping them to quit since this is jihad jihad against the hypocrites who claim to be Muslim but they are undermining all Islamic activities and they're siding by the enemies how do we make jihad with the mana 15 with the Quran Allah says with your hidden behavior you give them jihad by distict exposing them by writing articles against them showing people that they are not sincere and finally jihad against the kuffar the disbelievers all of these are types of jihad so how can we as individual contribute to what's happening because usually as an individual I am frustrated I am depressed I see my brothers and sisters being slain being slaughtered being killed being raped being thrown out of their country and I have no say in it so I feel frustrated and I say I can't do anything no a fee I'll give you the glad tidings you can make a difference with the grace of Allah not by your own strength never fall under the assumption that I can make a difference on my own no you can't without the help of Allah none of us can and so many times in corporates and in big companies when the CEO or the head of departments make a presentation they say and the first quarter I managed to secure three 0.5% increase in revenue and this that and I managed to do fulfil the targets of my department and I subhanAllah this is minor this is minor why because you're attributing something that is not yours to other than Allah solution abdullah grab a smell or appease with him said that if you have a house and your neighbours has a duck you know the bird or a dog and a burglar wanted to break into your home and steal so the duck quack I don't know what that sounds of what maybe and and that the dog at the dog barked so the burglar was frightened and he left if you say whom Dilla had the dog not barked the burglar would have stolen my goods and my house if even a bat says whoever says this he has mitad silk because it was not the dog it was not the duck it was a large grace upon you so you have to attribute this to a larger so when I say you can make a difference not individually but with the grace of Allah with the help of allah azzawajal look at someone who was a fierce enemy of Islam do you know Holly the mill elite everyone knows highly the mill worried he's the sword of allah azza wajal he was the main reason after behind the Battle of hood and the people who would died in it because he strategy strategically came behind the mountain you know what he had done he accepted Islam on the eighth year of hijra or on the same year the Prophet aerosol of Sturm sent a small expedition a small army of 3000 and he appointed three strong and good companions to need them and he made erasers on the first thing that we call in HR Human Resources we call it succession planning the Prophet did that a lot of companies don't have this so he said Jaffer's a ABI talib is to head the army if anything happens to him then Zeta bethabeth if anything happens to him then I'm the lobner ilaha and when the army went to meet the Byzantine army which was two hundred thousand three thousand meeting two hundred thousand subhanAllah so they went and fought the first leader died the first lead the second leader the third leader died the Muslims did not know what to do so they said choose one of you and who was there they was had it so they selected hearted to lead them who just embraced Islam few months ago and if you tell him recite Fatiha maybe maybe not but he did not have knowledge highly dependent worried at the end of his life may Allah be pleased with him used to hold the the Quran dearly to his heart and say well I nothing took me away from you except jihad meaning that I could not read you and learn you and devote my time to you so though I love you except because I was engaged in Jihad and this was in the cause of Allah a soldier so he came he made certain changes in the the army very strategic at nighttime he shifted the right wing to the left and the left to the wing in the middle to the rear and the rear to the middle so that when it was morning time the enemy army saw this and said oh they have reinforcements these are new faces new flags these are not the one we were fighting with yesterday who gave us help so these reinforcements they are going to give us more help and he ordered them before hogr to say Allahu Akbar and make noise and make dust as if that army is coming once the enemy army saw this they retreated two hundred thousand they treated chickens they were afraid so they went back and Allah george'll saved the whole army by one man had it Edmund worried the Prophet was on the pulpit and the member when this was happening so about 800 kilometers away and he said by revelation the enemy of Allah Azza WA JAL attacked the Muslim army Jaffa and Abu Talib died Zaidan Assad as a horrific died and Abdullah Aroha died and then he paused and the Muslims were terrified what is happening to our brothers and and colleagues and friends and companions then he said then they'll flag was given by Allah to a sword of his swords and Allah Azza WA JAL made them a victorious so one man can make a difference not only that we're before if par I'm not going to give you something technical let's go into storytelling question have you ever heard of the name of no I mean in Massoud raise your hand please one I'm gonna ask you tonight we have presents we have we have present from KRT artifice do we have the presents from oh I see koc yesterday we brought us four or five boxes so we can oh okay Hellas right no I mean even Masood who is he yes okay okay yes ah he okay huh yes good okay the brother said it almost correctly but he said he was a Jew he was in the Jew he's from a fan so it was on the fifth year of hijra after Benny and nobody they did what they did so their leader went to Bnei Akiva the jewel tribe and said what are you doing you have to collaborate with the idol worshippers so we can attack Muhammad and he refused and he kept insisting until he accepted so what happened was the tribe of haka fan with the idol worshippers in Quraysh the mushrikeen and the fortresses of the tribe of Binaca Reza collaborated and surrounded Medina 10,000 men armed fully equipped against 3000 Muslims in Medina for a whole month not one day not one week one whole month surrounding them and only skirmishes were there not real fighting because they had dug this trench no I was a man a Playboy he was a mushrik and where would he spend his red nights in Banja Kariba there the Jews that you women and the Jew wine he would go there spend money spend good time enjoy himself and go back so Allah willed it that he on the last period of this month embraced Islam so he came to the Prophet irresolution at night and he said prophet of allah la ilaha illa allah wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh Oh prophet of Allah instruct me order me I will do whatever you say so the Prophet Eraser Sam with all positivity that we lack we're negative if someone comes to you and say this what do you say do you have a million euro do you have guns do you have be done there's no point of you being with us the Prophet said as Salaam you are a single man and war is deceit khuda Danny you are entitled in war to come off large to lie so that you would fool the enemy but you are not allowed to break any promises or any purchase this is totally prohibited but lying yes it is hella imagine me in the radio saying about man we are going east inshallah and I know that the enemy army is listening and they will wait for us in the east so you have to and you're entitled to do this so the Prophet told him try to turn them away from us no I in Lebanon masud may allah be pleased with him went to the jews and they received him and they hosted him said yes do you want the usual and said no no not not tonight today i come to you with an advice do you know that i love you of course we've been so many years together we have so many many memories together so I said okay I am afraid for you because the mushriks from Quraysh and the people from rata fine they have their children their wealth and their women in their homes so whenever they feel tired they will leave and go back to their homes while you on the other hand will be stranded here fighting Muhammad on your own and you will lose your wealth your children your wives and I am afraid that it will come a time that they will leave you so I advise you that take guarantees from them they people these people can change their mind any time so I advise you to ask them for seventy of their dignitaries as guests you host them you give them wine you give them pleasure you give them whatever just as a guarantee and they said to him online you are giving us a very sound idea so masala mamasan he went to Krrish and he said to the dignitaries of Quraish do you think that I would betray you said no you are a good friend and a good Ally we've known you so many years he said I heard something that disturbed me while I was moving I heard that the Jews felt afraid after one month of siege of Medina and they sent to Muhammad sallallaahu Salim telling him that listen we will collaborate with you against the people of Quraysh and the people of what a fan how about if we give you seventy of their dignitaries where you can execute them and we will fight with you against them so the Prophet said yes no I'm is making up the story was he sought permission to lie and I am giving you a friendly warning if they ask you for this don't accept because this is what they are going to do go to them and tell them come and fight today and he went to his tribe got a fan and there are his people and he said exactly the same thing so the following morning it was a Saturday the army the enemy army went to Bannock arena and said come let's go and fight we've been staying here for one month it's consuming our resources and finance come and fight with us the Jews said today is the Sabbath we don't work in the Sabbath and even if it wasn't the Sabbath we would like to have 70 of your dignitaries coming and being hosted by us so that would be a guarantee for us that nothing wrong would happen the the mushriks and a lot of fun tribes said this is what Narain said to us they are trying to make a trap for us they said no you have to come and fight with us now without giving you any of our men the Jews said this is exactly what no I'm said no we're not going to fight with you so they went back to their tribes and they Jews were left behind alone and you know the hadith no one should pray us except in Benny or Eva and how the Prophet re salatu salam executed all of their men due to the treason they caused and the breach of the covenant they had with the Prophet eraser of salaam this is the handicraft this is the work of how many men one single man who made the difference who made the whole Islamic Ummah survived a brutal attack which would have taken place it would have annihilated Islam and the Muslims one man so mama even though I felt who knows this man Wow yeah that's why I'm making it difficult I'm raising the bar I'm making up names now I'm inventing names nobody knows who mama I fell Wow mashallah is far away I need binoculars ah he sent very good masha'Allah so mama he deserves one yes yes Allah take care see no need for receipt colossal distributing okay so manna was the head of Benny Hanifa it's a tribe in the middle of Arabia he was an enemy of Islam but he was a leader and by chance the Muslims managed to capture him and arrest him so they brought him to the Prophet of Islam it's a big catch it's a big fish nice huh moon big so the Prophet ordered them to tie him to one of the pillars of the Masjid and which means that a character can enter a masjid and a kafir can enter medina unlike mecca there are so many benefits from this hadeeth but it is not the time for him so for three days the Prophet used to come to him marisa-san and he says to mama what have you got he says fair I have good Oh Muhammad if you want money ask whatever you want and if you want to kill me then be careful because people would come and seek my blood meaning they will fight you and if you want to forgive me and set me free you will find me thankful and grateful so three choices and the man is captured journey you should beg but no he is defiant so the following day the Prophet says of her mama what have you got the same thing we talk a lot the prophet has sent speaks three words for a whole day and then comes and so mom did not say the same and added the same thing you want money we give you you want to forgive you will find me thankful you kill me people will come and avenge it me the third day he said the same thing the Prophet said untie him they untied him he went out of the Masjid may Dawson came to the Prophet eyes and a shadow a la ilaha illa-llah horses Mohammad also this is the Dawa the hour by action he saw the Muslims he saw how they pray then he saw how they deal with one another and that is what affected him most then he said o prophet of allah by allah there was no face on earth more hated to my heart than your face now it is the most beloved face on earth there was no city so abhorred and hated to my heart than your city now your city medina is the most beloved order me and i shall do whatever you say are a sorcerer and then the prophet praised prayed for him and made dua for him and he said o prophet of allah your soldiers captured me while I was going for ombres he is a mushrik so he's going for Imran has like almost reeks so can I go for Imran now as a Muslim said yes go so he went for Imran and in Umbra Abu jahil came who is this making Tawaf at the midday not like we do by rubbing the idols in he's doing tow off strangely like Muslims who's this and he identified himself and when this problem took place he as a well i mixed a story of sodom wife with this not edit listen in the video I'm joking no it did not go for a home run that was sudden Mahad may Allah be pleased with him who had this coupled with Omaha and Abu jahil know some elaborate on being the tribesman the leader of Abu Hanifa of many hanifa he said o prophet of allah i will cut their supply of wheat of grain and nothing shall reach them until you approve it so he did so and this is economical embargo or or or by cutting not a single piece of grain reached makkah until they starved so they went to the prophet elisha son though he was their enemy begged him and reminded him of their kinship and their relations to them that he may intercede and he sent to tamama let the food come to them and he did one man makes a difference therefore you can make a difference providing that you are contributing with the spirit of the team if you are a team player you can go places and you can take a slaw with you to high levels providing that you are obedient to allah azzawajal it is it does not matter whether you're a leader or a follower the Muslims nowadays they're all leaders you know the Red Indians they have a saying in America said all chiefs no Indians all chiefs you know the big Chiefs that the leaders that make but there are no Red Indians know all officers no soldiers how can you communicate so it doesn't matter where you are at the top of the pyramid or at the lowest part of it as long as you are intending to serve Allah you are intending to serve Islam then you have got it made the Prophet said in sahih bukhari sallallahu ariados mmm pull back this big huge tree in Paradise is for a servant of Allah who takes his horse in the cause of Allah in Jihad if they appoint him in the security meaning that he's a guard he's in the guard and if they appoint him at the end of the army with a surah and a sapper they usually follow the army and pick whatever is falling down from them and they cater for anyone who's lost or who's weak and help them so the Prophet is saying Poobah for these people the people in the guarding position the it's dangerous when you're attacking an army because if they are at the very beginning and the people at the end of the army are in a very dangerous position if they are going back to their homes because anyone who's following to attack would come from behind so it doesn't matter if you're a leader or you're a follower as long as you're working for the sake of allah azza wajal I came to deliver these talks and with the grace of allah azzawajal it would not have been possible if the brother who drove me from the airport to the hotel and to here was not there I would not have given any lecture so the brother who drove me gets you word the Prophet the brother who communicated with me the brother who's filming it the brother who's sending us a mess all of these are working for the sake of Allah and they get the same reward as I am giving with so little even the Hoopoe you know the bird or the Hoopoe they call him hood hood one bird soul a man was checking his soldiers and this bird came and was the reason for an entire Ummah the Ummah of Saba to accept Islam from one single bird so you can make a difference if you try your level best a woman can make a difference if she focuses on what pleases Allah imagine if you have three or four children and you invest your time and effort on them in making them Imams of Islam how did Imam Ahmed become an imam through his mother do you know the story of imam bukhari his father died when he was a very young child his mother took care of him by the age of ten he memorized the whole Quran by the age of eleven he devoted himself for health of hadith when he was 13 he used to sit in the Masjid and the imam is giving hadeeth and he would stop and say imam this is wrong the imam would scold him are you crazy you're a kid said go and check your books I'm not playing then I'm going to check his books bring the books back it says what was it again and he corrects his books according to the 13 year old who made this man be the a man he was his mother who took him with his brother to Makkah for Hajj and left him there where he went and heard from all the great scholars of Islam and traveled and came to become Albahari if you have this intention for your child Hanuman you are in the greatest form of jihad if you manage to give your husband a house where he finds his comfort and peace of mind this gives him energy to go tomorrow to work and to be productive in the community but if he lives all these troubles outside of the home and enters her home and finds a nagging wife a complaining wife a demanding wife your mother did this your father did that your sister called me and she was trying to make me angry subhanAllah I'm fighting on all fronts you can give down with your sister's neighbor a woman can give downward to her cousins to her sisters to her family to her neighbors she can be productive if she wants to do so you can make a difference even you as a student even you as a pupil in your school when you give that word to all other students not necessarily that they will listen to you but at least you are pleasing Allah but by doing what Allah ordered you to do a teacher can give Dawa to his class by giving them the best example and being a role model never lies never cheats never discriminates never looks down at his pupil they will love him one lie until 20 or 30 years from knowing him this is very shocking I taught English as a foreign language for 15 years in high school public high school and I was teaching Saudis and you can imagine how horrible that is they don't know a thing of English and you have to teach them in high school so 15 years at hand Allah Allah and he blessed me to teach and that was 15 years ago so it's almost 30 years and until today I get phone calls I get messages on Facebook I get comments from people on like I don't know saying the sad awesome teacher awesome used to this he was the greatest teacher he was the greatest friend he was the greatest mothers of my teachers called me after 20 years they're having problems with their husbands and I may give counseling to them okay you can be a Muslim whatever you want if you're an engineer if you're a teacher if you're a doctor in your clinic imagine a doctor physician every time before he begins he says bismillah al-rahman al-rahim and he sees something masha'Allah alhamdulillah well I he even if he's a kafir in front of you he would be intrigued what is he saying he would be affected positively so you can make a difference as long as you put the effort because the effort will not come to you you have to put the effort you remember we began our story with the person who killed the one hundred Souls when he told him leave your village and go to that righteous village he went and a large there was a will did that in the middle death came to him it was time for him to die now if I was in his place I went and I migrated hollis Allah is forgiving me so I shouldn't worry the hadith says when he felt that he was dying he went with his chest like this you know the 100 sprint runners would they come to the line what do they do they do this so that they can at least get some distance more than the others this is what them the murderer did even really recognizing and realizing that he's dying he just wanted to prove that I am fully 100% for repentance and going to that village the angels of mercy descended and the angels of torment and Punishment each claiming his soul and they disputed and a large Dajjal sent an angel in the form of a human being of course they know that he's an angel but Allah wanted to honor humans by sending him in the form of a human being to judge between them to arbitrate between them so he told them measured the distance between both villages to whom ever he is to which ever he is closer he should be taken - so if he was closer to the evil village the angels of torment would take him if he is closer to the good village the angels of mercy would take him so they started measuring and a las marias above everything Allah told the evil village go away and he told the good village come closer so they measured and if on him closer to the good village and the angels of mercy took this man who had killed 100 souls and never did a good deed in his life so I make the effort and you will be able to make a difference this happens actually in many Muslim countries what do you know Indians this is the problem that everyone is proud of his own opinion and unfortunately when you go to Muslim communities outside in Europe or the kafir' are making fun of us you bring us one who represents you we don't have one you have different factions different cults different section even upon the Eielson l-jamaa even upon the Salafis you have factions and they would not agree and this is a big problem there is a big picture and there is a small picture so in Sri Lanka or elsewhere they have to have a majority a community of Muslims and whatever the leaders of this community say you follow so dia is not the thing to be followed by Americans by Europeans by East Asians because each country each region has its own sighting this was proven at the time of the Prophet also Salam and at the time of the Companions as in the idea of kryb and in Abbas and its Muslim morale Yahoo was the leader in a sham fasted it differently to even a bass who was a follower and a subordinate to a sham in Medina and he told them that this is a Sunnah each has a different sighting moon sighting so the brothers in Sri Lanka and India and wherever the community the largest community they should follow them house whether they do it by sighting whether they do it by calculation so that the word of the Muslims are together and this is why in the fake books it states that if a person sees the moon individually and he goes and tells the community the judge I have seen the moon and they reject his destiny some say he should fast on his own even taenia says no he should not fast he should be with the majority because it's tell al al Kummer meaning that everybody has seen it so if no one had seen it and no one is fasting the Prophet said the fasting is the day you all fast and what filter oakum and the day you celebrate a the Fatah is when you all celebrate not me and you only so we have to be with the majority we have to be with the community and a large no journalist first of all it's an issue of dispute among the four schools of thought and the basis it's always good to know the evidence however when I answer questions usually I don't give the evidence because this requires a lecture even when people ask me questions on my website I said yes or no said can we have evidences that go to a slump you na i I cannot afford it ty I don't have time but I'll give you time now because I'm waiting for a start well where will I go so what is the ruling on growing the beat wallahi if it is was not mandatory I would have shaved it today do you think I would like to be and he looked at people who know me speed is not tidy it's white and black I'd like to be like everybody else yeah I'll shave it off and be like everyone else but I can't because the Quran and the Sunnah proved to us that it is mandated first of all the consensus of all schools of thought the four schools of thought of Abu Hanifah Malik Jeffrey and Hamilton humble they say that shaving it is prohibited so this is clear the four schools of thought they have consensus they all agree that shaving it is totally prohibited and they differ in the issue of cutting it short there are two prominent opinions one is that you should not touch it at all why because the Prophet erase salatu salam hadith stated that or who acronym as Baloo powerful powerful all stating in an order verb to leave it whether you have one beard like the brothers from China one one hair long hair nothing else this is Allah's creation keep it as it is all you have a thick beard like the Prophet did it was so thick sallallahu Arya Selim's beard to the extent that the court that the tab' ring asked the Companions how do you know that the Prophet used to recite the Quran in the hora NASA silent raka they said from behind his back we used to see his beard trembling now if you have this short build yeah you're not not white even if you whatever you cannot see it but when it's thick in width then you can tell from behind that when someone's jaws are moving that he's speaking so this is the opinion even if I mean ambass that you should not touch it just leave it as it is with the exception if it is extremely long it becomes a hurdle and harmful so sometimes your beard goes this long and this is killing you if you want to eat because whenever you eat it comes in if you're riding a motorbike it comes in your face and absol and you make a crash so in this case seriously if it's harmful to this extent then you may be able to remove what is harmful so that it would not hinder your life the second opinion based their allegation on the hadith of Allah may Allah be pleased with him and si Bihari that whenever he performed Hajj he used to take his fist his beard with a fist and whatever exceeds it he cuts it short and he interpreted the verse in Surat al-fatiha that whole internal Masjid al-haram insha Allah who held a 1000 Sakuma Moses Aaron Allah says that you will enter the Masjid of Makkah with the grace of Allah so gel shaving your heads and cutting short the ayah refers to cutting short of your head if you don't shave after Homer or Hajj what do you do you cut short so he understood it to be shaving your head and cutting your beard only in hatch and this is his in the Sun dur standing we cannot follow his understanding because we have the main stream line of the Companions understanding and the sayings of the Prophet are a solution so to me if someone cuts short what exceeds the fist I have no problem with that because it's an any an accepted opinion the problem is with the people who cut the upper side of the fist rather than the lower side this is definitely not correct and Allah knows best in 1990 I enlisted in the voluntary army of Saudi Arabia to defend Kuwait so during the training of shooting I had a hundred and twenty percent more ability to hear things that people don't hear due to my sensitivity of my ear my right ear has gone so I can barely hear except from the left and that's why I always come close so definitely I cannot read your lips sorry [Music] [Music] okay I answered your question I was a fun I think you all heard it mashallah none of you contributed in the Gulf War first got anyhow ah hey the sky is the limit and we have a saying in Arabic al Hodja whom will FDR when you have a need to do something this need is your driver to innovate so at the moment I cannot give you answers for your problems this depends from person to the other but what I can advise you off is always be positive and I emphasize on this through my talk we have the feeling of being depressed feeling being frustrated and this is negative because it takes you back know always be positive proactive so now you don't put a problem and say what can I do I cannot do this I cannot do this I cannot do this so simply you're saying I cannot do anything no you can now honoring and helping your brothers in Burma how can this happen we heard a month ago about what happened to them on the shores of Thailand Malaysia and Indonesia and I wrote in my facebook saying that this is a shame it's a shame about upon even at a businessman because imagine if I were a big businessman of wealthy businessman a rich businessman I wouldn't be here force but if this would have happened and I had the resources and the connections couldn't I go to Malaysia and meet my business counterparts and my Indonesian counterparts and throw a party in a five star or seven star hotel invest money in it call them in and say ok we are going to China to invest because of the cheap labor we have zero cost labor we will train them we will house them we will give them a dignified life we will talk to the Malaysian government they have vast lands we will talk to the Thai government we will talk to the deletion government give us land we will give them Institute's we will invest money and we will make them our labors skilled we will train them can we do this yes but where is this rich businessman I'm not the businessman so I can give you solutions you can work hard on exposing what's happening to them through your website make a website there he will go on the Facebook try to write articles and distribute it to everywhere make a think-tank from your connections and when you have targets you set your strategies you have a mission and vision everything is facilitated afterwards but to put obstacles we are extremely good in that we know even for a part I see how are these people are going to sit in the F star is the dates enough yeah I take five days he takes seven days what about the Sherpa it will fall in no F part let's go home so we should not put obstacles be positive always try to innovate be creative and insha'Allah when you put the effort you can make the difference with the grace of Allah the brother is asking what is the ruling the correct ruling on the hijab and then he ARB of course is asking about the sisters and the men okay it's a difference of opinion and I personally believe firmly that a woman must cover her face and this is backed by the variances from the Quran and the evidences from the prophetic hadith and this is not the time but I think there is unavailable on my youtube channel there was a debate three years ago between sheikh osama's the hobby of greenland masjid and myself in the masjid it was on video and it's enlightening yeah you can get some formation and knowledge of it my Shara a heaven is impaired on a Sunnah are debatable I'm not going to use that but they are so strong if I were to tell you you will be convinced but logically okay when you want to propose to a woman and you ask about her beauty even if they tell you she has the figure of Miss Universe if she has the face of a monkey you will not marry her and this is why the Prophet that Islam ordered the Hobby the companion when he told him I proposed to this woman he said did you look into her face said no and this is another example if they were used to walk uncovered he would have seen her in the street no need to look at her the Prophet said go and look at her the unsub has something in their eyes so looking at the face that the face is the the place of beauty so the woman when she smiles the whole world lights up and when it she has you know frowns on her face or she's crying everything goes dark so imagine you're driving in the car at the traffic light you look to the left and this woman is laughing her head off with her husband over the brother and she's looking at you she loved me definitely because everyone her face but if she was veiled she could love her head off no problem so I believe that the face is the most important thing to be covered because all the fitna is in the face of Allah knows best it's an issue of dispute huh don't get me wrong I'm not fair oh now every woman who uncovers her face we have to throw her with a shoe like they threw the Houthi in the press conference no this is a respected opinion of scholars but this doesn't mean it's the right opinion and we cannot have the option of cherry-picking you know you just say I like this yeah but this I like this no you have to follow the Quran and Allah knows"
