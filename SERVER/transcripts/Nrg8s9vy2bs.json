  "transcript": "so if a person doesn't do an obligatory act of worship due to fear of showing off will this will this be considered to be riya that is my initial this is riya if you stop this is what the scholars say if you stop doing something for the sake of people which is a form of worship this is riya if you do it for their sake this is shirk so this is a little bit tricky when we explain it but you have to take it as it is if i want to pray and because there are people watching i stopped praying did i please allah azzawajal no did i please them so that i would not make them think of me this or that yes so then this is showing off whether by doing or by not doing but if i were to pray only to please them i'm not praying for the sake of allah i'm praying for this sake this is shirk and allah knows best you"
