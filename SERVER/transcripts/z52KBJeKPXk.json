  "transcript": "is easy to sew on how duendes end this scholars say that we understand it that these four or five or six took it straight from the Prophet smell that is lobster weather so far they took it from a companion from the Prophet is optional so they were the Masters of recitations and others all recited it correctly but not directly from the profit from each other so Roma after the Battle of your mama went over Booker he said Abu Bakr 70 of our habit died and I'm afraid that people would confuse Quran and it will not be preserved and this is the essence of our religion so we have to preserve it so what should we do Ibaka said I'm I said we have to compile the compound and one what's up public I said do you want me to do something the Prophet did not do are you crazy and how Mark said we're not doing something the Prophet did not do we're simply preserving the Quran we have to preserve the crime and after going forward and backwards from worker now let loose with him felt good about it so he said who should be called to do this important task so they had their doubts they brought zaid his rabbit for this task and that was on the birth year Papa Hegira when they spoke to say didn't Abbott who was the main chief scribe of the protocol is a sauna he said memories are crazy you want me to do something the Prophet did not do I cannot do this in this of course they are much older than he is and they are the base of the womb no one can doubt the submitter normal who's better than them so they started you know softened him up a little bit same person you don't know what has come up and immediately he realized that as long as they've chosen this then definitely it was there thing to do and he saw and he said that I believe that it was the heaviest task to be ever appointed to me this is very difficult and he started collecting people and they used to come to the masjid telling him that this is a cloth this is only if this is a bone this is something that's hitting the on his condition was to accept only from the Companions that wrote the poor and I unit plea from the Prophet I system so if you go to me and said this verse was revealed yesterday on the protocol is a so I was in the pending and I read it this is not acceptable only those who did you hear from the prophet or SSL yes I handed on that particular day and you have to bring two witnesses testify with you so you bring it did you hear it yes image of myself personally who testifies for you you have to bring another one two witnesses to testify on this show is very very strict adding to that pettite himself knows it he's happen when somebody comes to him and says Allah says the kuffar 11 Apollo in the Maha got it follada and he sees it written would you get this from bhai daljit bring another witness don't you notice verse yes I know but I'm charge here I have to only approve the things that I see written and with witnesses this is quran this is not a game we're playing this is a very serious stuff this is the kalam of allah no one can tamper or play with it at all so they started doing this and everything the answer this very simply by singing in less then a dick weighing and I'm gonna happen what it is barely that you're at it is we who reveal this Quran and you will preserve it so when they say something like this we say okay what do you want so there is a soda that is missing sister Pamela the rest is ok to this in the rest Allah says he will preserve this and this is what Allah preserve and they say no it's not okay with us then we say have a good night because not 1,000,000 not hundred million net 1000 million you have one point seven billion of clothing that this is the book of allah and change so these strict rulings of collecting the whole on there wasn't anyone saying hey listen listen you forgot my sure you didn't notice they all agreed alta companions the floor Khalifa the press and the command is agreed that this the Quran withholding is the Quran that was revealed to Muhammad re so awesome nothing less nothing more sure I hope this acid each other plane everything was in accordance to what is aiding the Fabbrica habit instructed except the verses at the end of Surat October the Jerusalem come as usual I am an item Harris Monica be moving in alpha body paint olo pud hasbi allah to the end of the surah he said I found every single ayah with two witnesses except miss Eyre the only one who came with it was kouzina him I think I haven't named here Zenda deserve it he's the only one who came with this verse and he accepted his witnesses without time in the second one why this why is two men is he to men no cheating because he testified for the Prophet is a lobster it was reported that the Prophet boat source from a man in Islam the transaction of buying and selling is conducted even if you don't receive the goods or pay the line so if i say i bought your watch for two thousand rupees and you said I showed how us I didn't give and I didn't receive I come one week two weeks later let us see where is my watch what watch we made the transaction you have to give me the watch this is the money they said well I got another one who bought it for 5,000 sturdy no sorry I want my watch this is my night so the prophet saw a man with a horse and this bed word so the Prophet told him how much is the horse he told him let's say for example 10 be not so appropriate I doubt it the producer i sold it in the Prophet went and five minutes later to some people of the Companions came and said how much is this okay so then you want to buy CBS said 15 paddy not she's okay without it Thank he gave them the horse and collected the money when the prophet saw the horse he went to the bed one and told him where is my money but where's my horse I told him was horse Saddam's i bought from you so did not buy see the assignment is it not we did not buy where is the witness the profit is our son said where's my wetness anchor and Jose Mihaly fabok Elsa said missing her is Susanna who's ever attempted I justify that you bought the horse so the prophets mother said how can intensify her something with that did not see support of Allah I believe that you are being revealed from Allah the whole Quran and you don't want me to dissipate that you bought it from this man so the Prophet Alistair Sam said that his testimony is equal to two because of this old other companions did not see so did not talk this man's believe in the truthfulness of the profit on estimates and made the property of him this testimony and that is why his testimony is equal to 2 and this is how wyndham story very simple question why is it why not every butter Wow drama where's my run a tiny hole of the Companions only we will sit dance is a Charlotte why not bring so me try good that's good okay this is one he was very young good this is was very complicated task is not the reason yes very good excellent he was with the Prophet the last time the Prophet provides the Quran dream the last year how many times it he devised a plan ok mashallah ok I have two changes ok twice every year he used to divide it once with the professor then I said he devised it twice and this is this was one of the signs that the Prophet realized that his end was approaching so Allah are you why he was in them there are a number of reasons let's go through them he was the primary skype whenever the prophet had adverse review to him he says where is late and they immediately bring him and he says about himself I was the neighbor that's why the prophet used to make me the main in chief scribe I was next door so immediately just ring the bell and he comes they do not have belt but this is metaphoric said he was a prime scribe of the Prophet is a son so he was the best one and and described is not just to write it's an art you know if I had a blackboard I would have showed you where to go then I'm going to waste on leather safe than sorry for example many key only thing it is manikyam did we decided but it was written manic em 10k and with a smile a lufthansa so this is an art to occupy and to join all the different I hope in the same wording they did not put dots on the woods so staff to dodge it did not have any which means that if you have it can be none it can be done it can be fun it can be in this is only for the first letter it has four perhaps my instinct when they read this they understood as a native if I read this I would be to take me an hour this is what if I put one not here until tops Ted no in one word they might gain state he was so smart so eloquent with the language immediately ticket tell it so he was chosen because he was an excellent photographer and he memorized the Quran in the lifetime of the Prophet Alesana afterwards and he was used to bias the Quran with the prophet the prophet realizes it with Sharia and he devised it with the prophets allah Mahoney who are you sellin the Prophet ordered him to learn the language of the Jews when he was only 11 years old the Prophet did not choose someone who's old he knew who to choose the axis we have to invest in them when youngsters come in ask question sheesh good old man taught young you don't know if you have a reason will not understand no invest on the anxious because they will be the elder these up inshallah the future likewise they complained I should have mentioned this in yesterday's last night's lecture the Companions complained to allah may allah be pleased with him and said come on Howard sons are all develop in our bus and you always insist on having him in our best attend your Majid easier gathering why is that our sons are older than he is and they're strong word he said this is something I chose and the following big while they were there old companions or elderlies he said who can give me the interpretation of unaga and also know he won't but what I eaten a say ve Neill I have Raja for some time give a bigger stuff your way now got it the water none spoke so even a bus what do you know this so Bernama said Allah is giving the tithing to His Prophet that his end is near so you should seek Allah for forgiveness because his to die soon Homer said by Allah this is exactly what I know about the surah immediately the Companions realized and new y el macho's him not by so the youngsters you can invest in them a lot and that is why the Prophet invested in late zaid mastered not only the language writing and reading of the Hebrew language in 17 days to Panama how smart and how strong his memory was and he was the most knowledgeable person and inheritance and this is a geek follow the whole saving the Cabot among all the companions of the prophet versus time even highly even from a bucket the most one who knows inheritance for his they didn't rabbit and so many times Alma would deputize him when he travels may allah be pleased with him he would make him appear which meant that he is a trustworthy ama does not trust anyone if he had the slightest doubt in someone he would immediately remove him immediately cardigan worried shameful laughs he removed him from the battle input abominably java and he said i did not remove him out of doubt in him but because the people were connected to him they thought that the victory was only coming through solid know the is coming from allah i approve this for him then he moved so many of the companions the second compilation of the Quran was at the time poorest man now before we go into this after all of this they save my favorite managed to compile one copy that was known to be preserved and Musa Abu Bakr with Abu Bakr Mallory peas with him whenever Booker died it was passed to rama when rama may Allah please wooden died it was passed to have some why have some there were other wives his daughter his relative voice he didn't build it to Abdullah dollar scholars say because at the time when he died the Shura was in six he was they did not collect they did not select an Emir so it was still uncertain who've become immune so that why while he was dying he told them take the most heart and give Gafsa I trust her only now until they choose someone when they chose they chose earth man earth man requested it from have some may Allah be pleased with her today familiar man now this is very familiar another body huh this one will be a loved one who is the one who came to earth man when he was fighting jihad in armenia he heard the people in the masjid reciting quran but they were reciting things different than their masters than the shape and he found that they are exchanging between the truth and formulating something that is not the proper quran that was revealed to prophet elisha salaam to immediately left and went to earth map and told him you have a problem now you have the possession of one's hub we have the problem but there are people who are learning through the blah and teaching it to students and they're mixing different presentations with others and we probably try to formulate something not the proper Quran so you have to find something to save for the people from that what to do there were seven 75 there were seven dialects that the Quran was revealed and now they're mixing so there is a problem first man may allah be pleased with him did is the haárin thought of it top top of it and said these seven roof were given to the Prophet Alison of Salaam to make life easy for the different tribes down of parish is a permanent one so let's compile copies and send it to these regions with these power and this is what they have done who did they choose to do this task they didn't have it again because he is the most knowledgeable person and he chose with him free of the people of Koresh because they know the dialect of Koresh and he chose with them a black man is available under severe may allah be pleased with him and his father hang up the rock man technol had english am and say eight alas they're all from flesh and he told they you scribe you write and whenever you have differences refer to the three because this is what the Quran was revealed in their tongue they were all have their own master in this health operation and this was written approximately took a year and a half or so it was written or two on the dialect of parish for the year twenty four to twenty fifth of a leader on the road five copies and some say they owed seven copies a copy was taking to kufa and he rock a copy was taking too bizarre also an error a coffee was gay he was taken to Mecca Medina and to Syria to Damascus tion so these were the five copies now welcome to talk about the cuttlefish Allah tomorrow he told them to write it in accordance to the power of 0 to the heart of flesh and if the heart of porridge is different in writing to this copy they would put it in another copy but the majority and you come to talk about the meaning of our and to notice less than inshallah which is the most difficult topic to people to comprehend them to understand no it was it occupied all it has the possibility of occupying and we don't have this copy because where is this copy it was destroyed it was destroyed not by earth manga at the prison but whether the ruler of Medina he requested it from housetops refused to give it to him and when she died he requested it from Allah Allah be pleased with them and he gave to him and you destroyed you said it would not diverse people tell us these five copies with a deal upon all scholars all companions they all agree that this is the heart that is accepted it is a coat for container may Allah have mercy on your soul it revolves on this you get the Shah Baba is no needed listen to be did questions what is the difference between the second pair the two compilation first one was one copy the second one was fine first one not because of the roof but to preserve the Quran itself the second one was too"
