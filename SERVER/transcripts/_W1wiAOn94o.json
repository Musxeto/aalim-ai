  "transcript": "what about a cartoon yeah give you more health and more Prosperity yeah I mean and you as well my question is that what is the difference between the Brazil and if okay so there angel israth are both sinful and mentioned in the Quran at the moment of out of the tip of my head I've read it so many times but I'm not good in keeping track with it it seems knows best is that is something to do with someone who does not have enough someone whose income is according to what suffices he spends more than what he can afford while al-israf is when you have a lot but you spend lavishly and in extravagance but again don't quote me this is out of the tip of my head and this is what I recall I need to go back to the books of language and tafsir so tabvir is when your income is ten thousand but you spend 14 and 15 000 a month more than your income but Israel is when you have millions yet you spend extravagantly in things that you may not need without account because you can afford it and Allah Knows Best"
