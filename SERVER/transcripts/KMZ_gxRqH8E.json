  "transcript": "sh if the ruling about those who rule rather than Allah are CI does this apply to rulers and judges or everyone in general such as a person who owns where did you get that the rulers who rule with other than Allah's law are cfir I mean generally I I'm telling I'm asking you you're telling me about a ruling that would enable me to fight the ruler and to overthrow governments I'm asking you where did you get this ruling from Adnan and Adan is gone see this is the problem when we have people that have wrong teachings and corrupt AA they tend to listen to any Tom Dick or Harry and Implement whatever their whims and desires drive them to do even if this causes Bloodshed killing people giving to Muslim rulers what brother Adnan was referring to was verse number 44 inah chapter 5 where Allah says whoever does not impl M what Allah has legislated in in in Shar then those are the disbelievers so people say okay this country the ruler does not Implement Shar he's CF okay hold your horses verse 45 of the same Surah the following verse Allah says those who do not rule with what Allah has legislated they are wrongdoers huh from cfir to wrongdoers okay wrongdoers sometimes could refer to disbelievers let's go and fight hold your horses the same Surah two verses after that verse 47 so 44 45 and 47 same Surah Allah says and those who do not rule with what Allah had legislated they are sinners whoa H I think we might need to think it over so not every person who rules with other than what Allah has legislated is a cfir yes if someone stands up and says I believe that the prescribed punishment mentioned in the Quran is inapplicable we cannot practice it it doesn't suit our time okay you're a cfir someone says we cannot chop the hand of a thief we cannot flog a fornicator we cannot Stone known an adulteress or an adulterer what are you doing this is the law of Allah someone says the law of inheritance is no no no no Allah says give the son double the daughter no we make them equal this is Allah's law in the Quran said nope we change it he's a cfir but I'm talking about different things someone who does it out of his own WS ws and desires to gain worldly benefit of course he's making one of the major sins in Islam for doing this someone who's transgressing because he's favoring a friend or a relative over someone else so he's twisting the laws or breaking it but he believes that these are the laws of Allah this is a different story and the topic is too long but I hope this yeah clarifies it"
