  "transcript": "it says that what about islamic nursery working in them sometimes they allow things and she is doubtful whether this is islamic or not and whether she is allowed to assist on them or not so painting the face painting the faces is permissible generally speaking what is not permissible is to paint the face of an individual to look like an animal so you can't paint whiskers and and the likes of a cat or of a a tiger you cannot um do things that make a person or a child look like a monkey though it's funny it's nice it's it's a it looks cute but we as muslims are prohibited from imitating the animals even for children even if it looks nice it is haram if you look at the sunnah we are not allowed to prostrate like dogs we are not allowed to make prostrations so quick like roasters we're not allowed to sit in a particular way like dogs or lions we're not allowed to so many things that prohibit us from imitating animals and allah has favored us over all of his creation or most of his creation subhanallah as wajal so you cannot assist on that if the children are doing it on their own to themselves this is not your job to prevent them as for the music some nurseries order you to play some music jingle bells or whatever sometimes it's related to christmas or even not to christmas any type of music exhibited you cannot play it by any means or uh ways if someone else turns it on and you this is part of your job you have to sit there there's no problem in sitting there but you should not do that yourself and allah azza knows uh best the bottom line is that you're not allowed to assist on sin so if you give them sketchbooks and pens and they draw butterflies or they draw animals or they drop you did not help them on doing that they are the one who's drawing it and it's according to the school's laws that they should do that but you don't come and show them now you have to draw it like this a butterfly has two big wings it has to be colored in yellow orange or black or whatever no you should not uh help them in drawing what is haram"
