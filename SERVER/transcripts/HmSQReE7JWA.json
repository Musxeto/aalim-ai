  "title": "Can a Muslim man marry a Christian woman? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "alul can we marry a Christian woman we uh can marry a Christian woman you you're talking about yourself yeah yeah islamically if all the conditions are met the answer is yes but is it advisable are the conditions fulfilled in today's women this is debatable and we usually say that the Quran in chapter 5 Surah Allah says that marrying women who are chased from the people of the book whether Christian or Jew is permissible this is the Islamic verdict why would we say no or yes or this is the Islamic verdict now from experience and from the counseling sessions that I'm involved in seeing what had happened after such marriages I would usually ask people to think twice this Christian woman might be an excellent woman and checks all boxes except for religion so she's mighty fine in her moral conduct in her she's beautiful she's kind she's caring she's loving she's merciful she loves children she's a good housewife everything but she's a Christian which means that if she remains on the same religion you have children in the future most likely you'll be living in a cafer country and most likely if anything happens and she wants a divorce she will take the custody of the children and she will make them grow up to follow her religion and you'll end up by your children carrying your name going to church is this something you want is she the last woman on Earth that you're willing to jeopardize the future of your children for just a um an affair this is not logical but at the end of the day it's your call and it's your neck uh"
