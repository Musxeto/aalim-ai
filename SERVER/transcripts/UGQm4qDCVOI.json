  "transcript": "so's question details explanation about wiping over the socks first of all Allah mentioned in chapter 5ah and also in uh elsewhere in chapter uh fourah the verse regarding and in the beginning of chapter 5 Allah mentions the oh you who believe whenever you want to pray then do the following in sequence so Allah mentions washing the face washing the arms to the elbows wiping over the head and washing the feet to the ankles those who know Arabic know that there are two verse two two narrations or two ways of reciting the Ayah when it comes to this is one and this is second so to go into details it would take us to the end of the episode but one refers to washing the feet the other one refers to wiping over the feet and this as the vast majority of Sunni Scholars say that it deals with wiping over the socks the shoes or whatever you wear on your feet so this is establish in the Quran thei of may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet was performing W and then he fell down that is Al to take off the prophet's shoes the prophet said leave them for I had put them on while on the state of woodoo and he continued his woodo by wiping over his shoes that's it he didn't wash his feet so the Hadith indicates that wiping over the socks or the shoes is part of the Sunnah more than 40 Companions of the Prophet reported it or so therefore it is an established fact in our religion in our Sunnah to wipe over the conditions one the prophet stated that wiping over the shoes or socks known as Al is valid for 24 hours one day and one night from the time of wiping not from the time of putting them on wearing them for a resident a day and a night 24 hours and 72 hours that is three days and three nights for a traveler whenever they want to perform wood it's sufficient for them just to wipe over their socks providing that they had them on after or while being in the state of wood if they take them off they cannot wipe over them again the following condition is that a person where the socks or the shoes that covers the entire foot up to the ankles so if it's below the ankles this is invalid if it covers the ankles this is good because washing the ankles while in uh woodoo is mandatory it's part of the pillars of woodoo so likewise wiping it has to be over a socks or a shoe that covers the ankles so how is this done if I wake wake up for f for example I perform W I wash my feet then I put my socks on whether immediately or after an hour or after 3 hours but the condition is that I put them on while I'm in state of woodo I can pray before putting them on because I'm in woo if this is the case then my socks or shoes that are covering my whole foot is legit after prayer or before prayer I answer the call of nature I urinate I deficate I Pass Wind I go to the toilet I perform woodoo normal woodoo when I come to the feet I simply wet my hands and from the toes to the beginning of the leg I wipe over my foot that's it not from underneath not from the sides just doing this is sufficient I can do this for the following 24 hours so till tomorrow's before same time I can do this all the time as long as I do not take off my socks and shoes the res the The Traveler can do this for 72 hours if person does this because it's more convenient for him to wipe at the office or at at at at school rather than take off his socks and wash his feet he does this with the intention of wiping due to easiness no problem with that it's if my socks are seethrough or made of NY or very thin no problem the concept that it has to be made of leather and it has to be thick this is not authentic you can wipe onever what you wear on your or your feet some people say okay my socks has small holes at the bottom they're worn out no problem the sahaba used to have and it had a lot of holes in it and this did not prevent them from wiping over it if my my shoe is my shoe's neck is short but the socks covers over the ankles so can I wipe over the shoes that does not cover my foot but the but but uh uh uh the socks does no problem because now they're considered to be one unit but if you take off your shoes your wiping period is over you cannot wipe anymore your woodo is it intact or not if you take your so sock it's an issue of dispute so if I wipe over my socks I'm in the state of wo but then I took it take it off does my woodo break some Scholars say it does others say it does not and the most authentic opinion is it does not why because if I perform W and I wipe over my hair and then I go to the barber and I have a haircut or I shave my head totally does my woodoo break because the hair that I wiped over is gone the answer is no and likewise with your sock so this is in a nutshell I hope it sounds logical to you we have a short break"
