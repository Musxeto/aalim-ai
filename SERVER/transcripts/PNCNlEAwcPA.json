  "transcript": "I mean so shape in the Masjid Harry pray the Imam of that Masjid often which makes serious mistakes while reciting the Quran on the conventional prayer Yani he resets the verses by omitting some words for example if he wants to reset the verse then he said something like instead of Yani instead of resenting Anna he says so now my question is how do we correct him as a muktari in that situation the moment the Imam makes such a serious Mistake by omitting or changing a word of the Quran you must correct him on the spot so the moment he says this you raise your voice by saying and he says and he should know this if he doesn't listen and continues leave him and after the prayer is over you go and talk to him seriously and say listen if you don't memorize the Ayah well don't read it as simple as that however such a mistake does not invalidate the prayer such a mistake is possible maybe he forgot maybe he made an error so you correct him as he is reciting the Ayah wrongly you correct him on the spot if he doesn't listen then you may address that at the end of the prayer inshallahu as"
