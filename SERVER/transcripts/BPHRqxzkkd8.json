  "transcript": "a quick question please um sit down um you know I say that I love Allah and I it feels genuine it feels real but whenever I get sick of any sickness whether it's a fever or something more intense I get really scared um it's like I get scared of death almost so I always ask myself then is my love for Allah real if it was real wouldn't I want to be run running towards death and um I think Allah say in the Holy Quran that if you love me you have to want that you have to think about that and so I was just not to say I'm a hypocrite but perhaps where did Allah say that um maybe Allah says I you know I could be mistaken but in the Holy Quran Allah talks about you should want like you should be thinking about that uh this is for the Jews uh Allah says inah this is for the Jews when it was prescribed to them that if you do sins you do this to kill yourselves or so so Allah challenged them so okay I'm sorry but I had to correct this before I forget it no thank you so that was my point is that is my love for Allah real if I I I understand your question I think you all understand the question the answer is the fear of death is natural nobody in his right mind would say oh I've done it all I'm just waiting for death is liar the moment he gets a flu virus he's terrified and he goes is my will written have I paid off my debts mother AA said to the prophet that we all fear death oh prophet of Allah he said no no no no this is not the fear of death a Believer loves to meet Allah so Allah loves to meet him and a hypocrite hates to meet Allah and Allah hates to meet him this is not the fear of death we all fear the agonies the pain of death we all fear departing our loved ones we all fear leaving our home to a new apartment even if it's better it's cleaner in a better neighborhood I have emotional connection to this apartment that I've been in my apartment that I'm living in I've been living in it for the past 40 years 4 Z I'm paying rent and everybody in my family said for God's sake just move go anywhere no I can't I can't I'm emotionally attached so we don't like to change things this is why we fear death not that we fear Allah on the contrary when any one of our loved ones dies we're saddened but we're appreciative that inshallah they're going to a better place I have no worries that inshallah this person was praying in the fer and the rest of the Salat with the JAMA in in the Masjid so I inshallah I'm hopeful that he's in Jenna so I'm regretful to miss seeing him but I'm happy that he is in Jenna inshallah so be be careful not to allow Shan to make you feel despair of Allah's mercy no we fear death but we love Allah so if I feel uh uh if I fall sick or afraid of death because I don't want to leave everything behind and I think that I can do better and this is why the prophet Alam said the longer you live the better it is why it increases your good deeds it elevates your level in Jenna and I'll give you don't have time yes okay I'll give you a story from the authentic Sunnah one of the 10 heavenbound says two men came from bah an area near Iran near Iraq somewhere I don't know where there were brothers and they accepted Islam and they lived with us one of them was martyred in a battle so he was a martyr and his brother lived after him one year and died on his bed says in a vision in a night dream I saw that the three of us were at the gates of Jenna and then the gates of Jenna were opened and the man who died last on his bed was admitted and the gates were closed me and the Martyr were waiting after some time the gates were opened and the Martyr came in I wanted to come in and the angel said no no no it's not your time yet and they closed the G Gates so when he woke up he told the people about the dream the people were shocked how is it possible that the Martyr was admitted last doesn't make any sense the story reached the prophet Alam summoned T what did you see blah blah blah said so what's wrong in that in the year that this man lived after the Martyr how many prayers did he pray how many days did he fast how many Charities did he give by Allah this is the prophet saying the difference between him and his martyr brother is like the heavens and the Earth so the longer you live the better it is for you the prophet says the best of you who his age is longer than others so you live 60 70 80 years good for you providing that his deeds are good if you're going to live 70 and you're looking around at girls and watching porn and and and doing Haram you're going to hell quickly man no might as well go and die and thirdly the prophet says that his moral conduct and is good so many Elders when they get old like me they become grumpy grandfathers they're always on the edge shouting why did you do this why did you do that I don't want children don't what's the girl is hanging on the chandelier get her down don't the food is on the floor these are grandfathers they're grumpy no no if you want Jenna you age is long good your Deeds are good in in in the first row of the Masjid good but your moral conduct your tone it down become wise becomes become kind become loving and compassionate you will be in jenah inshallah"
