  "title": "Is adopting pets permissible? Ruling on buying & selling - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so buying and selling pets is Haram but what about like adopting them because like sometimes there's like an adoption fee they ask for is that still her wrong pets are not prohibited to buy and sell only cats and dogs and whatever is Haram to buy and sell but you can buy and sell Birds fish rabbits and whatever is halal as for dogs and cats if you have to pay documentation fee or money to the shelter I am inclined to say that this is also not permissible because it is a cost that you are paying to acquire a dog or a cat and that's not permissible in Allah Knows Best uh"
