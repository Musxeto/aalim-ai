  "transcript": "Maleeha says can we make Nia fasting the missed days of Ramadan or the six days of show well after getting up in the middle of the day since we haven't done anything till then that would nullify the fast answer is no Rama bond and obligatory fasts you must have the intention for it before the Adana fetcher if not then this does not count 6th of Shawwal is a highly recommended and it has to be intended for doing it and you cannot simply after the add-on of fire by half an hour or even one minute say okay I'm gonna fast today it has to be prior to the add-on"
