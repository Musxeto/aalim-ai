  "title": "Why must we send salutations (durood) on Prophet ï·º before making dua, isn't it shirk assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I have a struggle understanding why having to say for for to be accepted isn't well this is the same struggle that Satan had when Allah told him to prostrate to Adam and he refused do you guys go to the same school yes or no no so was he justified in refusing no are you justified in asking such a question that the prophet himself taught us how to say it and he told us that the Dua is blocked unless we offer salutation upon him and you say I think this is shik what should I say to you s so I hope this answers your question"
