  "transcript": "i have a question uh alhamdulillah we blessed with the baby boy uh three days back can i can i give akika of my child in my home country while child was in a different country i mean we are in emirates so can i give akika on seventh on my in my home country the answer is yes this is permissible there's no problem in offering your akika in your home country though it's not from the sunnah and the sunnah is that you slaughter it on the seventh day where the child was born so that you and his mother and the rest of the family and the friends may eat from it and you may give gifts to your neighbors and you may give charity out of that if you wish but technically speaking if you feel it's more convenient that we slaughtered back home my parents would be happy there are more poor people who are needy and it's cheaper there's no problem in that insha allah you"
