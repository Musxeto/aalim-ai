  "title": "Working with non muslims in offices VS working to benefit their religious activities assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what can I do for you so shik I am asking that question today on behalf of another brother so the ministry of religious Affairs of our country deals with is deals with Islam as well as other religions y people of different religions live here such as Hinduism Buddhism Christianity in such a situation will it be permissible to join the job as a computer data entry operator there since there is work on other relig other religious as well as Islam the question is not clear now if you're asking about having co-workers in the workplace in the same company that you're working for and you work to make a program to manufacture a product to sell a commodity that is halal and everything else is halal there's no problem in that the prophet Alat wasam hired a disbeliever guide when he migrated from meca to Madina so he and Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with them were accompanied by this non-muslim guide who knew the routes that the disbelievers would not be able to catch them and this shows us that working with disbelievers or non-muslims on something that is halal is permissible but if you're telling me that you are collaborating with them on work that would benefit their religion and make it prosper and flourish in supporting them in their religion activi religious activities the answer is definitely that this is not permissible we have nothing to do with other religions when it comes to such issues and Allah Knows Best"
