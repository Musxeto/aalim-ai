  "transcript": "Wes had one question and that is the prostration of forgetfulness is it only for fart or if I have done a mistake or an error in my voluntary prayers night prayers Witter nephal rahiba should I also offer the prostration of forgetfulness the answer is yes the voluntary prayers are identical to the fault prayers when it comes to most of the rulings Johnny almost 99.9% like the Arabian elections so they're identical maybe there is a slight difference here and there but this is not the time to talk about it so yes if I'm praying soon little fetcher for example the Taraka before the photo and I forgot to say allahu akbar when going for record i made a mistake now how can i rectify it by offering the two prostrations of forgetfulness and allah knows best"
