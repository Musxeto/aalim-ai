  "title": "Giving the zakat to a neighbour or to a relative?",
  "transcript": "okay great um sister R here has a question regarding giving zaka she wants some explanation on who to give it to she says can I give it to a needy neighbor or should I give it to a needy relative who from them is more closer or more deserving for zaka well it is much far better to give the relative rather than the neighbor because you are supposed to connect with your next kin so you have to be close to them you have to be kind to them and if they're needy this becomes obligatory so if you have zaka you give it to your NEX ofkin your relatives rather than giving it to uh uh the neighbors and if they are far needer than your relative so if the neighbor is in deep need more than your relative then the neighbor becomes uh uh uh worthy of more worthy of that great do"
