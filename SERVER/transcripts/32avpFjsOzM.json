  "transcript": "pain says I live in America and I got a letter in the mail for jury duty I've heard it's very hard to get out of it and if you don't go they may arrest you knowing that it's a kaffir country with kafir laws and it might coincide with prayer times what should I do if I go am I out of the fold of Islam first of all it is not permissible to legislate and to rule with other than Islamic law the Islamic Sharia and without any doubt if you were called to jury duty you will be forced to follow their laws in incriminating or setting someone free according to their laws though I don't know what the system is and I personally think that it is not logical to enforce people to accept jury duty if they don't want to but hypothetically speaking if they call me for jury duty and there are 12 of us and we have to look into the case a man is accused of killing someone or raping someone and we see them deliberating defending and accusing the witnesses and the evidences and we deliberate or we We Gather afterwards to give a conclusion whether guilty or not guilty as a Muslim I can only judge through Sharia now I don't have to go and say uh excuse me guys we have to do this we have to do that no this is totally not the case because I'm not supposed to I'm not the judge I'm not putting legislations but according to what I've heard and seen I have to rule according to the Islamic rulings so if it's a rape case do we have a confession no do we have four male Witnesses testifying of seeing this the answer is no not guilty what we have this we have DNA we I can't say he's guilty this is what Sharia does that gives it gives the people the benefit of the doubt it's not kill first shoot first then ask questions without proof and evidence how could I increment put someone at guilt without real hard evidences and likewise when it comes to other allegations you have to implement the Sharia ruling you don't know the Sharia ruling give me a call tell me about the case and I'll tell you what to say and what to do or ask any of the scholars at the time and try to know the Shariah ruling on that particular case with the evidences at hand and he will get tell you what to say insha Allah"
