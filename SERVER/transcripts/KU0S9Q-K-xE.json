  "transcript": "uh actually my question is uh say one person did one kufur in one aspect and another person did uh many kufur in many aspects like uh cing at Allah like worshiping others and helping Pats in many others now what is the both are all already in uh eternal hell now what is the difference in their uh punishment actually actually my problem is I I'm uncertain of that um I did something maybe AER now my mind says that uh you already are eternally in hell now if you don't now what's the problem of doing more kuur do it more speak ill about hijab speaking about um polygamy now do it more you are already in h then do more oh if this is your attitude then you're right there's no problem in doing more because you've already condemned yourself to being a cfir and you are encouraging yourself to do more kufur because what the heck I already killed someone why not kill my father and mother and my siblings and kill the neighbors I already killed someone what kind of attitude is this instead of going back to Allah seeking his forgiveness repenting accepting and reverting to Islam you say well if I'm in hell might as well finish whatever I can do and uh uh uh enjoy the right no muslim does this only a full-fledged cafir or a hypocrite thinks this way or someone with mental illness that is delusional and has been possessed by shatan controlled by shatan and he is talking as Shan is pleased with what he's doing how is this possible Shana or Shona if a person does a mistake and falls into sin Allah addresses them in the Quran by saying oh you who have trans transgressed upon yourself and exaggerated in sins don't despare from Allah's Mercy for Allah forgives all sins instead of approaching Allah and asking for forgiveness you say well if I'm in hell might as well enjoy the ride and do some more no muslim does this fear Allah and get back to him and feel remorse and ashamed of yourself for not worshiping Allah as you supposed to"
