  "transcript": "alhamdulillah I'm not a practicing Muslim but sometimes of the blue I feel like Allah is not having mercy upon me suddenly suddenly I feel very lonely and depressed I feel that my level of spirituality has gone down the heal without any reason is this the was was of Satan what should I do well I'm afraid Satan himself would say what are you doing to yourself how can anyone think of Allah not having Mercy on him Allah is beautiful name and you're saying Allah is not having Mercy this is something wrong with your head why don't you think before you rephrase your question sometimes the word that we utter say fear Allah don't don't don't say me keep me keep your mouth closed because once it's out you're a prisoner to it now it controls you you're a slave to it but once you keep it within your mouth you still the driver you can well whe a driver one or two this depends but this is something you can control it is a major sin to think negatively of Allah Allah doesn't need you Allah will throw you in hell think as you wish Allah doesn't need you Allah will put you in hell and how many does Allah have this is crazy when and I had a counseling session today with a brother who is thinking like this and I had to smack him left right and center and the guy says I now I know my problem because lots of us talk without thinking they don't know Allah and they speak very badly of Allah why is Allah doing this to me I think Allah doesn't love me I think Allah is UN unfair you don't know Allah so first of all you have to know Allah second of all you cannot think negatively of Allah because if you do Allah will throw you in hell simple as that you think as you wish Allah doesn't care about you because Allah doesn't need you Allah has all this universe under his control who created it him who owns it him if he throws it all in Hell nobody can complain or say anything and when Allah doesn't give you he doesn't give you because he's poor he has everything in this world and and he doesn't give you because he's stingy he's the most generous who gave El musk who this these billions Allah and Ellen musk is an atheist cafir so does Allah love him no it's a test Allah gives wealth Health prosperity to those who he loves and Those whom he doesn't but he only gives Iman and content to Those whom he loves full stop so when you feel this low and bad know that Allah doesn't love you because you're feeling like this change immediately repent ask Allah for forgiveness show remorse and think positively of Allah and I ask every single person who comes to me in counseling not everyone the majority when they feel deprived like him who's more living a lavish life you or the prophet simple question who's living a lavish life having a car having air conditioners having um no fun intended so who us does Allah love us more than the prophet Subhan Allah so think twice life is a test can you find me some one single person on life in life on Earth who's not being tested one just give me one who is not being tested El musk he is being tested Big Time Allah says in the Quran we shall test you with evil but also with goodness so even your health is a test your wealth is a test your wife wife your children your pro everything Allah gives you is a test don't think Allah is giving it to you and you're not going to be held accountable no at the end of the day you're going to be asked about every ring so everybody is being tested but tests vary and when you're content you say alhamdulillah the prophet had seven children six died in his lifetime and the seventh Fatima he was told on his death bed that she's she's going to follow him 6 months later how did he [Music] feel did he feel resentment complaining no and whatever Allah decrees we are satisfied with it yeah ibraim we're saddened for losing you the eyes Weep the heart is saddened but we do not say anything that angers Allah this is the content that you should have and this is is what will take you to Paradise but if you have resentment if you have objection if you have complaints you're the only loser Allah doesn't need you Allah has billions of human beings who feeds them when I go to my festar hotel on the executive lounge and I overlook kalur highways in the rush hour and the traffic jam is horrible and I see these bikers and these cars in the tens of thousand hundreds of thousands what do I say I'm a wise man H I sit and think hm who's feeding them Allah each one of them has rent to pay at the end of the month who's giving them money Allah each one of them has debts has problems has worries has children has this has that who's facilitating all their Affairs Allah and this is only a small 7 billion individuals living on Earth who's taking care of them subhanahu waala how many animals do we have on Earth hundreds of billions who's taking care of them and feeding them how many fish do we have in the oceans how many birds do we have in the skies how many insects around us who's taking care of them I think Allah is not happy with me I think is angry Allah is not giving me who are you you ignorant imbecile you're nothing I am nothing I need Allah I am his servant not his peer I am his I have to express my poverty my humility my need to Allah otherwise Allah doesn't care about me so I hope this yeah gives you a reflection how to answer it"
