  "transcript": "so this question is on behalf of my friend um she said as she increases her I like her Salah fasting reading the Quran going to classes and Etc instead of becoming more energized there there and then is when she started to feel the slump in during those I so my question would be is there hypocrisy in I or is is she sing while she's doing her I that makes her feel this slump as she's um progressing toward she F you know that I do counseling sessions and I charge people money that's how I balance alhamdulillah and this money I don't take for my knowledge I take for my time when you demand half an hour of my time of my children's time and my gym time you have to pay yeah you pay peanuts you get monkeys you pay $10 you get monkeys you pay $100 you get a gorilla anyhow in my counseling sessions I tell people why do you have depression why do you have anxiety why do you have OCD why do you have Whispers people don't go to the basics okay Enlighten us I'm going to give you some of my secrets of my trade but inshallah it's all for the good someone who's 60 or 70 years of age how many pages does he have in his resume his CV 5 10 20 with the the training sessions and so maybe how many pages does Satan have gazillion since time of Adam till date he knows every thought that crosses your mind he knows everything that goes into your mind your weaknesses your strength how to make you fall he has all the time in the world until the day of judgment his only mission and vision in life to get you on board in Hellfire simple as that agree how does he do that he does it through Whispers so don't ever think for a second that you're saved or that you can have it made without any Whispers no one on earth lives without Shan's whisp whispering to him and these Whispers increase as long as you increase getting closer to Allah so many of us were not practicing true when you were not practicing did you have these Whispers that you're having today all huh this is unanimous all saying W she when I did not pray on time I was happy I didn't have these problems when I used to watch movies when I used to be negligent I had no now I pr I pray five times a day I pray Sunnah I do this I read the Quran and I am overwhelmed I know the more you get closer to Allah the more shatan raises the influence and The Whispers so what to do you have two options give up and go back to your slums or increase in your and your fight so he increases in his Whispers until you reach a breaking point where it's not feasible anymore a little bit more you're going to be with the companions what does Satan do he calls his thugs he says listen back off back off it's not feasible anymore the guy is he's going to Jenna so back off leave him don't whisper give him two three months he lets his guard down we attack again and this is the Vicious Cycle that is happening with me and with you sometimes I get Whispers of Shan by the way all the time but he may linger for 2 3 seconds and leaves so you're dangerous no no you know I might accept Islam if I talk to you no no no I'm leaving he leaves some people he lingers with them for a week or two and some of them feel weak and fall pray to his attempts and give up this is why you need companionship you need mentorship you need a sister to remind the sisters a brother to remind the brothers and you need a community because the moment you're alone and the sister who asked the question most likely she's focusing on her but not on her Sisterhood and everyone who comes to me I say to them with all due respect do you have a contact list on your phone yes how many so maybe 500 how many practicing two or three only yes how often do you hang out with them once a year seriously this is our problem we know one another but we don't hang out together we don't attend or Circles of knowledge we don't I have a buddy or two okay every couple of months let's go for us boys only okay bah we go on a journey of faith I shouldn't have used this we go on a journey of E and we go to um for two weeks we go to Medina we go together we pray together we wake one another we we sit between and we we boost our Iman we come back how do we come back no strong is not is an understatement we come as firm as a mountain in Iman for 3 four months then the thugs are back let's go for again let's go for a retreat let's go for this so the more you have an environment people around you to hang out with to strengthen your Iman to vent to to share things with you your Iman is as quick as a rocket and as high as it could be with the grace of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
