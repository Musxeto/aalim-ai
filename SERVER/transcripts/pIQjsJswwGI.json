  "transcript": "So my question is my mom has a dog and the dog one time drinks from a bucket of water and my mom the dog does what? Uh drinks from the bucket of water. He drinks from a bucket of water. Yes. And my mom uses the same bucket of water to bath the dog. So the water in the bucket was uh is nudges. Hence the day hence the hair of the dog. So what should I do? Because the this is the third time you asked me about this question of Zan, isn't it? I I didn't clarify my question or no. Yeah, we you you spoke about the question. You asked me about the hair of the dog and I answered you only the saliva. So now you're saying that he drinks from the bucket then he is bathed in the bucket and so what about the ruling of the hair? Well, I'll ask you another question. The dog licks its own skin and cleans its own skin. What's the ruling on the hair? The ruling is the same. The hair is pure until proven otherwise. And you don't have any proof. Move on. Leave the dog alone. Leave your mom alone. Don't make this an obsession. Don't ask me tomorrow about something that the dog enters the refrigerator and I don't know what happens afterwards. Don't make this an OCD."
