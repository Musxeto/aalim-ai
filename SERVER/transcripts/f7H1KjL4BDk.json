  "transcript": "first question was sent by email from brother Mohammed and he asks by saying did the prophet sallallahu wasallam recite poems before the prophecy meaning was the profit that is awesome involved in composing poems and reciting it and the answer is no Eliza we shall mentioned this in Surat Yasin what he says we did not teach him that is a prophet Alison poetry and it does not behove him and this was in chapter 36 cerastium so the Prophet array saw it was salaam was not known to compose poetry because this is what the idol worshippers accused him of when they saw the Quran and it's miraculous form they had never seen anything even close to it in its eloquent sea and perfection so they tried their level best to justify the refusal of accepting it so they said the Prophet was a sorcerer also some he was a priest he was insane and then they said he was a poet because this is the highest form of eloquence e in Arabic language poetry so this is why the Alonso gel said that he was not taught and he should not be even taught that why so that the Quran would be protected from anything that may tarnish tarnish its reputation or bring any doubt to it however it was reported that the Prophet as I'm used to say maybe one a verse of poetry and even when he used to say that he used to make a mistake in saying it in a number of incidents where Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him said o prophet of allah you've recited the verse of poetry wrongly and i believe that you are the messenger of allah and that the word of allah is true because allah told us that you were not taught to say poetry so the Prophet may have said one line or two lines of poetry on rare occasions and even when he said that it was wrong linguistically that is because it is not within him salah salem though he was the most eloquent in speech and the one who was given the concise of speech among the Arabs analyzer gel knows best hand"
