  "transcript": "um we begin inshaallah today discussing the chapter that deals with different types of prayers such as the prayers of the eid and as you all know as muslims we have two aids every year and one aid that is recurrent and it takes place every week but it is not considered to be a as such where people celebrate but it is called read because linguistically read is something that comes time after time and it can be called to describe things that happen time bound and it also can be describing something that people go to or look location that people go to so it can also be considered it to be related to time or to location now here we are only referring to time because when the prophet salallahu salaam came to madina he found the people of medina celebrating a day of the non-muslims so the prophet told them he told them that allah has substituted you with two better days allah has replaced these days of the pre-islamic era with two days for you to celebrate throughout the year and that is which comes after the month of ramadan and aid an abha which is on the 10th day of the last month of the year the month of ja and islam is a simple religion that is suitable to all times and all locations and the majority of the rulings in islam are based regarding time are based on observing the moon and observing the sun we need the sun to know what times we can pray at so the times of prayers are decided are distinguished are known by observing the sun as we've stated that before and we need the crescent we need the moon so that we know when the months start because in islam we only use the hijri calendar which is based on the lunar months we do not use the gregorian calendar because no one knows what day this is without referring to the calendar which is made by a handful of astrologists or astronomers or whatever but in islam we can know and we can identify which they approximately today is by observing the moon throughout observing the moon we know when read al-fatres we know when aida is we can identify ashura also if a woman is observing her iddah after her husband dies a widow she has to observe four months and ten days as a waiting period as a period of grief and this cannot be identified without knowing the time and this is known by observing the moon aid is means of celebration of being happy of trying to make the family happy by giving them gifts by buying food by buying new clothes by decorating the house all of these means are permissible because they introduce joy and celebration to the house so that our children our families know that eid is different than any other day of course there are things related to eid and the most prominent thing which is what we will discuss today inshallah is the issue of read prayer and as you know we are studying the chapter that deals with prayer so eight prayer is one of these things that we have to know and learn how to do we move on to the first hadith the first hadith was narrated by abdullah umar may allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi sallam abu bakr and rumor they all used to offer salatur a deni before delivering the khutbah so from this we learn that eighth prayer is composed of a prayer and it's composed of a sermon and the scholars all agree that the sermon has to be after the khutbah so it is unlike juma in friday prayer we have the two sermons and then we have the prayer in eight is the other way around we have the prayer and after that we have the sermon and we will insha allah talk about more of this when we go through this chapter hadith number 142 may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam delivered the khutuba after offering the prayer on the day of nahar that is the day of slaughtering so redu has another name which is the read or the day of nahar nahar means slaughtering and we all know that in eid part of the rituals is that you offer a sacrifice and we will come inshaallah to mention some of the rulings regarding this issue he said the prophet of allah whoever offers the prayer like us and slaughters like us then his sacrifice his nusuk will be accepted by allah and whoever slaughters his sacrifice before the eid prayer then he has not done the sacrifice may allah be pleased with him said o prophet of allah i've slaughtered my sheep before the eight prayer and i thought today as a day of eating and drinking and i liked that my sheep should be the first to be slaughtered in my house so i slaughtered my sheep and took my food before coming for the prayer and he's asking is this okay because you've just said that this is not okay the prophet said alaihis salatu the sheep which you have slaughtered is just meat for eating and it is not sacrifice so abu burdha said o allah's prophet i have a young she-goat a female goat which is dearer to me than two sheep will that be sufficient as a nusuk as a sacrifice on my behalf the prophet alaihis salatu assalam said yes it will be sufficient for you but it will not be sufficient as a nusuk or a sacrifice for anyone else after you from this hadith we learn a number of lessons first of all the prophet salallahu salaam insisted on having the order and what is the order pray like we have prayed then slaughter and he clearly emphasized this by saying whoever slaughters before offering the prayer with us his slaughter would not be accepted as a sacrifice which means that the slaughtering for read for the aid of the slaughtering or the it has a time when does the time begin after prayer what prayer fajr after the prayer of eight so if someone slaughters after fajr before salah his slaughtering is not a sacrifice this is considered to be meat for eating he has no reward in that so it begins after salat when does it end the scholars say that you have four days which is the tenth and then the three days of tashriq the 11th the 12th and the 13th by sunset of the 13th this is the last time for you to slaughter if you did not slaughter before the sun sets your slaughter is not accepted as a sacrifice so we have four days and these four days are also days of celebration you are allowed to listen to the doof in them you are allowed to celebrate as the prophet said allah these days the days of tashriq are days of eating drinking and remembering allah and it is forbidden for a muslim to fast them the days of the shriek 11th 12th and the 13th are forbidden for muslims to fast them except for pilgrims who are unable to sacrifice their hadi they are entitled to fast three days in hajj and seven if they go back to their hometown so the scholars say that these four days are forbidden too fast as the prophet alaihis indicated and they also say that those who have a habit of fasting 13th 14th and 15th which are the white days in the hijra they cannot fast the 13th they may fast the 14th and the 15th and any other day but these four days are forbidden for them too fast we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah with assalamu alaikum and welcome back so now we know that the time of slaughtering starts after the prayer some scholars said that it should start after the after the sermon but the hadith clearly indicates that it starts after the prayer and why is that because scholars say that what is mandatory is to pray the prayer listening to the khutbah is not mandatory so a person who prays and leaves this is permissible and his prayer is accepted as eight prayer it is recommended for him to listen but it is not mandatory and i would feel and believe that it would be best that a person waits at least half an hour after the end of the prayer so that would be equivalent to the time of khutba approximately in the hadith the prophets highlighted alayhi salatusam that slaughtering before is not permissible and it would not be considered as sacrifice it is permissible but the meat would not be rewardable it would not be sacrifice may allah be pleased with him he stood up and asked the prophet allah that he thought that this day is a day of eating and drinking which is the fact the prophet said assam that the day of eid is a day of eating and drinking but he did not know about the issue of the slaughtering and the sacrifice must be after the prayer so he said that after fajr mashallah he slaughtered immediately and ate some of that so the prophet told him allah that this is not acceptable sacrifice why because it was performed before time so one of the conditions of the sacrifice that it is to be performed on time and from this we also learn that there is a difference between things that are not permissible to do and things that are mandatory for you to do the things that you are told not to do in arabic they are called things that you should avoid and not do and the things that you are instructed to do are known in arabic as murat so what is the difference the scholars say if you do something that is something that you were not supposed to do out of negligence or out of forgetfulness you have no penalty and there is nothing wrong on you but if you do not do something you're obliged and told and instructed to do then there is penalty for you whether you're sinful or not this is beside the point can you give us an example i'll give you an example in prayer you are told not to carry any impurity on your body your clothes or the place you pray in what happens if i forgot and i pray scholars say your prayer is valid what happens if for example as we know in you're not permitted to clip your nails correct you're not permitted to cut your hair correct you're not permitted to put perfume correct you're not permitted to wear trousers these are all known as things you're not supposed to do during however if someone does any of these things does he have to pay expiation the answer is no if he had done them out of ignorance he didn't know that he shouldn't do this or out of forgetfulness i'm in my and someone says would you like some perfume nice and then what is this i'm not supposed to do this or if someone forces you at gunpoint you have to cut your hair and this is at gunpoint in this case you are exempted from paying any expiation as scholars say why because you're not supposed to do this you're told not to do it now on the other side is what the things that we must do so scholars say for example you are told to pray after you perform muddle so if someone forgets to perform mudu and praise what do we say about his prayer his prayer is invalid he has to offer wudu and then pray again likewise in hajj a person is obliged he is instructed he is ordered to make his from the designated place for him to wear the haram and to have his intention if he doesn't if he passes the mirkat and after passing the mikhail he makes his we tell him that you have done something that is wrong and you have to slaughter a sheep he said i forgot no excuse he said i didn't know we say inshallah you're not sinful but to rectify what you have done you have to slaughter ashi so now we learn from this hadith that things you're instructed to do there is no compromise abu burda slaughtered before time what to do this is not good it would not suffice likewise someone comes and says sheikh i prayed the first rakah of maghrib and then the imam called for the adhan i didn't know that it was not time yet so we say to him one of the conditions of prayer is that the time enters the time is due and because you prayed before the time was due your prayer is invalid you have to pray again among the things that we learn from this hadith abu badr said prophet of allah i have a young female goat and to me it's dearer than two sheep what does that mean scholars explain this hadith by saying you are not permitted to sacrifice any kind of animal there is a certain age you can only sacrifice a camel or whatever is from the family of camels a cow or whatever is from the family of cows and a sheep or goat or whatever is from their tribes or from their species can you sacrifice a horse answer is no a mule no can you sacrifice a deer the answer is no can i sacrifice chicken the answer is no these are known as behemoth this is the only thing that you can sacrifice but there are conditions there is a certain age for example the camel has to be at least five years of age or more so if i sacrifice a four-year-old camel this is not accepted and the cows they have to be two years and more so if i sacrifice a cow that is younger than that like our friend here then this is not accepted and for the goats it has to be one year and older less than one year is not accepted and enough which is dearer to him that two sheep was younger than a year so he said the prophet of allah yes it is young i know the age but by allah it is so big and huge it has so much meat that it is more precious to me than two sheep and what is the age of accepted sheep six months so if you have sheep that is below six months this is not accepted above six months this is accepted and sacrificed so is it okay if i slaughter it the prophet saw salaam made an exception for abu burdham and he said only for you i will permit that you slaughter this goat that is lesser than or younger than one year but this would not be sufficient or accepted from anyone else so this is a special pyramid for abu burdha from the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam here in india i know because i receive a lot of emails and i've written something about this that a lot of the people slaughter one sheep for every person of the family so if you have in your family 10 members they slaughter 10 sheep and they think that this is mandatory and it is not the prophet alaihis salaam slaughtered two sheep and he said one or two rams is it one on behalf of me and my household and the other one is on behalf my ummah especially those who cannot afford it so is it mandatory to slaughter a sheep for every member of the family the answer is no is it recommended well it's a form of charity if you want to do it and you have the means to do it this is permissible why because the prophet saw sent his sacrifice to be sacrificed in mecca while he was residing in medina and he also offered in hajj 100 sacrifice for though we know that he needs only one he offered 100 camels so it is permissible for you to slaughter one or two or ten or hundred or thousand because all of this is for the sake of allah however do not do it if you think it's mandatory do not do it if you don't have money and do not do it so that people would not talk about you and say this man our neighbor our friend he is not a proper muslim he's not generous he only slaughtered one because this is the sunnah if you want to do more and you have the financial means to do more this is okay but again you have to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages because especially in aid a lot of the people have especially the poor people have a lot of meat so when you give them meat they tell you we'd like rice we'd like clothes we'd like you to pay the bill of the electricity we like medication so it's best to vary and change rather than flood the people with meat when they have extra amounts of it i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
