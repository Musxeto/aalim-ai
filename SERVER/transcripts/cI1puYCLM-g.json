  "transcript": "I would like to ask what is the ruling of drawing living creatures in a whiteboard as a teacher because sometimes we would like to make an educational more fun to the student so maybe I would like every now and then to draw something maybe doing some Pictionary game and then after the class is dismissed I will immediately erase the pictures is this permissible cheap okay first of first of all it is not permissible for a Muslim to draw living creatures this is fixed from the authentic hadiths of the Prophet is making those who imitate and mimic Allah's creation to be the worst being tormented on the day of judgment and this is really scary the most severely punished on the day of judgment are those who imitate and mimic drawings of Allah's creation meaning living creatures you can draw plants and trees and and Landscape without a problem but when it comes to humans Birds animals Etc this is prohibited you can avoid this by avoiding facial features so if you draw a cellulite of a man without Fish facial features you draw the body of a giraffe without its head only the neck and the body this is permissible inshallah whether you erase it afterwards or not doesn't make any difference"
