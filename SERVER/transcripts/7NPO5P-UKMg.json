  "transcript": "Smith manova him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen vos allah wa sallim ala muhammadin wa ala mean sayidina wa ma mean Albertina muhammad while early he was so happy he a German I'm a bad dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato women around the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam words can explain things that are unexplained words can describe mountains huge oceans strong fortresses but when words come to describe this lawful trustworthy honest righteous caring loving wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam words fail to do her justice how can words describe a woman whom allah azzawajal made her the mistress of women in paradise she's the leader of women of this world and all other worlds the Prophet said alayhi salat WA Salam there were many men who reached human perfection however there were only four among the women that reached that level among them this lawful wife a beloved woman to the heart of our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam she believed in him when everybody accused him of lying she took him in when people rejected him she gave him her wealth and money when people held to their wealth and refused to share any of it with him whenever he was in distress she would comfort him whenever he was faced by the people of Quraish accusing him of lying and he was depressed and saddened by that she would bring joy to his heart we are talking about Hadiya the mother of the believers omul awesome the daughter of Hawaii amino acid mo Abdullah Rosa even opposed a blue Caleb elope or Ashiya to a cedilla she is the mother of all of our prophet's children early his salat wa sallam with the exception of the brahim in mecca d used to describe her as the flower of mecca she was the mistress of all women of Quraysh married twice and after her second husband died she refused to get married again she was a wealthy woman a woman of honor known for her intellect and wisdom the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam worked for her and traded in her wealth she was amused with his honesty she was happy with the Prophet he made through trading though everyone acknowledged that he was truthful and honest he didn't cheat he didn't lie she liked him as a person and as a man so when someone said why not marry him she didn't think twice one of her friends talked to the prophet alayhi salatu salam proposed to him the Prophet thought to himself who could be a better wife than this wise woman who's all dignitaries of Haresh are looking forward to get married to her but she's not accepting any of them so she she was fortunate to get married to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he was 25 years of age and she was 40 years of age 15 years older than him already married twice having children from her previous husband's they did not deter the Prophet Isis lamb from marrying her though he was only 25 years of age and he wasn't wrong this honorable woman had the greatest impact on our prophet's life at a his salat wa salam she furnished life to him to be as suitable as possible where she never bothered him occupied his time she never nagged him she never put any type of responsibility on his shoulders she made him a king in her house having to care for nothing but to rest to have his peace of mind even when he wanted to be in seclusion with Allah she would help him assist him prepare food for him and let him go to the cave of Hira stay there for days and nights sometimes she goes her self to get him food and drink just to make him rest and have the peace of mind and even when he was terrified for the first time of his life when receiving the revelation through gibreel peace be upon him he came to her shaking petrified scared confused she did not shout at him she did not blame him for going for days without end in seclusion rather she comforted him and said by Allah Allah will not turn you down your kind to the needy you help those who are in need of help you feed the poor Allah would never turn you down this great woman lived with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam for 25 continuous years the longest any woman had lived with our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam never ever once the books of ceará had mentioned a negative thing about her not even once not a single thing never it was reported that she had a fight with the Prophet al-islam or even a difference of opinion she was like a cold breeze never harm harming anyone and this was her greatest impact in the life of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam she had never ever asked for something for herself never whatever the Prophet wanted or needed that is awesome it was always there even when revelation was given to him she stood by his sight she was the first human being the first soul to believe in him he was in stress he confide in her he told her what had happened he thought that he was getting mad he had seen and heard things that he had never ever had or encountered in his life she was always there to comfort him no matter how many times people accused him of lying whenever he went back to Khadijah Khadijah comforted him and brought joy to his soul whenever he was sad she would always give him the glad tidings of what Allah has for him whenever he was abused physically she was always there for him believing in him supporting and him until he or until she met her Lord and died even when the revelation was paused for a number of days and pagans and the idol worshipers of Mecca started ridiculing the prophet sallallaahu asylum by saying that your Lord has left you allah azza wajal revealed the verses what boo ha well lady either Suja your Lord has not taken leave of you O Muhammad nor has he detested you and then Allah Azza WA JAL counts the favours upon His Messenger and among them Allah says and he found you poor and made you self-sufficient even in the Quran Allah is mentioning the favor and the blessing of his upon our Prophet Allah so Sam through mother Khadijah she's the one who gave him her wealth and made him self-sufficient the prophet alayhi salat wa salam loved rhodesia beyond what we can imagine a love that true love stories fall short from coming close to this is true love this is true affection it's not what you write and say while your heart is totally the opposite true love is portrayed in such situations long after her death the Prophet kept on mentioning her name talking about her attributes praising her though she's dead always asking Allah to forgive her sins all right show me Allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers the most beloved wife to the Prophet at his arms heart once got jealous so she said to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam allah has substituted you from that old woman meaning herself that look at me I'm a virgin wife of yours I'm young and beautiful allah azza wajal has compensated you from that old woman who's fifteen years older than you the Prophet la Salsa was outraged so angry that aya was scared she said I didn't know how to fix this so I started doing my prayers Oh Allah if the prophet alayhi salatu salam forgives my mistake and his anger is gone I will never mention Khadijah with anything that is negative then the Prophet said to her Aristotle Sam what did you say by Allah Khadija believed in me when everybody said that you are a liar Khadija took me in when people take me out Khadija gave me the children when Allah deprived me children from you all and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam stayed for a whole month repeating these words to aisha reminding her of the status of Khadija compared to all other women this is loyalty this is true love when even a statement that is said jokingly cannot pass in peace especially with a caliber such as the calibre of mother hadiza may Allah be pleased with her and this is why there is no wonder that gibreel comes to the prophet alayhi salatu salam once and said o prophet of allah Khadija is coming with a tray with food and drink for you if she comes read the Salam to her from Allah and from me and give her the glad tidings in or of a house in Paradise made of a pearl which has no tiresome and there is no loud noise so there is no work for her in Jannah and she will be in a calm environment no noises or loud sounds scholars say that this is in the word for her in exchange of what she had done to the Prophet as Salam in her house where the Prophet never had to work and he had a so Sam was always in a comfortable environment no shouting no nagging no problems the Prophet Allah saw Sam always remembered Khadija wherever he slaughtered the sheep he would dedicate parts of it to her friends send this to so-and-so she was a friend of hadisha send this to so-and-so she was a good friend of hadisha and the love kept on flaming and igniting in his heart though she was long gone and dead her sister halibut waited whenever she knocked the door seeking permission to see the prophet alayhi salat wa salam she would say as-salam-o-alaikum at home and when the Prophet I some heard her voice it reminded him of Khadija and he would say Allahu Mahalo let it be Hal the sister of hadisha she would come in and he would talk to her and give her time and give her what money and gifts because she was the sister of the love of his life she reminded him of hadisha and people did not know that this strong leader muhammad salallahu alaihe wasalam had this great affection and love and compassion to that great woman even after her death I will assume the rabbir the cousin of Xena the daughter of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam she's the eldest of the prophet's daughters I will ask who's the son of had married his cousin and they lived happily until the Prophet s era migrated to Medina the people of Quraysh insisted that he divorces his wife because her father was Muhammad our enemy and he refused he was a man of honor he didn't accept Islam but he did not fight the Muslims and he was captured among the prisoners of war on the Battle of better though he did not fight but he was with his people so the prophet alayhi salatu salam sent to the people of Quraysh if you want your prisoners of war sent ransom money so that we can set them free his wife zina she was in Mecca she sent money as a ransom to be given to the Muslims to set her husband free when the money came to the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam with it was a locket a necklace this necklace Khadijah gave it to Zeynep on her wedding night as a gift Zana to pay off the ransom of her husband collected all the money she had and she had this locket this necklace that was the most valuable thing in her life and she included it with the money and sent it as a ransom when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam saw this locket when he saw this necklace his heart was torn he remembered Khadija he remembered his love to her he addressed the Muslims and he said if you see it fit that you set her prisoner free and sent back what she had paid as ransom this is up to you I am The Messenger of Allah but I cannot force something upon you when the Companions saw how emotional our prophet alayhi salat wa sallam was just to see that locket that reminded him of that great woman hadiza they said we give it back without any need of any ransom or prophet of allah and they sent I will ask them near appear with the money and the locket back to his wife Zeynep the daughter of Muhammad alayhi salatu was-salam mother Khadija lived with the prophet alayhi salatu salam 15 years before him becoming a prophet and ten years after him becoming a prophet she went in to share ABI talib when at the end the Idol worshipers surrounded all the Muslims in part of Mecca and they made an embargo so that no one would sell them anything or buy from them anything they were starving and the infants were crying without any possibility of food getting in Khadija chose to be with her husband this rich woman who had always lived in mansions enjoyed the best of food self accepting to be in this isolation for three years with her husband and the rest of the Muslims and after this embargo was lifted and the Muslims went back to their homes in Mecca she stayed for six months only to pass away and died peacefully to go to Allah Jenna leaving the prophet alayhi salatu salam to be heartbroken saddened but accepting that what is awaiting for her at the sight of allah is better than staying in this life this is the mistress of the women in paradise this is the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this is my mother and your mother Khadijah been to Hawaii it may allah azzawajal be pleased with her either Allahu Alem when especially ill me Leahey Aslam o sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he wore a saudi he nabina muhammad a silly whiny como rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh today I'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader Abu hooray oh brother allahu anhu said that a man came to the prophet of allah salallahu alayhi wa salem and said o Messenger of Allah poverty has struck me the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sent a messenger to one of his wives to bring something for that man to eat but she said by the one who sent you with the truth I only have water he's on allah alayhi wasallam sent to another one of his wife's to bring something for the man to eat but she said the same until all of them said the same thing then Allah is missing Jesolo Hadi who has said him said who will take this one as a guest in exchange for a loss mercy a man from the on saw said I will o Messenger of Allah so he took the man to his home and said to his wife treat the guest of Messenger of Allah well she said by Allah we have nothing except the meal for my children he said get the food ready and light the lamp and put your children to sleep if they ask for dinner then when the guest enters dim the lamp and make it seem as if we are eating and when he reaches for the food to eat then stand up to the lantern and turn it off she got the food ready turned the lamp on and put the children to sneak she even went to the lamp as if she was fixing it and turned it off then they pretended as they were eating and they both went to sleep hungry in the morning the man from the Ansan went to Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who said Allah has loft implying his acceptance to the D from your actions last night then Allah reveal he's saying which means and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that reported by al-bukhari and muslim assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back Samia says how should we treat our non-muslim parents and siblings should we meet them on their religious occasions just to maintain ties of kinship well Samia these are two different things now your kinship would you remain your kinship no matter what so as long as they do not express enmity towards Islam and the Muslims and they are your siblings your parents your loved ones your kinship you must maintain ties of kinship and this differs from how close they are to how far so those who are close to you like your brothers and sisters you have to contact them you have to send them gift you have to check on them if they're poor you have to help them if they are in need you have to assist them and this is connecting to your kinship and if they're cousins or second or third or fourth cousins then maybe a phone call every now and then we need you see them in weddings and when you see them in family gatherings or sending them SMS is whatever is convenient for you and would at the same time be considered as tying the kinship ties of kinship and connecting it attending their religious occasions is a different thing all together it is totally prohibited for a Muslim to attend the religious occasions or the innervated occasions of the disbelievers so by default Muslims cannot attend Christmas gatherings cannot attend Easter cannot attend anything that is religion related such as funerals weddings in houses of worship set such as temples synagogues or even churches this is part of religion that we must draw the line also occasions such as new year though is not related to Christianity but it is imitating that the non-believers the disbelievers and this is not for Muslims to attend Halloween Thanksgiving though they are not religion related but again it is not part of our customs so it is totally prohibited to attend this and you can visit them when there are no such occasions and there is no problem that ish Allah zeyneb says how many names does the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam muhammad have and what is the difference between a name and a safe hat some people say he had two names and some say he had 99 names whenever I used to give them reference from Sahih Muslim and say hey Hari saying that he has five names they say those are not names please explain me about this well it is exactly how you had described it the prophet alayhi salat wa salam have names and he said in one hadith narrated by Bukhari and Muslim I have several names I am Hamid and I am Ahmed and I am Alma he which means the eraser by means of whom Allah erases Cofer and I am al hasha which means the gatherer at whose feet the people will be gathered and I am Allah paper meaning the last which means that after whom there will be no other prophet or messenger he also said inside him a Muslim that he mentioned several names of his and he said I am hammock and I met and almalfi the last succession and al herschel the gatherer and the prophet of repentance Nabil Rama or the prophet of mercy so these are what is authentic everything else would be considered as a description so you can describe the prophet alayhi salat wa salam with so many things such as al-mansour Ybor or the one who is granted victory through all this is a description not a name but unfortunately some people went into extreme when it comes to the Prophet Allah salah salem and this is what he himself told us to be careful and not to fall into a loo hulu to be in extreme so they said ok allah has 99 names our prophet as some has 99 names a stock for allah are you saying that the Prophet is like Allah no no no we're not saying that but they both have 99 names this is what you're saying ok can I enter your message suggests you're more than welcome these are our message you go to the message you find a circle with the name of Allah and another circle the same size with the name of Muhammad stop for a lot like what are you guys doing you're saying allah mohamet as if they are peers and identical this is not possible this is not permissible and this is why people went the extra mile in almost falling into blasphemy so they are giving our profit at HSN because Shaitaan is manipulating and messing with their minds and he says you love prophet muhammad allahumma salli wa sallam oh yes I do love him so you have to show and prove it what do you want me to do well you have to praise him I praise him I always offer salutation upon him so no no no this is not enough okay I'm growing my beard to follow his Sunnah no no not enough what then you have to say that he was created from the light of Allah there was a how do we learn how do you say such a thing not only that he controls the universe only Allah controls the universe no no he delegated this to Muhammad Ali so son and he sees everything as it's a fee as if he's however another and he looks at his palm of his hand and he can see the whole world this is shirk what are you doing this is how Shaitaan is messing up with them so don't pay them any attention we have a caller from Mustafa Mustafa why are you come surround Allah is it most of our almost over okay yes what can I do for you yeah actually brother I needed to ask this question that during the last third of the night Allah comes down to the lowest heaven and he listens to the prayers of whoever calls him now I need to know if a woman is from menstruating during that period she cannot create the Hydra so whenever she is praying how can she pray and how can she ask Allah subhana WA Ta'ala for her prayers to be listened and like what is the way how will I listen to her okay any more questions No thank you so much I will answer you Shana so Zach Allah here mrs. Mustafa she says we know that Allah Azza WA JAL as in the hadith descends to the lower heaven when the last third of the night is due and of course when you read this any Muslim would think that Allah as attributes are not like ours so his descent descent would not be like ours so we can't try to figure out how that is possible because thinking about it is impossible so you believe in it as it is without thinking that a Las descent is like human beings descent and allah azzawajal has the highest example so we believe as in it as it is without trying to figure it figure it out now she says that in the hadith the Prophet solemn says when Allah descends to the lower heaven he says helman Mustela fearing for all fear Allah is there anyone seeking forgiveness so I'd forgive him help me sir 18:40 is anyone asking me so I get I would give him Hellman there in Fallujah boy is anyone calling so that I would answer him so she says this happens in the last third of the night now a woman in her period how can she do that there is no problem none whatsoever in the hadith the Prophet didn't say that this person calling Allah or asking for something or seeking forgiveness has to be in prayer if you are raising your hands and saying oh Allah forgive me o Allah give me oh Allah answer me and I will answer you so a lot of the women when they get their monthly period they feel devastated depressed that as if Allah doesn't love them I would have allowed this is Satan messing with your mind this is something that a himself decreed upon you as women so if it takes place you should be content and happy because this is what Allah chose for you this is not your doing so no one can blame you for it so the only thing you cannot do is pray but you can read the Quran you can make duaa you can make vicar you can do whatever you want except prayer so there's no problem in that insha'Allah none whatsoever bushra says what is the concept of given fatiha on food is this permissible well Bushra Muslims as stated before many times they're either extreme or negligent and this is the doing of Shaitaan real Muslims are in the middle path following the Quran the Sunnah that's why they're always steadfast they never change they don't have many faces those who are not well founded on Islam those who are deviant you will find them come off lodging one year they say something the following year they change they adopt another opinion and you see them flopping from one place to the other now some would say that this is how evolves no hey this has nothing to do with the evolution of fit this has to do with how you change and flip sides depending on the current so how is everybody doing if the pressure is so great I can budge I may be willing to change a lot those who work according to the Quran and Sunnah they're always steady rarely you find them change their colors for the highest bidder therefore Bushra you have to look into how Shaitaan works is he tending to have people go to extreme or to be negligent when people love Islam Shaitaan comes to them and innovates things makes make them extreme he tries to bring things that are not part of the Deen and convincing them that they're getting closer to Allah by that and this is what's happening Fatiha the greatest chapter in the Quran no doubt about it did the Prophet as some recited before going to bed no should we do it well it's the greatest surah in the Quran why not no a fee I'll tell you why not if the Prophet didn't do it and you think that you're doing something better than him or you know more than him what more evil do you need to be to be an advocate of Shaitaan so the Prophet didn't do it I Suzanne you should not do it when did the Prophet recite Fatiha in rakia he approved as in the hadith Audrey people to read it in rakia so it's the best rocky around where else in the salat where else that's it what do you mean by that's it we Muslims read Fatiha whenever there is a marriage contract being conducted so after we propose and they accept tea huh this is an innovation what all muslims do it ok listen to me read my lips if the Prophet did not do it if it's not mentioned the Quran if not mentioned the sooner it's an innovation even if the whole earth is doing it it's streams and innovation did the Prophet ever do it no did the Companions ever do it no it's an innovation ends up sorry okay but we also do it whenever we remember someone who died so my uncle died last week Oh may Allah forgive him let's read the Fatiha for him why would you need the Fatiha for him well this is what everybody else doing innovation bid ah come on share everything is better okay either you bring me evidence from of the Quran or the Sunnah and I'll read it with you or it is a better so now this cascaded to all forms of our life now people mothers prepare food and they recite the fact and they make you eat it what are you doing said for Baraka okay why don't you read sortelha cross as well okay why not why don't you read al-baqarah the food will be cold you decided to open this Pandora Box for innovation what are you doing so people are listening to Shaytan and following his footsteps you as a Muslim it is your duty to cleanse all of these inherited thoughts and practices from your fathers and forefathers and look at them through the filter of Quran and Sunnah if it is not existing in the Quran or in the Sunnah throw it into the garbage and don't look back watch it says can we play video games my brother plays videos video games constantly and is losing his grades and does not pray on time how to make him quit well Rajat this is not your job it's your father's job how to make him quit unplug his video Council and take it away video games can be halal can be Haram using this pen can be halal if I'm asked writing your questions and can be Haram if I'm writing a love letter to someone who is an unmanned so you can't brush it with any paint it with the same brush you have to look into it a video game that leads to Haram is Haram this goes without saying so if distracts you from praying on time it is totally Haram if it is if it distracts you from doing what's mandatory upon you such as studying and doing well at school it becomes Haram if it becomes addictive and you can't live or breed without it it becomes Haarlem let alone if it had women if it had music if it had her arm seized if you are representing the u.s. army killing Muslims if there's excessive violence if there is sorcery or bringing life to the dead etc this goes without saying it's Hana so what kind of video games can be played sure you can play tennis you can play go-karting and racing like Mario and the Nintendo stuff Luigi I think is a name you use things that are Halong yeah this is ok but when it becomes addictive and it makes you flunk your school and miss your salat this is totally prohibited your father simply unplug the machine and throw it throws it in the dustbin or makes it and it as an incentive for your brother to pray on time and to do well in his homework in school then we will allow him an hour a week then this might be ok Romar says my sister and brother-in-law gifted me money as a birthday gift I do not celebrate birthdays and have advised my family in relation to this on several occasions what should I do with the money gifted if I try to return it they will not accept no don't return Atari what is prohibited is to celebrate birthday what is prohibited is to be with them in a gathering or a cake or blowing off candles what is prohibited is for you to exchange birthday greetings but to accept the gift there's no problem in that none whatsoever root he says we know that it is prohibited to play games with dice what if we played Ludo online will it still be Haram the answer is yes though it's virtual but the concept of dice is there virtually so the selection of how much you got from one to six from the dice is still there and hence it is Haram sumaya says what is the ruling on women discharges what about yellow discharge and discharges due to infection this is an issue of dispute vaginal discharge which is the white transparent liquid that comes from women it's like sweat and the most authentic opinion is that it does not break your Wordle and it is not necess but if there are other discharges that are not the normal vaginal discharges such as yellow excessive yellowish discharge that is different from the white discharge or if it's an infection that is having a resulting in such discharge these are nudges and you have to perform woudl whenever you see them and cleanse them when you get them the last question is from psycho says for attending daily classes in college or everyday chores is it allowed for a Muslim hijab' girl to ride a scooty this is not permissible in my opinion because when you ride a motorcycle or a scooty or a bike your figure as a woman is clear so you can see a woman's back a woman's waist a woman's buttocks and a woman thighs clearly even if she's wearing abaya not only that it is extremely dangerous if she were to fall or you have an accident and this is something that a woman must not put herself into such situations and hence my own opinion is that this is not permissible and a large L knows best this is all the time we have for tonight's episode I'm not sure if tomorrow we're going to continue the same time there is a possibility that we may shift the program to be at 1300 hours which is 1 o'clock p.m. afternoon in Mecca time but this is still ambiguous not certain we will - Allah notify you on our Twitter accounts and Facebook so until we meet tomorrow I leave you via Manila what said maricon what about allahi wa barakato"
