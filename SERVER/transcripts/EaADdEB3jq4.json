  "transcript": "is it permissible for me to say one day montana which means i bow down to my mother's land on their mataram okay i will answer you inshallah his third and last question he said that a phrase which translates to i bow to my mother country no this is not permissible to say or to do and i think there is something similar to that like in japanese or in in hindi it's called namaste or namaste or whatever and it means i bow to you and this is not permissible as well this is not permissible at all because we muslims only bow to allah even if the culture of my country or my tribe is to bow or to squat or to prostrate i do not do this because i'm a muslim first and my religion governs everything else and this is why we say um say that verily my prayers my sacrifice my life and my death are all for allah azzawajal i'm driven by the sharia by the quran the sunnah and not by the customs or the culture so saying such a statement is totally prohibited and allah knows best"
