  "title": "Do I need to obey my father to not go to masjid if he orders so for my safety #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my friend asks um once I told my father that I go pray in the Moss nearby my school in lunch break and he got very concerned and said that I should refrain from going to the Masid because it it's dangerous but he has never been there and it's pretty difficult for me to pray at school also there's a safe segregation area for women so I see no fitner when going to that Masid if I don't go there I fear missing or rushing my prayer at school so is it an obedience for me towards my valy or can I continue going to that Masid because he has no valid reason as long as you go to the school which is most likely mixed and this by itself is Haram and dangerous and you're unable to pray on time or you fear that you may miss the prayer and you commute and go and to the school and back without any problem and the Masjid is next door there is nothing unsafe you you do not have to ask him you can go without any problem inshallah"
