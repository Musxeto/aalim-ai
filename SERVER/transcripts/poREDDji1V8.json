  "transcript": "I love you for the sake of may Allah love you back my question is during in order if we don't know the meanings of the Quran translation when the Imam is conducting can we look at the translation on our mobile so we can maintain the very much some Scholars say that this is permissible for those who do not know Arabic to look at the translation of the Quran while standing behind the Imam I personally I'm hesitant to accept such a ruling because I wouldn't be reading Allah's words rather I would be reading the meaning that was understood by a particular translator thinking that this is what Allah's words mean so definitely I'm not reading the words of Allah because I'm reading it in uddu or in English or even in Arabic while I'm supposed to do in Salat what I'm supposed to do is to listen to the reciter to the Imam reading Allah's Words which are the Quran in Arabic so this is what I feel and Allah Knows Best"
