  "transcript": "the prophet saysat whoever does not give up false speech and acting upon it and offensive speech and behavior whoever does not give up these things Allah has no need of his giving up his food and drink which means that we misunderstood the meaning of fasting Ramadan the majority of Muslims only refrain from eating and drinking and they think that this is fasting of Ramadan no it is far far more than that and this is why if you fast Ramadan and you lie if you fast Ramadan and you say obscene things and you do things that Allah is not pleased with then you have missed the whole point the prophet saysat Allah the almighty has no need of his giving up food and drink what is it so many people fast and they do not get any reward for that but the majority of us with the grace of Allah the majority of Muslims who fast with honor who let the guest in and giving him all the hospitality they can they they are the True Believers and they are the true Muslims they are the ones who calculate and count the days and the hours and the minutes in anticipation in preparation for this guest who is soon to come with the grace of Allah they are happy and jubilant because they know that a great season of get getting closer to Allah is soon to approach us so they're happy of this month coming in but why the month of Ramadan is so special what is so special about it it's very simple it is the month of Mercy it is the month of forgiveness it is the month that Allah blessed it so so that it would have and contain the greatest night of the the whole year it is Imagine One Night in this month is better than a thousand months and the majority of us don't even dream to live for a thousand months how many years is that 80 plus 80 plus years and the age the average age of the followers of prophet Muhammad is between 60 and 70 and seldom who would pass that and why is that Scholars say that Allah blessed the followers of Muhammad sallahu alai wasam because the previous Nations they used to live so many years and they would offer so many good deeds n peace be upon Him stayed in his people calling them to Islam for 950 years and that is why Allah is granting the followers of Muhammad sallallahu alaih Al wasallam this precious gift one night you worship Allah properly in it it's better for your record than a thousand months and you don't want us to welcome this honorable guest not only only that it is the month in the year that Allah revealed the Quran to the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and that is why it's known as the month of the Quran Shah Quran and the Quran by far is the final word the final Revelation that is of Allah and it is the miracle given to our Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam to the end of time this miracle that we put it and keep it behind our backs we do not study it we do not recite it we do not memorize it we only keep it in our glove compartments we keep it under the pillow we keep it in our houses as a as a form of protection and nothing protects you except Allah asael and this goes against the reason that Allah revealed the Quran it was revealed to be recited to be memorized to be honored and not to be put on the wall or in your glove compartment"
