  "title": "Can a Woman wipe over hijab while making Wudu in Haram Makkah?",
  "transcript": "AA says can a woman wipe over her hijab in Mecca since she's surrounded by strange men a lot of women ask about this issue and that is they don't want to take off their hijab when they're making woodoo they just want to wipe over their hijab saying that if we take off the hijab men would see our hair and this is not permissible well first of all what is the origin of wiping over what you wear on your head the Hadith that the prophet Alam wiped over the turban and wiping over the turban has conditions so am I allowed to wipe on what I I'm wearing on my my head at the moment scholer say no because it's easily removed and put back again I can do that without any difficulty the turban that the prophet and the companions used to wear was too difficult to wear and they say that it is the one that that goes underneath your chin so it goes on top of your head and then it goes underneath the chin and it is sort of uh locked on a person's head so this is difficult to remove like the turban that our brothers from Sudan for example where it takes a while to put on and to take off so if it is difficult to take off then in this case yes you can so now the sisters would like to have a similar rule when it comes to the scarves so that men could not see them but the problem is that if you're performing W in har and there are men around you how are you going to wash your arms definitely they will see that which is even worse than uh uh exposing part of your hair unintentionally so my the way I see it no this the answer is no you could easily do this from underneath your uh uh hijab uh uh you can do this underneath so this this is not a mistake I hope the director leaves the the camera as it is and without exposing your hair uh uh and there's no need for you to do uh anything else but in cases that it is extremely cold or in severe conditions where you have to uh do something of A Sort then in this case it's okay for you to wipe over it but with the same conditions display uh uh in the case of the man's turban"
