  "title": "Haram income of father not Haram for family, what about hadith of Abu Bakr vomiting food Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "he said that there is a hadith and the origin of his question is that usually when we are asked about a family member the father working in an interest-based bank and he deals in riba transactions or he sells alcohol in his shop and he brings the revenue and he feeds his wife and children what's the ruling on that the scholars say the reward and the benefit is for the people that he provides for his dependence and the sin and the burden is on the person earning so the sin is on him there's no sin on them because they're they're not collaborating with him and it is his responsibility to feed them so that the money becomes halal why does the money become halal because this is the origin in islam the prophet alaihis salatu was invited once by a jew woman to eat lunch so he went accepted their invitation the prophet knows that the earning of the jews is through usury and cheating people and dealing in interest yet he did he did not ask this woman did you buy this sheep from haram money or from halal money he simply ate which means that it is sinful for her to earn it is halal for us to eat and enjoy and therefore if a person and this is related to um the thick the third question of his if a person dies leaving a wealth which is mixed between haram money and halal money like a person working in a bank or an insurance company or sells intoxicants or sells cigarettes and tobacco and hookah or whatever they call it or sells deals in entertainment movies music all of this is haram earning so now he's dead and we have the inheritance what should we do with the money distribute it it is halal for you as heirs of the deceased he will be punished for it in his grave and on the day of judgment insha allah azza for its bad earning so now brother labe says okay i understood this concept of yours my issue is that there is a hadith where his servant once brought him food and abu bakr may allah please with him was fasting usually he asks where did you get the money from or where did you get the food from this time he didn't he ate one morsel then he remembered and he said where did you get this food from and the boy said when i was a slave at pre-islamic era i pretended to be a soothsayer so i predicted something in the future i didn't know anything about it or just you know uh conning them and they believed me now after islam and after so many years they saw me and they gave me this food so abu bakr kept on putting his finger and trying to throw out what he had eaten and he managed to do that with difficulty so he's asking me now if the earning of the servant was halal why did abu bakr throw it up first of all no one had ever done this except abu bakr all scholars say no one had ever threw up what they consumed of haram after knowing from the companions except a walker secondly the servant belongs to abu bakr the clothes on the servant is abu bakr a slave belongs to his master and everything he earns and that is why a slave can never inherit someone who's free so if a son is a slave and his father is free and the father dies the slave cannot inherit his father because then the master would take everything because i own the slave and what he possesses so i hope this answers your question"
