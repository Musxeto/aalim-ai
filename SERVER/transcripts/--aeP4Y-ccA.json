  "transcript": "uh recently in your Ramadan series you talked about the importance of learning so I wanted to ask you what books do you recommend to learn it and also do you have any playlist on your channel where you teach that well I don't know what is found in English but one of the elementary and good introduction to such a science is is the book of it's a booklet I think it's translated that would highlight this science beautifully and in Arabic there are so many books that are concise and good do I have anything in my series on my YouTube channel I think I did uh an introduction to it in peace TV like 14 years ago maybe I don't remember and it was about where I spoke about the difference in between and and an introduction to the legal maxims also known as the great General um f rulings so maybe that would be beneficial and Allah knows best but this science has to be studied with a because it depends greatly upon the Arabic language when you speak about and and and the likes and when it comes to speaking about um and the likes so you have to do it with a Sheikh so that he would explain it to you um rather than reading it on your own"
