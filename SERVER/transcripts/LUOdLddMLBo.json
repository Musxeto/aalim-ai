  "transcript": "the the sheh is saying that a couple of days ago he was in the Masjid attending a wedding and the groom's friend asked his mentor to deliver a reminder for the couple as he was doing this one other person stood up and shouted in the Masjid and said that this is not part of the Customs this is wrong this is this and this and he raised his voice in a very rude manner so the sheh is asking is this part of the religion first of all it is not permissible at all and we said this in the yesterday's lecture about the eates of the mid it is not permissible at all to raise your voice in the house of Allah these are the houses of Allah I remember once I was in again Indonesia and mashallah the mids are fully packed when you go and deliver a so they announced that I have a lecture and being of Indonesian descent you know hey blood so they came because I'm their blood and when I went into the Masjid one of the brothers stood and said and everybody Allah the whole Masid was shaking and from the entrance until I sat and they're saying and then I sat sat down and I said Subhan Allah if you guys did this in my house I would have kicked you out raising your voices like this in my home is disrespectful how dare you raise your voices like this in Allah's home there is nothing calling for I'm I'm coming to do Jihad why are you doing this and the guy is saying no she they're greeting you said this is not how you greet people this is the house of Allah so don't ever do this again please so by saying this what the brother did is wrong the guy is not doing Innovation he's giving a reminder now is it the right time or not the right time this depends on the people a lot of the people come to listen to something beneficial some people come to chitchat and eat biryani depending on the occasion so if someone is interested in listening to a reminder if people don't listen don't listen but to come and stand and make a scene and to be rude and to be disrespectful to the others as if you are the one in control or the one in knowledge as the Sheikh said in order to be knowledgeable you have to be polite Allah says in the Allah is addressing who Muhammad it is by the mercy of Allah that you have become lenient and soft to them had you been rude and Hard Hearted they would have dispersed and left you that yes so this is what we should always do walk to talk and Allah Knows Best"
