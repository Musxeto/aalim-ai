  "transcript": "is not it comes with finance it comes with care it comes with love it comes with fairness it comes with children and it is a lot of headaches so if you have the patience and tolerance do it and the money sorry money is very important if you don't well I hear he Johnny be pleased and satisfied with what you have because it is not something easy so I'm not the advocating and I'm not defending I'm not stopping a lot of the brothers as the sisters call and tell me they say my husband in the morning in the afternoon and before we go to bed he tells me I am going to get married I'm going to get married and this has been going for the past ten years and nothing happened the Prophet says erase auto salam in logic a table is an ala kulli shayin Allah has decreed that you make a sign on everything for either the bottom for a single vibhu so if you slaughter an animal make it quick when you hit the hadouken shaft rata and you should sharpen your blade while you're there be hotter and you should comfort your sacrifice now this is in regard to what - sacrificing ahi if you want to get married do the same don't kill your wife every single night I'm going to get married I'm going to get married and she has to be beautiful she has to be thin she has to look nice she has to do this everything that is not in your wife you're saying to her no Haram this is Haram and unacceptable you will not ever agree to your son-in-law to do this with your daughter or to your brother-in-law to do this with your sister so likewise do not do it if you have to do it plan it do it in your head once it's going to be done next week tell her I love you I do love you but I have to get married this is Allah's right to me and no one is asking why are you get married no one is supposed to why is your wife ugly none of your business this is personal does she have any problems health problems why does you need do I have just to justify myself when I get married and my invitation card I say I'm getting married with my second wife my first wife have have has the following one two three four five just so that you can come No so but I know most of you Shalala we will not do this but just in case you you you think of doing it it is not an easy thing and if you want to do it don't torture your wife conditions the acceptance of her guardian now if she accepts but the guardian does not accept the marriage does not take place in England or in English they say it takes two to tango of course tangoing is Haram except between a man and his wife on the sheet without any door you can do this but you cannot dance on music music is Haram you cannot dance with someone else and you cannot do this so if a man proposes to a girl she accepts the father refuses marriage is not void it should be stopped the opposite the guardian approves the girl refuses it should be stopped it cannot be forced they both have to agree there are circumstances that can be overridden in regards of the approval of the guardian when is that if he performs what is known as Apple Apple is to refuse without any justification or without any legitimate justification that is so if a father refuses his daughter to get married to a man because he wants her to work and to support him this is a duel if he refuses a man though is he's from the same culture from the same sect but because his beard is long and a lot of marriages were postponed or cancelled because of this and the sisters write to me then again yes this is Adam and a woman has the right to go against her father if the man is god-fearing is good and if her father is continuously refusing but I got an email few months back from a girl who's 17 years old and she says that and she started Hermia Malak saying sure I would like to go and complain about my father to the khadi because he's refusing my marriage to this man and she describes the man she's from India and he's from Pakistan I believe this is a big problem here so she says I'm going to complain to the to the kadhi because he's a different sect he's from Pakistan my father is refusing to give me in marriage to him does she have the right know why she's young she's 17 and this is the first man to propose when would the father be are doing a dull when five come or 10 come he's loosening from me okay so if this is what's happening if he stopped or rejected five or 10 people yes but if it's the first one or the second one and legitimate reasons he's afraid that if he gives his daughter to her marriage maybe he will go back to his country and then they would abuse her because she is from that country or from that country by the way that email came from England and they originally are from and the boys originally from but they live in England they're British yet they still have this jahiliya in them if it's a country in a country it's understandable but if you're in the same country and you've been living there and you'll still live there for the rest of your life this is on acceptable so the Guardian has to accept and approve the person proposing however not anyone can fit the description of Guardian there is a list of conditions for a person to be a guardian for example he has to be sane so if your guardian is insane if your father is 120 years old and he doesn't know the directions he doesn't know who you are sometimes you know with these diseases as heimer and and and etc may Allah protect us all and our parents and our loved ones if some of them some of my friends call and say my father has reached this age I come to the room and I say my father everything is fine is it who are you and I say I'm your son yeah what's your name he doesn't know so can this one give in marriage no he does not have his sanity also he has to reach the age of puberty a woman came and says share I have no guardian I'm a Muslim revert my parents are kafir and the only Muslim in my family is my seven years old boy can he become my wali the answer is no can he become her Muharram in travelling no he did not reach the age of puberty a lot of the sisters asked the same question I have my brother he's 13 years old I'd like to travel with him from here to Bombay is it possible is it permissible one of the sisters asked me a question on my Facebook I think three days ago saying that she lives four hours away from Chennai and she like to come and attend the course but she does not have a muharram her brother will take her to the train station and someone else would receive her and he is this permissible and I said yes if it's my course is okay no it's not it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a Muharram this is the fatwa from the prophets not from my pocket salah salem is the prophet s Amazon who gave this fatwa so the age of puberty is important you cannot travel with an eight or nine years old child but he would or she would be something to break the seclusion so if I want to go into a taxi she says and I have my nine year old child with me is this okay or am I being alone with the taxi driver the answer is it is okay though he or she did not reach age of puberty but they are sensible they can hear and listen and they can understand everything fishy is taking place so that yes they break the seclusion sisters are not liking this anyhow freedom he has to be free nowadays everybody is handle a free but before it was a possibility that the guardian is a slave and his daughter is free so in marriage can he become her guardian the majority of scholars say no and some scholars say yes because if he is sane and caring the decision might be his because he would care for his daughter and he would only accept those who are good for her but the majority of scholars say no he does not have the right to make decisions for himself the slave have rights to make decision for himself no kind of a slave buy and sell for himself make trade no because he belongs to his master so I am the master he wants to go for Hajj he doesn't have any Hajj if he was freed he has to make his Hajj for Islam as a free man but as a slave he has no hutch Jumma no Jumana sit so I sell him and I buy him he's my slave also he has to reach the state of what is this he has to be wise and mature in Arabic it's called Russian he has to reach the stage of rush does anyone have the name of Russia here huh rush it means wise and mature and this is a condition required in most forms of transactions and also in the form of worships what is meant by mature and wise is being able to select and choose the right thing that is why if a man does not have this in him his transactions are void if a man is not mature and wise we all know that he spends unwisely and he wants to go and buy something scholars say that the contract is void and he's called Sofia he spends without any recognition without any thinking and likewise in getting a lot of men are like this unfortunately someone talks to him he meets him in a restaurant and he says sure give me your daughter in marriage  sure do you know the man no do you know his name what he does know how do you accept sir I'm a man he requested something I give it to him this means that he is not mature in that wise that's why he cannot give that in marriage he has to be male male as in Mal II not in ma il so one says no male mail means that if a woman is separated from her husband and this happens a lot a woman is divorced since 20 years she raised her only girl and she loves her more than her life and someone proposes to the girl so the girl the woman refuses to take the approval of the father they've been separated for 20 years the girl herself does not care about her father he didn't ask for her for 20 years and the mother says I will be responsible for the marriage processions I am the guardian I will give my acceptance is this permissible the guardian has to be male and he has to be from the same religion so reverts sister who embraced Islam and accepted it alhamdulillah a brother proposes so we say okay he stopped here we will have to go and seek the approval of the guardian she says my father is Hindu okay your grandfather he see a lot of our color do you have any brothers CSE on Christian when a Jew what is this any Muslim relative of yours she says no no Muslim relatives does she seek the approval and consent of her father a lot of the reverts sisters live with their fathers they live with their families and the families are very good to her when it comes to marriage she says I cannot get married until my father approves of it you have no right to do this your father has no right on you at all because he is not Muslim so how what what could I do you go to the Muslim judge in your community the Muslim judge he becomes your guardian and he says that this man is suitable or no Jeff we live in America we don't have any Muslim judge what to do go to the Islamic Center the biggest Islamic Center that is expected and go to the Imam and the Imam assumes the position of your guardianship the Prophet says is awesome the salt on the ruler is the Guardian to those who do not have guardians type in our courts here Hanafi school of thought we come and say we don't have a guardian and they just say you are your own guardian so can I marry myself the answer is the Prophet says and Sumner's and the hadith lani kaha in Lobby wali there is no marriage valid without a wedding so you have to stop Cher okay let me ask this question sisters who married without a wali don't be shy mashallah draw sorry okay I know that there are because I get a lot of emails what to do if a woman married without already if she believes that this is acceptable to her mother and the mother / husband and they believe and follow this school of thought and not to beat around the bush some scholars say that the marriage is correct however it is extremely important to just theoretically make it again by the buzz band who has been married for 20 years going to her guardian her father her brother and telling him give me your sister or your daughter in marriage and he says okay two witnesses that there Hollis just to be on the safe side but if one wants to initiate it no the marriage is void this is unacceptable because the prophets have some words come in front come ahead of any school of thought as Muslims one of the most controversial conditions is that he is trust worthy and what is meant by trustworthy in Arabic it's called adalah he has to be trustworthy if you go to the books of book 200 or 300 years ago you will find that none of us is considered to be trustworthy imagine one of the things that makes a person a person not trustworthy is to eat a sandwich in the street four hundred years ago it used to be considered part of the things that a person's testimony would be rejected if you eat a sandwich in the street why because say this is unworthy of someone trustworthy this is something that only low people do nowadays can we apply this condition McDonald's will sue us KFC will kill us everybody's eating in the street so nowadays it's okay five six hundred years ago to be like this would not be acceptable you have to wear a cap you have to wear a turban nowadays it has nothing to relate to Islam because the Prophet did not do it is o Salaam or instead actually he did not instruct us to do it so why should I cover my head another woman I don't I can go this like this in public and nowadays the scholars say part of being trustworthy is to abide by the Islamic law in your appearance because this is how I judge you do I know what you do when you go into your house and close your doors No so how can I classify you as being trustworthy or not by your appearance so if someone is shaved this is not trustworthy why because this is clear disobedience to the Prophet Haslam if someone smokes he is not trustworthy if someone works in a bank he's not trustworthy Shara Brahimi says if you apply this nowadays none of us can be trustworthy and he said then then this condition is not an acceptable because a lot of the time shaving the beard has nothing to do with my love to my daughter this is the same by itself but I have great love to my daughter and hence I would only choose the best for her so she write a mean and this is the most authentic says that this cannot be measured precisely so a person who smokes a person who shaves his beard a person who has sins that appear on his exterior does not affect his choice to his daughter and hence they consider it not to be as specific I can propose to a girl and her father is working in a bank interest based and I would not say excuse my uncle please can you ask your son to come you're not trustworthy or uncle please stop smoking and then I can propose to you or uncle no as long as he cares for his daughter and he chooses the right thing for her then hamdulillah now we move on to the rights of the wife the trick here is marriage you have to understand this a marriage is built on two pillars modesty these are my pillars not marriage pillars one to recognize your responsibilities and obligations to to know your rights now the gents and the ladies they all know their rights and this is all what they know they never think of their obligations they never think of their responsibilities so this is devoted to who gents or ladies no no now this is devoted to the gents now this is the rights of your wife you have to know them you have to fulfill them you have to honor them and some of them are found in the characteristics of a husband so you will find some duplication but now this is what you have to put as a compass in front of you what you want to treat your wife learn your obligations 1 protect her from Hellfire this is your number one priority how to do that Jen's how do we do that teach your Islam good more they don't know how to protect her from Hellfire because they're you know scanning all the things they want is know this takes her to hell this takes her to hell this thing what can I do the first thing to protect her from Hellfire is to take her out from my father's house where she sits and mixes with my brothers this texture to help directly nonstop flight I don't want this so I'm not going to tell this to the Sheikh the second one she has to cover but if she covers then how will she live with my brothers and my mother will be angry and whenever she puts the hijab my mother says always take the high job that you're there like your brothers this takes her to hell my she come on what's what else she works with in a mixed environment with men she has friends and this is a very quick way to help forget this I don't want her to pray fetch it because if we pray that sprays fragile on time she's going to wake me up and then I will not be able to go to sleep after fajar and I have to work at nine o'clock yeah okay everything is in your life Lee is taking her to help share can we change this well I can't sorry I cannot with the price you're paying me may be stuck for lovely okay you have to come up you have to come up with ways to protect your wife from hell are you doing this does Allah tell us to protect them from hell what is the iron the sisters know it more than the brothers yeah you Halloween a man ooh-ooh protect and push a comb yourself voila comb and your family's from Hellfire this is instructional of Allah so you'll mention twice in the quran surat al-baqara and surah tehreem so you have to protect her from Hellfire and this is done by a number of things a number of ways the best is teaching her but there is the second best which is a must is implementing it Janna my wife I could teach her Islam from A to Z but if I don't practice I am the first one to be thrown into hell she'll follow Jesus"
