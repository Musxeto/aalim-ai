  "title": "Punishments for men for wearing their garments below the ankles!",
  "transcript": "Third question was wearing the trousers under the ankles. Is it a minor sin or is it a major sin? Now the most authentic opinion is that it varies but in both cases it is a major sin. Why does it vary? First of all, because the prophetam prohibited it. But in some hadiths, he tells us that the punishment is that Allah torments the area that exceeds the ankles in hell. This is the only punishment. In other hadiths, the prophet saysam Allah does not look at a person who drags his garments below the ankles in pride. And in a third and crystal clear hadith, the prophet places for punishment that three, allahel will not look at them, will not p purify them, will not uh um have mercy on them and Allah would give them strong or severe torment in hellfire. So the prophet mentioned the first one or the first category is So the scholars compared apple to apple and said that the difference in torment and punishment cannot be on the same sin. If you add to that the hadith of Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him when he heard this hadith and said, \"Oh prophet of Allah, I'm a thin man. I'm a skinny person and I try my level best to get my uh uh isar and tie it well but one side of it may get loose and it would go below my ankles. So the prophet said you are not one of them. So if you look at all of these hadiths, you you know first if a person does not have any pride in his heart, the amount between his ankle and what is below it will be tormented in hell. And this is not something easy. The prophet told us that the easiest person to be tormented in hell, the easiest of all punishment in hell is a man that uh stone of fire is placed in his sandals. The heat of this stone of fire makes his brain boils. So you can imagine what happens to the rest of his body just because of this stone of fire. So if this is the least of punishment, you can do the math. However, if you drag it out of pride, out of arrogance, and most of people when they go to the tailor to have him make their uh uh ths or kam or shwal or whatever trousers or whatever, they insist that no, prolong it more more. And they know that they're wrong because when they come to to to prayer, they fold their trousers. So they are doing it out of pride. And if you claim that you're not doing it out of pride, like Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. Abu Bakr had someone to give him the green light, someone to judge his heart. And he says, \"You're not one of them.\" And that was the prophetam. You and I don't have this privilege. We don't have anyone to testify for us other than our actions. And therefore, this is a major sin indeed. But it varies whether it is extremely major with four types of punishments uh on the day of judgment or one punishment which is uh uh whatever is below the ankle is in hell."
