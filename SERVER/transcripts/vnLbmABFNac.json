  "title": "Can I pray for my dead non-Muslim parents?",
  "transcript": "amlaykum. My parents did not receive or hear the message of Islam before passing away. I received it myself later in my life. Is it permissible for me to visit the graves of my beloved parents? The answer is yes. Visiting the graves of the uh deceased relatives who are not Muslim is permissible. But you're not allowed to pray for them. You're not allowed to seek forgiveness for them. You just visit them without any of the following or the proceedings because the prophetat wasam sought permission from Allah to visit his mother's grave and Allah granted him that and he sought permission from Allah to seek forgiveness for his mother and and Allahel uh did not grant him this and he denied him that uh permission and Allah knows"
