  "transcript": "and she says how many days we should fast in Shan I used to fast every Monday and Thursday now what's the ruling on fasting shaan the month of shaan as reported by um Sal by by other companions may Allah be pleased with them they said that the prophet Alat did not fast any month more than Ramadan except Shaban so we have 12 months in the year the ninth year the ninth month is called Ramadan and we know that it is one of the pillars of Islam to fast the whole of Ramadan the other 11 months the prophet Alam recommended highly to fast the month of muharam which is the first month in the lunar calendar and he said that there is no month better to fast after Ramadan except muharam so number one is Ramadan number two is muharam now when coming to his own doing sallallahu alaihi wasallam he used to fast a lot of shahan in an narration he used to fast the whole of Shaban and connect it to Ramadan and it's a different of a dispute whether is it permissible to fast all of it like in one narration or it is best to fast most of it like in another narration so the prophet himself was was asked about fasting Shaban why do you often fast Shaban and he said because this is a month that people usually are uh uh heedless of or they neglect because it falls between the holy month of rajab the Sacred month of rajab and between Ramadan so it's a month that people usually don't pay a lot of attention to it so I'd like to remember Allah Asel in it and fast it so can I fast the whole of the month of shaan the answer is no because we know that the prophet Alat told us not to precede Ramadan by a day or two unless a person is used to fasting this day or two meaning that if it coincides that the 30th of shaan coincides with a Monday or with a Thursday and it is your Habit to fast every Monday and Thursday throughout the whole year in this case even if the day before Ramadan was a Thursday and you fasted it your fasting is correct but someone who is not used to fasting at all and he comes to the day the 30th day of shaan and he says maybe it's Ramadan we don't know maybe the sighting of the moon was not correct so just to be safe just for the benefit of the doubt I'm going to fast the 30th of shaan this is prohibited this is known as the day of doubt out because if it were cloudy and people were not able to see the moon the Crescent whether it is tomorrow Ramadan or a completion of 30 days of shaan it they have to by default consider it as the 30th of Shan so whoever fasts it to just be safe this is prohibited coming back to your question uh Leia so can I I fast shahan the answer is yes you can fast most of it preferably leave a day or two before Ramadan and you can fast the whole thing inshallah without any problem"
