  "transcript": "asif from saudi arabia says that when we buy a mobile phone for a thousand reals i don't know where you can buy a mobile phone this cheap now they are three thousand four thousand reels and it's it's becoming close to the cost of buying a car so when you buy such mobile phones they say if you want we give you an extended warranty for 200 reals or so is this permissible answer is no this is insurance so you're paying an amount of money 100 or 200 reals if the mobile was broken they will replace it for you so you gained 800 reels if nothing happens throughout this period of a year for example you lose your 200 yells and this is the com concept of gambling buying a lottery ticket for one euro with the chances of hitting the jackpot of a million euros that's a that's whoa what's wrong in that man yeah but there's a possibility of losing a euro so no problem and when 10 million participate and they lose their 10 million euros one euro each no problem but only one of them has a chance to win the jackpot and this is gambling this is totally prohibited and likewise when you opt for uh provident funds or retirement or uh 401k i think they call it the retirement scheme differs if you're obliged by the government and they take a portion of your salary without your consent and they put it in a fund and when you retire they give you a monthly salary this is halal because i have no say in them taking money from me and whatever they give me after my retirement this is legitimate but if it's optional and they say would you like us to do this or that if you say yes this is like insurance it's haram because you could live for 30 40 years after your retirement and get triple or quadruple the amount that you have invested in the beginning and you may die the following month and all gone down the drain so this is gambling and risky that is not permissible in islam"
