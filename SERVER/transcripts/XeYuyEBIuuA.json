  "title": "Can Zakat be given to Syed? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Kansa can't be given to say it my own brother is mentally sick and has two daughters and he doesn't earn first of all what is meant by saying it say it is a reference to the people of al al Bayt those who are the offspring of Abdul Muttalib Banu appeal Banu etc so many of them in a nutshell that revolve around the family of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam generally speaking the most prominent of them would be the descendant of Ali even ABI talib may Allah be pleased with him because we know that the Prophet Allah so salam did not leave behind any male offspring they all died when they were infants in Jung so there are daughters of his there is aina there is uncle tomb there is rupiah there is fatima and of some of them there are descendants these descendants are known as a lil bait and we know that it is prohibited for them to consume from the cat money or from charity because charity is the filth of people taking it out to purify their wealth and giving it to the poor so it is not befitting for the descendents of the Prophet Elisha to consume that usually and basically they have better sources for that as we know that there should be one-fifth of any war booties or income to the Muslim nation one-fifth of it has to be for allah azzawajal and the prophet Isaiah and one-fifth of this one-fifth is to the descendants of the Prophet Elisha unfortunately to my knowledge this is not being implemented anywhere in the world so Muslim countries have ignored this right they've scrapped it out and it shows you how close we are to Quran and Sunnah and therefore if they were in need the only means of helping them is to allow them to accept zakat money and charity and this is the choice of Chiklis iemon tamiya may allah have mercy on his soul he says that they are the best of the descendents of the Prophet Isis Salam and their poor so they cannot beg and we cannot allocate for them funds from the Treasury of the Muslims because they're not allowing them to take any of it in this case it is totally permissible for them to take from zakat money and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
