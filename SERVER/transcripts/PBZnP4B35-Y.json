  "transcript": "she first of all I'm not trying to be a religious police she so some people say and believe that the Muslim society and Islamic scholars must have an opinion to give time to to a reort women to adopt hijab in their lives like they will started by putting scarf over the head while wearing tight jeans and t-shirts including in the matters of taking mam uh while traveling and in other other matters too so do we find this kind of belief or and excuse from ourself what first of all Allah stated in the Quran in chapter 5 in the beginning of chapter five today I have completed your religion and perfected my blessing upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion when was that that was on the 10th year of Hijra so one of the last ay to not the last but one of the last ay to be revealed the dean is complete agree everyone in this world will say yep agree the dean is definitely complete number two if someone says okay we want to take things gradually so today for a month we will only pray no other four prayers and following month we'll pray and and little by little another one says for for women yeah they can't go to the beach with a bikini so they will only go to the beach with a one piece suit just for a month and then we will try to improve their hijab is this acceptable answer is of course not you have to totally eliminate all of the Haram and wrong practices and abide by Islam so anyone who says that we have to gradually take such things we would say no you misunderstood what Islam is all about Islam is about submitting your will to Allah so mandatory things must be implemented on the spot Haram things must be left on the spot recommended things okay you can take your time not recommending things Mak that are not Haram you may take your time I hope this answers your question"
