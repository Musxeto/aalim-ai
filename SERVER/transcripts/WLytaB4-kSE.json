  "title": "Ruling on wearing a ring made of iron - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh what's the ruling on wearing iron rings the albani authenticated the hadith where the prophet salaam prohibited wearing iron and he said that this is the jewelry of the people of hellfire while in sahih al-bukhari the prophet salaam asked the man to look for anything to present as a dowry to the woman and he said even if you can get a ring made of iron so to my knowledge this was abrogated in the beginning it was not permissible to wear iron for men specifically and later on it was permissible and this is the vast majority of scholars to my recollection and and memory don't quote me therefore it is totally permissible to wear um a ring of iron and there's no prohibition in this insha allah"
