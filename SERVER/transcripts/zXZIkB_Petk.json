  "transcript": "can we use water which has been mixed with chlorine or other chemicals for if not can we do or do we must use drinking water this water is used in swimming pools for example in tabs okay tab water is usually mixed with a little amount of chlorine so that it would kill germs in it now if I have a mug of tap water and I smell it and I can smell some chlorine in it would I identify it as water or a different liquid the answer would be water therefore as long as it carries the label water I can perform with it I can perform wood with it and in some cases if it's medically safe I can even drink it there's no problem in that the problem is when the liquid changes its label and name and nature so this mug if I bring a teabag and I soak it in it and I throw it away what is this liquid is it water the answer is no this is tea this I cannot use it for or for performing woodo so the end product is what counts if I have this mug with some flour in it because they used to use it with dough and and the like there is some flour so it's murky with some flour in it but the end result it's water with some mud with some flour with some Rust in it but it's water you can use that for drink for um W andul and I hope this answers your question"
