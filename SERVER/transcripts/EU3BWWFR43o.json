  "transcript": "insha'allah I met from a man says that he missed vada Nasser and only fine found time to pray it in mother if so how would he pray will he pray Maghrib and then prayed over Nasser or what first of all I asked him why did you miss the horn us and he said because I was busy at work in this case this is not a legitimate reason your sinful you've missed the hora Nasser and you cannot make them up at all they cannot be made up because the Prophet said Islam whoever sleeps over a prayer or forgets it he must pray it as soon as he remember it because there is no expiration other than that which is praying it as soon as you remember it so the Prophet gave two reasons are they in salatu salam sleeping and forgetting now someone at work he is neither forgetting and North sleeping he could simply go but he says I have a meeting I have a presentation to make I have this and I have that and he keeps on stalling and postponing and delaying until the time is over in this case he his prayer is not accepted even if he prayed it ten times but hypothetically assuming that you slept or you were so busy you forgot totally nobody reminded you and you did not remember until the Sun had set so what to do the most authentic opinion is that you have to pray the missing prayers in order meaning that mother it you should pray it with the on time aja on time now what you've missed was voter Nasir and these are composed of photograph while mother it is composed of three so the most authentic opinion is that you join them in the marieb you pray the first second third raka and when the Imam offers Salam you stand up to perform your fourth chakra completing your four raka of war and then afterwards you pray answer and then afterwards you pray mother once again"
