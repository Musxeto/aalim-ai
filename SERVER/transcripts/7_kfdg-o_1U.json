  "transcript": "ahmed from kuwait if the shop gave me change or i paid the shop something and they gave me more change than i deserve and i could not give them back the change do and the shopkeeper says keep it with you and bring it whenever you can and i delayed paying him back instead of bringing it in the afternoon i took two days to pay him back am i sinful no you're not sinful because it was indefinite but definitely you were not doing the right thing because if someone else did this to you you would have become a bit angry why didn't he bring the money when he had the ability to do so so it's always best to get rid of any debts on you and uh to exempt yourself from it"
