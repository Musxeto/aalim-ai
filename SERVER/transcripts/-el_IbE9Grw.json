  "title": "Patience in Islam",
  "transcript": "this is not a formal lecture and because usually I'm used to doing formal lectures abroad in Saudi Arabia it seems a little bit awkward for me I'm tuned to speak Arabic in Saudi Arabia so now I'm I'm having difficulties in adjusting but it's just a simple reminder everything you're going to hear you've heard before and you know it maybe better than I do but inshallah in reminding one another there are many many benefits to start with Allah says in the Quran Allah in this concise and short Surah every one of us memorizes it by heart but it has so much profound and Powerful meaning to it that some of us may neglect or may not be aware of Allah says subh tala and translates to either the prayer which is known or as the most authentic opinion is the time so Allah is swearing by time which is something that is relative on Earth but after the day of judgment there isn't any such a thing as time it's either in heaven may Allah make me and you among those who are admitted to Paradise forever or it is for in Hell forever may Allah protect us all verely Allah says man is in loss so no exception every single human being is in Lost except those who have these four characteristics they believe in Allah they do righteous Deeds they recommend one another to be on truth and they recommend one another to be patient one of the prominent uh one of the four prominent uh Scholars of Islam said by Allah if only this Surah was revealed to humankind or to mankind it would have been sufficient to us now we say sufficient come on I could barely understand it's easy no it's not easy if you look deep into it you would see the magnificence of Allah's word subhah waala now I'm not going to talk about this Surah I'm going to talk about patience and patience was mentioned in the Quran over 70 times Allah praised patience and he recommended the prophet to be patient and if we go or scroll down the verses that talk about patience it would be F time before we are through it Allah has promised those who are patient with success so those who are patient they will have success not only that Allah had told us that those who are patient will get forgiveness and will get the great reward so all of these are indications Allah is mentioning it so many times in the Quran for us to be patient but sometimes we don't pay attention to that Allah promised a man who was tested through taing his sight imagine going into the bathroom with your eyes closed or without any electricity and doing what you have to do in less than a minute or two and then open your eyes and you find that you've made a big mess now if a person is blind Allah is testing him but the person is content and is pleased he's patient what is the reward Allah says there is no reward for him except Jenna if a person has a child an offspring a child that he loves and adors and Allah tests him and that child dies and the man says alhamdulillah the woman says alhamdulillah Allah will build him because of his patience a house called the house of alham of the praise because he's praising Allah now the problem is who thinks of all of these hadiths and verses when the Calamity takes place Allah promised in the Quran those who are patient to double their rewards and in another verse to reward them without account yeah everything it might be weighed everything might be measured by size but when you're patient Allah does not measure he just gives subh Allah also told us in the Quran that Allah is with those who are patient those who tolerate those who endure for his sake Allah is with you yes but I'd like the Armed Forces to be to give us a helping hand I need this person with a lot of influence the government I need this much money Allah is with you are you a Believer isn't Allah enough for you if you're patient Allah is with you not only that Allah the prophet told us that Victory is with patience so whenever you're patient Allah would bestow the Victory and you will be Victorious and you'll Prevail with this with the grace of Allah those who are patient Allah loves them what more do you need if you come out of tonight's talk and you feel content of whatever is happening to you and you feel that you want to be patient on what Allah commanded you to do and you want to be patient away away from the things that Allah for you to do W by Allah Allah would be with you Allah would love you Allah subhana tal would take care of you but you have to do something you have to approach Allah to find all of this now what is patience in Arabic it's easy we call it Al is to imprison yourself it's to refrain from doing something but when you come to different places where patience is is mentioned or is mentioned in the Quran you would find that it has different meanings so when I tell you to be patient with sins I used to do a and then get fright now you're asking me to be patient with sins no misunderstanding it's different prepositions but in English sometimes people fail to translate so when you look at the meaning of in the Quran and in theah you'd find that it means to tolerate to uh endure to refrain from to be steadfast on so all of these revolve around this beautiful word of and it has uh uh three meanings or three definitions to it uh uh divisions that Scholars usually talk about and you all know that so they say it all Rhymes in Arabic but when you once you want to translate into English it becomes a little bit difficult you need a rapper probably to uh uh put something in line first of all one division is that you part of being patient or sub that you be patient when executing Good Deeds now a lot of us may fail to do this because Good Deeds are hard on the soul so if I'd like to say okay I have an hour I'd like to pray for an hour after 5 minutes I go back to bed if I did 5 minutes yeah I'm doing well alhamdulillah so this is the first time doing good deeds and you be patient on doing them and I allate a little bit further inshallah uh bad Deeds you have to refrain be patient meaning that you have to refrain from doing it it's so tempting but if you put your hand in the cookie jar then something would happen it's it's wrong so you have to control yourself you have to endure you have to uh try your level best not to do it and this patience Allah would reward you and we will come to mention this last and third division is the thing that you have no other choice in the first two you had a choice to do good deeds or to stay away from Bad Deeds the Third division is something you have no choice in and that is when a Calamity strikes I lost my car I I had a car accident I lost my wallet my money I have this I have that my my child is sick I got fired from my job it's a Calamity do I have anything to do with it no it is a test from Allah what to do you have no other choice but to be patient now this is the lower level the higher level is to be happy and intent because Allah did not decree this except because there is good in it for you you know that there's good in it for you yes I believe in that and I'm happy for that then alhamdulillah this is the highest level of content and we will go through this inshallah what is the ruling on patience do I have to be patient it has the five verdicts or rulings that we haven't felt it can be mandatory it can be forbidden it can be recommended it can be not recommended or disliked and it can be permissible five categories everything we do falls under these five categories and depending so if someone says what's the ruling on being patient on praying in the Masid say this is W you have to do this what's the ruling on being patient from listening to music or watching uh scrubs or soap opras we're in hospital so they watch a lot of Scrubs so what's the ruling on that it is forbidden for you to be patient yes but it's like in half an hour wrap up the program and let's watch it I I cannot be patient no you have to be patient here and if you're patient on going and watching it and doing the Haram this is Haram and likewise with the recommended and not recommended and with the permissible thing okay then we Muslims say we have it figured out right we are the most patient people on earth is this correct yes or no wishper it to to the man on your right no I will not do that huh come on guys is it right are we the most patient people on Earth no no even the kuf the disbelievers have patience some of them have greater patience than us Allah mentioned inah that they're advising one another to move on and to be patient on worshiping your idols don't listen to these people who are telling you worship only one God so they are recommending one another I remember and I think I have some time to reflect um few years back like 14 years 15 years ago Christoper re was Superman okay okay and was okay let's not go there okay Christopher re was Superman the guy was a handsome goodlooking athletic actor and he had a beautiful wife and he had four children and he was uh I don't know how they call it in Arabic in English he used to ride horses and junp fences there's a a terminology for that whatever so the guy was a professional I used to compete and one day out of the blue while he was attempting to jump a fence the horse thought that there's a rabbit or something that Cross by so it froze and this happens and when you are you know running in a high speed trying to jump and then all of a sudden your car breaks or your horse just freezes you start to feel like a real Superman so the guy started I Believe I Can Fly and the poor thing fell on his neck broke it and he was paralyzed neck down he was in rehab for about 6 to 8 weeks this was an interview in Newsweek about 8 10 pages he was telling about his ordeal and how many times he thought that uh uh he should commit suicide because he could not breathe except through a ventilator is it whatever we have doctors here they they can figure it out so and then he managed to learn how to breathe with this machine it was with him all the time and he said that killing myself is wrong this is a test from God I looked at the footnotes maybe he's a Muslim he's not and within 6 to 8 weeks the guy was participating on his wheelchair unable to do anything unable to move except to speak not even to breathe he participated in the per Olympics I think this is for the the uh uh physically challenge or whatever they call them and a week later he participated in a yach or a a boat race that was in and he they were showing his picture just sitting there with all the makeup and and the guy kept on doing donations and doing so many good things on his life and he was not a Believer he was not a Muslim and this brings us to the classification of people as the scholars say when it comes to patience and is and IM people are divided into four types one those who have IM and patience and these are the Elite of the human these are the Muslims who have Islam who have belief they are all and they're patient on all the three divisions that you mentioned and we will elaborate a little bit more category two those who are believers but they are not patient and this is the majority of Muslims they elaborate and they say the majority of us are from this category meaning that we are believers we pray we fast we attend Mah lectures and we give donations and we do unless we are tested and when the test Comes This reveals our true identity this reveals our true IM I need to travel tomorrow to I don't have any seats and I need was okay but you I have to cancel someone and put you his seat the hell with it I have to leave man I have to go we start to instead of bending rules we start to break them and this shows the lack of patience this this paper cannot be done except if you put 5,000 R under the counter do it do it Allah is forgiving Mak is half an hour away and take bake while coming back and Skip F because of the garlic it's it's all a combination this reveals your true identity and may Allah conceal our shortcomings and not expose us because W I've seen people being exposed like this and I'm afraid that I would be exposed as well so we pray to Allah to conceal our uh shortcomings and to make us steadfast on this de the third category are those who are disbelievers but they are patient they have the sub in them to tolerate and one of them is Christopher re and there are so many for example he was one of uh the followers of uh uh a sect or a religion that allows men to marry their sisters and daughters and mothers and it's part of the majus and and they had two gods and light and darkness and Etc this guy fought the rulers uh for about 20 years until they captured him and he killed hundred of thousands of of of Muslims when they captured him the Khalifa ordered that he would be uh uh amputated his limbs would be amputated one by one and then his tongue and then he would be crucified until left dead so the minute they started cutting his right hand the blood gushed out he took the blood with his left hand and wiped it on his face the told it wait wait now this has a story bring why did you do what you had done he said well if I start to bleed my face will get yellow and then you think that I'm scared of dying so I didn't want you get to get this compression may Allah curse him this CF but look at his patience he believes in his cause and he's in hell but he believed and they chopped his left hand his right leg his left leg his uh tongue and he did not utter a single sign not a single word this is patience but he's a c and the worst of all categories are those who don't have IM and they don't have uh uh uh patience and that's why if you go to Sweden for example beautiful country Beautiful People beautiful uh economy yet the highest trate in committing suicide why no Ean no patience so I have I had done everything so what's left let me try to jump from 120 stories high building and see maybe I L on my feet so alhamdulillah for the grace of Allah now going back to the original question is patience a Char a characteristic of only the Believers the answer is no disbelievers may share this with us but it is a prominent sign that this person could be a believer so the majority of Muslims inshallah they have patience in them and the role model are the prophets and messengers of Allah take a look at and this is um role model for every how long have you been doing da talking about myself very little how much do you devote for da from your day well a week maybe an hour for da but I convince myself that I'm doing something good by playing around okay what about you the same thing no you have to raise the level of your D commitment by looking at peace be upon Him Allah mentioned in the Quran that he stayed for a whole 10 uh uh centuries except 50 years 1,000 years except 950 years he kept on giving da how how many times did you give da to your non-muslim mother oh I spent with her like half an hour and when she cursed me I left her for 6 years I haven't P her since this is a true cases happening huh I know people who this is not like you know flashing reminds you of nightclubs that's it patience patience why is this happening to me the brother was delting was good patience patience so we have commercial brace if you have anything to advertise alhamdulillah like life so you have to look at your da and compare it to PE be upon your colleagues at the office I know people that have spent like six or seven years giving da to their colleagues until alhamdulillah they started practicing or reverted and I know big knowledgeable people who could only spend 5 minutes and then they got high blood pressure and frustrated and they do not give Salam to the brothers who will pray with them in the mess why spoke to him about his beard he's not growing his beard I will not give him Salam he's no no no but this is this is for just to show him you're not showing anybody look at Satan sitting there and he's laughing his head off this is not the way that the prophet did our Prophet Muhammad and definitely not new look at the patience of ibraim ibraim is a chapter on his own he is the father of all Messengers and he is no one is the best friend of Allah except two ibraim and Muhammad peace be upon them all and we mention his name every time we pray in the so ibraim is is is a category of his own and he is an um by his own when he was a teenager they threw him in the fire that was so huge people say tales about it and and he did not even blink do you have anything do you need [Music] anything is sufficient for us subh this is all what he said and Allah saved him did he go back home and retire I did my my thing no he kept on doing da going left right and Center to call people to Islam and if you are in this position you would think that okay listen I have credit H if I go go to tonight and I do a good while going coming back in the car I might might listen to a song here or there I go home and watch a couple of movies what are you doing this is Haram yeah yeah but I have credit I just did so you would think this is how we think this is how we deal with Allah this is extremely wrong but Allah forgive us ibraim one would think that okay he is the messenger of Allah he's the of Allah yet when he was like 80 years old he circumcised himself with an axe because Allah told him to do this he would say ah infection we're in the hospital okay is there any doctor in the house do it it's it's over now he didn't have any children did he complain no did he ask what's ring on uh IVF or what they call it okay if it's the egg from seate mother and then India is doing is not under question at all what did he do nothing he's patient and then Allah gives him a child gives him is from his wife ha and so happy with this first born Allah tells him take her and her child from Iraq and go to Mecca Mecca at the time they didn't have any GPS but everybody knows Mecca was no man's land it was Desert mountains no water nothing nobody lived there he didn't even check again he took his wife they traveled The Good Wife did not ask where are we leaving what should I take heavy clothes or uh uh light clothes she went with him once he reached Mecca he put them there he turned his back and walked she said who are you leaving us for what are you going there's no food there's no water there's no hotels nothing and he didn't even look back he kept on walking the of the Beloved friend of Allah do you think that his heart was happy wow I could get mared again he was being torn from the inside his son who who he he was waiting for so long he didn't look back and then the believing woman said did Allah order you to do this he said yes she said go Allah would not leave us patience ibraim was tested again he left for many years we be upon him and came back only to find his son almost close to the to the age of puberty 14 years of age 15 years of age and then one day he wakes up and says my son I saw a dream I saw a vision that I have to slaughter you now this is a vision come on maybe you did this no this is a revelation all Messengers of Allah when they see a vision it's a revelation so he knows that but does the young child know that no he doesn't and he says believing in his father and believing in Allah before of that oh my father do what you told you will find me among the patient you cease to wonder who should you yeah be shocked more with the behavior of IIM or is ibraim never looked back he took the knife he wanted to slaughter Allah gave this sacrifice and he gave us this beautiful story to see how to be a true worshiper to Allah how to be a true slave of Allah why did I say that this is a vision of a prophet and it's a revelation I don't want you to wake up tomorrow morning saying that I saw a vision that I'm sing my wife so this is definitely not intended this is specifically only for Messengers and prophets of Allah M also tolerated the harassment of the sons of Israel and their blasphemy and their rejection of everything he had brought them and that is why the prophet when once he was harassed in a simil way and he was frustrated but then again we have uh Allah what we have anyhow maybe this gives a new look Andes you know maybe next time you have colored lights and so the prophet was he was told that they said this and that about you he was frustrated but then he said may Allah have mercy on my brother Musa he was abused more than this and he tolerated it he was patient so we learn from M we learn from Isa peace be upon him we know what they did to him and they the last thing they tried they tried to crucify him to kill him but Allah ascended him to him we uh know what his father did who youf father huh this is the messenger is not sah you should know the prophet was asked who is the most honorable person of all he said YF isim you should know the forefathers of these uh blessed messengers of Allah prophets of Allah so he was patient when his siblings his own Brothers left him in a well for dead yet he was patient because this is something from Allah and so on so the first category you have to be patient on whatever Allah ordered you to do Salah does it need patience Allah it does a lot need a lot of patience when you wake up in the morning now alhamdulillah f is late so it's like half an hour and then you're off to work but when you are in in in summer and it's like 4:00 and if you're living in the Eastern Province as I travel sometimes there and it's like 3:00 and then you have a problem OFW up and if you're in England and you have F at 2:30 and at 11:30 and you have to fast Ramadan and you get tons of emails do we have a way out should I make hij this is not the proper time to make hij only for Ramadan and come back people have difficulties but they are patient because they seek the reward from Allah so uh uh to be kind to your parents needs patience especially when they're old when they're young and your father is mallah full of muscles and he could you know just kick your backside then you respect him and you tend to be kind but when he's like in his 80s and he speaks to you and he doesn't hear what you say and you repeat what you say five six times and if you're a little bit late or you bring him something that he is not very happy with and he starts to shouts at you Shan comes you need patience to kiss his feet and to obey him and to be tolerant with him because he has few days left and a door to Paradise will be closed for you and so many of us has have lost this St May forgive all our parents then you move on to you see something wrong from a Muslim next to you you have to be patient when you advise him and we you have to be patient when you prohibit him from uh doing something that is vice or something that is evil all of these things need patience patience before you do them so I'm going to pray fa I have to be patient to wake up patient while doing that so while in the is reciting the too long he should have over this too much for me and you have to be patient afterwards after the Good Deeds because you have to suppress your feeling of showing off so many people come to the office sit yarning and okay and I ignore them I play with my keyboard and then I said the guys asking me I'm not even going to ask said I'm very tired I'm not going to ask you why and I change the subject see I'm tired because last night I I spent 2 hours praying the but may Allah make it sincere what sincerity are you talking about you have blown the whole thing up you need to be patient after the after the worship by not concealing it by not showing off because this is for Allah subhana wa tala when you come to refraining from sins you need to be patient and this is harder than doing uh uh something else maybe charity I can give 10 R for a person fasting little difficult let me skip this but yeah I wake up in the middle of the night I don't feel sleepy so I may pray it's easy but when you tell me to refrain from Haram from things that my self loves and adors this is this becomes problematic when a brother comes and say did you see what sh so and so saidd yes the she is ignorant he is arrogant and he doesn't have knowledge look at his St it's below his ankles look at his beard he's been cutting it and his wife doesn't wear the hijab and I think that his is I enjoy this but this is har I have to refrain from doing this I can't my tongue just goes out like a lizard Subhan Allah I can't hold it ah then Here Comes patience you have to be patient away from Haram why don't you cover your face my sister why don't you wear the hijab the proper hijab let's not talk about the face now 10 years ago we would not talk about anything except the face now we're compromising huh please for God's sake for Allah's sake cover your hair I'm happy don't wear makeup I'm happy nobody's doing this why aren't you doing this everybody else is doing it why should I do it so you need patience in here you need patient when you know that this is the of Allah the of the Prophet wasallam to grow a beard why do we we grow beard because Allah tells us the prophet tells us do you think I love the beard if it's not in the Quran orah I would I would have shave it now I'm looking since like God knows when for an evidence that it's permissible I have J two with counter power in my pocket but no then there's no room for manipulation there is no room to play this is the ruling of Allah this is the sun of the Prophet I'll be patient and not doing what my S wants to do and that is why people lack this kind of patience and that is why we see people bribing do we have bribes big time do we have rib oh do we have emment people taking money uh you go to the gas station you fill up with 20 R put 30 and you take the money in your pocket this is a gift this was a gift given to me everything goes but because what prevents you from sending your gaze I love to watch movies I like to listen to music I like to do this I like to do that it's Haram you have to have patience but my my soul desire is it your soul desires what will take you to hell so you have to suppress this now the third category which is to be patient when a Calamity strikes and patience is not not to complain and not to do something that shows that you are not accepting what Allah has decree upon you Allah told us that calamities will take place will take place whether you like it or not it's going to happen Allah says subhanahu wa ta'ala and certainly we shall test you with something of fear hunger loss of wealth loss of lives and loss of fruits but give Glad Tidings to the the the people who endured the patient the tolerant so all of these calamities will happen to you maybe you've lived 40 years and nothing happened it will happen maybe it happened and you did not feel it maybe Allah punished you and you shred your shoulders and walked away it happens to each and every individual but once it happens how should we react because it happens every day May with her who knows okay one good bring the J so it's these are your ancestors these are your honor the wives of the Prophet Allah called them to be your mothers they are the mothers of the Believers if you don't know your heritage if you don't know your history you're in the wrong place you have to know um Sal was the wife of Abu Sal Abu Sal was the brother of the Prophet through suling when he died it was a catastrophe it was a problem but she said once he died I remember that the prophet said he said the prophet said and he taught this to the Muslims and she learned it from him he said whoever is struck by Calamity he should say we belong to Allah and to him we shall return oh Allah reward me in my Calamity and substitute me something better than it she said I immediately said it the minute I was struck by This calamity and my husband is dead and I thought to myself now who could be better than Abu Sal Allah would substitute me with whom nobody is better than the companion of the Prophet ab and after her was over who proposed to her the prophet Ya Allah imagine if every time we we are struck by a Calamity we immediately say this word and Allah would give us something the minute someone bangs my car and I come out you son of so and so I'm going to hit you I'm going to step on you I'm going to kill you I'll kill you huh then what happens after everything and N comes after 6 hours to record what's happening and then he tells me oh he doesn't have insurance you have to go to the police department and I spend like a day and a half and after after everything that happens and I go back home alhamd does this work no it doesn't why doesn't it work because it has to be at the first incident at the minute it happens it was reported in the authentic Hadith that a woman lost her child so was she was at his grave weeping and the prophet walked behind her and say oh a slave of Allah fear Allah and and have patience have tolerance to what calamity has uh struck you and the woman threw out her tears and and and and sobbing and she said go away you were not struck by a Calamity like mine go away leave me alone so the prophet left now if someone said this to the Sheik what would I do with him I'm going to bench press him like six times and then why because I'm not the prophet the prophet left and the companions came to her and said woman are you crazy this is the prophet and the woman was depressed and and shocked again so she rushed into the Masid to meet the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah oh prophet of Allah I have become patient I have become patient and the prophet said the uh patience is at the first shock of a Calamity this is what's acceptable not after 5 days or 6 days and that is why the scholars say that a real wise man A True Believer is behaves when a Calamity takes place exactly like a fool after one month when a a fool is struck by a Calamity what does he do bangs his head in the wall tears his clothes tears his his hair slaps his face says obscene things after one month what would happen to him he's he's cool he's calm down he's cool now he forgot everything a wise man or an believer does this on the first day not waiting after a whole month so where a Calamity takes place yeah do whatever you want will it change I lost my child my child died may Allah protect all of our children what should I do why why me I do this I heard it from people I heard it from a brother he's an uncle he's 60 over 60 plus years and I was visiting him as he was ill and I say uncle may Allah make it easy for you he said my son I have no regrets but the only thing that bugs me is that I've been praying in this Masid for 40 years not missing one single prayer and look what's happening to me but but my neighbor who has been there for 40 years never prayed a single prayer and he's as strong as a bull now this I don't see it funny I see it terrifying after praying 40 years in the Masid and you're 60 years plus this what happens to you you lose faith in Allah you complain of what Allah this is a problem calamities have to happen so when a Calamity takes place just say this was recorded in the preserved tablet whatever happens W when I I read an article once about one of the righteous uh Scholars and he was tortured because he did not say that the Quran was created he kept on saying what we believe that the Quran is an attribute of Allah that is not created and it goes back to him subhana tal so the man was being being tortured and he was being skinned alive bit by bit and his students around him were crying he said don't cry it was registered in the Pres tablets 50,000 years before Allah created the creation so it's it's done so what what are you going to do so you have to be uh patient and tolerant and this doesn't mean that you have a Heart of Stone no you can react you can cry you can uh uh uh speak feel sorry the prophet when his son ibraim died what did he say the heart is saddened the eyes are watering and and and crying and we do not say except what pleases Allah and by Allah by your departure we are sadden ibraim he he was sad he was crying and the companions are telling him you do this Prophet you cry said yes this is Mercy from Allah but what comes out of your mouth is what your hold held accountable uh with finally uh we do need patients and by the way this is a very shortened version about patients because it can go on to six to seven lectures and this is what Scholars usually do but here we are like a drive-thru uh just getting sandwiches and leaving and I hope by the sake of through the sake of Allah the grace of Allah that this may fill our stomach a little bit um we are in times of calamities look around you the Arab Spring the Arab Idol the Arab stuff every is around you is calling you for f everything is luring you to Hell Shan is happy because his soldiers are a lot and the Believers are weakened no you should not be like that you should ignite your Iman with patience with tolerance because with all these fitt These Old calamities these old tribulations the scholars say when tribulation comes only Scholars see it and this is what happened when tribulation came Scholars warned that this is wrong it shouldn't be this way and everybody said no no let's go with it protest demonstration after it was over and they saw the consequences and what happened the negative things that happened that did not benefit Islam that has affected Islam NE negatively now everybody sees it it's everybody everybody recognize Oh Yes W they are right 20 years ago when they started putting these satellite dishes The Scholar say says you appear on these satellite dishes yes not talking about good stuff we're talking about dancing and Billy dancing and songs and and and pornography and stuff like that so 20 years ago we're not talking about Quran being heard we're talking about Haram things being heard everybody was against us now even the worst of the Muslims say you're right this is filth this is horrible things that are being shown on our TV stations so we have to be patient we have to be patient when we treat our wives and the wives have to be patient when they treat their spouses their husbands but instead of jumping the gun and holding holding one's throat and doing fighting and and this this is not the right thing to do you have to be patient when you are bringing your son your daughter um take 50 and go play with the kids you have to bring him up like a true Muslim I'm bored I Tred to make him recite the fa and he doesn't want to okay you recite it maybe you don't know how to recite it you have to be patient this is your child this is your offspring if you don't bring him up in a good way after you die instead of supplicating for forgiveness for you he would curse you in your grave because you did not do a good job we have to do our level best in igniting this patience in our heart because Omar says may Allah be pleased with him by Allah we did not find the sweetness of Our Lives except through patience and these calamities these tribulations will continue to increase and this is a test from Allah the prophet said uh ahead of you he's addressing the companions ahead of you there are the days of patience so the the prophet said in these days of patience those abiding by their religion would be like a person holding a a Stone of Fire and to those in these days of patience what whatever you do Allah would give them the multiplication of the Deeds of 51 of you and the companion said of us the companions are of them and the prophet said of you the companions so the more tribulations are there the more testings from Allah are there the more reward you will get when your patient and the more reward you will get when you are abiding by the of the Prophet sallallah Alam and I I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who are patient on doing good deeds patient away from doing bad deeds and patient when calami strike wasallam I don't have question ask okay is there anyone from the crowd would like to ask a question for a second I was happy I thought he was asking a question okay there's a sister question there's a sister there has question [Music] ask patient you got a question want to ask about being patient sorry again actually uh as you speaking about the patient if someone is uh I mean the are transor and the are giv lot of Burg and lot of Z they very Z in such a way I mean the people should not the person should not raise the voice also and just keep quiet and be patient should not speak to anyone is this also patient okay should I answer like this as mentioned earlier that patients has five categories either it is mandatory recommended permissible uh not disliked or recommended and forbidden and patience is not always mandatory so in cases like what you've mentioned it depends on the situation someone does wrong to me someone steals my wallet and I say I have to be patient who shares this idea of being bent I'd like to get my hand on your wallets alhamdulillah so nobody says that yes if someone steals from you you have to be patient don't complain if someone RS you you have to be patient don't complain but Allah mentions in the Quran that when you punish you should punish exactly as you have been punished so to take even to be to get even is permissible in Islam someone says you're a donkey and you say reply to him you're a donkey this is Hal not the first one the second one of course providing that the first one who said you're a donkey is not bigger than you then you have a problem now I'm talking about sizewise in in usually so when someone does wrong to you you're allowed to say it back with limitation you if he does something that is Haram you cannot say okay he raped my wife so I'd rape his wife for example no this is this is something you have to understand some people do this they say they are killing our children in XY Z so we kill their children this is wrong they killed our brothers in this country so we kill their people civilians in their country this is wrong the prophet made this no matter who says that this is permissible so you have to know but if you're patient and tolerant for the sake of Allah then you are rewarded more and this depends on the situation if you tolerate and that person it exceeds his limit and adds a little bit more every now and then at the end of the day you are encouraging him and that is why the prophet Alam had a balance and if you go through the S you will find the excellent answer to all of your questions Allah did not send Prophet Muhammad Ali wasallam for nothing he sent him to be a role model and if you go through his s his biography his life and his teachings you will have the perfect answer because he was the perfect man one says oh nobody's perfect except Allah don't be like flies catching whatever filth you can find I said nobody no one except him was a perfect what human so in in humanity he is the perfect human s any more questions I sh we talking about let's say losing the wealth so if a man loses all of his wealth and the moment he loses it he thanks Allah subhana waala and he is not upset but uh so at the at the time Calamity strikes he is grateful to Allah subhana tala and he is uh accepting the situation but then when he starts to continue with his life and starts to feel the effects of having lost his well um and then he comes at some certain points in life where he gets frustrated sometimes he um might you know say something wrong so does that take away the reward of him praising Allah subhana tala as the first time eom right this is a good question you all understand the question if if he says something that is wrong it doesn't take the reward of the first patients uh at the first shock of the Calamity but it reduces it now a lot of the brothers think that to be patient you should not be depressed you should not have high blood pressure and you should not react negative it's human nature if your kid dies you cannot smile when people give you condolences alhamdulillah I'm happy I'm happy and you start dancing and people say no this is the doing of some of the Sal with all du respect to the Sal what is the doing of the Prophet when his son died he cried so this is human nature you can't be more uh uh believing in steadfast than the prophet having said that it is only natural to react act and maybe you would suffer something that you did not suffer before because of This calamity this doesn't affect your patience look at peace be upon him when he lost Yousef he was saddened when he's Lo he lost his second brother what happened to him huh what happened to him he got blind he lost his eyesight because of This calamity so and he's a prophet so this is human nature what Allah holds you accountable by is your tongue as the prophet said what goes in your heart what goes in your mind this is all part of the forgiven uh uh things but what you say the word that you say if it incriminates you you are in deep trouble Allah the patient as I understand you know you have uh should it be ConEd all the time as patience in a negative way in that way we always consider patient to be used when you are you know frustrated upset or something that you probably should should stay away from doing uh things that become more obvious to to yourself and to others my understanding also the patients you know like I would like to understand am I on the right track or not my understanding of patient is not just for reaction to C things rather it goes in a proactive way where the patience is should be consed more as a consistency and commitment in what you are doing or rather application for for the sake of Good Deeds because that itself reflects your personality in terms of how you deal with that you don't don't wait don't wait for for an event for you know to react in a negative way for you know and then and somebody say know you got to be patient to do that you rather do that in your day today application and in that where you show the consistency in what you're doing no matter what happens whether it is you know good or bad you you you you you you have decided to do it and and for the sake of Allah in a consistent way in a committed way where you know that the end result is is going going to be a okay understand I I I understand the question but you have to understand that we do not live in Utopia meaning that we're not perfect we can theoretically sit here all night long and talk about patience and the minute I'm in my car and someone crosses in front of me I fall follow him until the corish until I get him off his car and start cursing him and maybe slapping him fighting him this is human nature we can talk about theories but the issue is not in talking it's in implementing now as I said the leure lecture is too long we did not talk about the consistency of doing good deeds the prophet said said that the most beloved Deeds to Allah is what is consistent even if l so we need to have patience I get people fasting Mondays and Thursdays for 6 years and then they give up why I got tired I the brother who whispered the other brothers the first thing that he did not do he's not doing now like in in the past is t a lot of the Muslims don't playay tud don't wake it up before F to read a of the Quran don't give charity every now and then unless as said someone gives his hand otherwise aldah my my money is my pocket nobody's been asking me for a couple Allah increase this we have a problem so consistency is correct but we human you can't ask someone to be calm and not to be sad or not to be angered by uh uh uh someone's uh behavior for 5 or 10 years he has to you know Bur one day but such a birst is part of human nature the prophet said All Sons of Adams are all sons of Adam are sinners and the best of the Sinners are those who repent meaning that we're human we but we try our level best to coach ourselves with the grace of Allah to train ourselves to reach a level where we can actually tolerate we cannot be you know uh Grasshoppers and monks and so no whatever you do I'm not going to react this is impossible do excuse me but I have other commitments well I would love to sit"
