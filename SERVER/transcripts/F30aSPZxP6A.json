  "title": "How to give Dawah to my non practicing husband? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "assistor says my husband is not good practicing muslim which might be because he was brought up in a family who were not staunch muslims when I call him towards thus strengthening his Deen like praying on time and going to the Masjid he gets frustrated and reminds of the hadith where the Prophet said that it's awesome that most women will go to hell and calls me one of them so who is right well he is definitely wrong he has no right to label someone that he is from the people of hellfire the Prophet our system gave a general description due to the characteristics of women in general but not all it's not for me a you to label people that they are from the people of hell secondly it seems sister that your approach to your husband lacks diplomacy lacks wisdom so you should rectify it you should revise the way you speak to your husband because at the end of the day it is not who is a winner and who is a loser at the end of the day you want to lead him to Jenna you want him to accompany to paradise accompany you to paradise but with this a tug of war sort of relationship and who's stronger and who's weaker who's right and who's wrong it's a no man's game and and no one would win actually both of you would lose so you try to audit the way you give him dower change it fine-tune it and try to reach his heart so that inshallah both of you would preach Jenna"
