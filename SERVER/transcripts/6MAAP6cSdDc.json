  "title": "Giving Zakat to someone who doesn't Pray - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the last question I think we have time for it a sister says can we give zakat money to people who do not pray first of all you cannot condemn people and label them as kafir just because you don't see them praying people can pray when you leave to the Masjid people can pray when you go home and sleep people can pray when you're not with them in the room so unless a person is established to be a disbeliever for leaving prayer as in the case of someone who says I don't pray I don't want to pray I have never prayed and it's none of your business and you try to your level best and the guy is defiant he says I do not pray a number a drop believe in praying so in this case this is different but a person we tell him common phrases inshallah pray for me we don't see him pray he is still considered to be a Muslim and if he is needy and if he is poor he is deserving to be given from zakat money and Allah knows best this is all the time we have for two days or for tonight's episode until we meet same time next week I live in fear Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
