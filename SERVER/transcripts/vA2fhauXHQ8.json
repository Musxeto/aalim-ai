  "title": "Can we accept gifts from someone whose money is from stealing? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "abdullah says since haram income is only haram for the person earning it and not for the others can we accept gifts from a person who got that money from stealing and can we buy stolen items we've addressed this issue before abdullah and we said that the scholars identify haram items or income and divide them into two types haram due to the way the wealth was earned and haram due to the wealth itself so haram due to the wealth itself such as a person stealing a pen and then he gives it as a gift or sells it and takes the money and gives his family to feed them this is totally haram why because the item itself is haram not the way it was earned but rather it is stolen it has to be returned to the lawful owner unlike the haram income which is haram due to the way it was earned so a euro or a dollar that i earn through selling pork or drugs or intoxicants or renting movies or an income from music industry all of this is haram but it is haram not because this euro is haram rather because the way i got it through was haram therefore if i give this money to someone else the one receiving the money would be receiving halal money for him but the income and the earning is haram for that individual and this is the same when the prophet alaihi salazar once came to his house and found some food so he said to his wife aisha bring the food i'm hungry aisha refrained and said o prophet of allah this food was given as a charity to bahrira barira was a freed slave so this was given to her as sadaqah and we know that the prophet isam and his lineage must not accept sadaqah but when she came to aisha she gave this food as a gift so the prophet noticed this allah said it is sadaka on her but a gift to us and he ate from it and likewise when a jew woman cooked food and invited the prophet to eat al-susan from it and it was a poisonous or a poisoned uh sheep the prophet went replied and answered the invitation and ate from it though he knew that the earning of the jews is mainly from riba and usury and eating people's wealth unlawfully not stealing so he ate from it despite the fact because it is halal when given and shared to others it is haram on them and i hope this answers your question you"
