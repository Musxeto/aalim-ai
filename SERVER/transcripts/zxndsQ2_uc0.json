  "transcript": "I know him but hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in one ayah he was like a huge man I'm about to dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh in continuation of the ins and outs of marriage in islam today in our 46 episode in sha allah we will be talking about the conditions of marriage so we spoke about how to get engaged and the Islamic prospect of engagement the book goes on to speak about the conditions of marriage and there are a number of conditions one would ask the frequently asked questions where did we get these conditions from if the Quran did not stipulate it or the Sunnah this is where the scholars come allah azzawajal has placed in the quran verses of the quran and told us that in them there will be signs for those of intellect for those of comprehension for those who understand and this meant that those of intellect and comprehension should sit and study the Quran to understand what Allah wanted to tell us which the vast majority of Muslims may not be able to detect this and this is why we have scholars and we have laymen and they gathered and compiled these conditions these pillars these mandatory acts and classified them listed them so that you and I could comprehend and understand like they had done so these conditions are obtained through a vigorous process of reading and compiling and documenting the Quran and the Sunnah and doing so with the understanding of the three favorite generations of the Companions at Abilene and the Tibet tapping so the first condition here is that each of the two spouses must be identified in person what does that mean ambiguity must be removed and this is in all types of contracts I sell you my my mobile phone you say I accept done deal haleh's after sometime I would ask and demand my money you give me an amount that does not rise to my requirement and we start to fight the mobile doesn't cost that much well this is what I want to charge for it and you agreed to buy it and dispute occurs Islam blocks this door of disputes through eliminating ambiguity in marriage ambiguity is very easy a boy comes to meet the father of the girl and in the marriage contract he says I give you my daughter in marriage the boy says I accept the witnesses are there everything is fixed after the party is over he goes and discovers that his bride is not the woman he came to marry they all knew that he was interested in marrying the younger one but the father says no I gave and managed the eldest this is not permissible and such a marriage is not valid why there was proposal and consent and there were witnesses and the dowry paid yes but there was ambiguity identifying the bride was not done properly likewise on the other hand if a guardian of a boy says that I accept the marriage of your daughter fatima to my son or to one of my sons this is not permissible this doesn't do the job and such description is not sufficient and that marriage is not valid but if he did not give the name rather described one of the spouses with a valid description such as I give you my eldest daughter or my youngest daughter there is no problem in that if he has only one daughter and since I give you my daughter in management he doesn't have to say her name because she has no other daughters again this is not problematic there is no problem in that insha'Allah the second condition is known in Arabic as a River meeting that you are content you are willingly accepting you're not not being forced there's no compulsion it's not against your will so this is also a very important condition now I will come later on insha'Allah to discuss the ruling on video marriage contract because someone might think that this is the mother of all ambiguity but I will come to discuss the society Charlotte so content means that the woman is not forced and the boy is not getting married against his will and this happens a lot in families that are run by tyrant parents people who have fathers that don't accept a position or an objection to what they say usually girls are forced into marriage with such an evil father one would claim and say that okay but he's the father is it he will it does it have he have the authority to get his daughter married said yes but not against her will and this was clearly stated by our Prophet Allah his heart was self when a woman came to the Prophet Elisha Absalom complaining and saying O prophet of Allah my father gave me in marriage to my cousin so that for one reason or the other so the Prophet said are a sort of salaam the marriage is not valid and no marriage is valid through compulsion however it is the duty of the girl to oppose and to stand firm and to complain so on her wedding night or before that through the wedding contract she must not sign the contract even if her father forces her to do so she must complain to the judge and tell him that I was forced to sign she must go to the authorities and do whatever she can to change this if she doesn't and then comes the wedding night and she is taken by her husband to their home and she does not stand up for herself she does not tell him that I'm forced I do not want to be married to you if she doesn't go to the police if she doesn't do anything and after a month or so she comes and says I was forced into marriage where were you all this time the judge cannot help you in this you have to make a stance immediately so the woman who came to the Prophet la sala fusa and complained about her father forcing her to get married he told her that you have the Liberty to leave such a marriage as it's invalid the girl spoke and said well as of now I'm ok with my husband but I just wanted women to learn the rights and not to be driven to such a thing that they may not be happy with so this hadith proves to us that forcing a girl to marry someone she doesn't want the marriage itself is invalid this is why we say conditions of marriage what is meant by conditions of marriage a condition is something that comes prior to an action or a form of worship which without its being present the form of worship or that action would be void so a condition of salat is to be in the state of Buddha if a person does not perform Hulu and prays his prayer usually is invalid the third condition is the presence of a woman's guardian not only the presence any it should have been rephrased here it should have been the proposal of the woman's guardian because the proposal is the clearest of all indications of his consent and approval because as we will come to know inshaallah the marriage procedure is by the guardian of the woman proposing to the boy and by the boy accepting the proposal unlike what most people think is that the boy proposes to the girl or to the girl's father and then the father says yes okay I agree they think that this is the norm normal procedure this is not the normal procedure is to have the proposal first so if I go to a shop and the shopkeeper tells me buy from me this piece of cloth for $10 this is a proposal I can say in response I accept or I do this is acceptance house deal is done managed is done so the proposal of the Guardian is essential it's a condition the Prophet said that is solid awesome no marriage is valid without the presence of the Guardian so the vast majority of scholars the vast majority of schools of thought say that a marriage without the proposal and consent of the Guardian is invalid only abu hanifa may Allah have mercy on his soul said that no such a marriage is valid even if her father was not present or was not approving of it and his justification was that in Islam a woman has the right to deal with with her wealth buying selling giving putting into endowment she has the right to do this without the approval of us of her guardian why would she need the approval of her guardian when it comes to her own flesh and her own body she should be the one responsible for that and this justification though might be logical yet it goes against the teaching of the Prophet area so that was salam and before that against the quran because all the cases of marriage in the quran when it comes to women allah addresses it through the guardian so Alonzo Aegean says do not give in marriage those who are idol worshippers or the likes even if you like them so do not give in marriage means that it's not me who's getting married Allah says in the Quran while I thank you who moosh riccati hotteok min do not marry the idol worshipper females until they believe do not marry this is addressed to me but when it comes to the guardians or the females Allah says what I told you who I was like in a hot tub you know do not give the idol worshippers men and marriage until they believe why do we say do not give why doesn't Allah speak to the woman directly like he spoke to the man directly because in marriage a woman needs a guardian she doesn't go and marry herself and this is the opinion of the majority of schools of thought and scholars based on the hadith and if I recall correctly even the top two students of Abu Hanifah may Allah have mercy on them all went against his opinion and stated that a woman cannot marry herself and this is the description of chaos when a woman over passes overrides her father's opinion and she goes in get gets married we've seen this a lot especially in liberal places where women go to universities and colleges and work in mixed environment she sits with a stranger for eight hours minimum a day at work well while she sits with her father and siblings may be less than quarter of that time less than two hours a day what would you expect Shaitaan to do and all of a sudden we find out that she was married for three years in secret this is not marriage this is proper zina this is fornication because it was the Prophet himself Ali so some who said no marriage is valid without the presence of the guardian so he is not present if he doesn't give his consent if he does not propose then the marriage is invalid the now in regards of guardian because I faced a lot of such problems especially doing while doing counseling sessions while being asked a lot of the Muslims nowadays are involved in marriage through Skype or through zoom or through any of these new technologies that facilitate things and get those who are far close by so what's the ruling on that in a nutshell if ambiguity is eliminated the marriage is valid but this ambiguity has to be eliminated with all parties what do you mean Cher well when we are face to face on the internet I have a webcam and a screen or a monitor you have a webcam and a monitor we see one another so I would say hi my name is Asma Hakim and the father of the girl says my name is X Y Z I never met him I know the girl through matrimonial websites or through a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend and when I look into her character into her CV and we had a meeting in the presence of her brother through online of course I felt inclined to marry her and she did this had the same feeling now in order to get this marriage valid I have to know whether the garden is truly her guardian or not because in so many cases which I was involved in a woman comes to me saying to me that she got her Makai her marriage contract with X person and after the marriage the guy disappeared and she doesn't know the witnesses because they came from his side and she has no contact with him so she's married but she's not married she's supposed to have a husband but there is no husband inside okay she wants to move on and marry someone else but she can't because she's already married what to do well this is your problem you put yourself in this mess and so many Muslims put themselves in such similar messes when they don't ask I get people coming to me a brother called me a seditious I bought a car in installments and I don't want to know whether this is halal or Haram subhanAllah when did you buy it is it only last week why didn't you ask then said I didn't know because the offer was good and it was Alexis said Alexis has its glow and temptation it's already done the damage is done you bought the card and if I tell you to quit they'll tell you to pay thirty thousand dollars for using it for one week this is a contract so why didn't you ask Jeff I saw a woman whoa she's a bombshell her father must be a terrorist because she's a bomb Subhan Allah then what he said I proposed online and sent her an email I ask Allah for forgiveness because we used the chit chat until I got to know her now I really am desperate to marry her so we got online and she told me that this is her father he was an elderly man and then we got married and after a couple of months I discovered that she's married to six other boys and that old man was rented and the two witnesses were not her siblings rather they were University colleagues I don't know what to do now you come and ask me why didn't you even send me an email give me a call contacted any other ship would have told you that there should be no room for ambiguity therefore to conduct a marriage through internet you have to be certain of the person or persons involved so as a boy a man I have to know the identity the true identity of the father of the girl and identity of the girl herself and the two witnesses one would say okay what about the mithoon the one who writes the contract this guy is not part of Islam he's just a cleric to authenticate a document but if I know that the girl's father is my uncle he's my neighbor in my hometown for 20 years there's no ambiguity if I know that the girl is my cousin and my parents are there on the other side I'm living in a new airport somewhere else and they are in my hometown so everybody knows everyone there's no ambiguity they know that I'm their cousin and their relative and their neighbor and the witnesses are known to all we can get them whatever we want such a marriage is valid and there's no problem in that so usually people don't follow this procedure why because they have one objective in their map and the mind and we would like to do it immediately after marriage contract this is what's usually happening the girl is here I'm here but the barrier of Haram is there we want to take that barrier away so we give concessions we don't follow the protocol and after the marriage is done and I get what I want then we start to ask questions this is wrong you don't shoot first then ask questions this is what people are doing and then they're coming and having counseling sessions what to do how can i rectify this a sister calls and says that I'm married to a man I don't know where the man is the witnesses are not willing to contact me the imam himself just fled and I'm stranded I am married but I can't get out of this match no matter how many Islamic centers I visit they say ok no problem just give us a paper of marriage she says I don't have we didn't document it ok give us the ID card the name the mobile number of the husband of the witnesses well he fled the country I don't know where he is the witnesses don't want to talk to me Finola so just because of a one-night stand you destroy your life or face the possibility of getting married while you're still married the issues of marriage is very very important to learn and to have control over your desires and lust marriage is not a carte blanche for you to go and see whatever woman you like and you just jump the gun Palace pose let's get married let's go to 8711 and see the cleric or order a share to get us married and move on marriage is a constitution it is a strong pledge as mentioned by allah in the quran fourth condition is the presence of witnesses so the previous hadith the Prophet said no marriage is valid without the presence of the guardian and he said afterward afterwards and to sound witnesses so when we say sound witnesses what do we mean by Idol Shahid a Idol meaning that they shouldn't be open sinners or fornicators because fornicators are not trustworthy are not sound so if I get someone who's a well-known open a fornicator to testify on a marriage this guy is not trustworthy because it doesn't care about Harlan harm and by the way if we go back to the condition of the Guardian the Guardian is not any person who relate is related to a woman so some people say ok shake I proposed to a girl her father refused so I asked her brother and brother says ok I have no problem no it doesn't go like this The Guardian must be the father if he's dead then his father that is the paternal grandfather of the girl if not then her son if she was previously married and has a son if not then her brother's if not than her paternal uncles if not then her paternal cousins The Guardian cannot be someone from the sight of the mother a maternal relative even a grandfather doesn't work he has to be a person that carries the same name and he must be an adult so I can't have a child or a young boy who did not reach puberty acting as a guardian for his sister mother or whatever he must be an adult he must be sane I can't get someone who's 20 years of age but unfortunately he is severely autistic and doesn't understand has the brains of a three-year-old child he cannot be a guardian he must be a free man so even if I want to marry a woman whose father is a slave he cannot be her guardian because the slave does not possess his own freedom let alone possess the right to marry someone to someone else and the Guardian must share the same religion with his daughter or sister whatever so if I were to marry a Muslim whose Rivard previously Christian or Hindu her father is a kafir disbeliever he has no authority over his Muslim daughter so what should I do I should look in her paternal relatives someone who's Muslim so if I find that she has a Muslim brother excellent she has a Muslim uncle that's the job if neither or none existing to be Muslims in this case the Prophet said are a lot of Salaam that Muslim ruler is the Guardian to those who do not have a guardian assault on wali woman Liliana and who's the Muslim ruler if you're a Muslim country then the head of the country or those who he had appointed such as the governor such as the Muslim judge in the Muslim Court they would take the place of the Guardian and they would give the authority of marrying this woman to you if there is no Muslim ruler no Muslim Authority as in the case of Europe or America so you go to the authorised Islamic centre because this is the Islamic Authority existing at that place where all Muslims should abide by their instructions and they should follow their orders so you go there that Imam of the authorized Islamic Center would act as a guardian in this case so number four the presence the presence of witnesses and again unfortunately a lot of the Muslims who are ignorant conducted their marriages in a nun Islamic way a lot of Muslims in Europe for example go and have a civil marriage so they go he goes with her with the father of the girl and the girl with him and they conduct a marriage contract in the City Hall stating that I married Fatima the daughter of ahmed on this particular day and maybe the father would propose I give my daughter Fatima to some soul and the boy says I agree and they have a certificate civil marriages there and it's registered and they live for 20 years then after watching my ask that or ask for the program's is it the whoops we have houston we have a problem what's the problem our marriage is not valid why there were no Muslim witnesses yes but it is authenticated it is registered in the City Hall it is documented is it is not an Islamic marriage without the presence of two Muslim male witnesses her father was there her father doesn't count as a witness he's a guardian you need two men Muslim men witnessing this well no we didn't have any well your marriage is invalid what you do this is another issue solving current problems needs you to send us an email or maybe book as a counseling session or get me on the phone providing it's less than five minutes that's free send us an email that's free put a question in the question box that's also free we will get to answer it later on insha'Allah finally there is a condition that is also classified as a pillar so a lot of the schools of thought don't mention this but it is mentioned because it is in between which is the absence of any reason that preclude the marriage such as the prospective spouse or spouses having been breastfed by one woman or following different religion or they were in the state of Haram etc what does that mean I can marry any woman on earth unless there is an obstacle preventing me from marrying her doesn't sound logical what kind of obstacles are we talking about first of all can I marry my sister of course not this is incest why not because she's not permissible for you she's a mom to you so this is one of the obstacles I cannot marry any of my mom whether she's my mom or my daughter or my sister or my aunt or my niece among others of course I'm not gonna go into details of the Maharaja no that is Charla so this is one of those I cannot marry to to widen up the scope I cannot marry anyone who is already married which means couple of billion women on earth I marry why because they're married they have a an existing husband so this is an obstacle free if a woman I'm interested in and myself were breastfed by an auntie so an elder woman in her 70s 80s she said when you guys were infants I breastfed you for a whole week so now this woman is my sister through suckling I cannot marry her and the same happened at the time of the Prophet is awesome when a man who was already married with children met a woman and she said you and your wife I suckled when you both were infants so the man went straight to the Prophet as a son and he said o prophet of Allah the woman says so and so so the settler prophets have a son leave your wife she's your sister he said o prophet of Allah how can I leave my wife for such a testimony and the Prophet said what do you want me to do as long as it was said the woman testified that's it that's sufficient so this is an obstacle another obstacle would be that I'm interested in marrying a woman but this woman is not lawful for me because as a Muslim man I can only marry a Christian woman a Jewish woman or a Muslim woman but this woman is Buddhist or she is agnostic she doesn't believe in any religion it is totally prohibited for me to marry her and if I attempt this marriage was being would be void and invalid and among other conditions there are obstacles that would prevent such a marriage from taking place now what are the are can and are can are the essentials of marriage we have a number of them and I think we will stop here to check the questions that we did not finish last week or last Monday so question number nine alley or Aiza says what to do when your heart is hardened and this needs a lecture allah azza wajal as mentioned in the hadith does not look at our bodies or our wealth how much do we have in a bank account rather he looks at our hearts and our deeds this is what allah a soldier looks at hence the heart is the most important organ in your body because it makes it or breaks it it can be filled with Eman and it can be filled with hypocrisy and disbelief allah azzawajal tells us that Ibrahim said in the Quran that salvation should only be for those who come on the day of judgment with a healthy pure heart and I will not get into the discussion how can the heart be the center of feelings of choice of intellect while the brain has these powers this is a long topic all what we understand in the quran' is that this flesh is the center for all of these things that we talk about such as the choices the feelings the love and hate the belief and disbelief so this heart as a prophet Savannah so Salaam there is a morsel in the body if it is fixed then the whole body is fixed and if it is bad or rotten or corrupt the whole body is corrupt it is the heart the Prophet says also so so when you have a hardened heart you have a big problem there are things that soft in the heart and there are things that hard in the heart for example the Prophet said al-asad solemn avoid excessive laughter because excessive laughter kills the heart when all our day and night we're engaged in laughing cracking jokes watching stand-up comedy's watching comic movies and comedian movies or comedy movies and reading comic books that are all you know making you laugh this would lead to your heart to your hearts death and by that we don't mean kardi a trick attack rather than we mean the ability to love Islam and to taste the sweetness of the Quran and to enjoy salad etc the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam told us about how sins impact our hearts and that every sin a black dot is placed on the heart and if a person quits and asks Allah for forgiveness it's erased and if it is not then the dots continue to occur until the heart is overwhelmed and becomes as dark as night the Prophet said Ras salatu wassalam whoever misses three consecutive Friday prayers and with the lockdown one is not included because this is forced upon us it's not by choice so whoever misses without a legitimate reason Allah will place a seal on his heart and how would that be it's not a physical seal that you see it is simply that Allah seals your heart so that when you hear the truth you're unable to process it when you hit the or and being recited you don't feel that you're understanding it or enjoying it when you hear the Adhan calling for the prayer you see everybody going to the Masjid and you're the only one who is going in the other direction people are looking at you you're not aware of any of this because you heedless you're neglectful so hearts are hardened by sins are dried by not remembering Allah and reading the Quran are stiffened it becomes stiff when you don't mix with righteous practicing company this is why the prophets entering his thought was cinema that a wolf attacks a stray sheep that went away from the pack from the hurt and shape and attacks those who are alone don't have righteous company don't mix with righteous people this is why your heart is hardened your heart is softened by an by liquor by prayer by listening to lectures by attending circles of knowledge by reading beneficial books but it is hardened by listening to music by watching Haram movies and Oprah's and the likes by looking at harem pictures nude women or men pornography all of these tarnish the purity of your heart so it is like a tree where pure water from the river is irrigating it and sewer water is also irrigating it the tree inevitably is inclined to what goes into its veins more so whether it is nauseous or pyre this depends on the amount that enters it likewise your heart so how to soft in your heart this again requires a lot of talk which we don't have time for but there is a beautiful hadith and it's a glimpse there are many Hadees that shows you how to soft in your heart where the Prophet said to his companion Arya solo son do you like to soft in your heart and to attain the things you need and want and I said yes of course I attained I need to attain wealth to buy a new car or house or to pay my debts how to do that the Prophet said if you wear two white over the head of an orphan this would soft in your heart and helps you attain what you want subhanAllah this is the last thing I could ever imagine to be of such great reward wiping over the head of an orphan of course this is a metaphorical gesture of being kind of being loving of being merciful of providing for that orphan not just going randomly in an orphanage and just wipe their heads and then leave no this is not what it was meant it is referring to showing love and compassion to this broken heart an orphan who lost his father and he's below the age of puberty needs compassion needs mercy needs love so there are so many things that would soft in your your heart but as for now fill your heart with Quran with vicar with worshiping Allah with listening to lectures being around practicing righteous people instead of being around people who do not relate to the Dean and misogynist Aziza says can women wear wigs and remove it when praying the Prophet said allahís alot was salam in the hadith that was narrated by Abdullah and mr. only Lauren and it's in the sia la laa la silla tower must Allah may Allah curse the one who fixes extensions to women and for the women who get extensions fixed to them what is meant by extensions hair extensions so if a woman comes she has short hair and she gets fake braids or fake long hair and she would have Wow mashallah fixed to her hair she is cursed and the hairdresser who did that to her is cursed as well wearing a wig is even far worse than extensions because at least in extensions you have the real hair and you have the fake hair but when you wear a wig it's all fake so it's worse but it is permissible to wear a wig only when this is used to remove a defect so a woman who lost her hair completely not that her hair is thin no she's completely bald as in the case of women undergoing chemotherapy may Allah cure our ill people she loses her hair in this case it is totally permissible for it to wear a wig because this wig is not for beautification rather to restore amla's original creation and to remove a defect there is no problem that but to wear a wig so that you please your husband or that you look different or for even for costume parties this is Haram which leads us to what about the hair that clowns wear again this is a wig and this is Haram so people have to pay attention to this and Allah knows best it has nothing to do with your prayer so if your sinful and you put it on and you put your hijab on top of it and you pray your prayer is valid families Hussein says can I recite the sewers in Salah loudly while praying alone so either Ambreen is asking because she's a woman I don't know if the name of is a name of a woman or not so she's asking I'm alone can I recite or an infidel Margaret raesha and night prayer aloud or not that's it is yes there's no problem in you reciting these prayers aloud even if you're not alone even if the there are moms your brother your father your son your uncle no problem your voice is not a problem for them to here the other possibility is that Amin is asking about raising the voice in silent Broca's like the vomer prayer our prayer the last Locker of Margaret and the last two rakahs of raesha these are silent for men and women so can she recite them loudly the answer is as for permissibility this is Helen this is okay as for the sooner this is against the stern and you would be losing reward when you recite it loudly but the prayer is valid and you have no problem with that and says how to deal with angry people stay away from them simple as that when someone is angry just stay away from them don't talk to them don't respond to their anger don't defend yourself meaning that when they curse you or say bad words don't defend yourself don't argue with them because Shaitaan is overriding them taking control over them so the best thing is to stay away from them and to make done whatever you do is going to provoke them and make them more they make them angrier and maybe say things that would take them out of the fold of Islam because of you in the sari the Prophet was once with his companions when they saw two men arguing together in a very strong fashion they were angry but one of them was so angry his eyes almost popped out his veins were so clear and his voice was high was right it was loud so the Prophet s have said to his companions now notice that the Prophet did not go and intervene he could have but it wasn't device a wise decision so the Prophet taught his companions a lesson and he said to them I know a phrase if he were to say it Allah would relieve him from what he is suffering from that is his anger what is the phrase I would allure him in a shape or nerve regime a beautiful phrase imagine the wife and I are fighting and she's saying heinous things to me abusing me cursing me you're not a man you'll not have the man you used to be you feel when a man divorce me I don't want to stay with you I don't want to live with you in the heat of the moment I also get angry and I'm tempted something is pushing me I'm looking there's nothing but something is pushing me to divorce her to beat her to do anything excuse me who's who's talking to me oh it's straight on Shaitaan wants me to divorce the Prophet says Anna his awesome if I say at the moment with contemplation I would be learning min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem end of story I would like having the ice bucket thrown on my head whoa ass it's all gone all what I see is an angry woman shouting pulling her hair I can't hear anything I said I ought to be laughs I'm seeking refuge in Allah I would never divorce her but if I don't say that word she would pull the trigger she would push a button that would inevitably make me say I devotion and then everything is done Shaitaan is over there sitting laughing a standoff and not only that it is the prop well yelling what are my grandchildren just walked in that indeed sure what have you sorry for that so the issue is say this phrase now the Prophet said this is not Salaam one of the Companions it might be manageable it might be someone else took the phrase and went to the man and said O prophet and he said to the man who was angry was furious in a state of rage he said the Prophet Allah saw to some says that if you were to say I would appeal a min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem this would take away all of your anger now if you were in your normal state of mind you would say but you're not this is a problem you are not in your normal set of way so what did the man do a companion but he was in rage he said go away from me do you think I'm crazy so he rejected the advice of the professor he redirected his anger on this companion who the companion acted upon him his own self he did not take permission from the Prophet Isis Salam therefore when people are angry stay away from their path it's like saying chef there's a hurricane there's a tornado coming to strike our village or city what what should we do run well can we take shelter can we do you can but the best way is to stay away from its path otherwise it's going to any have devastating impact on you and everyone else was man says it's very hard to know who to take the knowledge from how to know who take Islamic knowledge from this is an issue that we've always mentioned before even Assyrian may Allah have mercy on us all says in the Hallel medinan this knowledge is religion and you should know who to take your religion from usually if I hear of a person and I like the way he looks and sounds I've listened to one of his lectures in Wow that was a good lecture I would check his credentials so I would check those who know him so I would say to the scholars around me in my country what do you think of X Y Zed now I know that even scholars have problems among themselves due to rivalry maybe Envy so I shavasan I look at other deities and scholars and I'm envious why are they more famous than me what they do they have more followers than me if I don't fear Allah a soldier when asked about X died or student of knowledge or as you guys call them scholars they are not college but so someone asks me what do you think of share so-and-so because I'm envious I said well I is not good they has problems in our tea that I don't feel a lot I'm envious and my testimony is driven by hate grudge and envy I'm in hell but if someone asks me and I'm bound to answer to the best of my knowledge ok this person has problems in Aikido what do you want me to do sugarcoat it this person has problems with flirting with women it's as you see it on on videos cracking jokes laughing I don't know about this private life this brother is not knowledgeable he's famous but he has zero knowledge in Sharia so what am I to do so you have to go and check with the scholars of your environment of the community now bearing in mind there's no one's perfect so definitely you will not find a companion in the form of a scholar but you try your level best to get as close as possible to the best available they would direct you to scholars that they think that they are on the right path of the Quran the Sunnah of with the understanding of the three favorite generations and also checking their track record and someone who's been around for 10 or 20 years what are his shortcomings what are the mistakes he made throughout this long period of time if you count one or two in such a period of time this guy's almost perfect but if you count a mistake every single lecture or every single week and the guy's catastrophic and what he delivers then you know that even if he's famous you have to stay away from him so the process itself is difficult because it's not for you let me rephrase it it's not for laymen it is required to be studied thoroughly and analyzed by trustworthy students of knowledge there are students of knowledge who criticize everyone anyone who does not follow their allama there summer had they would criticize them and sometimes they wake up in the morning and look in the mirrors of what the heck is this and they criticize their own selves no you don't listen to those listen to those who are fair those who have benefited the Ummah those who are known not to have hidden agendas wanting to raise people and lower others those who fear allah azzawajal and may Allah make it easy for you to find what you are looking for so I think we would stop here hoping to meet you with the grace of allah azzawajal on next monday where we will speak about the pillars and essentials of marriage so until that date I live in fear Manila West Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
