  "title": "Masjids open with social distancing, not allowing my child 2 pray there, am I sinful if I pray home?",
  "transcript": "the u.s. Islamic Toula so now I'm gonna catch oh I I think I might have heard the end of this maybe you might have answered it but just in case I figure out ask any anyways so my Masjid opened up yesterday for Juma they've been open for five le salar de soir but yesterday they finally opened up for Juma but they said we have to do the whole social distancing stuff and also anybody under the age of ten cannot go I have a son who is seven who already praise and he fast the basically act like an adult Muslim he does everything with me so and I'm also not comfortable with social distancing inshallah so my question is am i sinful for now going to Juma because one they're not letting me take my son and true they're making me do social distance in this a lot okay that yes he's from the States and he said that yesterday they were allowed to pray Juma but because of his son who's seven years of age they've banned anyone below ten years of age to attend the prayer and therefore he has these problems of attending so he's asking am i justified to not attend first of all if the authorities thought that this is the best scenario to handle opening houses of worship you should comply you don't want to swim against the tide ending up and being accused of spreading discovered 19 because you did not commit to it so for example I don't like the issue of social distancing and I'm a hundred percent with you but if I go to the message and I find people distancing themselves from one another and I want to become a Rambo and stand in between the two of them this is wrong first of all because I'm defying the authorities who backed by doctors whether they're right or wrong this is not my speciality I have to be with the pack I have to be with the majority I have to be with the Muslims so I have to comply secondly I'm harming others and I don't want to tarnish the reputation of Islam or being committed to the Sunna a selfie or from a hadith or Arsenal JAMA and end up tarnishing the reputation of my beliefs and my conviction so for you if you truly not happy with the social distancing and the issue is an issue of dispute still we don't have the unified opinion of the major scholars of saying that this is ok we can do it therefore if you decide to pray home due to that you have the right to do that now do you have the right to pray home because they banned your son no you don't his prayer is on one side your prayer is it on the other side they didn't ban him because he was not he they banned him because they are afraid that he might be infected as a child especially with the latest infections to children in New York and and the number of infant's that were affected by it with a different car was a key I think disease to them which is different to the copied 19 but it is a result of it so they don't have anything personal against your child if they prevent him this does not justify you not to go there and Lazo John knows best"
