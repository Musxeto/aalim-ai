  "transcript": "children eloheem and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam wa and mobile-sierra metaldehyde Amin nabina muhammad in wada Adi he was a huge marine assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato we continue studying the book of room that will become and we are still in the chapter that deals with bahara and as a reminder Tahara means purification purity and it has two meanings one physical which is you have to clean and remove that from your body from your clothes and from the place you're praying in and one is moral something we cannot touch your seat and this is major such as being in the state of janaba sexual impurity this can only be lifted by oasl and this can't be minor such as when you pass wind or answer the call of nature and this can be uplifted by performing Moodle and Woodill is our topic for today the eighth hadith is one of the great hadith with us so who would volunteer to read this hadith please kolima do qumran the freed slave of osman said I saw Osman now la be pleased with him calling for a vessel of water and poured water over his hands three times and then washed them then he put his right hand in the vessel and rinsed his mouth and cleaned his nose then he washed his face three times and his hands up to the elbows three times then wiped his head then washed his feet three times then he said that the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam had said he who performed ablution like this illusion of mine and offered two Rakas of braille without allowing his thoughts to be distracted all his previous sins would be expiated very well this hadith of Quran one of the servants of Earthmen even - may Allah be pleased with the third caliph of Islam and twice the son-in-law of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as he married to two of his daughters may Allah be pleased with them all he is describing to us how the prophet alayhi salat wa salam performed boodle and if you go to look at what he had done you will find it to be in compliance with the Quran because in Surat al-ma'idah chapter 5 verse 6 Allah describes to us how we should perform ooodle and as you recall in previous episodes we said that there are six pillars of Moodle is this correct so let's count them once again the first pillar washing the face of the rock man second pillar hands or cleansing the mouth or the nose no tea you have to when studying for be in full concentration it's like playing badminton if you blink when he's serving you lose and in fact every single word comes and that is why you study the fundamentals of sulphur which is a very serious science that teaches you the meaning and how to use each word and that is why they have general meaning and they have specific meaning and they have what is known as metallic and mukha yet and all these terminologies refer to the usage of the word and what it means we go back again concentrate we have six pillars of Moodle without any of them your rule is invalid that is why when we say pillar also this is studied in fundamentals of fair when you verify something to be a pillar without it the whole building collapses so pillars of ruk or if i forget to make rock or if i do not bow once in a for Raqqa prayer so I did only three but one of them I forgot I immediately went into prostration is my prayer valid my prayer is invalid unless I make up for that during the prayer why because a pillar has gone so we go out back again four of the pillars are mentioned in the Quran washing the face which include cleansing the mouth and inhaling and blowing your nose washing your arms till the elbows to think that washing the hands is not sufficient because this is the hand and in Arabic this also can mean to be the hand which is the full arm so you have to be specific and that is why when Allah tells us in the Quran that the punishment of a person who Till's is to chop his hand to chop his hand to chop his hand to chop his hand after you know because the word in Arabic may carry all of these meaning so it is essential that you know what you meant by this and for an example you know the word I mean in Arabic what does it mean I I mean means I however it has other meaning for example the letter I mean which begins with us my name is Hassan so the first little my name is Iying it means the organ itself the I it means a spring of water hang on Jerry ax Teja Einon Jerry and the Quran sort of Russia it also means a spy I sent mine I sent an eye to go and find out what's happening and it also means the entity of things I initiate the entity of this thing and not this thing so the word itself has a number of meanings so you have to be in fact very practical and very specific when you say washing the hands I did that in the beginning know it washing the arms up to the elbow and in the Quran its refers to ID idea come in animal offal and the third pillar wiping our head and then washing our feet to the ankles up to the ankles number five order what do you mean by order I cannot start with my feet and then my face I have to go pace arms to the elbows head and then feet to the ankles and number six is the continuity or the sequence in the sense that I don't leave a big gap leaving a gap means that I'm not being in sequence and then I have to do it all over again so these are the pillars if you look at the hadith you'll find the pillars but you'll find also an added value which is the spoon now what do you mean by Sunnah things if you do you reward it if you don't do you are not sinful you're not sinful so let's go on to look at the hadith of earth man first of all the first thing he did was to pour water and washing his hands three times why we said that before that this is so that you are able to enter your hands into the vessel if you don't wash your hand maybe your hands have the germs they're not clean smelly by entering your hands into the vessel before washing it this would not make you feel good and would not make those coming behind you to use the water feel good neither so he did this and this is a Sunnah the Prophet is the one who did it because he's describing to us what the Prophet did erase a lot of cinema then he got his hand right hand in the water took a scoop made rinsing the mouth inhaling and blowing and he did not tell us here how many times so we are assuming it is once because afterwards he says then he washed his face three times so now we know that this is different than washing the face I don't know let's assume it's once and washing the face three times then he washed his hands up to the elbows three times okay so three times again then he wiped his head then washed his feet three times wiping the head how many times he did not take so we assume that it is once and then he said I have seen the prophet alayhi salatu salam perform mu do exactly as i've showed you and then he said whoever performs rule like this and prays to Rakas without talking to himself without allowing the thought to be distracted Allah who'd forgive all of his previous sins very easy has anybody tried it has anybody tried these two rakahs what are you successful not always well it is very difficult it needs training it cannot come from the first time it is exactly when you go to the gym and try to benchpress 100 kilograms you cannot even lift it but if you start with 5 kilograms and over the year you build it up to 30 and over the 3-4 years you build it up to 100 it will come likewise if you try this prayer once five times hundred times a thousand times maybe why because every time you're fighting yourself and those who fight who struggle Allah would guide them Allah said in the last verse of surah Chabad well ladina jihad Rufina then idnum sabudana those who struggle in our cause and a lot cause we will guide them so you struggle you will attain this and the reward is not something to be taken lightly all of your previous our sins are forgiven so I think it's worth trying every now and then so these are two rakahs our topic is not these two rakahs our topic is wudu ablution so we will go back to some of the lessons that can be learned from this hadith just after the break so stay tuned salam alikum law and welcome back the hadith of us man may allah be pleased with him regarding woudl has a lot of lessons we could learn from among them first that all beautiful things we have to begin by using the right hand and that is why he did this when performing Woodill first of all he wash his hands and then entered his right hand rather than entering both hands and one of the things that callers differed upon is the issue of turning the water in your mouth and inhaling and blowing your nose is it mandatory is it part of your boodle or not the majority of scholars stated that this is not part of the would do and it is not mandatory however other scholars said that it is mandatory imam ahmed may allah have mercy on his soul said that it is mandatory in moodle simply because the prophet adam had never ever left it there is not a single report that he performed without making mod model honest in shock and since our turning the water in his mouth rinsing his mouth and inhaling and blowing his nose and secondly because of the hadith of lucky tomisaburo may allah be pleased with him when the prophet told him exaggerate in turning the water in your mouth and inhaling and blowing your nose unless you're fasting so he's telling him do that and do that quite well meaning that it is something that mandatory now having said that using the right hand side I'll give you a scenario and tell me if my water is correct or not I went to the bathroom turned the faucet on made my Baba is sin Shah is sin far and washed my face washed my hands to the elbows wipe my head and my feet is my voodoo correct or not who those who say correct raise your hands one two three four five six seven those who say it's not correct raise your hands one two three four five six seven eight you've raised your hand twice so you are with or without and it's not correct okay those who say it is not correct why can you just define Kelly you did not wash your hands in the beginning yes I did not wash my hands in the beginning does this have to do anything with Ludo is it mandatory is it a pillar is it the Sunnah always classify things in their perspective so that I can identify this is Rajab mandatory this is a pillar this is a Sunnah so if I do not do the Sunnah no problem I lose the reward buts no problem if I do not do the Rajab intentionally there is a problem if I don't do the pillar then there is no another so let's go back to the pillars of Moodle first of all the first port mentioned in the Quran I did exactly what Allah mentioned in the Quran in chapter 5 verse 6 o you who believe if you want to pray what do you do wash your face and this is what I did therefore my wooden was 100% correct those who said my wood was correct they get full mark those who don't next year insha Allah I'll give you another scenario I went wash my hand three times wash my face and hailed and blow my nose and turn the water in my mouth and then continued the rest my order is correct or not correct yes ma'am he thinks he's correct but it's not part of the Sunna who shares the opinion who okay nobody who says that it's incorrect one and the rest they are undecided yet undetermined the question is is it correct or not the answer is it is correct why the sequence is not there yet the sequence is their face and this is all face whether you begin by washing or you begin by turning the water in your mouth or begin by inhaling and blowing your nose all these three other thing so there's no problem understood no problem there the last scenario I went to the bathroom say bismillah wash my hands Rita and I'm going to describe to you exactly what I'm going to do and then water mouth nose my face the water my left hand my right hand a head then my feet would Oh is correct or incorrect those who say correct raise your hand one two three four five six seven eight nine okay those who say incorrect raise your hand one two three four five six tell me why because that left hand was used first yes I did the left hand first and then the right but this is again tuna not a pillar and not mandated so I can begin with the left and the right then and left foot and right foot is the sequence is the order correct yes face arms and legs but I switch the arms instead of right I began with the left and that is why I Lee may allah be pleased with him said i care less if i begin with the left over the right because it follows the sequence of the quran so it is a sunnah to begin with the right but if you begin with the left it is not a problem however i made another mistake while doing the wood that makes my wood according to a lot of scholars not valid yes he didn't do your ears for some reason i didn't even wipe my head I said continue that no no that is initio sure and in ideas ok just to save time the biggest problem that a lot of Muslims don't pay attention to is that when they wash in the beginning their hands 3 times when it comes to washing the arm they skip the palm of their hands so they wash from the wrist to the elbows what about the pump should we washed it in the beginning haha but washing it from the beginning is a Sunnah is not part of the order so you actually did not complete your wouldl imagine how many people are doing this you do you see it that you do it yourself you wash in the beginning after washing the face the water is coming down you just wash from here today and then you wash from here today what about the pumps I don't know have to I wash them in the beginning the order is important and that is why when you wash your hand in water you have to wash the palm of your hand and part of the Sunnah is to wash the inside of your fingers with your other fingers and to the elbows so this is quite important does anybody have any questions regarding this point well we go on O Shaykh from the beginning till the end if you can just classify what are the pillars and the mandatory and the Sun now you're getting confused with the mandatory and the Sunnah ok pillars are clear it is an issue of dispute about the mandatory things because as we I've stated the majority considered that the nose and the mouth are voluntary not mandatory and the most authentic opinion it is mandatory so the Sunan is that you begin with saying bismillah not saying bismillah does not nullify your uluru do is intact but it is a valid grade and degree and a lot of the times people say where do we say bismillah if we're in the bathroom can we say verbally bismillah can we now people are hesitant in answering yes we can say bismillah unless it is the place where we answer the call of nature and even if it's in the place where we answer the call of nature it is different than the place that the Companions used to answer the call of nature why at the time of the Prophet and they did not have any running water they did not have any toilets so they had to go to the desert or out of the city to answer the call of nature so the dirt the filth the feces the urine was dead except for those who buried it and I don't think that a lot of people cared about that because nature will take its course nowadays our bathrooms are not like this on the country our bathrooms in our homes sometimes are even more clean than our living rooms because everybody is careful that to wash it to have it in perfect hygiene and to put detergents and and there is no filth all the NASA is gone so that's why some scholars even say that it is permissible to say bismillah in a loud voice but to take it in between it's sufficient for you to move your lips by saying this is enough taking the ball washing the hand this is part of the Sunnah if you don't if you just immediately go and rinse your mouth and blow your nose and wash your face it does the job third of all the sequence in the pillar the order in the pillar the face it has three things mouth nose and washing the face if I with any of those it's permissible because the order is Sunnah it's not mandatory in the pillar itself thirdly likewise when I wash the arms if I begin with the right this is a Sunnah if I begin with the left this is okay wiping the head it has to be once this is the Sunnah if you do more you are sinful why because wiping the head is to minimize the exposure of the head to water otherwise Allah could have ordered us to wash our head our head every time what will happen you will catch cold 24/7 you'll always be sneezing and coughing and having bad illnesses because of this Allah made it easy only once what is the Sunnah in it to go back and forward and the scholars all say that this is a pillar however the Sunnah is quite obvious the Prophet always wipe his hair one to do the ears the Prophet said the ears are part of the head in the hadith so it is not only a Sunnah it becomes mandatory as well and to wash your feet this is obvious up to the ankles this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wa laqad"
