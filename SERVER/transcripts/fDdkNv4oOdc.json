brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the holy month the noble month of Ramadan is a season whoever neglects it is among those who are doomed by Allah so John the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once was stepping down from his Milberg and every step he used to say I mean Amy Amy and the Companions said to him prophet of Allah what are you saying I mean - and then he said sallallahoalyhiwasallam it was gibreel telling me o muhammad whoever rama bond gets to him and he is not forgiven and then thrown into hell may allah azza wajal cast him away so say me and the Prophet said I saw a me how many Rama bonds have passed over us can anyone say can anyone claim that allah azza wajal has forgiven our sins do we feel good about the previous year rama bonds that have passed us well let's not talk about the past and let's talk about the present time this is a season this is a moment that we should cease we should do our best to get closer to allah azzawajal and allah subhana WA Ta'ala did not limit ways to get closer to him on things that we are unable to do Allah gave us a whole array of variations Jojen instructed us to fast and he gave us a glad tidings that whoever fasts the month of ramadhan believing in its obligation and anticipating for the reward from Allah has organ allah the almighty would forgive his previous sins not only that we know that there are 8 gates to paradise to Al Jenna and one of them is called a Ryan only those who fast will enter from it so we have to fast but also we have to offer a lot of good deeds in Roma Bahn there are lots and lots of things to do for you to choose from and if you are favored by Allah if you're blessed by Allah you'll be able to do most or all of them there is night prayer known as taraweeh and the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave us the glad tiding he said whoever prays with the imam until he concludes his night prayer Allah would wreck record for him the reward of a whole night as if you prayed from Asia until Fechter so if you pray with your email for an hour top two hours Allah Georgia would give you the reward of a whole night not only that if you do this every single night the Prophet Eraser option tells us again whoever prays Roma Bahn there is night prayer in Ramadan the whole of ramadan allah azza wajal would forgive his previous sins providing that he has done this believing in the reward and anticipating of it 30 days some people say this is a lot allah azza wajal is asking us not only that he is facilitating to us to get closer to him allah says to his prof salatu salam and the prophets of allah wa salem informed us that if you offer night prayer in lailatul qatar the night of decree which is one of the night of the last 10 nights of ramadan if you pray that night Allah would forgive all of your previous sins so anyone who misses this chance and aperture tea would be considered to be insane would not be considered as a proper logical intellectual Muslim because he's giving this reward away for nothing for what for a movie for a TV program to sit comfy in your house all of this can be done later on but getting closer to allah azzawajal cannot be accept in this season the season of opportunities the Prophet tells us is a lot of Salaam that the people on the day of judgment will be under the shade of their charity of their Sbrocco and this is why the prophet aerosol of Salam was not seen more generous than the month of Ramadan so it is an opportunity for those who cannot pray night prayer to give generously for the cause of Allah to help the poor to help the needy to feed the hungry to assist in giving Dawa to the Muslims and to the non-muslims to build the mosques and the Islamic centers so that we can spread the word of Allah your wealth can be one of the means for you to enter Jannah with not only that the month of Ramadan if you ask any Muslim they would tell you it's the months of month of fasting and it is the month of the Quran so this month dedicated to recite the Quran to memorize the Quran to understand the meaning of the things that you're reciting and reading because you will not get closer to Allah better than what a lot soldier has revealed to us the Companions those righteous predecessors of ours if you read their biographies and see how they used to decide the Quran you would be astonished the least you could do is finish the whole Quran in Ramadan this is the least there are people who used to recite the whole Quran once a day as man even I found me Allah be pleased with him prayed the whole Quran in one raka one Whitter raka from Asia until fuzzy prayer near the Kaaba he recited the whole Quran and a lot of the Muslims don't even know how the Quran looks like except in Ramadan and they do that only for a few minutes the month of Ramadan is an opportunity to reconnect with the people especially those of the next of kin those whom we severed our connection with is an opportunity to purify our hearts and to remove our differences it's an opportunity to forgive and pardon and to reconnect with those whom we love and with those whom Allah ordered us to reconnect with Ramadan is an opportunity to repent to humilate yourself for Allah to show Allah true and sincere submissiveness ask Allah to forgive you and Allah knows it is there allah subhanaw taala is there if you call him he will answer you if you seek his forgiveness he will forgive you and if you require or request anything from him he will give you because he is Allah the provider the sustainer the hater the owner of all what you see may allah azza make this Ramadhan a blessed one for you and for me and for the Ummah of Islam was Salam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
