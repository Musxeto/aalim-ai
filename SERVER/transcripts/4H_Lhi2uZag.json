  "title": "Who is the right person to lead the Friday sermon",
  "transcript": "brother tufi's second question and he's from sweden he says that when our hatib our orator is not available for friday and nobody is capable of delivering the khutbah i feel i have to do it myself and my knowledge is very limited should i continue now a lot of the times shaytan the devil puts hurdles and obstacles in our way and the easiest thing to do is that you're not qualified that you shouldn't do this because you're not a pious or righteous person or you have a lot of sins or you have a lot of shortcomings so don't give dawah don't lead prayers don't advise others even if things are crystal clear in front of you why aren't you forbidding this person from drinking alcohol in your presence he says i have a problem i smoke and i don't pray on time and i miss a prayer or two in the masjid so i'm not fit to advise him subhanallah who is fit in this category the only person who is fit is the prophet he is the perfect human being it is wrong for you to look down at yourself and not do what you have to do with this lame excuse that you are not fit or you're not up to it or you don't have knowledge you've said that you're the only one who can speak arabic and can pronounce arabic in a good fashion or a good way so why retreat and allow others who are not capable of doing what you can do you have to deliver the khutba if there's no one else to do this and you don't have to be the most biased person among them all what you have to do is prepare a good ba know what you're talking about and deliver it and this would do insha allah because if we all look at this from this angle none of us would give dawah do you think all the scholars or all the daes or all of us are fit to give dawah or we are so pious and righteous that masha'allah we are the cream of the society no but it is an obligation that if we do not come forward and give it someone else who is probably not as capable of doing it would come and step forward therefore it's an obligation it is not something of choice that we do or think highly of ourselves that we are doing and this is what would please allah and this is what we seek allah's pleasure and reward from"
