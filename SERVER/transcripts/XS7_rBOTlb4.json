  "transcript": "Vanetta bachmann ibraheem and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu wasallam America and Abdi he wore a suit Ameen nabina muhammad in while adding he was a beard Jermaine I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith 125 is still discussing the format of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and how he used to offer night prayer and hadith 125 was narrated by mother aisha may allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet of allah prayed with her in all parts of the night the beginning the middle and the end of the night he continued to pray with her at the end of the night at Sahar time what does this hadith mean alhamdulillah the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not limit the time of night prayer to the last portion of the night he himself prayed in the beginning of the night when is the beginning of the night after isha prayer so when does the night prayer begin after Isha prayer when does it end just as the dawn is breaking and I'll tell you something that you might be a little bit surprised Islam puts rulings and a lot of emphasis on individuals in the sense that if I prayed malory prayer at six o'clock and I'll tell you something that might surprise you a bit if I prayed malory prayer and I was travelling and after that immediately I pray 2 rakaats of ratio prayer can i offer with your or I must wait until the Adhan Oratia I can offer Witter why because I have prayed Asia so night prayer for me begins now you as a residing person as a resident can you pray between Muttalib Anisha night prayer no because you have to pray asha first I'll give you another example as a traveler I prayed before prayer at 12:30 after that immediately I joined other to it and I pray 2 rakaats of a sir now it is quarter to 1 can I offer volunteer prayers I cannot you as a resident can you offer this time voluntary prayers yes because the restriction is that I am NOT allowed to pray after a sir until the Sun sets so for me as a traveler I've prayed ah sir and it's quarter to one that's it I cannot offer any voluntary prayers so the time of whitter begins after I pray raesha not only that some scholars went even a bit further to say any prayer you pray after Isha is considered to be night prayer even the Torah cos of Sunnah because this is the time of night prayer so the Prophet allahumma salli WA Salim Ali used to pray in the beginning in the middle but at the last thing that was finalized for him he continued to pray his whitter at the end of the night at the time of Sahar and the time of Sahar is the time just before the break of dawn and usually of course it is in the last third of the night this is the time where the divine dissension takes place when Alonzo L descends to the lower heaven and Allah says Subhanahu WA Ta'ala is there anyone seeking forgiveness so that I would forgive him is there anyone repenting so that I would repent upon him is there anyone asking me something so that I would give him and all of this is happening every single night and that is why a true believer a true student of knowledge usually devotes the last hours before the break of dawn for his recitation of the Quran for praying night prayer for seeking Allah's forgiveness while everyone is asleep the companion of the Prophet our s-salam Abdullah hip knee Salaam may Allah be pleased with him he was one of the rabbi's of the Jews when the prophets first came to Medina and when he heard that he came he said I wanted to go and listen to him and look at him and I'm the lobster I'm says as a Jew when I went and I looked at his face I knew that his face was not a face of a liar and the first thing I heard from him was all people pray while the people are asleep and feed the food and spread the word of peace that is Salam alaikum you will enter paradise Becerra up Amata Washu Salam was a Lubin naeli when a Sunni emptied hulu Ginetta vision so praying at night is one of the greatest forms of deeds of an individual to the extent that the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that the best prayer after the five mandatory prayers is the night prayer imagine the best prayers after the five Monday the prayers is the night prayers and a proper Muslim never skips a night without offering night prayers and Witcher for Allah the Almighty we move on to the following hadith hadith number 126 I shall allow on her reported The Messenger of Allah used to observe 13 raka of the night prayer 5 out of them can assisted of withering and he did not sit but at the end for salutation reported by Muslim now this hadith clearly states that the Prophet used to pray how many records 13 and it's an authentic hadith so how do we combine between this hadith and also the hadith of aisha herself when she answered that man who asked her about the prayer of the Prophet lslam in Ramadan and she said the Prophet did not pray in Ramadan or elsewhere more than a Americas scholar said that this hadith of 13 meant that she also calculated the Torah has of raesha or that he sometimes did this and sometimes did that and nevertheless this means that the number is not limited it's up to you to do whatever you do in this hadith she told us that the Prophet used to pray five records of whitter sitting only in the fifth and you remember that so many times we said that the whitter has a number of formats either you pray onerecker only and this is the least so if someone says say I don't want to pray a night prayer at all I only want to pray with your one raka is this permissible it's permissible it's like saying share I don't want you to give me ten thousand dollars as a salary give me only one dollar is this permissible thank you yes right that's permissible if you want to work for one dollar it's likewise do you want Jenna you have to work for it you want paradise you've got to strive for it but if you say no no no I just want to give one or two offer one rock out with it it's up to you if you pray three records there are two formats either you pray 2 rakaats and and conclude it to Salaam and then pray a separate unit or pray three rokkes but without sitting in the middle like Maghrib you have to pray one record send up one word huh and send up and the third Rock I use it for tisha hood and conclude that five records Witcher you do not sit in the first for you always sit in the fifth seven records of Witter you do not sit in the first six but you sit on the seventh nine records of Witter you sit on the 8th and also on the ninth this is a sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam moving on to the hadith number 127 and this hadith is regarding the vicar that we say after salat and who will read it for us yes brother Italy Abbas reported raising the voice with dhikr mentioning the name of Allah after obligatory prayers was a common practice during the lifetime of Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam we peace be upon him and when I heard that I knew that they knew that the people had finished the prayer in another narration we didn't know that the prayer of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was over except by takbir al Muslim okay this hadith even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father is describing to us how things were at the time of the Prophet are a solid asana he said that at the time of the Prophet and during his lifetime the people knew that the prayer had concluded by the peoples raising their voices with the vicar and specifically with takbir and this what made the scholars differ they differed not on what to say they differed whether it is permissible to raise our voices in liquor or not into two groups one group for example if you go to Arabia in the message after the conclusion of the prayer you would hear everybody saying - Eric Edelman coilover ham - our evolution ecology and say all the decade that we will get to know some of and in some message it's in different countries you would hear nothing assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah Sarah my Rahula this is all what you hear in the people making dhikr silently so which one is the best those who raise their voices they say we have this authentic hadith that even our best clearly states in it that this is what the Companions used to do after they conclude the prayer with the prophet alayhi salaatu them did the Prophet tell them not to say it did the Prophet tell them not to raise their voices then this is a pseudonym other scholars said no it's not the Sunnah this was done only for a reason this reason is what we will discuss after the break so stay tuned Salam alaikum and welcome back those scholars who said that you are not to raise your voice after the conclusion of the prayer verified and justified actually justified the hadith of women are bars to be a period of teaching the Companions the vicar and that is why they used to raise their voices in the air so that those who did not learn would learn now again this is a probability this is a maybe and whenever we have maybes what do we do with them we take them to the dustbin because you need something that is solid and this is not solid not only that they said that we have another hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam forbade his companions from supplicating in a loud voice and this happened in one of the trips probably and maybe it happened when they were going for Hajj or when they were on an expedition the Muslims used to raise their voices so high that the prophet alayhi salatu salam came up and addressed them by saying o people take it easy on yourselves you are not calling someone who is deaf or far away you are calling someone who is all-hearing and close to you and we'll answer your supplications so this meant that when I supplicate I must not raise my voice if you go to harem you will be shocked by the ignorance of the people who go for Omar on Hajj in the harem in the Tawaf you will find people raising their voices allahumma and everybody behind him Allah and they shake the message hey who are you calling again you're calling someone who is unable to hear you the more you raise your voice the better Allah will hear a star for law of Allah Allah Azza WA JAL here's the footsteps of a black ant over a stone in the middle of the darkest night Allah hears the footsteps of that ant so why are you shouting and therefore these scholars said and that is why it is not recommended to raise your voice with Vika after Salah those scholars reply to them said no no no no this justification of yours is not acceptable because it is also part of the Sunnah to raise your voice Intel BIA when you're travelling to Hajj you see the Baker l'homme Ella Baker Baker la sharika laka labbayk in El Hamdaoui near metallica al-mulk the sharika laka you raise your voice throughout the whole journey and the Prophet encourage the sadist Lal Salaam so there is a difference between making vicar and supplicating when you supplicate you don't say oh Allah forgive my sins when you supply get to Allah you should lower your voice do like Zachariah what did Allah say is nadar Abajo neither and hothea Zachariah called his Lord in a silent manner this is how you supplicate to Allah so there is a difference between supplication dwara and making vicar and that is why the most authentic opinion is that you raise your voice with Vicar however don't shout and don't try to make people hear you you have to be normal that you and the one next to you the two people next you can be able to heal you so you say la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lahu lahul mulku alhamdulillah kulla shay'in qadir la hawla wala quwata illa billah la ilaha illallah wahdahu la mala sinha houdina local kathryn aluminum an animal a well immortal even not what I am for adelgid even cultured this is what the Prophet used to say Allison after the prayer in a normal voice not shouting it out or holding a microphone and talking into it and by this we would join all the evidences together insha Allah do we have any questions yes getting we learned that there are two methods of praying three raka with either we say the Salah on the second raka or we sit only in the last eschew hood but especially here in the Indian subcontinent we see that the people who follow Hanasi motherhood they say no that's not the way and we were not making it as the marry Priya what we do in the third raka - we do the recitation aloud and that is how it differs with the mother so how do you advise these brothers what they're doing is wrong because the Prophet Allah saw Salam was never reported to us that he recited the third raka allowed he only recited - requires allowed and always the third and the fourth we're silent so by sitting in the second raka and standing up for the third you are definitely making it as mother it and we tell them that this is wrong it's against the Sunnah but if they insist on following this methodology this is that right Allah will hold them questionable do I pray behind them answer is yes so if there is an hanafi imam who's praying taraweeh when it comes to it there should I leave him know I have to pray with her with him as he was praying it yes brother Salam aleikum my question is that as there are two types of whittler three regards and one regards so we had learned that there are different times of performing three and one Ricard so it's just correct no you can pray them all in the beginning of the night you can pray them in the middle of the night you can pray them at the end of the night she should be prayed it is morsel to pray three after Isha and if you are delaying so it is more of them to pray one before dawn no no no no it's the same the Prophet said that is awesome if you feel the break of dawn offer one raka as with you this is not necessarily for someone who usually offers free records with it because some of us and the majority of us pray three records with it they pray 2 rakaats Schaffer maybe they pray 4 sets of 2 meaning aides that like the profit distribution do and conclude that with 3 records Witter some pray for records and conclude that with 3 records which is some pray only 3 records so there is no preference whether you pray 3 records in the beginning of the night or before you go to bed or one raka at the end of the night no they're all the same either you pray wonder car before you go to bed or 3 records before you go to bed or postponed all of this which is better and best to pray 1 raka before the break of dawn or 3 records before the break of dawn person sure what do you have to say about duality Emma like the Imam supplicating after Salah and the moon they are seeing God I mean and like before breaking the fast we're in this is called congregational door which a lot of the country's Muslim countries do and that is after they conclude the fog salah the Imam mixed wha and they all say I mean this is an innovation it was never done by the Prophet as Salam it was never done by his companions and whoever claims that this is permissible we asked him to provide us that evidence it is exactly like and those people who make this always give them this scenario they say no no is something good it's something recommended we're making duaa tell them okay was it done by the Prophet should know it wasn't done but it's good in this case tell them okay we just Freddy sure you made congregational Dora which is an innovation and you say it's good how about if we call the people to stand up and offer soon at Elisha in congregation as well no this is why what's wrong it's good is good but no no this is better so it's like a locket this is what I wanted to hit whatever is innovated it's very clear the Prophet didn't do it he didn't recommend us to do it he didn't instruct us to do it the Companions did not do it their Tiberian did not do it so you definitely know better than them and that is why we very easily disregard their bid us when we asked them to do few things similar to that yes brother Charlie coupe shifts around flaw question is if I am offering voluntary or so nine months it especially a fudged any comma is called what is the ruling and how to do it the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said whenever the Obama is given for a prayer there is no prayer except that which the hama has been given for clear cut hadith meaning that if I am praying voluntary prayer and the comma has been given the scholars say I have to evaluate how they say if I'm in the first rocker and the Akama is given I have to cut my prayer enjoy the Gemara because I will never be able to attain the first stack Birla and I will lose preference and the rose but if I am in the second record and I know that if I hastily if I make some heart about him once semi-long hundred ham so horribly other ones a bit fairly once I quickly finish the prayer I can be in time in the row and pray with the congregation before the mm says Allahu Akbar they say you have to do this so the question is answered you have to evaluate if you're in the first raka cut it if you're in the second rocker and you know that you can hasten it then this is what you should do yes sure what happens when supposing I do to rocket Sunnah at home for Pfizer and I come to the Masjid and there is still 10 minutes left for father for Salah and I have reached the Masjid should I offer 2 rakaats nephal the hama was done the camera's not done yes you cannot sit before offering two rakahs but I already did my son yes yes I know if you if you done your Sunnah in your house and you come to the Masjid and they did not pray it is mandatory for you to pray 2 rakats before you sit down but if you did not pray your Sunnah in your home and you came to the Masjid you pray only to records of the Sunnah and not pray 2 rakaats more for sitting and this is all the time we have until we meet next time for Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
