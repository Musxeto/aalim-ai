  "title": "Where does the beard start & what parts can I remove? Can I Shave my Moustache? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "jos√® nein says a new show at the man or demonstrate where the male beard starts from near the ear which part of the cheekbones is in includes etc how far in the neck it goes also can we shave the mustache into a straight line I've read a bit online but physical demonstration would be perfect I'm sure it will not only help me but others too so the director will keep the short camera on my face inshallah and not take a long shot first of all the beard in Arabic is called aleashia and linguistically alia is the jaw bone so this lower jaw bone the one that moves because the upper jaw does not move this one the lower jaw is the one that moves is called leha so the scholars say the hair that grows on this lower jaw is called lahia and the most authentic and accepted opinion is that your jaw begins from the ear so even the sideburns are part of your jaw and if you open your mouth you will find that this area with this area here the lower and the upper these are called your beard so anything that grows on your jaw this area and on your cheek is called the beard what grows on your cheek bones below your eyes this is not so you can remove this one but from here this is your beard now what's underneath which is in my neck so my face is like this this is my beard but what grows on my neck is not considered to be part of my beard so this area on my neck on my Adam's apple above that just below the chin this is not my beard I can shave it it looks awful weird if you do this because you will have like a curtain here but in underneath you will not find anything it looks awkward but c'est la vie if you want to shave it or shorten it on the neck no problem here this is your bead you cannot line it as some people do this is the line what's underneath your eyes is not part of your beard and you can remove that what about shaving the mustache totally prohibited this is not from the sooner the sooner is to trim it so that there is no surplus no extra on your lip but you do not shave it you just trim it with the machine or whatever and Allah knows best"
