  "transcript": "question is from brother osama is it allowed to meditate using apps such as and he gives an example head space i've never been to space so i cannot answer your question osama but most likely you're talking about listening to uh ocean waves or birds chirping or the wind etc and this is not meditation this is just listening to natural sounds and i think there's nothing wrong in that meditation which is prohibited is the same as that what the hindus do or what the people practicing yoga do these are related to other customs and religions that muslims should not do our meditation is to look at allah's beautiful creations and wonderful miracles in the universe and praise him as the wajal not to just sit there and say um what are you doing i'm meditating what kind of meditation is this no this is something for the buddhists the hindus the whatever and this is not permissible and allah's best"
