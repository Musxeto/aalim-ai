  "transcript": "with Manila - hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen son lagos alderman Baba Khalid Mohammed al-ameen nabina muhammad in water our hero sabi Romani be happy he was an efficient Amandine amato assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this fortieth episode of the islamic shock I hope by now you have registered in the Islamic the Islamic dot net web site and that you are interacting with them and in their quizzes and whatever they are doing hamdulillah today we are going to talk about a new chapter that deals with transactions now if you notice and remember that we started with the forms of worship such as salat is a cat fasting hatch and concluded that with jihad and jihad to some scholars is considered a form of ibadah worship this is why they included it after hatch and not out of transactions because it's based on worshipping Allah and fighting for the cause of Allah the Almighty Azza WA JAL now after that most scholars begin with the book of transactions and why do they begin with transactions rather than with marriage they say because before you get married you need to eat and drink which means that you have to sell and buy and that is why afterwards you tend to talk about marriage divorce custody suckling the maintenance all of these things related after the transactions and after that you come to the chapters that deal with judging between the two conflicted people you prescribe punishments for murders adultery intoxicant consumption etc because usually when people eat and drink and they get married they tend to feel relaxed and look for other venues that might be Haram which means that there would be a need to solve conflicts arising between them so now we begin with the commercial transactions the book says in Islamic context or contexts a sale means the permanent exchange of one property or legitimate benefit for another even for the deferred handing over provided that it is neither usually or long what is the meaning of the year in Arabic buyer can be both selling and buying and it is a transaction where two things are exchanged a product and the price and the price can be monetary and can be another product so if I give you my mobile in exchange for your pan this is selling because there is the exchange process even take and some scholars even consider leasing or renting a form of selling because I'm selling you the legitimate benefits of my home so that you can live in it you can utilize it your interest for a period of time in exchange for an amount of money so it is selling you not the property but rather the benefits you can obtain from that property all of this is considered to be what selling and this is mentioned in the Quran so no one can say okay what is evidence to prove that selling and buying is Helen first of all we have the default so everything by default is halal until proven otherwise so no one would come and say share tell me the evidence of being allowed to sit on a chair this is Panola this is the default if you say or claim that it is haram you have to bring me the evidence not the other way around allah says in the quran allah llahu the air well not river but Allah has permitted trade and has forbidden RIBA usually or interest so this is a crystal clear evidence that selling and buying is permitted and the Prophet said allah√≠s alato Salam when two persons make a sale each of them continues to have a choice as long as they are together and have not parted this is known as trading by choice or condition so if we are in the same room and I tell you I sell you my mobile phone for $100 and you say I accept and you take the phone and I take the dollars and we're still in the same room chit chatting talking doing something anything and after half an hour I said listen I changed my mind give me my mobile phone and here's your hundred dollars you don't have the right to say no it was a done deal it's over because we did not depart had I left the room or you have left the room that case yes it's a done deal we cannot retract it and go back but because we're still in the same location this is known as trading by choice or by a condition which is the condition of not departing physically and in order to have a sale conducted you have to have three things you have to have those selling and buying so you have to have a buyer and you have to have a seller the parties involved then you have to have a product something to sell and of course something to buy it with so the things to be exchanged and thirdly there has to be a formula so how is this exchange going to be because it can be verbal and it can be buy action the verbal type is to say I sell you my mobile for $100 and you say I accept this formula is known as an EJ board Kabul proposal and acceptance and this is done in all types of transactions on top of the list is marriage marriage is a transaction so the father has to say to the groom I give you my daughter Fatima in marriage he says I accept Palace incident deal if there are two male Muslim witnesses around so this is the formula do we require witnesses as in the case of marriage the answer is no it's not required but it wouldn't hurt to have one or two actually it would add value to authenticate the sale but alhamdulillah selling and buying has been done for centuries and no one had ever requested or demanded witnesses unless there is a dispute because we need to conduct trading all the time and it can be quite hard if not impossible to find two witnesses who are willing to testify and remember and what will they remember during the day they might witness like 50 or 100 transactions they won't be able to remember that and it's not convenient to always bring you with you to testify so in Islam trading is done in a very easygoing way I give you my product for this price I accept buying it it's done allah azza wajal says as a recommendation have witnesses when you make business deals so this in the Quran in the longest ayah in the Quran ayah number 282 sounds like it's an obligation but when you go to the Sunnah to get an explanation you will find that the Sunnah explains it to be recommendation not an obligation the Prophet himself al-asad son in a famous incident bought a horse from a nomad and there were no witnesses so the Prophet bought the horse and told him to catch up with him back to his home so that he can pay him the money on the way the Bedouin the nomad met people who gave him a higher price so he accepted that and when he went to Medina the Prophet a son gave him the money and the nomad said I didn't sell you so the prophecy yes you did so the nomad said no you didn't sell I didn't sell you anything we didn't agree on anything this is because of greed he wants to sell it to the highest bidders so the nomads with such horrible audacity said do you have any witnesses so one of the companions is name is Jose MA stood up and said yes or breath prophet of Allah I testify that you bought the horse from him the Prophet smiled and said subhanAllah how do you justify to something you'd not see is it Oh prophet of Allah I believe you when you say that Allah revealed to you such-and-such from the seventh heaven from above seven seven heavens you don't want me to believe you when you say that you bought a horse from a no man so the Prophet al-assad salam congratulated him praised him for that and made his testimony equivalent to men and this was used later on years later when abu bakr started to gather the quran to compile it in one book and most of the Sahaba knew it by heart but they would not accept any written form of it unless one brings two witnesses so they accepted an ayah which was found with Hosea and he had no other witness but himself they did a favorite may Allah be pleased with her with him accepted it because the Prophet made his testimony on behalf of two men now there are conditions for a trade to be valid without them you're selling and buying is invalid one would argue say ok where did you get these conditions from are the end or an are they in the signal and the answer would be no conditions that are backed up by the Quran and the Sunnah are legitimate those who do not have any evidence to back them up are illegitimate and this is something that is needed to protect Islam so to have classifications such as the the legislative rulings mandatory recommended permissible not recommended Harlem where did you get these classifications from where did you get the other terminologies such as valid invalid condition restriction cause all of these are terminal terminologies found in Fela where did you get this isn't this an innovation that's additional this is not something that we worship in Allah PI this is something that was put by scholars in order to limit and protect and fix the Sharia so that it would not have any loopholes for those who study it so in order to make it easier to understand and comprehend you need to know that there are things that are mandatory and there are things that are recommended so what's the difference growing a beard is mandatory entering the message with your right foot is recommended don't mix apples with oranges you have to know through the evidences from the Quran and the Sunnah that we stem these rulings from and likewise conditions so if someone says what is the evidence backing that Woodill is a condition well we go to chapter 5 sorted merida where oh you who believe whenever you want to pray then wash your faces etc to the rest of the ayah this is an instruction so this is classified by the scholars as a condition meaning if you do it then you pray or once you pray is valid if you don't do it then if you pray your prayer is invalid however once you do it that is the would look you're not obliged to pray you can pray and you may not pray so this is the definition of conditions etc so now we have similar conditions when it comes to trading that requires us fulfilling the conditions in order for the transaction to be valid and these are generally speaking seven conditions are they limited dancers no these these are the most closest to our understanding there can be more conditions that we don't know of but once we meet them we will find them and it's like the Prophet saying is awesome each attorney mu a several mu B hot avoid the seven things the seven sins that lead to destruction scholars say that major sins are not limited only to b7 they're closer to 70 but the Prophet is sallallahu alehiwassallaam highlighting the most horrible of them not specifying that there is nothing more than D 7 and Allah knows best so what are these seven what are these seven conditions number one there must be an agreement between the seller and the buyer in Arabic this is known as a pur all the I agreed to sell you there's no compulsion there's no forcing I'm doing it willingly because if it's done without me agreeing to it or against my will then the transaction is not legitimate Allah says in the Quran believers do not devour each other's wealth illegally unless it be through lawful trade which you conduct by mutual consent so it has to be through mutual consent so if someone forces me to sell my property the sale even if conducted is invalid I have all the right to get my money back once I go to the court if someone embarrasses me so I am selling under being ashamed shy embarrassed because of his pressure again this is invalid transaction it has to be totally consensual you agree and I agree were both happy now there's no force if I buy something from you after bargaining so how much is the mobile it's 100 dollars no I it's too expensive I'll give you 90 should no light is too little this is all what I can afford so okay I'll sell it for 90 so am i forcing him No he could have said no and there are so many other people that I can buy from why would I buy from him so when we talk about agreement it's not under gunpoint it's not being pressured but even though there are some times that the consent is not required and these are rare cases for example someone is under debt he is unable to pay his debtors so the Muslim ruler rules that we confiscate his house sell it and pay for the debtors he is not happy he does not give his consent but this is something done by the authority of law because he has to pay the people so when we pay the people we are actually buying his property without or against his will there is nothing wrong in that because this transaction is a legitimate transaction for the better or for the the goodness of the public the Prophet says Isis on a sale can only be through mutual agreement the second condition each of the two parties should be a person of age sanity and rationale the scholars give four descriptions one he has to be an adult - he has to be seen three he has to be rational for he has to be free so let's go and study these conditions again why must he be an adult because Allah mentioned in Surat Annisa that we have to test the orphans once they reach the age of puberty and if we sense that they are rational we should give them their inheritance so two conditions mentioned in the ayah reaching the age of puberty which we have mentioned now being an adult and being rational so if a rational child comes a 13 year old boy and goes to the soup to the market to buy something the most authentic opinion is that his transaction is invalid he might be rich his father might have given him money or he had me he's a blogger or a youtuber and he has lots of money because of his games and the videos he makes so he comes to the shop with a bagful of money and wanting to buy computers wanting to buy this and that and he knows what he's doing the transaction is not legit because he is not an adult so we cannot give him authority to deal with his money so he has to be an adult he has to be rational he has to be sane so someone who has Alzheimer and he doesn't know what to buy and what not to buy he may buy something that is worth a hundred with a thousand and he may sell something that is worth a thousand for ten so such a person's transaction is invalid and fourthly and finally he has to be free because a slave does not have his own wealth the money that a slave possesses including his clothes belonged to his master and this is why the Prophet said are a sort of Salaam when one of you sells a slave then the money of the slave belongs to the seller unless before the transaction was made the buyer makes it a condition and this is understood at times when I have a slave and I trust my slave so I give him a fancy car a fancy watch nice suits and few credit cards and I authorize him to sell and buy and my behalf things so another guy sees them and says wow man this slave is high quality is sophisticated he's cold I want to buy him I like his car I like his watch so I offered to sell him for an X amount of money the buyer pays the money willingly so before sending the slave to him I tell my slave give me my car keys give me my watch give me my suit give me my credit cards now take this t-shirt and jeans and go to your new master the new master comes just as whoa where is everything that I saw on you yesterday and the slave says that my master took it so he complains the Prophet as Salam made the ruling for his complaint you can't say anything can't do anything and because you did not make that as a condition from the beginning the default is everything that the slave owns is his masters before selling so these are the four characteristics in order for the seller or the buyer to have their transaction valid the third condition is that the seller must be the owner of what is being sold so this is understood when we learn the hadith of Hakim of Nizam may Allah be pleased with him where he said do not sell anything that is not yours so you have to possess a merchandise before selling it and this is why in so many cases generally speaking without going into details drop shipping is haram when you come to me and say I'd like to buy a mobile that I don't have and I'll tell you that it costs you XYZ and you say ok I'll buy it and I say ok I sold it to you I don't possess it for me to go to a third party and make an order and ask them to ship it to you and then receive the money or partially what stressed what the remaining of it this is Haram and not permissible there are other ways of making it permissible such as a Salem transaction but this might come later on in sha allah so a person cannot sell what is not his there is an exception for what is known as baleful Dooley a person who's a Snoopy so I have a brother and while my brother was using my phone someone approached him and said to him nice phone would you sell it to me for $100 my brother knows the market and he says ok a done deal now he doesn't own the phone so this transaction is dependent on my approval so if he comes to me and says listen I sold the phone for $100 and I said him no way I'm not selling it even for a thousand I don't want to sell it then the transaction is void and canceled but if I said to him what one hundred thousand so good price done deal then it is a valid transaction but this is not the norm number four what is being sold should be something that is permissible to use in the normal way not in case of necessity now this needs to be explained there are things that we sell that are permissible without the necessity and there is benefit in it so if it is beneficial permissible in a normal way then this is Helen the condition is fulfilled so for example things that are not permissible selling them is prohibited whether beneficial are not beneficial give an example share something that is beneficial but it is Haram and no way it can be halal even if there is a necessity for it example musical instruments what benefit do we get from it we can play music can it ever be halal due to necessity Lancers no in this case selling or buying it would be prohibited it would be cancelled and void also included is selling intoxicants selling cigarettes tobacco there might be some benefits in it but it is Haram and hence such a transaction is void and unacceptable there are things that have no benefit in them though it might not be Haram but buying and selling them because of the lack of benefit makes the transaction void such as selling cockroaches or insects in general there's no use in that so such a transaction is void and not permissible there are things that are beneficial and might be permissible at times of necessity because they are permissible at times of necessity selling and buying them is Haram such as dogs used for hunting hunting is halal but it's the exception of the rule so selling and buying is prohibited though there is times that it is permissible for necessity to use what selling and buying them is still void and prohibited likewise fertilizers well fertilizers are used of animal dung or maybe human dung as well so this is an impurity and it can be benefited from but buying it due to the condition that only when there is a need for it some scholars say that this makes it void so we cannot buy and sell such an impurity and it's an issue of this dispute number five I think we are almost exceeding the time allocated so maybe we will stop here in sha Allah at number five and we will continue later on on Thursday in sha Allah if Allah willing we go to your questions Fatima says what's the prayer mentioned here 200 or taraweeh abu huraira said may allah be pleased with him i heard the prophet sallallaahu salam saying regarding ramadan who ever prayed at night in it out of sincere faith and hoping for the reward from allah the all his previous sins will be forgiven so far team is asking is this the hatchet or taraweeh it's both we've stated this so many times before Tala we is the prayer prayed and offered in congregation the mess anything else that is sprayed home this is called night prayer so if you proceed that with sleep this is called hatred and if you pray it at the beginning of the night this is night prayer so whatever you pray of them that would be a reason to forgive all your previous sins providing that you pray the whole night or most of it or to the best of your ability let Excel for those who have legitimate reason to not fast can they give food at the end of the month for example in one family for members then in other family five members till they reach 60 or should one give for each different person a single food till reach 60 this is his first question and my question to you lyric is why would you feed 60 people if you have a legitimate reason not to fast then you are obliged to feed one person for every day you miss which means either 29 or 30 days you are my friend mixing apples with oranges feeding 60 people is for a person who breaks his fast through intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan he is obliged to free a slave and if not possible he is obliged to cast two consecutive months and if this is not possible he is obliged to feed 60 poor people so you see you have got things mixed up going back to your question if a person is unable to fast due to legitimate reasons and this or these reasons are forever with him meaning that he's got a chronic illness that not to say you will never be able to fast again or he is too old and fragile though not sick but doctors say that he cannot fast more than five or six hours without fainting or falling down these people are permitted to feed one poor person for every day they miss from Ramadan now it is not important or essential to feed 30 different people if you give the food of 30 days of Ramadan to one poor person at the end of Ramadan this does the job unlike feeding 10 poor people to expiate a broken oath Allah stated clearly in the Quran that the expiation is to feed 10 poor people from the middle of what you eat or clothe them or Frias later so by indicating 10 this means that they have to be 10 different people if you fed one poor person 10 times or 10 meals this only counts as one and you still have nine to go Arina says in the quran there's a verse in surat al-ahzab where allah says indeed mankind is in loss why Allah said that and what should I do to not fall into this category why did Allah say that no one has the authority to question a large devotion if one is asking to inquire and to learn then the answer would be because Allah created mankind in loss except as Allah mentioned afterwards those who fulfill the four categories the belief in Allah doing righteous deeds they advise and remind one another to be patient and they advised one another about truth and this is what if mankind follow they would prosperous and be among the winners mmm chattering Alma have mercy on his soul said had Allah only revealed to mankind this surah and nothing else that would have sufficed them one of the shortest sewers of the Quran yet it has a profound meaning behind it that summarizes our life on earth in this hiya to dunya you want salvation you want to win you have to implement the conditions mentioned in this great yet small surah Hassli says there is a hadith that whoever prays Risha in congregation tool Imam concludes his prayer will have the reward of praying the whole night the hadith applies only in Ramadan because the taraweeh or is it for the whole year the hadith is clearly about trauma bond and it's not about Asia it's about night prayer which is taraweeh or tahajud in human calm an imam a hot iron solid Kotov at Liguria melilla he who he whoever prays between brackets voluntary prayer of night prayer until the imam finishes his prayer then he would be acquitted in andrew as if he prayed the whole night so this is only for Ramadan because we do not pray night prayer in congregation other than Ramadan Frieda says did mother Aisha exit her haram when she got her menses at sir how did she exit home can you explain her Hajj as it was out of the norm there is nothing that stated that she exited the ham on the contrary when the Prophet entered on his salat WA Salam her tent and found her crying and he said to her this is something normal that Allah prescribed upon all daughters of how well daughters of Adam meaning females so do all what a pilgrim does but do not perform power round the Kaabah that's it so she stayed in the state of a harm and she performed all the rituals other than praying of course another than offering the Tawaf in the beginning like the Prophet al estado Salam but we know that she offered it after she got pure from her menses o mania or my says when Islamic Day starts the Islamic day starts by the sunset so today's Monday and we have about an hour and a half for sunset in Saudi in Jeddah once the Sun sets this night is known as Tuesday night so the night precedes the day and this is why when the Sun sets at the last day of Ramadan this is eight so this is the night of the eight we don't do taraweeh anymore then it's time for us to give saw the cattle country so the day in the islamic calendar starts by the previous day's sunset so when the night starts of the previous night this is the night of today's day abdul rahman says if the adven the one who calls the van to inaugurate the beginning of the time of the prayer if the mohel then gives the Adhan two or three minutes after sunset will it depend on it or as soon as the Sun Goes Down I should break my fast no you should depend on sunset so if you're certain through visually looking and you see the Sun had disappeared then you break your fast even if there that is not cold and you can pray even if the event was not cold the problem is when people depend on Google timings or an app timing showing sunset and they have a message next door and they can't see the Sun should we trust the apps or should we trust the van I would definitely go with the event because on the day of judgment if he calls early or he calls late he's the one who's entrusted in Sharia the Prophet said Allah has Auto Salam el vin mortarman he is interested well Imam Baumann and the Imam is a guarantor what does that if I make a mistake while praying behind the Imam for example they're all sitting for the second for the first shot after the second record and I unconsciously stood up for the third started reciting the fact have open minds that everybody sitting what the heck and I immediately said do I prostrate for Sahu no the Imam guarantees that from he carries out such a mistake likewise a live a mortarman he's entrusted he says Allah walk what I eat my dates someone says okay it's still early the one thing gave there that I eat I don't know if it's early or late I can't see the Sun to verify so he's the one who's in charge Bansi says in the two event of Roger when is Isola to high room in an on-set is it in the first or the last event as a philosopher in the second event the first event is just a reminder so those who are praying to hedge it would be reminded by that than that whoa watch out the real event is coming soon within few minutes so if you want to conclude your whitter or you want to go and have a bite so that you can fast then you should do that now so just a reminder we don't say oscillatory Domino in it swing man earth man says is this present social distancing acceptable according to the teaching of Islam so a man this is an issue of dispute among scholars some of them said that as it is permissible to abandon praying standing up due to a necessity or to pray without Waddell due to a necessity it can be also measured upon it to say that social death singing prayer can be acceptable for necessity however till date I don't know of a trusted major scholar who approved of it so until we are not scholars we are followers of scholars we're students of knowledge so we don't shoot from the hip we have to go and consult and follow so until the scholars come up with a fat one stating that this is OK I remain saying that this is an innovation and it is prohibited it is best for you to pray home rather than to engage in such an innovation and I'll tell you why in normal days the harem is fully packed let alone seasons such as Ramadan and Hajj I'm talking in normal days it is fully packed now if you introduce to them social distancing do you think that the harem would suffice them or the whole of Mecca do you think that anyone in the harem area would honor it can it be forced definitely not everybody's gonna pray on top of each other they want a piece of the cake in hatch when it's really crowded sometimes you get men praying shoulder-to-shoulder but with women usually it's the woman's mistake they come they don't find a place at the women's place so they infiltrate men's drawers and pray in front of them or beside them and this is not permissible who's to control it so if you go to somewhere where usually the messages are full and Ramadan and people are packed in the message how are you going to tell them to keep a distance of 1 meter between one of you if each one of you is not logical not only that if you look at the heart of itself where people are watching this social distancing being performed by the security by the workers by the janitors there look at those standing behind the imam they are shoulder to shoulder foot to foot there's no social distancing behind them one of the brothers said yeah because these are sure their sheiks did not get infected subhanAllah so in my own humble opinion what's happening there in regards of the social distancing is just a public relations stunt so that people say oh they're doing this in Harlem but come on be fair this is not practical so this is my own personal opinion until we get something that is solid and concrete from the major scholars we yeah I think that this is still valid that it is not permissible and the yen I'm sorry says watching from Nepal mashallah after this part I cannot stand I'm not able to stand so is it permissible to pray mother it's a lot by sitting this is between you and Allah Ariana if you are unable to stand Allah doesn't burden so beyond what it can bear so pray sitting sitting down in the hadith of remember mother Jose may Allah be pleased with them the Prophet said that Islam to him pray standing up if you are unable pray sitting down if you're unable pray lying on your side so to you if you are unable to stand no problem is adult in sitting Jimin says is solitude is rocks supposed to be prayed at home or at the Masjid it can be prayed at home but the reward of a full perfect umbrella and hatch would not be awarded this award is only given to those who prey fetcher in the Masjid in congregation wait until the Sun rises and then pray 2 rakaats but those who pray home can do the same will be highly rewarded but not in the same fashion and Allah knows best Rafi shall he says do you or can you pray Salah to jealousy twice can you perform salat and janessa the funeral prayer twice Lancers yes you can even create more than that so if a relative was washed and shrouded and prepared in his home and we're about to take him to the Masjid there is no problem if I pray funeral prayer on him then we take him to the Masjid and there is no problem I joined the congregation and praying funeral prayer again then we take him to the graveyard and there are people who were late did not offer salat so I joined them and we offer salat for the third time this is totally legit and permissible Karima says is the verbal contract between the two parties to the trade marriage or any of this will or will of the deceased between brackets word of honor it would this be considered as strong as a written contract is there a punishment or penalty for breaking it as for the marriage whether written or not there has to be two male Muslim witnesses for it to be valid so whether written or not it's the same thing it's a marriage and no one can break it without divorce if it is trade then you don't need witnesses it's sufficient for me to say I sell you my mobile for a hundred you say I accept done deal finished if we separate physically I cannot retract that or pull out out out of it you can't do that neither it's a fixed done deal as for the will of a deceased it's not sufficient for me to come and say so and so on his dying bed gave third of his money to the Machine there has to be two male witnesses testifying or one male and two females other than that is not valid and Allah knows best the final question of the Abdul Rahman says can I pray fed you as soon as my phone a van comes in Nasser's no you can pray fetcher once you are certain that the break of dawn the break of dawn has been established either by visually seeing it or by confirming that your app is accurate so that you would not proceed that by a minute or so and if you give like three four minutes or five minutes just to be safe rather than sorry that would be much better and easier in sha Allah and with this we come to the end of our session for today until we meet next Thursday I leave you fear Manila wa salaamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
