  "title": "Does evil eye occur from looking directly or even without the person / thing present assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you okay I'm saying there's a particular on evil eye where one looked at another and he fell to the ground so my question now is for evil eye does the person have to look at another person or can it transcend through time and space okay the most authentic opinion is that it has to be direct so the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him when he got the evil eyee it was from the companion looking at him directly which means that if a person looks at a photograph on your Instagram would that have an impact the most authentic opinion that it would not because it's not direct but you never know what can happen however if you see something whether it's direct or indirect you sayik but to be haunted by the idea that whoops somebody's going to look at me and give me evil eye and this if you're observing your car in the morning in the evening after Salat before you go to bed before you leave the house inshallah you are protected"
