  "title": "Did the Sahaba like Ali have a big belly? Were some Companions fat? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is we can see many narrations about the description of the such as having a big belly Etc are they authentic some of them yes and what's the problem my grandfather had a big belly so that is not something to be uh um looked down upon and if you look at the strongest man on Earth as they say in these Scandinavians or these polish or these people who carry like tons and tons they have big bellies it does not mean anything being a bodybuilder has nothing to do with doing weights or your tolerance and ability to uh bear uh uh pain and and and be a good fighter or a warrior we know without doubt that some of the companions were totally bold does that mean anything is it a must that we have this idea of all the companions being 6'4 uh muscular and with nice bodies with six-pack and um blue eyes maybe I don't know this is not a well-known fact some of the companions were short some of them were tall some of them were fat some of them were thin some of them were handsome some of them were ugly and people knew them for their ugliness that does not discredit them the least or make us think of them less than anyone else this is how Allah created them and Allah's creation is beautiful what counts is your Iman what counts are your actions so yes we know that some companions were white some of them were dark some of them were black some of them had soft hair some they're like humans they come from all over the place and they have all different uh uh features of their own and there's no problem in that inshallah"
