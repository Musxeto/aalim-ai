  "title": "An Imam who makes ruqya & reads the palm of a person's hand - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he was talking about an imam who does rookia and he looks at the palm of the hand and it seems that he's reading the palm of the hand i cannot elaborate because i don't know the case if the imam and this is a big i f if this person is reading the palm of the hand he's a soothe sayer he's an imposter he's not an imam he is involved in shirk and you must not believe him or go to him but if he's reciting the rookie and he's looking for physical signs such as shivering or increase of temperature etc something that is physical and he's holding the hand of a another man he's not permitted to hold the hand of a woman for example maybe this can be justifiable but i cannot comment on something that i don't have enough information about"
