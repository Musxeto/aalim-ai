  "title": "What does being cursed by Allah & Prophet mean, Is there hope for him to be forgiven Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says what does being cursed by allah and the prophet isalam mean does this mean there is no hope for that person first of all the scholars defined allah's curse or in arabic is known as alan to be expelling someone from allah's mercy and this is only given to major sins so when the prophet saws for example curses women who pluck their eyebrows or can attach attachments and extensions to their hair or those who do tattoos etc this is from the prophet allah asking allah azzawajal to expel them from his mercy which means that this is a major sin or these are major sins so this is when the curse of allah azzawajal takes place and this only takes place over major sense and this is why when scholars defined major sense they said that it is any sin that allah azzawajal has cursed the one who does it among other uh conditions so one of the first conditions is to gain allah's curse for doing such a sin now having said that humans may curse so i may curse someone and this would not be as when allah curses someone or when the prophet haslam curses someone but when individuals curse others this is swearing and cursing not actual um getting them or expelling them out of allah's mercy because this uh type of curse is from a human to human it's like dua it may happen it may not happen but this is also something that is sinful in islam for a muslim to curse another muslim so the question of saleem if someone was cursed by allah so for example when allah curses those who deal in riba or those who pay and receive bribes does this mean that they are doomed and there's no hope for that person the answer is no all sins committed on earth if a person repents before he dies and fulfills the conditions of repentance allah the most forgiving the most merciful the one who repents will repent upon him and will accept his repentance so all what you have to do is ask allah for forgiveness quit whatever you you have been doing feel remorseful return whatever is for the people to the people that you have taken unlawfully and intend firmly within your heart not to do that sin again and insha allah you will be saved"
