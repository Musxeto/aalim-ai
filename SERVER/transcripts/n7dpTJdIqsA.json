  "transcript": "so in the uk we have this carpet that is um all over the house except the kitchen and the toilet and some small area in front of the house so can i pray on this carpet because when you stand on it you can feel the ground but when i frustrate i'm afraid my forehead doesn't have much pressure as my legs so maybe it doesn't reach the ground or not no the vast majority of carpets in houses and in places are permissible for you to pray and you don't have to listen to the whispers of shaytan is my forehead touching the ground or not no when we say that you cannot pray on a carpet that you would not feel the ground is when you pray on a foam carpet which actually when you put your forehead on it it goes a little bit down and if you push a little bit it goes a little bit down and if you push it harder it goes a little bit down so it's like floating when you prostrate as if you're floating in such carpet if you walk on it you won't be stable because of the foam and the sponginess like uh nature but the normal carpets and houses and hotels and and the likes they are okay for you to pray on without any problem insha allah"
