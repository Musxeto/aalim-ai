  "title": "Ruling on plucking the eyebrows - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sister ashma asked a number of questions and in a previous program we spoke about the ruling on dying the hair and on plucking the eyebrows and to elaborate the hair on the human body is one of three either it is mandatory to remove or it is forbidden to remove or it is permiss ible to remove so the hair that is forbidden for a person to remove for men and women is the eyebrows the most authentic opinion is that you cannot pluck the eyebrows you cannot cut the eyebrows and you cannot shave the eyebrows as well for both men and women and for men it is forbidden for them to shave their beard s this is completely unacceptable in Islam the prophet forbade this and he instructed us to grow the beards for the men and the consensus of the four schools of thought in Islam states that it is forbidden to shave the beard the hair that is mandatory for both men and women to remove is the pubic hair the hair that grows over the private parts and the armpit hair and the Sunnah is to pluck the armpit hair and to shave the pubic hair the third type of hair is the hair in the rest of your body which the Quran nor the sunah told us what to do with it so it is permissible for you to keep or to remove this is up to you like the hair that grows on the arms or on the legs but the custom is that only women remove the hair on their arms and legs and the men would keep this and it depends from one uh uh uh country to the other from one uh people to the other"
