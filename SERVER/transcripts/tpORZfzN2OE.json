  "transcript": "and if from Germany he says and this is a big problem Ali a lot of the immigrants who go to Germany to UK to Finland and I don't need to mention which continent but they are well known the moment they go in they do not work some of them even tear their passports and apply for asylum and they sit there they take benefits for unemployment from the government and unfortunately cheat and lie and deceit the government that's paying them because it's a Kaffir government and they work without declaring that they have a job they take their wages in cash so they don't have to register that and be deprived of unemployment and they're married and they register themselves as single or even single parent a Muslim does not do this and such people are the worst representation of Islam such people tarnish the reputation of Islam and the Muslims in a sense they are professional beggars they extend their lower hand and Allah tells us that the upper hand is better than the lower hand they have the audacity to go and say yes give us money this is our right it's not your right you are just a liar and a cheater yes if you're looking for a suitable job and you do your best to work in a halal job and you're unable to find one meanwhile the government is giving you money there's no problem but if the government says this is a job for you and you'd go and you flunk it deliberately and then they give you another job and you decline because physically you're not fit so you claim and you go for a third and a fourth and you continue to live in their houses too their benefits while doing nothing this is definitely Haram and you are sinful"
