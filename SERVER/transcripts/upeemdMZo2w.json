  "title": "Should a woman pray taraweeh behind son who recites short surahs or pray longer surahs alone Assimal",
  "transcript": "Sadia says is it better for a woman to pray in congregation with her son who recites small sewers in taraweeh as he will get reward of congregation or should she pray alone and recite longer sewers from the most have sadly it is not mandatory for you to pray in JAMA and if there is no other man with your son then he can pray alone so at the end of the day I would highly recommend that you pray on your own prolonged your salat because this what would count for you on the day of judgement rather than praying with him in five or ten minutes and getting it all over with and allah azzawajal knows best"
