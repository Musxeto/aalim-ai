  "transcript": "foreign and welcome to the 19th lesson of the islamic faith and today we will inshallah study chapter 11 i think yes and this chapter is about a very important part of our apida so whenever you hear people talk about apida then you have to know that this is one important aspect of it and that is the belief of what is after death and we will begin in sha allah reading what is in chapter 11 and then we will comment whenever commenting is required by as wajal the sheikh says death is inevitable and this is a universal fact no body on earth believes that he would not die every single born creature knows of the inevitability of his death he is going to die how long it would take him to reach that conclusion this is in allah's hands the most fortunate those are those who know from an early stage in their lives that they are going to die and more fortunate than them are those who know what to do to prepare themselves for what is coming after the death allah says everyone upon it that is earth will perish and there will be or there will remain the face of your lord honor of majesty and honor the sheikh says it is a part of faith it is a part of iman that we should believe in what comes after death including one's examination in the grave and the resulting happiness or torment so this is something that is definitely among the most important things people must adhere to and that is they are going to die and their death is not the end as people say he died and he went to his final destination no this is not his final destination it is the beginning where the prophet alaihis allah used to say the grave is the first stage of the hereafter so we believe that this is not the end there has to be after death examination in the grave and there has to result of that examination happiness in the grave or torment and this is again one of the major issues that deviant sex and cults disapproved of so they used their logic and said we don't see anybody sitting in his grave we don't see any marks of punishment or torment on a deceased or a corpse body so they denied with their minds but they cannot see alhamdulillah a couple of chapters ago we discussed the role of the mind and the role of the intellect and how it cannot oppose the revelation of the quran and sunnah because our minds cannot comprehend everything as exactly our eyes cannot see everything so things that we cannot see this does not at all mean that they do not exist moreover part of the belief part of the faith we should have is it is essential to believe a resurrection and this again is an important aspect in islam allah says and the horn will be blown and at once from the graves to their lord they will hasten therefore we believe in resurrection other religions we believe they believe in reincarnation other cults who pretend to be muslims believe in reincarnation they don't believe in resurrection and this goes on to prove to you the importance of the belief in the day of judgment and why allah azzawajal made it one of the six pillars of faith six pillars of iman to believe in allah his angels his books his messengers and in the hereafter and also to believe in pre-destiny evil and good or good and evil so part of your faith is to believe in resurrection whoever doubts the resurrection disbelieves in allah and there is no other choice because part of the six pillars of iman is to believe in the day of judgment and resurrection and whoever doubts it as stated is a kafir allah says in surat al-jafiyah but as for those who disbelieved it will be said where not are verses recited to you but you were arrogant and became a criminal people and when it was said indeed the promise of allah is truth and the hour is coming no doubt about it you said we know not what is the hour we assume only assumption and we are not convinced so this is their sin on the day of judgment that they would declare that they did not believe in the hour and this is why they were cursed for their actions and for what they had done needless to say the one who denies the day of judgment is also a disbeliever so it's not resurrection that one becomes a disbeliever if he believes that once we die it's over game over there's nothing no whoever believes that resurrection is not there is a kafir and whoever disbelieves about the day of judgment about the hour then he is a disbeliever allah says but they have denied the hour and we have prepared for those who deny the hour ablaze they are there would be upon the people of hell fire another part of faith of iman is to believe in the reckoning on the day of judgment so everything that comes after death you don't have the option to disbelieve in it because this is believing in allah azza this is faith so you believe in death you believe in resurrection you believe in accountability you believe in the day of judgment so reckoning on the day of judgment allah says in surat al-anbiya and we place the scales of justice for the day of resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and if there is even the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and sufficient are we as accountant and we place the scales of justice do we have to believe in such a thing the existence of scales the answer is yes on the day of judgment we as muslims part of rapida to believe that there would be a scale and it would have eyes and a tongue to speak with and in one narration if the heavens and the earth's were to be put in the scale the scale would fit them how big is the skin and it is so accurate that even the seed of a mustard seed the weight of a master seed can be noticed and accurately weighed so what is to be weighed on this or in this scale scholars have said there might be three types one the deeds themselves so good moral conduct would be placed in the scale to be weight your consumption of intoxicants would be weighed being kind and dutiful to your parents would be weighed the action itself the good deed or the bad deed would be placed in the scale number two scholar said it is the record books we know that on the day of judgment we pray that we will be receiving our record books with our right hands which means that we are fortunate and blessed but there are those who would receive their record books with their left hand which means that they're doomed may allah protect us these record books are to be weighed on the scale if you were fortunate to have your good deeds overweigh your bad deeds you're saved and blessed if your bad deeds overweigh your good deeds you're doomed and if they are balanced and equal these are the people of chapter 7 in the quran is called suratul araf and araf is an area between heaven and hell some say it is a mountain called al-araf where those who have their good deeds and bad deeds balanced and equal would remain there until allah rules their affairs and admit them either to heaven or to hell and funny that a lot of the brothers and sisters send me questions what's the ruling on calling my son al-araf it's a mountain why not call him mount everest people are quite strange when it comes to naming their children they just open the quran in any thing they see they pick it up and say okay some even called their son zakum which is a tree that grows in hell but they saw it in the quran so they said what what what the heck i was in india once and my driver's name was shaytan i don't know what what to say they called him his parents named shape on so people should be more aware of how to pick and select a good name for their children so believing in reckoning everybody is going to be weighed did we say number one number two i i forgot number three number one is the deed itself number two is the record box number three it's the individual so the human being would be placed on the scale as in hadith may allah be pleased with him that the prophet said to the companions and defended him in front of the companions when they laughed of how thin his legs are the prophet said by allah they are heavier on the scale on the day of judgment than mount or hood so the individual himself would be weighed and the most authentic opinion that all three the deeds the record books and the individual would be weighed on the day of judgment and allah azzawajal knows best um the chef goes on to say yet another part of faith is to believe in reward and punishment heaven and hell part of believing in the day of judgment the one pillar of iman is to believe in heaven and hell in reward and punishment allah says in surat as for those who were destined to be wretched they will be in the fire for them therein is violent exalting and inhaling exalted inhaling and as for those who were destined to be prosperous they will be in paradise and this is a great from allah azzawajal and a great threat as well to the believers so we fear hellfire and we hope in attaining paradise now the disbelievers will go to hell and this is a well-known fact to all muslims they chose not to believe so they will go to the fire while the believers will be in heaven allah the almighty says and for those who disbelieved i'll punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the hereafter and they will have no helpers but as for those who believed and did righteous deeds he will give them in full their rewards and allah does not like the wrong doers so this is crystal clear of what would happen to the believers and what will happen to the disbelievers all of this happens after death and as you know we have this life the dunya we live in and then we have a transitional period which is called al-barzach where we will be in our graves being enjoying what we see from paradise or tormented from a window to hell after the transitional period is over and the day of judgment is called and everything changes this will be the hour the day of judgment where we will be held accountable for our acts and destined to paradise or to hell this is what will happen all after death and this is all part of believing in the day of judgment finally the sheikh says it is also required to believe in everything stated in authentic texts of the things that will take place in the life to come and on the day of judgment and this is a very essential point that must be clarified we have authentic hadiths we have clear verses of the quran where it talks about the unseen things that we have not seen yet we believe in because allah azzawajal and the messenger of allah can you give example the sheikh says such as the pathway what is the pathway it's a scales the and the scrolls of people's good and evil deeds so if you look at the footnote at the bottom of the page it says the pathway or the sirat is a sort of a bridge that is erected over hell on the day of judgment all people will need to cross it in order to reach heaven now this is not very clear statement not very accurate and i would suggest that you scrap it off all people will need to cross it in order to reach heaven it says believers will be able to do so while unbelievers will fall no this is not true as is a bridge erected on the sides of hell when the day of judgment takes place when everything is cleared someone calls oh you who used to worship other than allah follow those who you used to worship so those who used to worship the sun the moon the idols anything else they will follow their lords they used to worship into hell so they won't get a chance to cross the bridge or even attempt it the hadith tells us that only the believers and the hypocrites which means only those who were pretending to be muslims whether genuinely or fakingly will wait so they will hear a voice addressing them what are you waiting for and they will say we are waiting for our lord allah so the voice says do you know him and they say he promised to identify himself to us so only then allah the almighty reveals his shin his leg and every believing man and woman would fall immediately prostrating to allah with the exception of the hypocrites who try to prostrate but allah turns their backs into a steel plate that cannot bend so they fall on their faces and they would be doomed then the believers the sinners the hypocrites all those those who claim to be muslim would be ordered to cross and to walk over the salat and this includes of course the jews who followed musa the christians who followed isa the followers of who were on the ark with him the followers of ibrahim and the rest of prophets and messengers now those who don't know what assarad is the prophet described it to us scholars talked about it and said that it is thinner than a hair and sharper than a blade and it is slippery people who walk on it will slip and fall and the three types of people that would cross over it those who are saved and they differ in the speed they make it those who are doomed and they fall in hell and this is done by hooks that come from underneath it and takes them and drops them in hell and the third category are those who walk and crawl and while in the process these hooks injure them scratches them scratch them but they eventually make it it would be pitch black dark and there's no light except an individual light according to one's deeds so if you were a righteous practicing muslim with a lot of good deeds you will have light in front of you and from behind you illuminating the whole place only for your eyes and if you were not such a good person you would have a faint light but would enable you to see and if you are where among the sinful once then the only light you will have is in your toe that turns on for a while and then it shuts off then you can imagine what would happen to you when it shuts off when you see hellfire beneath you when you're walking this thin hair and this sharp blade and it is slippery and you see people in front of you falling in hell shouting and screaming just imagine your good and bad deeds what would you like to have more would you like to have more light then and less darkness then reduce your sins quit the habit stop sinning and do a lot of good deeds as much as you can the third category goes straight to hell the second category walks and crawls now those who manage to cross the sarat they vary in speed the prophet said to us that there are people there is a group that would cross the sirat in the same speed of a flash they're there some would be like a tornado very quick but not as quick as the flash some would be like horse riders who cross in a very fast fashion some would be on camelback much slower some would be jogging some would be walking some would be crawling so the speed again varies according to your good deeds so the point i wanted to make in this footnote is that only the muslims whether genuine or pretending to be will be allowed to cross over this salat but not the disbelievers the footnotes goes to say the scales are placed to weigh people's actions which they did during their live on earth we've spoken about this the pond belongs to the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi when he will give people to drink and this is a widely spread misconception that people think that the prophet himself would offer the people to drink what is the pond the pond is a pool where the prophet tells us allah that the cups which people drink from are as many as the stars in the billions and those who drink from it would never ever get thirsty which means that they will never be admitted to hell because we know that the people of hell would be among those who are thirsty and beg for water and the prophet told us that it is as white as milk as sweet as honey something you cannot actually imagine but you believe in it and the prophet told us that there will come people from his ummah muslims who would want to drink from it yet the angels push them back and prevent them from doing so so the prophet tells us that i cry to allah and say my lord this is my ummah this is my ummah so i will be told that you do not know what they had innovated after you which means that these are muslims but they are innovators they had innovated in islam so the prophet says as some destruction may be to those who innovate after me this is the pond and allah azzawajal called it in the quran as al-kawthar as one interpretation in we have given you the abundant goodness so they say that this can also refer to the pool okay uh the scrolls are records of all that people do in this present life each one will be handed their records on the day of judgment and the believers will be proud of their records calling on other people to look into them the unbelievers or the disbelievers will with wish that they had never seen their records and this is what the class is all about the belief in the day of judgment the reckoning hell and fire the questioning the scrolls the books etc by the way these are all things that are part of our iman our belief but unfortunately many muslims that we know of may have issues with that and such issues usually arise because of their ignorance because of their distance from quran and sunnah so it is important for us to share with our families with our relatives with our friends such knowledge and to emphasize the importance of arteda because at the end of the day this is what allah will hold them accountable for and if they have zero knowledge of it it's not going to be very beneficial for them we move on to the questions zayd zubair says i'm asking about loans assume i want to buy a motorcycle and i don't have cash but the seller gives an offer by uh increase the real price to some amount due to paying an installment there is a hadith where the prophet says which translates to if anyone makes two transactions combined in one bargain he should have the lesser of the two or it will be or it will involve usually so uh he's asking what to do how to think of such a hadith first of all the issue of selling a product or an item in installments while increasing the price is totally permissible as the majority of scholars approve that so i have this mobile phone i will sell it in cash to brother ahmed for one thousand dollars then brother abdullah comes and says how much is a mobile i would say twelve hundred dollars abdullah has no right to complain and say why are you selling it to ahmed for a thousand and for me you're adding 200 dollars for that i say it's none of your business it's my mobile phone you want to buy it you're more than welcome pay 1200 you don't want to buy it go somewhere else so this is my product i can sell it for any price am i right or am i wrong i can't hear you but i would presume that you're saying you're right you can sell whatever you want that you possess in any price i can sell it to brother muhammad for one dollar nobody has the right to say this is too cheap why are you doing this no it's my money so now let us look at it in a different angle ahmed says one thousand dollars for the mobile phone that's a good price abdullah says oh i don't have cash but i really need the mobile so can you cut me some slack i said listen i can't do anything to help you except i'm willing to sell it for you providing that you buy it for twelve hundred dollars you give me one hundred dollars every month for a whole year that's twelve months it's a done deal he said wow that's great i can't afford a hundred dollars a month that's easy for me to pay so we agree the deal is done vast majority of muslim scholars say that this is totally halal and this is the most most authentic opinion the hadith you're referring to if anyone makes two transactions combined in one bargain he should have the lesser of the two or it will involve usually it will involve riba this is referring to me selling abdullah by saying to him if you pay cash it's a thousand if you want it on installments over one year it's 1200. abdullah says done i agree and i say okay i have sold you he says i have bought from you and we depart one would say you showed your mobile i said yeah i sold my mobile i said how much said i don't know maybe a thousand maybe 1200. i said excuse me how is it possible you don't know you sold something without knowing he said yes i gave him the option to choose and he's choosing i don't know what he chose this is what the hadith talks about if anyone makes two transactions combined in one bargain he should have the lesser one my friend says to me no no no this transaction is not either 1000 or 1200 then you must take the lesser one the one thousand you can't go for the 1200 otherwise it will be river this is what the hadith talks about according to the most authentic opinion of scholars and allah knows best so in short you have to decide which transaction which contract you're going to go for and then before we depart halas we've agreed that i'll pay twelve hundred dollars a hundred dollars a month that's it maryam says make hijab i have no problem my siblings okay this question is like crosswords so i have to um so her siblings say if you make hijab they have no problems but i put on there is problems my mother is the only one supporting me the others are asking me to remove till i get married so basically her question is all of her family oppose her taking on the niqab wearing the kneecap they have no problem in her covering her body her hair but they have a problem with her covering her face the only one supporting her is her mother what to do ignore them you can't have people dictate to you what to do and what not to do especially when you are doing what pleases allah the almighty so wearing the niqab is it part of the sunnah yes was it practiced by the muslims at the time of the prophet isa salam 100 did any of the prophet's wives peace be upon him and may allah be pleased with them did any of his wives ever unveiled her face never is mentioned in the quran 100 so with all these compelling evidences what do you care let them say what they say let them disapprove and disagree with what you're doing as long as you're pleasing allah azzawajal don't pay any attention to them yes be diplomatic be wise when talking to them be tolerant sometimes you have to pretend that you did not hear any abusive remark or pretend that they did not say what they said just ignore it eventually they'll become tired and leave you on on your own says what does islam say about narcissists from your point of view a narcissist if i understand correctly is a person who is fond of himself and this is stage one not in cancer in what is worse than cancer before arrogance which is stage four so arrogance defined by the prophet sallam is to be looking down at people resenting them and rejecting the truth when it comes to you this is the definition of arrogance when the prophet isam was asked about a person liking to have a beautiful suit or a beautiful set of clothes and a beautiful pair of shoes would not be adding us he said no allah is beautiful and allah loves beauty so there's a thin line between being narcissist and being beautiful being beautiful being handsome good looking having a good body working out and loving it because it is something nice and beautiful it's good being narcissist usually is accompanied by an internal feeling of thinking that i'm above everyone else i'm smarter than everyone else i'm more eloquent i am more intelligent i know everything when everyone else doesn't and everyone knows that this comes with the territory when the knowledge is superficial when the knowledge is not genuine it seems to me that i am the most knowledgeable person and when you talk to me i say what do you know what did you study i've done so much studies and research i know i've been there i've done that now narcissism is when this is an internal feeling that someone like me with 33 years of experience under my belt in giving dawah and so many conferences and lectures and questions answered blah blah blah inside i feel that i must have a position very high an elite with allah i am the answer to the world's problems i know more than anybody else this is the silent killer yet it is not showing clearly to the people which makes it dangerous but curable once it comes out of my mouth and i start looking down at people and i start saying i did my research i know i have studied i have done i have this i it's all i then this becomes arrogance when you look down at people when you start thinking highly of yourself this is why a true believer is always humble even if he was the king where he has the power the authority the wealth everything is under his fingertips yet when he is addressed he sees himself as small as a small insect fearing what allah will do to him knowing his own shortcomings when people come to him or you are the scholar of the world you are the most knowledgeable person and i'm talking about real scholars may allah have mercy on his soul in an interview the presenter was saying that no one has ever seen such a man with such knowledge and he is the remedy for all illnesses and he is the light in all these darknesses allah has blessed us with him allah has this he interrupted him and he said i pray to allah that allah forgives you for the evil that you had set it is not appropriate at all to say these things about people you don't know who i truly am and in humbleness and in humility he started his lecture refusing people to say this even if they mean once in a public lecture it's found one said while introducing him and today we are having a guest who is beyond introduction no need to introduce him so the sheikh said wait wait wait nobody is not in need to be introduced allah is the only one who is well known others are in need to be introduced to know about them and such praise is not permissible how do you praise a human being by saying without any need of introduction who has no need to uh be introduced so this is true knowledge so narcissism as i said is stage one and the destruction comes when it reaches stage four which is arrogance may allah azza protect us because even if the whole world come and praises me and says shahasim is this shahasim is that yeah i would be happy but deep down inside no this is one of sripan's traps all what they're saying is not true because i know myself i know my flaws i know my shortcomings and i know definitely that if sins were to have an odor nobody would be able to sit next to me so a true believer knows himself whether people criticize him or praise him and this is a sign of sincerity when someone comes and says wow what a beautiful lecture sheikh that was what i needed to leave to listen to what i needed to hear it doesn't matter to me alhamdulillah i praise allah it's allah's guidance that i was able to give it and if somebody comes and criticizes it what is this i could have said it better this is a waste of time you've wasted 40 minutes of our time on a lecture that has no value it didn't get us closer to allah i wouldn't feel sad or depressed i would shrug my shoulders and say i did my best allah is the only one who i'm away waiting for praise and reward from not from you and not from him so this would help you a lot in curing such an illness may allah protect us all camilla uh says is it allowed to fulfill salah on top of assassin assist cesspit and also is allowed to have cesspit in the masjid because it's no more space so the area of the machine is extended with the suspect now inside if i understand this question i think cesspit is something like a sewer hole or a septic tank to have this underneath meaning under the ground and to pray over it is okay there's no problem in that in that but to have the tank itself inside the masjid this is not permissible it can't be underneath it can be outside but to have it inside of the masjid itself though it's a tank though the najasa is protected yet it is totally inappropriate to have it inside the machine underneath no problem inshallah pami bint and for says so could we could buy a house from a bank buying a house from a bank from a murderer from a fornicator from a kafir from a mushrik is permissible buying and selling there's nothing wrong in that it doesn't matter what religion the person you're buying from is whether it's sinful or not so buying a property from a person is permissible now your question is not that your question is is it permissible to buy a house in mortgage from a bank so you have to be clear when you are asking a question because buying from a bank can be halal can be haram example bank xyz bought a neighborhood consisting of 20 houses and now he's willing to sell them over the period of 20 years and he would charge interest in the halal way so the money the the house costs five hundred thousand dollars he'll sell it for seven fifty thousand dollars over the duration of twenty years and the month the amount is fixed it cannot be increased more than seven fifty thousand no matter what happens what's the ruling the transaction is one hundred percent hala what shaykh the bank is interspace is a conventional bank yeah i know i'm talking about the transaction the buying and the selling is the the bank selling something that belongs to it yeah is the price fixed yeah what's the problem then no problem so whether you buy it from a bank or from a jew it's the same thing secondly the bank sells you a house that you would like to buy with a fixed price but the bank doesn't own it explain more i have a property this beautiful villa and it's on the beach it costs cash five hundred thousand dollars i don't have the money i go to the bank the bank says i'll buy the house and sell it to you for 750 fixed price over the period of 20 years i said okay i agree he said sign these documents this contract and after i sign and commit he goes and buy the house this is haram because he sold you what it does not possess the third scenario is that the bank gives you the money for the mortgage here's 500 000 cash you buy the property in your name and you paid the bank 750 000. this is clear mortgage there are fourth and fifth scenarios where the bank has a pay a late payment fee or increases the final amount or the final amount is fluctuating depending on the inflation rate the interest rate etc so the 750 can easily go to 100 000. as we speak all of this is so i hope this answers your question pami um diallo says can we pray sitting down at work desk praying sitting down is permissible when you're praying voluntary prayers mandatory followed prayers you must pray standing up because the first pillar of prayers we have like 15 of them the first pillar is to stand up when able so at workplace if you want to pray for prayer you cannot pray sitting down whether you're a man or a woman you have to stand up and pray your father prayer standing up even if there are none men watching sheikh even if there are none men watching as long as you're wearing your abaya you're fully covered try to find an a place where there are no people looking at you but if not possible then pray in front of everyone else there is no problem maybe you need to figure out whether working there in the first place is halal or not and final question is from milad is it mandatory to wear or to wash the private parts after passing wind no it is not mandatory nor it is recommended on the contrary it is prohibited washing the anus after passing wind is not from sunnah or jamaa it can be from the rafale who would do this but the muslims don't do this and it is an innovation to do this we only wash our private parts if something came out was emitted physically passing wind is not of that sort and allah azza knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of our session until we meet next monday assalamu alaikum"
