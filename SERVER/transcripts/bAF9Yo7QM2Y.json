  "transcript": "is it acceptable to praying with animals low on t-shirt like Lacoste etc it depends if the logo has a face eyes features then this is Haram if it's a silhouette like Puma for example it's a tiger or whatever and it doesn't have a face it doesn't have eyes it's just like a shadow there's no problem in that Lacoste some of it it's just the drawing of an alligator or a crocodile that does not have face that it's just the logo itself no problem now new trends and I got over eight couple of t-shirts with the cost logos as a gift from my siblings and one of them it's almost a statue it's not a TD a 2d drawing it's a 3d you can see it coming out and you can see the eyes and the nose of this crocodile and this is not permissible you have to cover the head what I did was put a button on it and my wife fixed it up looks very funny looks what is this but who cares I fear that a lot it will be angered with me if I wear this a picture which is haram so I hope this yeah it makes it clear"
