  "transcript": "[Music] and we begin our session which is dedicated to your questions and with these questions inshaallah we will conclude our talk our course on the islamic faith on the book of phil and we have like 28 questions so inshallah try to wrap it up all uh as possible as soon as possible this is from um zaid zubair he said i'm asking about fitna that broke out among the sahabah melody please with them how authentic are these stories is there any benefit on us in studying them and hence take sides does cursing any of the sahaba leads to kuffar jazakum first of all the stories that history books tell us about are originally basically true in the essence that there was a dispute between the companions at the time of the killing of uthman ibn afan the third caliph may allah be pleased with him and what followed that when ali was nominated and chosen by the ten remaining heaven bound to be the caliph and there were calls among those who felt betrayed for not avenging the death and the murder of of man so they started demanding and pressuring ali may allah be pleased with him to take their revenge and to execute those who participated in murdering this righteous khalifah ali on the other hand may allah be pleased with him wanted things to become stable as the chaos was recent and the potentials of it continuing is great so he did not want to cause more fitness he wanted things to calm down he wanted to enforce his reign over the land and then he can enforce the law and bring the perpetrators to justice making a long story short both sides had good intention yet the culprits and the villains once they approached or once they felt the rope was tightening around their necks they did not want things to go down easily so they started to cause fitna within the armies and they sparked fighting and this led to the killing of many people which neither parties had intended or wanted the same thing happened with muawiyah and ali may allah be pleased with them now would it benefit us the answer is no there is no benefit in it none whatsoever it's part of history it has no relationship to sharia to the quran or to the sunnah except in very very minor aspect but not knowing it does not impact your iman not knowing it would not lead to you being questioned on the day of judgment why didn't you know about it as for your last part of the question does cursing in of the sahaba leads to kuffar the answer is no one particular sahaba or two this does not lead to kufr but definitely a person who does this is a facebook and if he curses them because they abided by the quran and the sunnah and were companions of the prophet this is kufur if he curses any one of the ten heaven bound whom the prophet told us that they are in heaven this can easily mount to kufur and may allah azzawajal protect us all rashid says i was stuck in traffic and was not able to catch asur salat and by the time i reached it was after the adhan can i pray first and then pray maghrib or after maghrib prayer can you guide me please this is an issue of dispute rashid and the most authentic opinion is that whoever deliberately leaves a prayer until the time is over that he cannot make it up only as the prophet had given excuses of sleeping or forgetting the prophet said alaihis whoever oversleeps or forgets a prayer must pray it as soon as he remembers that there is no expiation other than that now if you analyze the hadith the prophet mentioned two reasons oversleeping which we know that allah has uplifted the pen of accountability so that the person who oversleeps is not accountable for what he misses and forgetfulness and we know that when a person forgets he's not accountable even if he eats during the daytime of ramadan forgetting and allah says in the quran do not burden us if we were to forget or to make an error and allah said i have done so so this means that when the prophet says there is no expiation other than that for reasons that are already forgiven by sharia this means that any other reason would not fall under this category being truck or stuck in traffic does not allow you to delay assa until the sun sets you could have parked anywhere and prayed and if it's stuck in the traffic you can uh uh get out of the car if you're not driving and you could have prayed us on time and hence there is no excuse for you and allah's best fat says you answered me before that it is not permissible to pray the voluntary prayers in the same place where we prayed the father prayer but what about in ramadan many people especially the imam pray tarawih in the same place what is the ruling on that the ruling is the same usually the imam and the congregation would pray two raka's of sunnah so the imam himself would back off a couple of steps or goes to the right or to the left or exchange the place with one of the followers behind him for the sunnah and this movement by itself is sufficient and they can pray tell away afterwards without any problem in sha allah zaid says dear hassan how relevant are the four imams and our great scholars may allah be pleased with them sheikh i have been learning my dean from a group or a sect for the past 10 years and i have been in doctrinated doctrinated to hate the four imams and from this group we don't find relevance in scholars but we learn from our teachers only who read and interpret on their own understanding ever since i started following you i have discovered so many things hence making me hate my sect may allah reward you i mean how relevant are our scholars and please explain to me the danger of sex brother zaid those contemporary people who believe that the four schools of thought the previous imams uh and scholars of islam are not relevant in that we only have to follow the quran and the sunnah such people themselves are irrelevant and they are ignorant imbeciles because at the end of the day they don't even mount to be equivalent to one of their toes such great imams and scholars of islam who had spent their lives dedicating it their time their effort and everything they possess for the sake of islam and for the sake of allah such ignorant imbeciles come at the end of the day just because they read a book or two and they claim that all these scholars are irrelevant unfortunately this type of ideology in the past has found fertile ground among the youth and these youth consider themselves to be men like the scholars and they report a quote by imam abu hanifa he says whenever something comes to us from allah or the prophet it is followed unquestionably and whenever something comes to us from the companions where they agreed upon we honor it and we put it on our heads but whenever something comes to us from the tabi's then they are men and we are men meaning that we don't care about what they had said this was from one of the great imams and that is imam abu harifah whom a shaffer he said all people are dependent on abu hanifa they all need him they cannot live without his fear and that was imam shafi so this would be accepted from someone like imam shafiq imam but to come in the 21st century having people simply scratching off all the scholars all the schools of thought all the tabbing all tabi italian on the account that their men and weird men this is absurd they are men but you are not men you're scum you're nothing compared to them and these people some of them they label themselves as salafis athletes etc indicating that we have been liberated and we follow only the quran and the sunnah not knowing that they don't have the tools to understand the quran and sunnah on their own having said that i'm not saying that we have to be enslaved in our opinions to the four schools of thought and to the scholars etc no we are studying the quran and the sunnah and we abide by them but with the understanding of the three favorite generations companions which means that we do not shoot from the hip but rather we understand incidents as the three favorite generations would have understood it nowadays we find people saying that oh i don't follow any school of thought i'm a salafi i follow only sheikh al-bani okay is one of our great scholars and we respect him and we love him but if you follow sheikh al-bani then you might as well follow abu harifah who's definitely greater than al-bani or malik who are gazillion light years better than sheikh al-ban so at the end of the day when you follow your teachers or your sheikh or your imam in his understanding this is blind following and this is not the right thing to do therefore this sect they are a group of ignorant imbeciles don't be fooled by their shiny titles or their inner circle that praise one another oh i've never seen like our sheikh the allama the samaha so and so he does miracles and others one and he says oh yeah i've seen that and i've done that and the third one says the same so you hear these few praising their sheikh or alim and you are fooled by that and think yeah well three people said he's good he must be good not knowing they are like a volleyball team one or two blocks the other three or four they receive they raise and lift the ball and set it up and the third one smashes we scored a point teamwork but this doesn't mean that they're right so if you have done well by leaving them and you have done well by following the quran sunnah with the understanding of the self while respecting every single scholar of islam and this is the methodology of allah we respect them we honor them but we don't follow them when they're wrong yet we do not disrespect them when they're wrong they did theirs they had if they failed they're rewarded once if they succeeded they won't reward it twice and allah knows best rumor farooq says i heard that some people asked allah to show them how the torment of the grave is then a person popped up from his grave and told them reported it i think can i make a similar dua to allah asking him to show people what's happening in the grave of a super sufi so people know that he was upon wrong path so they stopped following him first of all himself used to say you have to first of all make what you're engraving on firm before you start engraving so if you have a piece of marble and you just put it loose and you start to engrave a name it will fall down or break because before you put such an allegation prove it when you say that imam sheikh al-bani said something like that cannot say something like that and even if something like that this is preposterous no no way you would convince a muslim that somebody came back to life popped out of his grave to tell the people in a storytelling fashion what is happening and what has happened to him and then he says well i think we come to the end of our episode i have to go back to my grave and face more punishment this is ridiculous come on if someone is crazy and telling you tales of insane people you wouldn't react by saying ah is that true wow i never knew no this is insane this is totally fabricated and baseless so definitely no you cannot ask allah for such a dua because you would be transgressing in dua might as well ask allah azza to make to walk on the water or fly in the air or not need to eat and drink for few years it's the same concept actor says if a person misses replying to evan from the beginning but he catches it from the middle so can he reply to the adhan and say the prescribed dua after the adhan this is an issue of dispute some say that it has to be coinciding with the imam otherwise you would not repeat it others say that no you can even do your own repetition of the dua of the the adhan even after it's finished and some said that well if you have missed the first few phrases for a legitimate reason they there's nothing wrong in doing that and this is what shaykh abdullah may allah have mercy on his soul used to do when we used to call him between asha riyadh time when the adan is given in riyadh time and he was talking to one of the callers so he missed the first maybe half of it or the three quarters of it then when the callers uh finishes this calling before he picks up the second caller he would hear him say allah says my apologies in advance if this question is odd i'm a new muslim and i have to pay the cat for the first time can i pay the cat for an animal shelter or another organization that benefits animals if this was on twitter i would have given a different answer but this is a serious q and a session so i would answer seriously naomi mentioned in chapter 9 in verse 16 6-0 the eight categories of the recipients of zakat so we cannot give the cat except to eight categories of people and animals definitely are not included so you cannot give your zakat to animal shelter or any organization that benefits animals and that would not be accepted so you have to give it to the poor to the needy uh to those whom their hearts are inclined to islam to those who work in gathering uh the zakat uh to uh freeing slaves to those who are indebted to um those who have uh wayfarer i think they call them those who have been stuck in countries other than theirs and they don't have money and in jihad these are the eight categories that you can only give zakat to suha says i have small kids sometimes they cry for milk i offer my fart salat as well as sunna leaving athcar after fart salat and i read my car while in the kitchen is it permissible or i have to read it after salah only so if i were in your shoes i would utilize the time after i finish my fart salat i go immediately to the kitchen to prepare their milk while saying my afkar when i give them their milk i go and offer my sunnah you don't have to follow the sunnah immediately after fall there could be a gap of an hour uh or more as long as you prayed within the allocated time of the salat then you're safe in sha allah abdullah quick says if a person does shirk or kufur in his lifetime can allah accept his repentance even if he was previously a believer awesome hakeem i don't know what why is my name is mentioned i don't i hope he's not referring to me so the answer is yes if i understand your question a muslim who was practicing all of his life when he was 30 years of age he fell into kufr and committed it deliberately or started associating others with allah then allah guided him back to the light he repented uh he repented he sought allah's forgiveness and he was remorseful so the question is will allah accept his repentance of course allah would definitely and certainly accept his repentance because he came back to allah and allah never ever pushes back or rejects anyone that comes to him independence no matter how heinous the sin is no matter how bad allah never returns someone back on his heel if he comes to allah to allah in repentance and allah azza knows best tahira says i have you're an incontinence do i have to change sanitary napkin or special urine leakage proof underwear for each prayer please answer the answer is yes if you are seriously suffering from your incontinence then you have to after every adhan before you pray you have to clean and wash your private part and the parts of your body that was uh the parts of your body that were contaminated with impurity change your impure clothes your underwear or your napkins or your um uh whatever and then perform mudu and you can pray with that one till the time is over but tahira i would like to bring to your attention that urine incontinence is actually a continuous dripping of urine 99.9 of those who think they have urine incontinence do not have urine because the first question we ask them does the urine stop after you urinate and they would say yes it stops maybe after 10 to 15 minutes we don't have the feeling does the urine incontinence come if you urinate in the middle of the night when you don't have to pray so you don't perform muddle do you still feel it most of them say no which means that it's related to urinating when preparing to salat to prayer and this is caused by shaytan the vast majority we make counseling sessions for them they're cured from such incontinence and thoughts alhamdulillah and the grace is to allah the almighty alone so i would highly recommend that you go through your case because you will find that you don't have your incontinence and you're just making life difficult for yourself in vain sharman says i want to know if online assignment writing is halal or haram so he makes money from writing assignments researchers homeworks for students is this halal haram no this is help this is cheating and collaborating on cheating the student when he presents the city research paper writes his own name when he writes presents the assignment it's his known name you are not known to anyone except him so this is haram and you must not do that as for the previous income which you collected when you did not know then this is halal for you to use but you have to stop rabbi khan says i have a question my father's named me as rabbi or rabbi it has a on it but in the beginning his name was r-a-b-e which is totally legitimate legit means spring be means my lord everybody calls me by this name in my university and passport md rabbi khan md i think is a short for muhammad this is my full name given but in the quran means allah so i am destined for hell forever because of this name it's almost impossible for me to change the name because i'm currently studying in a foreign university would you please answer my question first of all robb b can indicate my lord and lord can be given to allah and can be given to a judge a master an owner we can say he is my lord not referring to and this is not shift because there are names that are common between or not common that we can use for both uh we can be used with both allah azza and the humans such as al-hakim allah is a hakim but humans can also use the name in surat yusuf al-aziz was a title that was given to anyone who reigns over egypt including yusuf so yusuf did not say to them no this is haram don't use al-aziz with me this is only for allah and so on alba these are common so rabbi my lord can also refer to a wife calling her husband or a slave calling his master and the word itself is inappropriate but it doesn't mount to shikh so if your name is muhammad rabbi khan or you can tell the people to pronounce it that would be a win-win and also if you just call yourself muhammad that would be also perfect it'd be ja says i have a question to marry a wife you must have two witnesses present by divorcing her do you need two witnesses to be present thank you yes the sunnah is that you should have two male men muslims to witness the divorce or at least to be acknowledged to be informed that divorce took place yesterday and this is a sunnah but it is not mandatory nor a pillar of marriage such as having them in the marriage contract so when getting married it's a must to have two male witnesses muslims at least or more to testify and witness but in divorce it can be even done alone so if a person is sitting in the room alone and he says i divorce his wife he's talking about his wife the divorce takes place even if there's no one in the room as long as he uttered it and said it verbally the divorce takes place it is sunnah that he goes and tells people or two of his relatives friends that i divorced my wife yesterday is it mandatory no it's not manatee but it is a highly recommended sunnah aisha says i hope you are in good health insha'allah i want to ask the ruling of dress code for muslim women in islam when she is staying temporary or temporarily in a foreign state it is the same whether she is in a foreign state or in saudi arabia or in cairo or in morocco or in kuala lumpur what they wear is the same they have to cover themselves with a outer garment that is thick not transparent that does not expose her bone structure and body curves that does not look like the attire of the disbelievers and that is not a fitna on its own it does not attract people to look either to the design or because of the flashy colors so the same goes in a foreign country or locally but if you're referring to wearing abaya the black abaya no this is not mandatory for a person to adopt and wear in such foreign countries if you feel that wearing something that is dark blue that is gray that is brown and it has a acceptable design that fits the requirements of the islamic attire there's no problem with that muhammad says instead of one wiping front of the head and back and then vice versa wiping as in hadith three wiping another sunnah way may i wipe my head randomly all over almost always ocd of hands drying before covering the whole head and the ears i don't understand the hadith wiping of the head is the easiest thing your hands becoming dry or not is not an issue because you're not told to wash you're told to wipe which means that not every single strand of the hair is going to be wiped so your hands are wet you do this and this that's all going to the back and back to the front and in another hadith you also can do this so from the top going down especially for those who have a very soft hair like mine they can do this they do this that's it and it does the job it doesn't cause you to brush it again or go to the hairdresser and make it over again people with ocd make their lives and the lives of those around them difficult but it is very easy to get over your ocd once you know what is causing it how is causing it and how to prevent it this would be inshallah souls all what you need is to talk to someone who can open your eyes from a sharia perspective and tell you how to counter this illness hadi says what are the most authentic duas during sujud apart from the normal dua well you have the book muslim and there are different versions of numerous duas that the prophet used to say you can learn it from there in sha allah she too says what is the ruling on a girl who does not know her father and father's family and she wants to get married well such a girl if she's born out of wedlock and her name is either called by her mother's family because she's born out of wedlock or given a name that is generic such as daughter of abdullah everywhere is abdullah so it can't be anyone or the new yorker because she lives in new york if this is the case and she doesn't know her father's family or her father's who he is because she was born out of wedlock in this case her guardian would be the muslim ruler if she's in a muslim country or the muslim judge if there is an islamic court or the authorized imam of the islamic center if they are living in a catholic country but if she knows her father's real name and he's not only her biological father no he was married to her mother and she was born as a legitimate child she must look for him and for his family and she cannot get married without his approval and consent because the prophet said allah there is no marriage valid without the approval and consent of the guardian and the guardian is the father so she should look for him with uh facebook and social media search she would inshallah definitely be successful in that heber says my father worked in a bank all his life he had three daughters and a limited salary he never took any black money though it was offered to him several times he never paid zakat all his life so my question um okay so my questions are how will they pay zakat now they gave all their gold and land to our sisters in marriage now they are left with only one house in which they live but even that is declared for three of us they have hardly three or four dollars of gold now so how will they pay their past zakat first of all before going to the second question if i understand her question correctly when her father was a an employee he made savings and over these savings he did not give zakat and now after retirement all of his savings were spent over the marriage of his three daughters and he doesn't have cash left all what he has with his wife is the house and three or four dollars of gold which does not reach the nisab if i recall correctly of the slab of 85 grams of gold three or four dollars i i think they're less than that it has to be seven dollars or something so she says what should my father do well all the years that had passed with him not giving this a cat this is a debt that he has to clear because the debt is to allah azzawajal and he must pay that how this is his problem either sell the house and clear his debt or ask his daughters to pay him what the zakat which is due is equivalent to and clear his uh debt and allah knows best number two how will the zakat for gold be calculated i mean will we pay zakat on the current rate of gold or on the rate that was in the past no if you had zakat in 2005 if you had gold in 2005 and you would like to give zakat for that you have to check how much was the rate of gold in 2005 and pay according to that not according to 2021 3 can we assist in paying the zakat on their behalf while they're still alive if they authorize you and you tell them i'm going to pay the zakat equivalent to so-and-so would you allow me to and he says yes then this is accepted if he says no even pay if you pay it he would not be exempted from the punishment as now he is retired okay then i think we've managed to answer all of this muhammad ibrahim says i have [Music] a little dilemma that has been bothering me a friend of mine just passed away a few days ago i had borrowed money from them and haven't repaid them back what do i do now you go to the heirs of that person so if that brother has a father you go to the father and says listen i borrowed a thousand dollars from your son i pray for his forgiveness here is the one thousand dollars debt that i had and the father is responsible of distributing it to the heirs according to the sharia bintawa says can we recite quran without wudu from mobile phones the answers is yes will it be the same reward as reciting with wudo the answer would be no wudu is a higher degree but it is recommended and rewarded but not mandatory when reading it from a mobile phone while reciting the quran from the mobile will that part be included as quran even without wudu the answer is yes again benthawa says if a man divorces his wife three times in writing will she get divorced this is an issue of dispute and issues of divorce are not answered in an email this has to be answered in a court a muslim court where the judge would tell you after hearing from the man and from the wife in order to know the intentions the circumstances how it happened was it an anger or a normal situation so this needs a session to answer it fatima says can a woman observe ertikaf at home the answer is no women and men cannot offer erticaf at homes etiquette can only be offered in messages full-fledged messages which means that even a prayer hall or musa cannot qualify for a tickaf uh also can she come out of room to eat and cook without talking to anyone i said that etiquette is not valid so yes she can cook and clean and eat and do whatever she wants in her home because this is not an etiquette is evolution necessary while teaching quran to children if you're not going to touch the quran no it is not necessary kimberly says i'm a new muslim i need to know some rules regarding halal and haram of islam how can i learn easy way as a beginner moreover i need to know about dress code of islam how it will help me in my working environment in the u.s culture how i can face all this environment regarding islam well kimberly this is a very long topic i would advise you to go to islamic philip facebook page or to is the islamic dot net website and you will find my series explaining the islamic from 80z and you'll find it there also if you go to my youtube channel you'll find the islamic fair series and it's comprehensive inshallah easy to understand i hope and also you will find it's a course i gave but it's a very lengthy one detailed so it explains to you everything you need to know of about your religion uh it would take time it's the islamic is much uh shorter and concise but if you are a person who likes to um know how to fish rather than others giving them a fish every day then go to um fatima says i have a question does a woman have more reward if she prays alone in her room or in congregation with her husband and father-in-law women are not obliged to pray in congregation so if she prays alone in her room that is much better for her reward insha allah but if she feels that joining her husband and her father-in-law in prayer would make them happy that would be fine as well masuma says please tell me giving daily adhan especially in these times base besides the five daily adhan is according to the sunnah of course not how would a person do and then other than the five daily advent women must not offer them at all this is number one number two that is given at specific times allocated times i cannot come at 12 o'clock in the at midnight and give the adhan this is neither isha nor fajr yes there are some narrations stated that it is permissible to give a dan when a fire breaks or when you're afraid of the gin but i don't see any authenticity to such narrations and allah azza knows best ms bach says is having a career plan or high ambition permissible in islam if not then what should i do as i have some ambitions like higher studies and so on the question is not clear misbah no one has ever said that pursuing a phd degree is not recommended in islam or becoming an owner of a company or a ceo or an influential person in the society all of these are recommended and permissible with conditions number one you don't do anything haram so if you're studying something to get your phd then this is haram if you need to bend some rules if not break them in order to reach a post or a position in the government such as lying bribing cheating etc this is hara such ambitions will take you straight to hell if you in order to become a ceo of a company you need to deal in riba and do haram transactions and maybe cheat this is totally haram other than that if everything is legit the sky is the limit finally bansi says please how do we go about the marriage of a christian woman who accepts islam while her family are still christians my second question is how close or far should someone be to be considered a neighbor the first question is if she reverted to islam she is not a christian woman anymore she is a muslim so you don't ever refer to her as a christian revert no she is a muslim full stop in order to marry her none of her christian family can be in charge of such a thing because they're not her guardians a kafir cannot be a guardian for a muslim and therefore her guardian is as mentioned a little bit earlier is the muslim ruler and if there is no muslim ruler than the muslim judge in an islamic court and if there is no islamic court then the authorized imam of the islamic center in the cafe country as for the second question there is no specific prescribed definition of your neighbor some scholars said a neighbor is a person who hears the adhan so if the adhan is in the masjid the vicinity that the adhan reaches these are all your neighbors some said your neighbor is the seventh door to your left right front and back so all those you count from one to seven are your neighbors some say your neighbors are every person who prays fajr in the masjid with you providing you which is unfortunate to see that so little of the muslims observe their prayers in the masjid so there isn't any prescribed answer for that and allah azza knows best and with this we conclude the islamic faith for saul and philippe and this was the third session of questions and hopefully inshallah hopefully that we will find something else to begin soon and we would start a new book if allah azza wills it and with this we come to the conclusion foreign"
