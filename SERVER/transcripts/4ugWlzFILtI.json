  "title": "Wearing Niqab during ihram is not permissible, how can she cover her face in a crowd assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "may Allah give you and you as well by the of Allah by the grace of Allah we are uh doing umra next month with my mother uh my question was regarding thear of the face the covering of the face we have been reading about how uh nikab is not allowed and we have to cover the face so my uh mother was concerned like if she covers her face because she has to do it all the time because there are so many men there how would she be able to like do the TA in in such uh you know High uh uh people a lot of people there and uh how would she be able to do that while I'm doing RAR and everything so uh if you could do more detail on that in okay first of all a woman's is by not wearing the gloves nor the nikab which is a face mask that has two holes or an opening for the eyes this is prohibited so the ideal situation is that as per the Hadith of Asma AB Bakr may Allah be pleased with her and with her father she said we performed ha with the prophet Alat and we used to unveil and when whenever Men passed by us riding we used to Veil our faces so the ideal is to throw a veil on your face now women know that the Black Veil they wear is made of layers so one layer is very very very thin and you can see her she can see you and this is not a Veil because it hides any defects on the skin and the face a second layer would be too difficult for them to recognize but still the woman can see through it without a problem a third layer would be black in black she cannot see and she cannot be seen so your mom is allowed to put a layer that allows her to see and if your mom is over 60 or 70 years of age and she''s reached an age where she's not sought after by men due to her age Allah has G her given her the concession to co uncover her face if she wants if she won't bring any attention and no one would be tempted or seduced by her looks she can uncover her face alhamdulillah without any problem"
