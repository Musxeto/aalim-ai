  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first time we here tonight with family around the nice meal we're making do night feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam Hadith number 12 in the chapter that deals with fasting from the book this Hadith was narrated by Salman may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallai wasam said when one of you is breaking his fast he should eat some dates if dates are not available then break it with some water for water is purifying now in this Hadith the prophet wasam is telling us about one of the etiquet of breaking your fast so we spoke about how to hasten when breaking the fast we also talked about the pre-dawn meal now the prophet is telling us what is the best thing to break your fast over so he says that the best thing is that you break your fast by eting dates and dates in Arabic can refer can refer to the fresh dates that are ripe and can refer to the dry dates that can be stored for long periods of time and in another Hadith the companions tell us that the prophet Alam used to choose to eat or to break his fast with ripe dates when possible it is what we call and usually it is either red or yellow in color and it is very sweet and it's fresh and ripe so if this was not available then the prophet would go to the other type of dates which is the dry one that can be stored and this is harder for the stomach usually but still it's better than anything else so the rip fruit the RAB is very tender and nice and can be easily digested especially after 15 17 20 hours of fasting the body is drained from the sugar level in the blood and it needs sugar to restore its strength and Agility and power and this happens easily through dates and if the prophet was unable to have both types of dates sallallah alaihi Al wasallam then he would refer to drinking sips of water and he justified this by saying because water is pure now this is the etiquette this is the norm that the majority of Muslims do worldwide and it has a lot of medical benefits when you eat dates because Allah has put in these dates a lot of medical miracles so dates is considered to be the best food possible for people it contains all what they need if most of what they need in their life if not all of it and that is why may Allah have mercy on him the cousin OFA may Allah be pleased with her when he heard her say that we used to see the Crescent then the Crescent then the Crescent this indicates that it is about two months that pass and the fire would not be lit in the houses of the Prophet Alat wasam so he asked her if you did not cook for two consecutive months what did you eat then and she said we only consumed the two blacks aladan and she was referring to dates and water and why would she describe water to be black she wasn't describing water to be black but rather this is sort of uh Arabic metaphor and the usage of the Arabic language so whenever you have two things and one is more dominant or prominent then you would use the name for it to refer and describe the other type and for example they used to say that the two Omar came and they were referring to Abu Bakr and to Omar so instead of saying Abu Bakr and Omar they they would say alar and they do not mean any disrespect to Abu Bakr but it wouldn't sound good it wouldn't sound well in Arabic to say Abu bakran for example the two Abu Bakr Omar is much easier likewise when you say that uh when the two moons appear alaran and they refer to the Sun and to the moon so they give the Sun the name of the Moon because they are always uh mentioned together and the name of alar is easier to uh mention as two or plural likewise when AA referred may Allah be pleased with her to dates and water by the two blacks which means that the first black is the dates because it's the color is usually dark or black and the water falls underneath the same uh category or same description so dates has a lot of benefits in it to the extent that the prophet Alam spoke quite highly of it for example the authentic Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam a house that does not have dates the people living in that house are hungry so even if they have lots of other types of food but this is the essential food that should always be there because people can rely and depend on it for uh uh nourishing their bodies and being able to sustain a living not only that the prophet sallallah wasam also highly recommended to have dates for your pre-dawn meal he said what an excellent pre-done meal dates is so whenever you have dates as your preon meal then this is an excellent as the prophet said and there are types of dates one of the most most famous is the dates known as and this is mainly found in Medina the prophet says in an authentic Hadith whoever eats in the morning the first thing that he puts in his mouth whoever eats seven dates of then he would not be harmed neither by poison nor by black magic and Scholars differed is this Hadith specifically for this kind of dates only found and allocated in Medina or is it General some Scholars say that it is general and any seven dates you consume the first thing in the morning does the job for you other SC Scholars say the prophet did not designate by name this date except because it had some special characteristics in it that no other dates share it with it and this what seems to me uh to be the most appropriate uh answer so yes if you eat every single morning seven dates the first thing you wake up and do is eat the these seven dates from the from Medina and that is why it's one of the most expensive types of dates because it's not very famous and it's there's not a lot of it produced so if you do this then with the grace of Allah no black magic and no poison would be able to harm you so dates has a lot of value in the life of a Muslim and the prophet's habitat of breaking his fast of encouraging people to break their fast with dates and to consume a lot of dates is coming without him knowing anything about medicine without him going to medical schools but because Allah revealed that to him so if a person is unable to find dates then the prophet used toam drink sips of water so he used to drink water and he described it to be pure so the prophet Alat wasam said to us that this water is pure the Hadith says for water is purifying now what does water is purifying mean Scholars say and Allah and Allah knows best this is what the medical uh doctors say and we hear a lot of reports of the benefits of drinking a glass or two glasses of water the minute you wake up before eating anything and its room temperature a lot of them say that doing this has so many benefits for the liver for cleansing your stomach for your arteries Etc this is what they say I don't know how authentic or how how true this is we have to refer to Medical medical doctors to verify this but we know that the prophet told us that if you're unable to break your fast with dates then drink water because it's purifying so we can say with confidence that it purifies the body it purifies the stomach how this is with Allah and he knows uh uh best moving on to Hadith number 1 and this is a long Hadith so inshallah we will see it displayed on the monitor Hadith number 13 Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet of Allah Sall alai wasam forbade us from practicing W in fasting what is w that is fasting continuously without breaking one's fast in the evening or eating before the following Dawn so so a man said to him but you practice WIS oh messenger of Allah so the prophet saidat wasam which one of you is like me I am given food and drink during my sleep by Allah and in another translation you can say that I stay with my Lord and He feeds me and he gives me drink so when people refused to stop WIS the prophet Sall alai wasallam fasted day and night continuously along with them for a day and then another day and then they saw the Crescent of the new month of sha the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to them if by the way I'm still reading the Hadith I'm not seeing it on the monitor but uh I hope my reading is okay the prophet said to to them if the Crescent had not appeared I would have made you fast for a longer period that was a punishment for them because they refused to stop practicing wi and this Hadith was agreed upon this is the end of the Hadith so let us go back to the Hadith again the prophet forbade them from what is WIS we know that in Ramadan when you fast you fast from the break of dawn till sunset now the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam on his own without telling people he used to not break his fast when the sun sets but rather he used to continue for another day and maybe for a third day without eating or eating or drinking K without breaking his fast so he would fast probably 36 hours 48 hours 72 hours Allah knows how long so the companions may Allah be pleased with them complained and this shows you how eager they are to do good deeds now when the prophet forbade from doing continuous fasting without a break this illustrates to us that Islam is a religion of ease Islam is a religion of Simplicity Allah doesn't want us to kill ourselves Allah unlike other religions does not want us to torture ourselves Allah the almighty is ordering us to worship him for our own benefit so that he would give us Paradise so that he he would give us a good living so Allah does not tell us to fast for two days or for three days one would say okay there is a lot of hardship for those who live in the Scandinavian uh uh countries so they like fast for 20 or 21 hours and nevertheless as long as Allah obliged them to fast this is within their capability does not hold the soul or does not burden a soul for more than what it can bear never doubt that Allah obligates something and people are unable to do it if Allah ordered us to fly that would have been burdening us with what we cannot bear if Allah ordered us to stay under water for hours without end we would probably drown and and die but Allah doesn't do this Allah tells us to pray and he knows that we can pray he tells us to fast and he knows that we can fast and one of the most I wouldn't say funniest but the most awkward fatwa I heard from a Sheikh in Arabic and I was told that there was another Saudi Sheikh who gave the same fatwa I I did not hear it yet but this is very strange I don't know where these people get their knowledge from because in the Quran we're told that you have you can eat and drink as long as it's night time when it's daytime it's over you have to refrain until night time and the prophet says Alam when the Night comes from here and the day leaves from here then the person who is fasting has broken his fast meaning that this is a time for breaking your fast so whenever there is day and night and you can segregate between between day and night then you have to fast no matter how long the day is I heard yesterday a brother sent me a a um a WhatsApp broadcast or whatever you call it and I opened it and it was for an Egyptian uh um Di and he was saying that the people in Sweden they fast for 21 hours and it's very hard people have to go to work people have to go to schools and and and it's 21 hours who can tolerate this long but alhamdulillah there is a way out for them and I was you know shocked maybe we learn every day something new so this honorable Sheikh said that when it is the break of dawn you have to refrain from eating and drinking you have to begin your fasting however look at the timetable of to know how many hours do Saudis in Saudi Arabia in Mecca fast so let's say it is 15 hours and you started fasting at uh uh 3:00 a.m. so this is uh 3 + 15 18 so at 6:00 in the evening he says at 6:00 in the evening exactly you break your fast even if the sun was in the middle of the sky I was shocked how would someone break his fast asked if there is like five or 6 hours left for Sunset and the Sheik said no problem go ahead and break her fast how can you how dare you give such a fatwa without any foundation and the funny thing is that he attributed this to the European Islamic Council of fatwa whatever I don't know where these guys come from if they are exist and I truly doubt that a scholar would give such a fatwa because you have two scenarios either you have day and night in a day or you don't have day and night in a day so if you go to the South Pole for example and you find that for a few months you can see the sun 24/7 it never sets in this in this case it is either the whole uh month or two or the whole season of daytime or it is the whole season to complete darkness and nighttime if this is the case in the first situation when there is a difference between day and night and you can segregate between the between day and night in this case it is a must for you to fast the daytime even if it was 23 hours and uh 40 40 minutes you have to because Allah does not burden a soul Beyond its ability and would not hold us accountable and order us to do something if we are not able to execute it and this is possible but if the sun doesn't disappear at all for weeks or months in this case the answer would be you should look to the closest country where there is segregation between day and night so for the people in the South Pole if we go a little bit up north and we find a country that has like 21 the the closest country to them is a country that is 21 hours of night and 3 hours of day in this case we tell them whenever it sun uh the sun sets in that country you break your fast and whenever the dawn is there whenever the break of dawn is there in that country you refrain from eating and drinking so you your timing is like their timing but to have the audacity and to come and tell the people for example in Sweden that no after 15 hours you break your fast okay why don't they pray M as well so no you cannot pray sunsets or tou then how can you break their fast if you cannot pray your M what kind of a fat is this why do people speak in things that they're not good at if you are good in uh uh uh preaching preach people don't give FAS if you're good in doing tap then give tap explain Quran to the people but don't give fatwas don't do something that you're not good of or at least don't do something you don't have predecessors you don't have Scholars to back what you say but simply to speak of your own whims and desires like this and this goes viral this goes public to everybody look at the am amount of sins you will be gaining may Allah Asel have mercy on us all so Allah does not hold us accountable to things that we are unable to do but at the same time he would not legislate things that we are not able to do so if you look if you look at zakat Allah tells us to pay 2.5% on whatever wealth that is is possessed and saved and stored for a lunar year if it reaches nisab but if someone doesn't have the nisab if someone does not have the threshold and he says wow I don't have 595 grams of silver I have like 400 then there's no zaka Allah doesn't burden you because this is not within your ability someone doesn't have the means to go for Hajj and he wants to borrow Islam tells him do not borrow he says yes but I want to fulfill this pillar of Islam said okay Allah knows that but at the same time you do not possess the financial means and hence it is m not mandatory upon you Allah would not burden you with something you are not able to bear so Islam came for making life easy for people and that is why the prophet forbade them from do not continue day with Night by fasting without breaking your fast and this is similar to the three that came to the prophet's house sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam asking about his worship so they came to his wives and asked the mothers of the Believers how does the prophet wasam worship Allah so they told him that he does this he does that so the three men Bel the forms of worship that the prophet performs sallallahu alaihi wasallam because they thought that yeah the prophet Allah has forgiven his previous and upcoming sins so why should he go out of his way in offering so much forms of worship he's not like us we're so sinful and we would like to do something to get closer to Allah so one of them said I will pray all night long without sleeping from I'll keep on praying eight hours nine hours no problem the second man said I will Fast every single day not skip a single day and the third one said I will not marry women I will deprive from myself from any uh Halal and legitimate sexual pleasure for the sake of Allah now this came to the prophet Alat wasam and the prophet was angered by it the prophet did not look at their intention because their intention was 100% perfect their intention was to get closer to Allah so what did they do wrong where did they go wrong that's very easy the prophet said why do I hear people say such and such or so and so by Allah I'm the most knowledgeable among you with Allah and I'm the most fearful of Allah but I sleep and pray I fast and I break my fast and I marry women whoever chooses a Sunnah other than mine he is not from me whoa the prophet Alam acknowledged that the fact that the intention was was sincere and for the sake of Allah and that's a plus however this intention is rejected is completely unaccepted as long as you're not following the footsteps of the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam and this is the Cornerstone whenever we talk to the Deviant sects and the innovators we tell them we do not doubt your intentions we do not say that you're Hypocrites or your Liars or your uh uh disbelievers we say that the methodology you're using to get closer to Allah the methodology you're using to justify your intention is wrong and hence Allah would reject thisa may Allah be pleased with her and the Hadith is inah Muslim said that the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam said whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected what do we understand from this whoever innovates meaning that he's not following the prophet's footsteps he is bringing something new to the to the dean and it is in our religion so if someone says sheh you're wearing a watch and the watch is an innovation the prophet did not have a watch I said listen listen carefully and learn the Hadith of the prophet he said whoever innovates in our religion now is it part of my religion to wear a watch definitely not it is part of my religion to have a microphone when calling for the aan so if I don't have a microphone I wouldn't call for the aan no these are means of improving or of developing but it has nothing to do with the religion itself so so even if your intention was pure even if your intention was good as long as it is not following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam as long as it is not following his Sunnah it will be rejected so these three Companions of the Prophet Alam the prophet told them sallallahu alaihi wasallam that you have a problem and this problem of yours would put you and place you in great danger why because you will not become part of me you will not become part of my followers so imagine innovating is equivalent to making a sin like like cheating the prophet said whoever cheats us is not from Among Us now the Hadith has a lot of benefits and and points that we would like to um discuss further more maybe inshallah we uh will delay this until tomorrow we have a short break stay tuned and you can start uh um dialing our numbers and I'll try to answer your questions with the grace of Allah after the break so stay tuned asalam alaykum and welcome back umia from s Arabia hello Alum listen to me from the phone and mute your TV please uh Shake uh my question is um ablution can be done in the washrooms like for uh for example those who are having one room a small houses there is no other option to perform ablution in uh the other places like only washroom is left so they can perform ablution in the place okay any more questions yes one more question is there yes um suppose while performing Salah sometimes uh after finishing one raaka in the second Raa I will sit and pray because when I was pregnant at the end of the months I was sitting and Performing Salah so sometimes I will forget and I will sit and perform Salah so it is acceptable because you are pregnant this is why you sit down yeah I was but now also I forget and I will sit sometimes okay I will answer your question from bahin yes yes a mean what can I do for you hello she I have three questions yes first is many people says that there is no zakat on diamonds okay second question is sh when I'm praying Quran in the after Salat and if there is a s some people says that that you should not do SDA because that is not the right time between and M okay and the third question is Sir since I'm in from India uh in our banks we have saving accounts and the bank after every 3 months or 6 months they credit our account with the interest money and as a Muslim we know that we should not use interest money it is Haram so we give it to the poor and needy people without expecting any AER from Allah is it allowed sir okay I want answer you in from Saudi I have a question uh Sheik every time we go to perform umra my husband uh says that he has to shave his head is this um a Sunnah is he required to do that and secondly uh I'm not sure about this because the other day in your um one of the questions You' answer answer and somebody requested me for some help and he's a non-muslim does that just go as zaka or can I give it as a s okay thank you very much you're welcome mam okay uhia from Saudi Arabia she says that what's the ruling on performing wood in the toilet because in small houses we have only a small place for urinating and defecating for answering the call of nature and this is the only place suitable or available to make woodo so is this permissible and the answer is yes it is totally permissible and this is one of the misconceptions that people have you can have woodo in a place of toilet or in your uh um bathtub or when you're having a shower you can have voodo when you are totally undressed completely new this doesn't affect your uh woodoo at all uh we have moon from the Emirates alikum sir I want to ask a question but um a lady she

pregnant and sometimes she prays the first Rak and the second Rak she continues it sitting down out of forgetfulness so she says is my prayer valid the answer is no your prayer is not valid because obligatory prayers it is a pillar for you to pray standing up so if you forgot a pillar which is standing up this means that your prayer is invalid and the ra is invalid but if it is voluntary prayer this is permissible whether you start it or from the beginning or in the middle um Iman from Jordan hello hello I have two questions yes in the Salah during T when to point our index finger to the and

should not do this and this is completely wrong you can do it 247 any time of the day or night because prostrating for recitation is not a prayer that you are forbidden to do you can do it any time even when the Sun is setting or Rising because this is not uh a prayer FMA from Gambia I would like to ask like my husband did not me M for the of the Ramadan later I still don't want I acable I did not get your answer your husband wants to sleep with you in Ramadan no he did not send mey for Ram then after he s and but after I get I don't want to I ask I okay I I think I think I understood your question that he wants to sleep with you after while fasting yeah while fasting I don't want to speak because I'm not happy of what he has done to me I will I will I will answer your question inshallah Amar from Saudi yeah alikum yeah um I have uh like three questions yes the first one is abouta uh you know like what is the right way for EA for women um can they do it from home or do they have to go to the MOs um I don't know okay and two uh you know about these uh vas like um you um um the shiks tell you to um um read certain verses or AAS this number of times um like to cure illness or for some AA or something like there is a famous One Manzel very popular in um the subcontinent um is it is it the right way to do that okay and the third one is I want to know about the best of the asars you know the best um okay ascar to say at any time of the day thank you you're welcome is from Kenya yeah I have like one question I want to ask yes yeah for example to say in the month of Ramadan someone Mak Z after all the Ramadan is gone or okay I will answer your question okay thank you you're welcome okay we will stop taking questions inshallah uh until we finish what we have at hand I means uh third question from uh bahin he says that we have a saving account in our banks in India and they force us to take and they give us without us asking um interest so is it permissible for us to take this interest money and give it in means of Charity without wanting to get closer to Allah but rather just simply to cleanse our money the answer is yes if there's no other alternative if there is no other alternative for you yes you may do that but if the bank gives you an alternative it tells you this is a current account no s no interest zero interest and this is a saving account with 3% to 7% interest which one would you like and you choose this one no you are dealing with riba you have to take the one that does not offer any interest but if there is if the bank does not offer it and the country itself does not offer it they say yes whether you like it or not we're going to give you interest in this case this is the right thing for you uh to do and also I would see no problem whatsoever if this is the case in India and there isn't any s such a thing as current account so whatever you deposit they have to give you uh uh interest I see no problem none whatsoever to take the interest money and give it as your taxations which the the the the government takes from you give it to the taxation because taxation is Haram to begin with but I'm forced to pay it so I have to pay it if I can dodge it by taking the Haram money which they're giving without me asking them or wanting it and taking it and giving it to the money they have to take from me without me approving of it then tou it's Halal inshallah uh omsar says that her husband whenever he goes for om he shaves his head is this Sunnah the answer is definitely the prophet saysat wasam to men may Allah have mercy on those who shave their heads so the companion said what about those who cut short the prophet said may Allah have mercy on those who shave their heads again and they said again what about those who cut short their hair the prophet said may Allah have mercy on those who shave their heads and those who cut short their head so it's three times better than cutting short your hair and this is part of the Sunnah that the prophet continued to do sallallahu alaihi wasallam she says that what's the ruling on giving zakat to someone who's in need but he's not a Muslim this is not permissible zakat only to be given to Muslim except in the category of their those who are their hearts are inclined to Islam but the poor and needy they have to be Muslim moon from the amra says that a friend of hers started to fast on Monday which is a day after the Emirates in Saudi Arabia we started on Sunday and she's coming within the few days to the Emirates so most likely we will celebrate Eid before the people in Pakistan which means that she would miss a day or two so what's the ruling on her fasting she has to calculate beginning fasting in Pakistan while she's in Pakistan is the right thing to do celebrating Eid with the people in in Dubai when she's in Dubai is the right thing to do now we have to measure how many days did she fast actually herself individually if she said I fasted 28 days or 27 days you have two days to make up if she said I fasted 29 days or more then your whole month is correct and you don't have to do anything alhamdulillah ibraim from Gambia is saying what is the ruling on toothpaste the using toothpaste while fasting that this is permissible there's no problem in uh brushing your teeth using toothpaste providing that you make sure you don't don't swallow anything while doing this IM from Jordan says now when we sit for T you know what T is tah is the sitting position after the two units of prayer is over or third unit in M or fourth unit in the prayers that have four ra so we say say it to the end when do I point my index finger the scholars have different opinions the most authentic opinion is that depends on the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet whenever he sat for T he used to point his index finger and he used to shake it or move it supplicating to to Allah invoking Allah with it so he used to do this he did not do it once and that is it or some schools of thought say do it twice and other schools of thought say no point it without moving it and this has also a Hadith which is narrated by abdah Zu that the prophet used to point his finger not move it moving it but's Hadith is more authentic and and stronger the scholars say so this is what you should do from the minute you sit till the minute you conclude your prayer or you stand up for the third ra you point your finger you move it in its place not up and down just move it uh shake it in its place and the prophet told us that this is harder on Shan than hot metal or as the prophet said sallallah uh om man says what's the ruling on giving Salam to the deceased when he is dead and kissing the deceased there's no problem in kissing the decease if he your Mah or the same gender Abu Bak may Allah be pleased with him when he came after the prophet died and he was covered with his uh uh piece of cloth he uncovered him and he said and he greeted him and he kissed him between his eyes so this is inshallah permissible and we always give Salam to the dead when we enter the graveyards and this is for men not for women and we say to the rest of the Dua um I can barely read my handwriting I think it's beta from Gambia uh she says that binta or something like that she uh a person who lost or missed F prayer when should he pray it well the prophet Alam is the one who answered you he said whoever pray whoever forgets a prayer or oversleeps it he should pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation for it other than that which means that if you overslept over fer and you woke up at 9:00 the first thing you do after opening your eyes make W and pray your F prayer Alia from Saudi Arabia uh she asks about the Ayah in Surah Al bakar verse 145 Allah says and do not say to those who are killed in the way of Allah that they are dead they are alive even though you have no knowledge of their life this is in reference to the martyrs those who are martyred in the cause of Allah asael they are alive because when we say that someone is dead this mean that his life is over the martyrs are not dead they are alive their souls are at the lungs of green birds hanging at lanters in the Trees of Jenna their bodies are on earth underground but their souls are in Jenna commuting between the grave and the Jenna and the different places this is the grace of Allah and this shows you the beauty and honor that those who are martyred at the side of Allah those who are marted in Jihad receive from Allah um again I have no idea a yes A's question he says that if a person cannot bow or prostrate and he walks to the Masjid when is he entitled to sit down first of all a you have to know that standing up in F prayer is a pillar when you're able to do this so people who come and walk and are able to stand up in prayer they must stand up if they begin their prayer or if they sit within their prayer while they are able to stand and they rather sit the prayer is invalid in F prayer in Sunnah prayer you can sit throughout the whole prayer so they should pray standing up when they cannot bow they may sit down when they cannot prostrate they may prostrate while sitting down but when the second raaka is due they have to stand up and uh if they're able and continue their prayer standing up Samar from Saudi Arabia says that thear that we read before going to bed while we're in bed and then all of a sudden someone wants to go to the bathroom someone wants to go and have a drink and get back to his uh uh bed does he say it again the answer is no he doesn't have to say it again what about uh saying thear after going to bed after fer prayer you've already said it in the evening so this does the job for you inshallah if you want to say it again alhamdulillah T from Nigeria says what is uh uh the ruling on Magic someone who has a black black magic on him or a spell how can he treat that you have to do R you have to believe that no one can save you no one can cure you from what you're suffering from except Allah not me not XY Z from the sheh not this not this no one can cure you except Allah so if you have total dependence Reliance and Trust in Allah you do your on your own you drink a lot of zamzam you wash yourself with the water that you've recited the suras of Rya on with the grace of Allah you will be cured F from Gambia she says her husband if I understood her question wants to sleep with her while fasting during the month of Ramadan and she refrains and she's doing the right thing it is a major sin and if she allows him to do that then he and her they have to give the major experation which is to fast two consecutive months without a break 60 days in one go as an experation for such a Sinar from Saudi Arabia she says that what's the ruling on women offering that is seclusion in their homes and this is not permissible can only be done in the Masjid and the prophet Alam and his wife uh did it in the Masjid she says that what is the ruling on wasifa is an innovated thing that the uh uh people have in Pakistan in India in Sri Lanka in Bangladesh elsewhere they go to uh this Shaman or to this pier and they say that we have a problem I'm not being able to get decent proposals so they tell them to recite a number of verses or suras or uh invocations like two 45 times and do it after and and they call thisif and this is all fabrication and total uh uh Innovation you should not do this or believe in it she says what's the best of invocations orar to be done refer to Muslim or or for or the book ofar for IMI they have lots and lots of things that you can refer to is from Kenya says uh a person who commits Zena who fornicates not during the daytime of Ramadan but after breaking his fast so does this void his Ramadan the answer is no his fasting is accepted and this is a separate thing but definitely the essence of Ramadan is lost because this guy thinks that Allah exists only in Ramadan when I'm fasting after I break my fast I can do whatever I want and this shows you how uh um ignorant he is Allah is there Allah is watching over you Allah is listening to whatever you're doing or saying so how can you be so neglectful and committing such a major sin in the sacred month of Ramadan after fasting for 15 or 16 hours for the sake of Allah this definitely shows that such a person is ignorant and he does not know Allah and he's not aware of Allah watching over him this is all the time we have until we meet you same time an hour from now tomorrow I leave you while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first time our we here tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do I feel how ni it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
