  "transcript": "[Music] ald sh and for it was reported inl that Hisham may Allah have mercy on him asked mother AA may Allah be be pleased with her he said oh mother of the Believers tell me about the character of the Prophet sallallah alai wasam what was his character she said don't you read the Quran he said yes I do then she replied to him by saying the character of the prophet was the Quran now if we look all nations before us all Messengers before our Prophet were given a miracle or a set of Miracles go to the Christians go to the Jews go to any other umah and ask them we as Muslims believe in the Miracles of prophet Musa Prophet Isa but show them to us no one can show The Miracles of their prophets to you today because it is not existing only the prophet Muhammad wasam can and will maintain and preserve and have this miracle that will stay till the end of time this is the Quran that Allah has challenged the whole universe to produce something like it and they will never be able to do this this is the only scripture that is preserved for the past 15 centuries not a single letter changed this is the only scripture that was revealed in the language of the Arabic which is spoken by more than 400 million people till date and they understand it when they read it this is the only scripture that is memorized by Heart by more than 10 15 20 million individuals living among us today this is the miracle of Allah and this miracle has has impacted our Prophet profoundly and positively to the extent that it changed his character and formed it the character of the Prophet was the Quran as mother said may Allah have mercy on his soul says explain explaining this phrase to have the character of the Quran is to understand it to believe in it to implement it in your daily life to abide by its instructions and to contemplate about or upon its stories this is how you become a person with the Quran as his character and if you look at the character of the Prophet you will find that he's the best man ever to walk the earth Sall wasam he was the most courageous the most generous the most chased his perseverance and patience and tolerance was UN un matched he sallallah alai wasallam never touched the hand of a woman that was not Halal to him through marriage or that was nah said oh prophet of Allah give us your hand so that we give you the Pledge of Allegiance he says I do not touch women this is the character of the Quran he was the most generous the din and the Durham would not spend a night in his house he would spend it in the cause of Allah Asel trusting that he's the provider trusting that he's the most generous subhanahu wa ta'ala every year the prophet would only store the provision of his family for a whole year and that would be only from barley and dates no cash this is the provision the food of his family for a whole year and everything else is given for the sake of Allah even this food that is saved for his family for a whole year when someone comes and asks him he would never ever say no he was known to never reject anyone who asks him even if they ask him for his own own cloak clothes he would go change and bring it to the man who asked him though he was in need and this caused the prophet Alat wasam to spend all what he has saved for food for his family and then he would have nothing mother AA says we used to see the Crescent after the Crescent after the Crescent two months 60 days and we would not light fire in the house of the Prophet wasam to cook no food no cooking her nephew says mother two months without cooking what was feeding you she says water and dates that's it for two months sallallah alaihi wasallam he was so humble and modest he himself self used to fix his shoes patch his th if it's torn he would milk his own sheep and he would serve his own family he would not feel arrogant to do these Shores he himself was so bashful and modest he would not stare in the eyes of those talking to him he would always look somewhere else he could not look them in the eyes because of his bashfulness whenever he was invited he would not ask who's inviting me a millionaire a politician no he would answer the invitation even if it was from a slave he would accept any gift regardless of its value even if it was a drink of milk yet he would reward those who gave him with more more than they had given he would never eat charity because he's from Al let alone ask people for what they have in their hands and they look like we do at people's watches at people pens at people's cars the prophet wasam was never like that he would be angry only for the sake of Allah when the limits of Allah are invaded he would never become angry for himself if someone abuses him insults him he would forgive and tolerate he would execute the truth if it's needs to be executed even if it brings harm to himself and to his companions the truth has to be implemented the prophet wasam suffered through his lifetime though he could have lived like a billionaire he used to be suffering all the time because he used to spend in the cause of Allah so many days would go by him starving feeling hungry until he would patch a stone to his stomach to curb the feelings of hunger s and mother Aisha says he had never had his full of barley bread not wheat barley for three consecutive days if he was full for one day he would go two three four days not being full of barley bread that today we do not even dare to consume he would answer invitations for wias he was he would visit people who were sick he would follow funerals of those who died he would walk alone among the people among his enemies without any guards or protection the prophet was the most humble he was the calmest without arrogance he was the most eloquent without prolonging his speech he would wear whatever he finds sometimes he walks barefooted sometimes he wears sandals or shoes and sometimes he would not wear a cloak the outer garment sometimes he would not wear a turban he would ride whatever was there no arrogance no Pride sometimes wears a horse sometimes wears sometimes he rides a horse sometime he rides a camel sometimes a donkey sometimes a mule sometimes walks if needed and whenever someone needed a ride he would put him behind him on his ride he used to love perfume from this duny he loves beautiful fragrances and he hates bad smell and this is why he would not eat garlic or onions not because it's Haram no but he doesn't like any bad odor to come from him he would sit with the poor eat with the needy and would honor those with the best of character he would connect to his nextkin his relatives without favoring them upon others because this is unfair he would accept anyone giving him apology look how we treat when people come and apologize to us sometimes we don't accept their apology sometimes we want to harm them and torture them the prophet would accept anyone who came and apologized Sall wasam he would smile without laughing out loud he would joke without telling a lie and he would see people play and he would not forbid them from playing sometimes he used to raise his wife look at the modesty and the humbleness his own wife sometimes we treat our wives like slaves do this don't do that and sometimes we forbid them from laughing or joking or having a good time the prophet s. wasam used to race with his wife and he would never ever let a moment go of his day without utilizing it in the pleasure of Allah he would not look look down upon someone who's poor because of his poverty he would not not look down at someone of who is sick because of his illness and he would not be intimidated or afraid of someone due to his Reign and power and authority even if he was a king once an Arab Nomad startled him while he was walking with an us pulled him from his cloak until it made a mark on his shoulder and neck abusing the prophet saying yeah Muhammad give me from the money you have it's not your money it's Allah's money what would you do I would have killed that man seriously but the prophet he smiled and ordered his companions to give him money end of story not this is not appropriate yeah this is not light I'm the messenger you should respect nothing once in T he was overlooking a valley of sheep that they've won from the enemy and next to him was a nomad nobody no one someone he's not even mentioned by name he was next to him standing and the man had his jaw dropping all of these sheep you know the Arabs they look and they calculate okay this is 200 Rings this is how much okay how much would I be owning if I had this so the prophet looked at himam he said you like this the man said yes the prophet said it's yours come on what kind of generosity is this from a man who cannot eat who does not have enough food to give all of this to a man he does not know the Man rushed to his tribe saying Oh My Tribe oh my people accept and embrace Islam wall I came from a man who does not fear poverty who does not fear poverty he gave me all of this what are you waiting for the prophet forgave those who were who wronged him a man kills his own Uncle Hamza and he forgives him a man who kills and attacks his companions he forgave all the people of Mecca when he Conquest Mecca and say go you are free for the sake of Allah the prophet wasam was so tolerant even when his own wives caused him trouble trouble they were jealous and they would do so many things that normal men like us could not tolerate the prophet would never reprimand them shout at them or say anything that would be offensive he would only meet them with compassion mercy and love never ever he had beaten a woman or a child sallallah alaih wasallam he was never rude he was never using bad or obscene words he was proud without arrogance he was kind without violence he was merciful without weakness s alhamdulillah what is our problem today why are we at the bottom of the food ladder why all nations look down upon us we have no respect why all the nations look down upon Muslims and do not listen to them we brought this upon ourselves when we made the Quran behind us and we took everything else other than the Quran in the past Nations like Malaysia Indonesia the Philippines and the likes Nations accepted Islam not by a single soldier coming to their land not a single Army why did this these people accept Islam because of the Muslims character when they met and encountered real Muslims Merchants traders who came and they saw their Islamic eates and moral conduct they loved this religion they embraced it and look at them they are the largest nations nowadays alhamdulillah they saw truth they saw honesty they saw their commitment to their religion what what about today look at the character of Muslims today backbiting slandering gossiping lies cheating betrayals rarely you will find someone among the Muslims who you could pimp out and say mashallah he's honest he's trustworthy he doesn't lie he comes on time rarely you will find this and this is why the Baraka the blessings in our times in our children in our health in our wealth is gone you look at the previous Nations before us the P previous ancestors of ours they used to utilize the day and night where we cannot do what they used to do in one day in a whole month the Baraka in the Baraka in Quran the Baraka in their lives we don't have this today we have transgression Among Us Muslims this is something that Allah prohibited upon himself and he made it prohibited among us today we hear complaints from Partners from one another we hear complaints from subordinates and workers we hear complaints from wives complaining of the transgression and the husbands do to them on the contrary we also hear about the lack of jealousy in men's Hearts you see a man 6'4 not in this country maybe but you see man mallah muscular and strong and and this and that and you see his wife unveiled with her hair coming out wearing makeup and un modest clothes where is your manhood where is your jealousy where is your they abide by the hijab only for the sake of customs and traditions and not for the sake of Allah as for our hearts it is black it is hard our hearts are filled with enmity grudges Envy evil eye every bad bad thing is filling our hearts and you see this in the Masjid when the comes look at the worshippers in the first and second and third row if anyone comes in an opening what they will do resentment hatred fighting trying not to give him room you're in the Masid this is the house of Allah your heart should have a place for your brother let alone a small space between you and him all of this is a sign of Destruction the people are in complete oblivious they're ignorant because they've abandoned the book of Allah they've abandoned the Quran they do not stand by the instructions they do not refrain from what the Quran prohibits and they do not read it and once they read it they do this for Baraka they put the Quran in the glove compartments and you can see the dust on it why because I don't want to have car accidents they put it under the pillow they put it in the house to Allah protects the this is not why Allah revealed the Quran Allah revealed the Quran to be recited read implemented and to act upon it this is why we read the Quran it does not exceed our throats the Muslims are oblivious and ignorant about the Sunnah of the Prophet though they claim that they love him they defend him and his reputation and we are in great danger therefore fear Allah Servants of Allah read the Quran recite it day and night learn what's in it so that you would implement it do not read it to find an answer to a question you want so many times we read the Quran if the answer does not fit what we want we leave it aside and do what weever we want no a true Muslim reads the Quran does exactly what it says even if it goes against his whims and desires teach your own children your spouses about the beauty of the Quran so that their character would be exactly like the character of the Prophet exactly as was stated in the Quran because this character would lead you inshallah to this is walli more important than their studies wall more important than their own health and wealth this is the way of Salvation and to reach and the prophet said sallallah alaih wasallam the closest among you to me in J on the day of judgment are the best of you who have the best of character I will say my Dua in Arabic so you just say I mean trust me for that huh Allah Allah m"
