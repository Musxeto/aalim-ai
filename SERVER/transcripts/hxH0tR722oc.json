  "title": "Fairness & Justice with the Wife (2nd half Q & A) Edmonton Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have four main lectures in Canada and it's all about Justice in Islam I did the first one in Toronto and now I'm out of ideas so yeah bear with me I don't know if you're going to sleep halfway I think the brothers won't sleep because this is something that may offend them a little bit and when we speak about Justice generally people speak generically justice justice and we want this we want that mashallah very powerful very strong but in essence we need to have Justice in our own selves to begin [Music] with the one who does not possess cannot give so if you don't have Justice in yourself you cannot transmit and give and Cascade Justice elsewhere therefore I thought of focusing within house in ourselves for example Allah says in the Quran and of his signs is that he created for you from yourselves mates that you may find Tranquility in them and he placed between you affection and mercy indeed in that are signs for people who give thought the therefore the most people in need of Justice are those who we live with and a man must be just with his wife and as we see today there is great Injustice in the way how men generally speaking deal with their wives and the opposite is quite true but the time is not sufficient for me to talk the other way around so consider this to be round number one a man has to be just with his wife by giving her her rights and by being loving and caring and kind while doing so and her rights usually refer to what providing for her housing her rights of dividing the time if she has other co-wives and to live with her with decency and kindness there are two stories in theah and both of them are interl one story very famous you all know about it when Salman Al fari may Allah be pleased with him visited his brother Abu D they were not siblings but in the beginning of Islam when the migrants came to Medina as a form of solidarity the prophet made each one of the migrants a brother and a sibling to one of the ansar the people or inhabitants of Medina so this way they would share with them whatever they had even to the extent that if one of them died his so-called brother would inherit him so Salman Pharisee was made a brother to Abu d one day he visited his brother Abu D and heard the complaints of his wife that Abu D is almost becoming a monk fasting all day long and praying all night long so he has no time for Hanky Panky in inoc innocence so Abu Salman waited until Abu D came he greeted his brother he invited him to eat Salman said you go ahead and eat as well Abu D said I'm fasting he said no you break your fast and eat so he broke his fast and ate they prayed Isa Abu D wanted to start praying Isa night prayer from 9:00 until fer this is every night routine AB Salman said to him sleep said I want to pray he said not now sleep so he slept an hour or so then he woke up again said sleep not now not now not now number of times until it was like half an hour or an hour before F Salman told him okay let's pray now afterwards Salman said to him you your lord has a right over you your soul has a right over you and your wife has a right over you so give each one his due right so Abu D went for f told the prophet what Salman said the prophet said Salman told you the truth in an exact similar incident there was another companion by the name of Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father who was a newly wed his father one of the smartest men of Arabia couple of weeks later came to visit his daughter-in-law so he asked how is my son with you she said mashallah he's the best of men fast all day praise all night am immediately clicked and understood the message the woman did not complain but he understood that he's not doing his duties as a husband and as a man because he's consumed in worshiping Allah Asel so he complained to the prophet about his son's Behavior and the prophet Alam summoned him in so he came and he asked him then the prophet said exactly almost the exact same thing he said to himd your body has a right over you your eyes have a right over you your wife has a right over you and your visitors have a right over you so give each its due right this is what is known as the golden rule of happiness in life and this is sumon this is summarized in being balanced and if a person balances his time and efforts in such a fashion he would be fair to his own health to his own family to his own social activities and to his financial well-being because he's Distributing everything at the right time but this is not our topic our topic how to be fair and just with your wife now everywhere you read in the Quran and in the Sunnah the same rhetoric the prophet is telling us Allah before that is telling us commanding us to be kind and to live with our spouse in a decent manner most men and and women think that marriage is all about rights and responsibilities 1+ 1 equals to it is like an auditor whenever a dispute happens what did I do and what did you do and they start to check and balance and this is not correct when you have to live with your wife in kindness and and a decent fashion and honorable way it means that you love for her what you love for yourself so don't start pointing the finger and say you should have done this you should have done that rather look if your sister or daughter were to be treated in the same fashion how would you feel if you were a wife and your husband was treating you in the same fashion how would you feel we tend never to think in this way and this is one of the treats and characteristics of a True Believer the prophet saidat IM is 60 plus branches which means that if you do not fulfill and complete these branches you'll never be classified is a full-fledged mmin rather You' be Muslim or mmin that is not that perfect so you have to fulfill these 63 Plus or 60 plus branches or 70 plus branches as in another narration one of them is to love for others what you love for yourself and we never think of this we're so selfish we we so concentrated on what matters to us and the hell with everybody else whether it's in our jobs whether it's in our own homes the siblings among themselves I'm not going to do this they should do that I never think of what your country should do to you but what are you going to do for your country what Uncle Sam says this is what we should behave or how we should behave so marriage is not an equation that is fixed it's filled with many many other things that may not be tangible it is not restricted only to food I married you I'm feeding you you have a roof on your head well when she was at her father's house she had a better way of being treated she had more food than what she's having today in your house and she had a better roof and she was treated like a queen so why did you take her from her father's house to treat her like trash this is not Islam Islam tells you to fulfill her rights in addition to being compassionate caring loving show showing her great deal of empathy compliment and encouragement and 99.99% like the Arab elections men do not do this they don't they fail in showing their emotions they fail in praising their wives and complimenting their beauty even if she's as a gorilla as ugly as a gorill no problem say you have beautiful eyes gorillas have beautiful eyes say something that would make her feel good even if you you're you're lying this lying is rewardable Imagine The Prophet Alam did not permit lying except in three cases one lying to your spouse not that you're having poker night and you say listen I have some overtime to do no no no this is not Halal lying this is Haram lying Halal lying is when she comes out trying a new dress in front of you and you say I don't know which one is making the other beautiful you're making the dress beautiful or the dress is making you beautiful wow this gives you a pass for 6 months I've done that I've been there trust me but when you see her trying trying a you dress and see she says honey how do I look and you start laughing for half an hour and can't control yourself I don't know is this your granddaughter's dress you're going to have problems so you have to compliment her praise her give her kind and nice words part of being just and fair with your wife is to fulfill the Covenant that you took when you got married to her is to overlook her shortcomings her flaws her mistakes and not to audit every single mistake she does because life cannot go on like this this is a concept well known in Islam it's called in Arabic and it is to overlook the shortcomings this is strongly cemented and and founded well founded in Islam it's found in the Quran it's found in the Sunnah it's found in the books of everywhere you go and the prophet said this clearly he says no believing man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another seriously speaking we have a problem as individuals I've seen like 70% 80% of men and women cannot let things slip why did you do this why did you do that I have a friend who has a driver back home in Saudi and whenever he asks him to do something he Court Marshals him I told you to bring why did you bring this why did you bring that and he questions every single thing he does and he shouts and his blood pressure goes to the roof and I said why do you do this said he has to learn I said Subhan Allah this is an individual problem I said what is his job description if he could have communicated with you and understood what you said and executed you ex not you excuse my word edit this please terrorist uh executed what you told him to do he should have been an assistant or a secretary not a driver imagine Islam and the beauty of Islam a man came to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah the servant of mine and when the Hadith said says the servant it is referring to a Slave in slavery is something that is well established in Islam this is not the time but I can elaborate on it but no sugar coating it so slavery we have slavery it's in the Quran but there is no religion it's in every religion it's in every nation before us and after us but there is no religion on Earth that tells you if you do this free a slave if you do that free a slave if you uh swear and and make a you break your your oath free a slave if you do so many things ordering you to free all the slaves you have but a man came to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah the servant of mine how many times should I forgive him they make mistakes the prophet did not respond to him so the man repeated the question oh prophet of Allah the servant of Mine He's my slave I can sell him and buy a new one with sunroof and headlights 2024 Edition what how many times should I forgive him a day the prophet saidat 70 times a day a servant making mistakes 70 times a day and you forgive him I ask you by Allah our own spouses wives and and husbands our own children our own colleagues our own own subordinates at work how many times do we forgive them Subhan Allah how many times do you would you like others to forgive your shortcomings and mistakes a gazillion times a day so why don't you reciprocate and do the same because your IM is this much if ever existing so this is how you should deal with your wife in the Quran the prophet once went to ha his wife and told her a secret and told her not to cons to to expose this secret to anyone so she went behind his back and told AA her best friend and the co-wife of the Prophet Alam Allah revealed the Quran and told the prophet everything she said to AA and then Allah revealed this Ayah and remember when the prophet confided to one of his wives a statement and when she informed another of it and Allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored the part he went to haa and said ha I told you not to tell AA so and so but he did not expose everything that Allah told him he just told her a little bit so that he would not embarrass her so that he would not make make her feel ashamed and this is an etiquette where the Prophet s wasallam is teaching us how to live with our wives to look the other way and to ignore these flaws and shortcomings now ignoring the flaws and shortcomings as as the Sala used to say is is your well-being on in in on this Earth Imam ahed said when you have this ability to look the other way and ignore the shortcomings and the flaws this is fully in this D because you will never ever live a happy marriage if you don't look the other way all those who come to me for counseling they have half an hour and I listen to them for 29 minutes and I could not find the problem yet they're bickering you should no no no no no listen when I speak you don't talk I gave you 5 minutes to talk and she's bickering and she he's doing this total disrespect and we haven't even reached the surface of the problem how do they live together in one house if all what they do is pointing the fingers you did this you did this you did this well your mom did this your sister did that and you never stood up for me she he never stood up for me since when 25 years ago his mother said so and so and he never 25 years ago last week I don't remember what I had for lunch and you still they remember they have photographic memory and sometimes it's documented so be careful but life doesn't go on like this some men don't even forget and and I've seen so many of them doing this this is part of being just with your wife to be kind to be compassionate to be merciful to show your praising of her to compliment her to encourage her mashallah the food was excellent though it was horrible I admit it's not fit for human consumption lie yeah lie give it a shot you don't want to her to perfect the food then you become masallah uh The Incredible Hulk eat one two three mercels and just give her Dua because tomorrow when you go shopping for the groceries the first thing she you come she says as usual you forgot the eggs and the milk huh you never pay attention honey I brought 50 items yeah but you always forget the milk and the the eggs and she makes a problem out of it if you guys can't have chemistry if you can't Tango together you got to do it solo and this is not good if you are unable to reach that level of being a good kind loving caring husband the least you could do is to stop your abuse stop hurting her so don't be too kind but don't hurt her how the prophet was asked oh prophet of Allah what are my wives rights over us what are our wives rights over us what are their rights the prophet said Alam and listen he said that you should feed her when you feed yourself you don't go for a rabbi steak well done like uh three 4 lbs and you give her uh chips no you you eat she eats with you and this is what men do usually they would feed their why in in Arabia we have a different uh tactics not because we ask for it our wives do it willingly and deliberately when we are eating the men eat first and they the wives take the leftovers this is our customs we as men we tend to put plates uh of food clean food what is this oh this is for my wife and this shows how you care for your wife before you eat you make her eat but this is one in a million because and and women do it because they love their men they respect their men they want to honor their men in front of the guests so you if you feed you feed your wife from what you eat and then he said clothe her when you clothe yourselves so you don't go and buy fancy clothes and you let her uh um stranded without buying her except once every year maybe one or two dresses and and that's it then the prophet says Alam and you should not hit her on the face because this is totally Haram hitting women and men on the face is Haram and you should not curse her by saying may Allah make your face ugly and this is not funny because lots of the men criticize how women look and this is worse than a stab in the heart never criticize how your wife looks ever always compliment her always say good things about her always make her feel good lots of the men well you don't see yourself you've become Subhan Allah short and fat you're like an economy pack what is this this is not what I got married to look at you why don't you hit the gym why don't you do this why didn't you do that try to eat a little bit less why don't you do something with your hair oh I want you to dye your hair blonde this kills women if you go and say I want you to dye your hair blonde this kills her what does it mean you want something else rather never say anything like that and before you criticize your wife take a good look in the mirror some of the men can't even see their toes while standing some of the men don't even smell their mouth when they say they they don't they they're astonished every time I pray in the congregation the man next to me goes like this why because you smell when was the last time you took a shower this is problem they think that this is okay no it's not okay AB may Allah be pleased with him used to take good care of his hygiene and how he looks and when his students said come on this is too much you're always you know taking care of the way you look and you're you're being so neat and H what is this he said well as I like my wife to look good for me I like to look good for my wife This is how we roll This is how Muslims should behave and the prophet saidat wasam and you should not forsake her except in the house that means in the bed not leave the house and go to your mom for a couple of weeks not attending her and your children like so PE so many people do among the Injustice that we have obviously among the spouses something that's prevailing in the subcontinent India Pakistan and Bangladesh when they force their wives to live in a joint family this is Haram who wo sh this is an overstatement Haram we we're more than like 100 and 200 300 million Muslims and we're doing Haram yes it's Haram this is in the encyclopedia published by Kuwait which is a very renowned source of knowledge they say that it is not permissible for a man to have his wife living with his parents in one premises in one house this is not permissible likewise it's not permissible for him to force his wife to live with a co-wife in the same house and she has all the right right to refrain from sitting from staying with either one of them that is one of his parents because it is his her right to live in a separate accommodation and this is the opinion of the vast majority of hanafi shaf and H so this is her god-given right now if we were to move into a different level if someone has two wives he has to be fair with both of them in terms of expenditure in terms of Housing and in terms of splitting his time between them if he's unable it is Haram for him to get married and a lot of the men who get married are doing Haram to the second wife they're doing Haram they're unable to provide for the first family yet they take a second wife and they force the first wife to pay the bills or to chip in the uh expenses or the rent and all of this is Haram Allah says in the Quran but if you are afraid you will fail to maintain Justice then content yourselves with one or those Bond women in your possession this way you are less likely to commit Injustice and this is related to financial expenditure things that you can be fair in such as splitting one night here one night there but things that you cannot be fair in because it's not within your reach and grasp Allah forgives this such as you have two wives one of them treats you like a king and the other one treats you like a doormat naturally you're going to love the one who treats you like a doormat right no of course not you're going to love the one who treats you well this is human nature so this inclination in heart is not blames worthy Allah says subhah wa ta'ala and you will never be a able to be equal in feeling between wives even if you should strive to do so so do not incline completely towards one and leave another one hanging so this is something that it's human nature you cannot have this heartfelt inclination equally to both you have to love one more the other but you you must not show it you must not express it no one should know about this at all and coming to polygyny as they call it why would people do this if they are unable to be fair a lot of the guys that come to me wanting to get married said sheh we've been rejected from 10 houses we proposing 10 houses rejected me and this is the first wife said why said I no no she I have a good job I'm goodlook and I'm religious but they keep on rejecting me so this is not logical lots of women want to get married what is it that you're saying said nothing but all what I do is I give them a heads up I say I say in the interview to the woman I'm yeah proposing to listen um I don't want to she you I'm going to marry four and immediately they kicked me out of the house I don't know why I said W this is the least that can be done to you you schmuck are you are you stupid are you out of my out of your mind said she I don't want to cheat people who told you that you would be able to get married to a second wife to begin with maybe she will make you happy and satisfied that you would never ever think of Maring again why do you put this upfront on the menu how would you feel if she says to you okay no problem you can get married to any one but maybe after the second or third child I may apply for why I just want to pursue my studies I'm just telling I'm giving you heads up would you marry her of course not why do you put negativity up front and to tell tell you the truth why think of a second wife from an early stage lots of the the guys think that marrying a second wife is being a macho she how many wives do you have I have one poor thing poor thing I have two the other guy says two only I have three so what is it car collection sers it is a difficult thing to do to be in a a plural marriage I've done that for 25 years and it caused me hell I was fair w i was fair to the dot but I ended being diabetic high blood pressure high cholesterol and three stance in my heart so yeah it's not an easy thing to do and it's a responsibility you think it's a yeah a a a roller coaster or a a nice uh ride no it's not the prophet saysat Whoever has two wives and leans towards in in favor and he favors one of them over the other he will come on the day of Resurrection with half of his body leaning half of his body tilted everyone in the day of the Resurrection would know that this guy has more than one wife and he's not fair would you be willing to withstand such a a punishment and some of the men when they get married to a second wife they have total Injustice they abandon and neglect their first wife and the children he never goes there he never checks on them he never uh speak some of them is so terrified from either the first or the second wife so if the first wife calls he answers and if he was at the first wife's house and the second wife calls he never answers he's afraid some of them would abandon one of the wives for months Without End ending up spending lots of the time with the boys neglecting his first or second wife some of them are so intimidated and Afraid of the first wife that he does a lot of Injustice are we good well so I have to finish so alhamdulillah Saved by the Bell I have so much things to do and but I have to conclude there's so many things to advise you with out of experience inshallah because this is justice that you need to focus when you have more than one wife you have to be fair and you have to draw the line so that you do do not do Injustice to one over the other otherwise Allah will question you how did the prophet deal with nine wives imagine and they all fought over him and they caused him a lot of problems and trouble and headache how did he deal with that did he favor one just to be safe and lose the headache no he was fair with all of them mother AA says every single day the prophet would drop by all of us and he would come to each one of us houses until the night he is with that person with that wife so all eight he would go Salam alayum how are you alaykum how are you everything is fine chitchat with her and also the prophet saidat ASA uh narrated whenever it was sunrise and after fer after Sunrise the prophet would go to his wife's house one by one giving Salam and making Dua for them and then he settles with the one he is sleeping at her house at that day and and when it's now he would prolong this so he would go to one by one sits for 5 10 minutes Chit Chats how is everything and then goes to the one he is sleeping uh um at her house and finally when he got married to Zab B J may Allah be pleased with her his his cousin after consummating the marriage he went to visit all of his wives the same night after consummating the marriage he went to visit and what did he say he would enter the house give Salam the wife would return the the Salam and wouldn't say how dare you you cheated on me you got married again I hope I wish I do making Dua against him no these were civil people he would give Salam the wife would return the Salam and say how did you find your new wife may Allah put Baraka in your marriage Dua Subhan Allah this is how they lived and coexisted and lived a happy marriage and this is what we should do if we were to have a good marriage an everlasting marriage a marriage that as they say until death does us a part of whatever they say truly with respect with a a high level of communication and with lots of love and compassion and Allah Knows Best thank you so so much for your words um and sharing uh such uh wisdom and hikma with us so we are now opening up um for the next approximately 20 minutes um Q&A with um with the Sheikh so the QR code is up there I already been given some of the questions so um I will ask them to you and um we can go from there so um so the first question is um how to deal with difficult people and what are some ways to practice patience with them too genetic be specific and give example how to deal with difficult people with these that's any you you put such a question I'll give you such an answer be as easy as Sunday morning don't care what they do they make life difficult ignore them when a dog barks at you that's difficult are you going to fall on your hands and knees and bark back you're a human being you're much better than this so when people start to abuse you let them rise to your level don't go to their level and this is the right way of dealing with problems don't you don't have to respond to each and every inquiry why did you do this why did you do that so I did so what are you going to do one of the brothers yesterday asked me why do you have a bodyguard in the Masjid after the the salot I gave a speech and there was a guy standing next to me he's a bodyguard I didn't ask for him they appointed him so the guy says well sh why do you have a bodyguard said I can't afford it and we moved on I don't have to go and explain to him and show him this and that piece of cake a man who was 80 years of age was asked how did you reach this age and you're healthy and you're fit he said anytime someone argued with me I said you're right the guy said this is not possible maybe it's your diet maybe you walk maybe you said the guy said you're right this is how you deal with difficult people move on don't life is too short and sweet to spend by nagging and bickering and debating and trying to prove you're right I'm wrong so what I'm wrong you're satisfied go go give him a cookie and he'll go away um the second question is my father does not pray Salah and when I asked him to come pray with us he always says he'll start tomorrow I know that uh I know that that is I know that the Islam of one who sorry the grammar is a little bit off I know that the Islam of one who questionable and I want to help my dad my entire family is practicing but him what should I or my mother do this is a big problem not with the father with the son let alone the Holy Ghost this is a big problem because lots of such youngsters are so quick to draw the gun and shoot and then ask questions in the sense that they just want to make his father cfir he's almost labeling him as cfir and his mother is cfir my brother did this he's a cafir right why why are you so eager to take people out of the fold of Islam why don't you look at the full half of the glass instead of the empty half of the glass he's not rejecting Salat he's saying inshallah tomorrow and you don't know whether he prays when when you go to the Masjid on his own or he prays in his bedroom or he prays when you're at work or at Uni so assume the best act with him in the best of fashion being diplomatic being dutiful and obedient and respectful give him a sense of feeling that you love him and respect him not that you are talking to him from your Ivory Tower wanting Simon Says to be obeyed wanting to control him like so many of us do this is why people are rejecting you why aren't people accepting my da my family my close friends my relatives they always reject me because you are wanting to control show them that you love them that you're willing to go out of their way to help them and serve them and give them a year without talking to them about Islam and after one year they will come running after you and asking you about Islam and they'll be convinced of whatever you tell them to do because they trust you and believe you but now you just hatch from the egg and now you're telling me to do this and this Isam and this is and this is and you're going to hell and what is this nobody's going to listen to you so do not reinvent the wheel go to the basics call people with your etiquette with your moral conduct with your behavior with your generosity with wanting to go out of your way to serve them not just to be the religious police this is halal this is Haram you're wrong you're this you're that they will never listen to you and Allah knows best the next question is that the person just mentioning that he was in a illicit relationship for a long time um and um now he's changed and he believes that um that the the lady as well has changed so is it okay if I talk to the father and do things the halot way of course fair enough absolutely love um is it haram to cut the beard due to jobs that require you to shave because of safety of your being and if they tell you to wear a thong would you do that of course not see that issue is that we as Muslims are ordered to obey Allah and there's no obedience to human beings in disobeying Allah so I have red lines so what is the limit and what is the job that would require me for safety to sh shave my beard or cut it short come on you're working in with machines you can put a face mask or put something that would restrain it from going to that machine you're an uh um Air Force pilot the face mask can fit without any problem you are a surgeon again this has nothing to do with what you're doing because you have hair in the different places so this is too much when people make an issue out of a no issue I have my religion to observe and to protect because if you don't draw the line sisters you're obliged to take your hijab off okay the is too long don't wear okay the dress is too long wear pants and what is this we're not going to work as Hooters we are here to serve and work a job that pays Halal and and i' rather seek Allah's provision in halal anywhere else rather than in a place that would compromise mise my religious practice and Allah knows best um the next question is what should I do if the Mah is an absurd amount that I cannot afford she's not the last woman on Earth you can get four with the same price yeah some people are so fixated on oh they ask for this much Mahar ditch her and go somewhere else Subhan Allah she she's not Miss Universe She is not uh MMA champion she is not filthy wealthy wealthy so why would I pay so much Mahar no the prophet said the best blessed in marriage are the least in Mah so be yeah moderate don't go and pay her Penny as Penny appeal no give her something that is normal and adequate $1,000 $5,000 this is the norm how much is the m here if it's cheap maybe you know if you push me too far I just might I don't know these days big money chicken anyhow um yeah I think it's $5,000 maybe would be appropriate $10,000 Max but I know people asking for a million of course not now so that they would restrain him from divorcing well when he wants to divorce he will divorce he will go let her unattended for 6 seven years until she files for and writes it off and this is not fair be logical you're not selling and buying it's not a transaction it's a long life uh uh um relationship so be moderate and again if someone asks for something that is Sky High she's not the last woman on earth the next question is I think this is more in reference of um you know food delivery people U eat so and so forth so they're asking are are you allowed to deliver food of which you do not know whether is halal or not yes perfect um no yeah you don't want me to waste time okay so if someone says oh you have to check and open the parcel you have a parcel they're going to sue you and sue your company the norm is it is halal until proven otherwise because otherwise you can't work in the mail delivery you can not work for Amazon parcel delivery maybe there's something Haram maybe this maybe that and it goes on with maybe that you won't be able to function you have to go with the flow until it is proven otherwise otherwise you're going to make life hell for you was it open before no okay I didn't hear a tick I'm very careful assassinations and you know I have a bodyguard maybe my My Bodyguard would taste it first me and see if he's okay go ahead okay um the next question she uh I'll just rephrase it it's about um a man is is asking about the difficulty that Society brings if he wants to marry a woman who's 5 or 10 years older and how to deal with the family about that if you're going to take care of what the society say or of of what your parents say you're not man enough don't excuse me any I know this is offending a lot of you if you're not a man to marry don't you have to take your own decisions I'm still sucking my thumb I have to ask my mom can I marry this woman or no be a man if she checks sold the boxes even if she's 5 10 years older than you so what she's immature she's she glavy she is um this is a new word I just made now um she is mallah religious she is a good Chara has good character she would be a perfect mom and a perfect uh wife for you who cares what the people say at the end of the day I'm the one who's getting married not them so if you're not having this mindset of being a real man don't let your mom marry you to someone she likes I think the next question kind of I guess essentially pivots into into what you just said it was um similar that a brother saying that he wants to marry a convert but his parents are against it and what should he do converts are different some converts don't wear the hijab wear Min skirts uh converts and make with men and celebrate Haram feasts and would probably have no problem in sitting on a table with pork and wine and and and having a good time of course you have to obey your parents because this woman does not check all the boxes a convert that checks all the boxes meaning she is a practicing muslima much more practicing than born Muslim women who don't I'm not pointing at anyone I'm not looking I don't even they don't come at me I'm just saying this so some Muslim women don't even practice half of what she's practicing so definitely go for that revert if she checks all the boxes and she's a good practicing sister um a lot of these are of course marriage oriented CH so this is from a university student um at uh at University he wants to get married how how should he approach a sister for marriage um especially because he doesn't want to get arranged marriage you don't this is called dating you don't approach a sister directly ever you don't go to a sister in the college alikum I like your hijab wow where did you get this your shoes are from Brother mashallah you it looks nice no you don't ever communicate with the opposite gender ever you're interested in one go get your mom go get your sister to talk to her take her number visit her at her home check her out ask around checks all the boxes then you go and talk to her father but it's not appropriate at all for a woman to go and approach a man excuse me brother are you married mashallah or a man approaching a sister sister masallah I like your hijab can I am interested in marrying you would you mind giving me your number this is totally not permissible um the next question is my husband does not validate my emotions he gives me the silent treatment when I voice my frustration how do I deal with this book a counseling session now seriously this is a big problem lots of the men are not real men they're male but not men to be a real man you have to know how to treat a woman and I'm talking about communication respect how you like others to treat your sister and your daughter and always put this scenario at the back of your head would I like my son-in-law to raise his voice like I'm doing with my wife with my daughter of course not so always be careful of what you do what goes around comes around you're going to treat your wife in a bad way someone's going to treat your daughter or your sister in even a worse way so but again this really requires counseling when a woman comes and complains to me I wouldn't judge for her because she's concealing 90% of the picture I say let me speak to your husband and I speak to the man when I listen to the woman alone I say wo your husband needs to be hanged but when I listened to the man I said wo your wife has to stand in front of a firing squad and when I put them together 70% of all what they said melt like butter Under the Sun not in Edmonton it doesn't melt anything the sun here so be fair you as a wife before complaining from your husband's Behavior take a good look at the mirror why is he doing this you'll find that so many things you do irritates him and they make him resent you you need to change your ways and it takes two to tangle of course with Nashid no doof no musical instruments but you cannot expect him to be the best of husbands when you are the worst of wives change your strategy if it is always nagging nagging nagging refrain from nagging and do something else that may make him feel that you've changed and again you need to book a counseling session sh the next question is um how do I deal with how to deal with student loans that have ribba on the conditions that if you can't pay after 6 months there is riba what about the students that need to do a degree and can't afford it without student loans riba is one of the major sins of Islam it's one of the seven the one that uh uh destroys an individual and Allah threaten those who deal with r by Waging War against him and the prophet so now you tell me is the necessity of getting a degree justifiable to have war with Allah and his Prophet definitely not it's best and better for you if you believe in the existence of Allah and the day of judgment that you work as a janitor than to take a riba based loan whether you can pay it or not and at the end of the day how many though graduates did not find jobs who are unemployed and how many people who did not get a degree are millionaires or hard workers or good merchants or have restaurants or have businesses a you go with Allah and Allah will provide for you you depend on your strength on your knowledge on your knowhow Allah will abandon you and nothing will come good your way so there is no compromise or tolerance when it comes with such a major sin and Allah knows best she one of the questions is that there um a husband's asking in reference of the process of that if he wants his marriage to work but the wife is asking for hula how you know what is the remedies to try to stop it and or then I guess what what is the process for it again someone who doesn't want to live with you a wife who hates your guts has extreme resentment to you cannot fulfill your marital rights and she would be in huge uh uh distress when she's with you she's buying her way out she's giving you your your dowy and you said no I'm not going to divorce you I'm not going to give you do you expect her to stay Idol do you expect Islam to say okay if you don't want to divorce or give sorry sis you have to go back of course not this is not Islam you whenever you want I divorce you T one some of the husbands are AK-47 you know Mah 30 shots in in in in 5 seconds divorce divorce divorce divorce divorce divorce he hangs up he texts 20 messages he calls the parents he divorces like crazy but when she wants out and you try to make life difficult and you ref no no you have no right to refuse the Muslim judge or the authorized IM has the right to impose whether you like it or not the next question is uh I've missed a lot of Salah and fasts in previous Ramadan how do I make up for everything that I've missed knowing you cannot make up for missed prayers that were missed intentionally the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave us two excuses to make up prayers one forgetfulness two oversleeping and he said there is no experation for that other than to pray it as soon as you remember it meaning that if you've left Salat and skipped it until the time expired for any other given reason than sleeping or forgetfulness without which is not legitimate then you cannot make it up why because it was made timed Allah timed it it was prescribed at a specific time can anyone pray m 2 minutes before Sunset yes or no would it be accepted even if he was not knowledgeable of the time even it's not accepted because the time was not due likewise if the time was expired you cannot pray this is the the opinion of and thei clearly states it when do we stand inat in ha on the 9th of imagine someone coming to perform Hajj gets restrained at the customs and they delay him for five or six days and on the 14th or 15th of they set him loose so he goes to wearing hisam going to mounta alone so who hey dude what's happening he said I'm going to do my Haj today is the 15th of is on the 9th said I know but they hold held me and I could not perform it on time can he perform it a day later let alone 5 days no you can't because it is prescribed at a specific time so Salat forget about it it's gone the what to do ask Allah for forgiveness repent show remorse and offer voluntary prayers can I do this is in the subcontinent every time they pray F they finish and pray another F what is this it's for like three years ago I did not pray so this is compensating for any fer I did not pray every single day they another another this is an innovation and unacceptable by Allah totally Haram fasting is a different issue if and this is one of two scenarios if I fasted one day and in the middle of the day I felt thirsty looked right and left nobody's looking drank and had some milk and some tuna fish sandwich and nobody knows about it this day I broke I started it right but I broke it I have to make it up even after 10 20 years I have to make it up because it's a debt time is up no we have a couple cuz the microphone went so I thought any okay scenario number two from night tomorrow I'm not going to fast I'm going to skip fasting so I did not initiate the fasting now this day is gone forever I cannot make it up because I did not intend to fast it so the fast you break you have to make up the fast you skip from the very beginning you cannot make it up and Allah knows best and she how about also um women that are nursing or pregnant during subsequent Ramadan um about them as well they calculate the days they missed and eventually after 15 20 years of marriage the conveyor belt will stop so now you're free you can fast you have no obstacles in the past 20 years I was pregnant she Ramadan came okay you have a concession skip it the second Ramadan she I'm suckling okay two Ramadan you will you'll skip skip it so that these are 90 days the fourth year Ramadan I'm pregnant again she good show Energizer Bunny is still working masallah keep up the good work so some sisters 1520 years they keep on skipping Ramadan unwillingly are they sinful definitely not but after 20 years you multiply 20 by 30 this is what 600 days they have to make up what to do sh start making it up sh too much can I pay no you can't pay because alhamdulillah you're fit and healthy but Allah is the most forgiving most merciful if you fast three days of white days every month and every Monday and Thursday you will be fasting 90 days a year almost three months a year so within like maybe four or five years you would have done all that you would had owed alhamdulillah Allah would reward you for your pregnancies and taking care of your children and for your fasting and Allah knows best just I guess the final question here is um the opinion on um cigarettes and vaping uh which has become very prevalent as for tobacco they used to say this is grown from the earth if it's Haram we're burning it if it's Halal we're smoking it of course this is [Music] stupid smoking tobacco or chewing tobacco or vaping or electronic cigarettes as long as the doctors and the Physicians say that it is harmful and dangerous it is Haram Allah said says in the Quran describing Prophet Muhammad anything that is that is disliked and not natural and has a bad thing to it it's Haram in Islam children when you get them some sodas and to drink they would drink it and love it if you give them some candies fresh juice they would love it give them a puff of a cigarette how would they feel of course not like Clinton they would inhale how would they feel they will cough eyes get red maybe vomit and maybe faint this is the norm because it's not natural look Subhan Allah how Shan reverses everything and to make it natural people nowadays who suffered in the beginning when they started smoking Now find great enjoyment in it the best cigarette you can take is after lunch or while drinking Turkish coffee this is W man I I I have the world in my hands and this is how Shan messes up with our heads that this thing that is so disgusting and and and and repelling and and revolting it becomes something of a delicacy to people vaping is Haram because the medical uh um institutions and and and the Physicians say it's Haram Scholars also have fatwas stating that it is Haram and Allah knows best check just and add on to that as well as what about um selling of cigarettes or selling of Vapes for example anything that is Haram selling it and profiting from it is who the prophet says when Allah prohibits something Allah prohibits transacting through it by selling and buying thank you so much everyone our Q&A session is now concluded for your time your wisdom and answering this question so brothers and sisters
