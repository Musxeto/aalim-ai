  "transcript": "am is it permissible to make pictures and videos of women in full face Veil fully covered also the hand and an oversized thig Veil from head to toe shoulders are fully covered and you can see you cannot see the body shape or head shape with all due respect what is the benefit of such videos why won't I bring a sack of potatoes and video that and picture that doesn't make any sense unfortunately women fall under pressure of peer pressure social media pressure and they have this urge in them to be filmed to be photographed or to come in public but their Iman and their hijab and their belief restrains them and prevents them from doing these things so shitan drags their feet little by little and they start to follow the steps of shaan so you find Instagram pages of AI woman nothing you cannot see a thing of her but she's doing this with her ABA and snapshot and she posts it at a sunset or at a jungle or a garden or a forest or uh uh um next to flowers and you get comments wow beautiful dashing astonishing little by little she exposes things that are not permissible wearing tighter abayas maybe letting go of her gloves maybe opening the eye uh um in her uh nikab the eye uh um opening little by little you can see some skin her face her cheeks little by little maybe she com compromise and her face shows up and the story is well known afterwards this is not what a real Muslim woman would fall trapped to don't compromise your religion see how many scholars D religious committed people were how they were 10 years ago and how they are today you get diis and quote unquote Scholars taking pictures with women big smiles next time maybe they'll hug them and they would say this is out of compassion these are the victims of a massacre and I hug this woman though she's not my Maham though and this and that but I feel sorry for her what is this remain steadfast on the dean don't compromise your religion you won't get likes and people won't recognize you just because you posted your picture on full Veil nothing is showing my shoulders are concealed and my body shape is not showing might as well bring a a sack of potatoes and photograph it there's no point of it but this is how shatan Works may Allah protect us all"
