  "transcript": "says in my home most of our curtains are like see-through but not white usually like a blue or natural or neutral color so if I stand in front of it people could most likely see a blurred image of me as a woman should I wear a hijab in front of these windows when moving into its view I was told that because they don't know it's me it's fine but I feel uncomfortable because it is not that blurred out this is up to your preference if you think that you're not recognized they cannot see your body figure recognize your face your hair then there's no problem in that when you wear your full hijab people see you on the streets and they see the same image Those Behind the curtains can see a blurred image of a woman not being able to recognize anything else so I play I pray to Allah that this is fine insha Allah"
