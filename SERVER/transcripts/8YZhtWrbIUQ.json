  "transcript": "says from what I have learned wigs are not permitted to be worn my relative has bought a braided wig for her granddaughter to wear when she's playing she's a girl of four years is it permissible is is this permitted first of all what's the ruling on wearing wigs well there isn't anything in Islam that refers the to wigs per se what is there is the Hadith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him and others where the Prophet Alat wasam cursed a number of women for things that change the nature of a woman and the creation of Allah so the prophet cursed the women and the ones who do this to them the tattoos so Tattooing in Islam is totally prohibited whether it's being implemented on this person or the person doing it and charging for it even if he does it for free or she does it for free they're both cursed the prophet Alam cursed the women who pluck their eyebrows whether by plucking by shaving or by cutting by scissors this is all prohibited those who do it to themselves and those who do it to others both are cursed the prophet Alat cursed those who connect their hair with other hair so if her hair is this long and she braids it with an extension so it looks longer or she puts something underneath her hair to make her hair so thick and and bulky so those who see her would think that she is she has a long hair she is cursed and those the hairdressers are cursed as well and likewise those who put uh fake eyelashes that are so long and and and and and and big again some Scholars consider this to be as connecting uh or attaching uh an extension to the hair and also the prophet Alam and this was applied at the time of the Prophet at the time of the Arabs they used to consider um filming I think it's it's the right verb uh the teeth the front two teeth so that you leave a gap between them so when you smile at the time it was beautiful or maybe it's not now but the issue of filming your teeth and fixing it in a way to look beautiful this is also uh an issue where a person who does this and the dentist who does this are both cursed so is uh uh wearing bracelets uh considered to be part of this well if you're fixing your teeth so that it would look beautiful without any medical need such as it's not impairing your speech and it's not impairing your ability to eat but you just want to have nice teeth it falls under the same category of sin and those who do it are cursed so this is the main topics ofi of abdah may Allah be pleased with him and when a woman came to him and said how do you curse people who are not cursed in the Quran and the Sunnah in the Quran that is because I read it from cover to cover and I didn't find anything in referring to this he said it is in the Quran she said where he said Allah says in the Quran whatever the prophet brings to you as an instruction and order you have to follow and whatever he forbids and tell you and tells you to stay away from you have to refrain then the woman looked again to abdah and said okay this sounds logical okay we have to believe and follow the prophet's instruction but maybe your wife and daughters do this so you're commanding us with things that your own family don't do and he told her this is my house go in and look and come out and tell me so the woman goes in for 5 10 minutes looks around and she meets his wife and his daughters and then she comes back and says by Allah I saw what pleases Allah you're right I haven't seen any sign of these cursed things uh uh with or on your uh wife or your daughters he said by Allah if you had seen anything of what I've warned of and narrated The Hadith of the Prophet Alam they would not have been my family meaning that he would disown them and he would divorce the wife because she's disobedient to the instruction of the Prophet so the scholars looked at these hadiths or this Hadith in particular and said ah if it's not permissible to attach an extension to your braid or to your hair then it's even even worse to wear a wig so wearing wigs is totally prohibited in Islam with the exception if someone loses his hair in an unnatural way so someone who's like 304 may Allah preserve the our dear listeners and and and viewers and me as well with them if someone gets cancer and he goes or under goes chemotherapy and he due to that has a lot of hair loss and he's completely bold or she is completely bold in this case this is a a defect this is something that is not natural that is why it is permissible for him or her to wear a wig and to hide this defect may Allah cure all our Muslim patience and cure all patients of all faiths and restore their health back to them now for your question F what bothers you most I believe that this is a 40-year-old girl so she is not held accountable in the day of judgment so what's strong in her wearing a cap with braids attached to it so anyone who looks at her says mashallah look at these long braids and she looks cute she looks funny she's 4 years old and this is an issue that most parents seem to neglect and they always ask themselves questions if she's not accountable so why should I care well the child is not accountable the parents are in the"
