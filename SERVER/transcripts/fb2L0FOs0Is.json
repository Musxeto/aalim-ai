  "transcript": "rihana says our wedding expenses to be divided by both grooms and bride's family or only by the groom's family my father has no problem in spending half the amount of the walima but the groom's family say that usually nikka expenses are done by the bride's family and they will lima expenses by the groom's family what is your advice share because in the subcontinent we have nikka on the day and the walima the next day first of all the walima is usually done after the marriage has been consummated whether you do it on the same night or the night before it's not a problem you can do it either way you wish the walima in islam is the sole responsibility of the groom and by the way everything related to the marriage financially is the responsibility of the groom so it's the boy who pays the dowry or the ma not the other way around women and their families are prohibited from giving the boy anything as a dowry like in the subcontinent because this is the doing of the Hindus Muslims don't do that women are more honorable to be forced to pay for their marriage we honor women we don't accept this in Islam it's Haram it's prohibited so it's the boy who gives them aha the doubting it's the boy who also pays for the walima now this is Islamic in the sense that I want to get married I propose I give them Mahara I get married and I throw a small party the Prophet Isis and when he saw Abdullah manonoff may Allah be pleased with him and he looked fresh so he said why do you look so fresh he said I just got married he said okay in this case throw our lima even by one sheep so he did not tell him to hire a hole in a fancy expensive hotel rather the minimum would be a sheep and it can be less than that the concept is to gather few Muslims to feast celebrate and eat that's it now people have forced themselves into customs that are not part of Islam like Brianna says that they insist that the walima is to be done by the groom and the wedding party to be done by the girl's family and this is nothing related to Islam yes in most Arab countries in my country they have what is known as Milka and this is the marriage contract the marriage is not consummated only the writing of the marriage contract and they throw a party then we have the wedding night where the marriage would be consummated and the girl would move into her husband's house and this is they claim that the woman has to pay for this but this is not part of Islam this is cultural so as Muslims we cannot burden the girl's family to make a wedding now you as a groom you have to throw the walima is that sure I did that already I had the marriage contract I threw the walima and I invited my relatives and my love one's and from the girl's family we got like five or ten people Shambala it's done yeah but the wedding night the wedding night you want a wedding night your family wants a wedding you throw a wedding you can't ask the girl's family to throw a wedding that would consume five times the mehar the dowry that you had paid be a man and don't ask for something that is not yours so you wanna MA oke no problem you want a a wedding night no problem but if you want to reach an agreement for example most people would say yeah we would like to have a wedding night for our daughter but we would like to have it small and only for like 50 or 40 members of our family and we may invite five or ten from the groom's family now if the groom's family say no we would like to invite more of our people tell you what we'll share the expenses we'll pay half of it we'll pay 30 percent 70% depends on the agreement a mutual agreement between the two families without one being forced to do something he does not want and allah azzawajal knows best you"
