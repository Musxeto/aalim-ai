  "title": "Is it a must to do everything 3 times or in odd numbers? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ambrosian I read that you must do three or in odd numbers is this a required fault or recommended Sunnah if we are eating or drinking and we take an even number of bites or sips is this sinning now the confusion arises among a lot of the Muslims from the hadith of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam where he said in ilaha Whitten Allah is one and loves odd numbers 1 3 5 7 9 etc so all people of the Quran perform whitter which is the odd numbers of night prayers 1 record 3 rock has 5 7 etc so some scholars looked at this hadith and looked at another authentic hadith that the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam whenever he wanted to go to alpha turn three prayers after we finished Ramadan the first day of the following month the day of Shawwal it is prescribed after fajar prayer to go to an open plaza an open area and offer range prayer the Sunnah is that before going from your home you eat dates in odd numbers the Prophet used to eat dates in odd numbers 3 5 7 etc so some scholars and the majority of laymen looked at these 2 hadith and looked at how many things in Islam are in odd numbers power from the Kaaba is seven rounds say between safa and marwah seven rounds the seven skies seven Earth's etc and they thought that this cat is cascaded down to everything to the extent that some even recommended that when breaking the fast in Ramadan that do this on odd numbers of dates and like Roshan asks and what about the number of bytes the most authentic opinion is that this does not cascade so yes it is recommended to eat dates in odd numbers before going to read Salah in after Ramadan it is recommended that you perform Witcher prayer but this does not mean that when I'm eating rice I count in odd numbers so that the last spoon I eat has to be on an odd number this is not from the Sunnah it's more closely to be an innovation because this was not reported likewise sipping the Prophet used to drink water in three sips but if someone wants to add more he's not quenched his thirst yes yet so he may add another 1/4 and stop on me at 2/5 and stop so it's not a must to be in odd numbers and everything you do some say ok we why do we say after Salah subhanAllah 33 alhamdulillah 33 allahu akbar 33 well ok this is part of the things that is recommended to be said in odd numbers because the sunnah came and taught us to say it in odd numbers but also the sunnah came to say in other forms of the curse of Han Allah 10 times alhamdulillah 10 times allahu akbar 10 times and this is also an authentic vicar that is said after the prayer and this is an even number therefore the misconception that a lot of people believe in is not true you do not have to cut everything you do in odd numbers"
