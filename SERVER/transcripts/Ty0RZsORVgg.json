  "transcript": "uh what's the ruling on eating meat and drinking water in an airplane of those Airlines which serve non haral food or alcohol on board um and my question is based upon a previous videos that you said we can't eat or drink in a restaurant where po or alcohol is served if the airlines belong to a Christian predominantly Christian country like UK for example or Europe or uh the U the US Canada Etc then there's no problem in or Ethiopian Airways one of the um highly Rising uh Airways in Africa and I used them a couple of times service is good and they're either Muslim or Christian but predominantly they're Christian country so there's no problem in eating their food inshallah however most if not all Airlines when reserving your ticket and and and buying it if you ask for a Muslim meal they will prepare a Muslim Halal meal for yourself and that would be a win-win and Allah Knows Best"
