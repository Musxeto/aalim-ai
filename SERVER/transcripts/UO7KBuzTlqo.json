  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim 27 Dua Istikhara Seeking Allah's guidance in making a decision Assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign we move on to the following chapter which is about seeking guidance in forming a decision or choosing the proper course etc known as al-istikhara what is al-istihara al-istrihara is to come and seek allah guidance over something you're about to attempt to do so it's unlike what people think that i have two things i would like to choose which one of them so i praised it doesn't work this way you have to make a decision first because the prophet alaihis wasallam said as in the hadith of the prophet would instruct us to pray for guidance in all of our concerns just as he would teach us a surah from the quran how he would say if any of you intends to undertake a matter then let him pray two voluntary units two raka's nephilim of prayer and after which he should supplicate okay what does that mean it means that if i have a choice between buying a blue car or a red car i don't praise tijara i have to do my due diligence go for a blue car for example and make my decision to buy that car and totally ignore and neglect the second option now i'm determined to buy the blue car now i'm determined to marry a particular woman i had three four potential uh choices now i am decided to take that job offer and not the other one alas i've got my mind made up then i have to to do the following pray two raka's voluntary not fart not mandatory something that is voluntary so does a sunnah prayer work yeah it works there's no problem in that then what should i say then i should say the dua okay when would i say the dua sheikh because you've said that ibn tamiya says we have to say the dua before the salaam and the dikkar after says this is dua so should we say it before the salam if you do it before the salaam this is valid however they mean and other scholars they say that the wording of the hadith indicates that you should say it after so this means that it's after the two rakahs are over okay should i raise my hands or not there's no problem in raising your hands it's highly recommended to raise your hands when making dua and this is what say also says so what is the dua abdullah i seek your counsel by your knowledge and by your power i seek strength and i ask you from your immense favor for verily you are able while i'm not and verily you know what i do not and you are the knower of the unseen again attributing all these attributes of perfection to allah azza with his knowledge with his ability with everything oh allah this is what i want if you know this affair and you call and you name it and here he mentions his needs so if you know that buying the blue car or marrying so and so or accepting the offer of a particular company to be good for me in relation to my religion my life and and that means hereafter then decree and facilitate it for me and bless me with it and if you know this affair and you name it again to be ill for me towards my religion my life and end then remove it from me and remove me from it and decree for me what is good wherever it be and make me satisfied with such and this is very important the essence of making this dua is for allah to choose but allah will choose either way you're asking allah to make you content to make you satisfied with whatever choice allah had made for you foreign one who seeks guidance from his creator and consults his fellow uh believers and then remains firm in his resolve does not regret and this quote by the way is one of the rare comments of sheikh saeed the compiler of this booklet in this book usually he just puts verses of the quran and the hadith here he commented he said one who seeks guidance from his creator through of course and consult his fellow believers and this is called istishara and then remains firm in his resolve does not regret for allah has said wash our home allah said and consult them in the affair then when you have taken a decision put your trust in allah so this is what all of this refers to is that we should do our level best to investigate to do our due diligence whether this choice i'm about to attempt to take is the best course of action or not once i do this i do not rely on my strength and intellect and ability rather i pray to raka's expressing my poverty to allah azza raising my hands saying the duas asking allah azza to guide me and then i go ahead with it if there is good in it allah will make it happen if not allah will distract me away from it and allah would choose something better than it for me not only that allah would make me content and satisfied with that alternative this is all the time we have until we meet next time hello [Music]"
