  "transcript": "you have to understand extracting Anger from its root is impossible because if a person has no anger he's not a human being but what Islam orders you to do is to control it to put a nozzle on it so that it can be harness and it can be driven in the right way how do we harness it by knowing the consequences of your anger what it would drive you to by accompanying people of righteousness of Dean when you accompany imams righteous people students of knowledge and see how they react you become calm and tame when you see how the prophet used to behave in places that my horns grow what if I were in his shoes but the prophet did not behave in such a bad manner or a rude manner rather he was kind and tolerant and forgiving this how you perfect your own self and this is how you coach yourself to the best the prophet saidat when a person is angry what to do if he's standing up he should sit that down and if he's sitting down and you cannot suppress your anger lie down and if you feel the urge to do something go and make W because Wu is water and anger is from Shan who's from fire and this extinguishes your anger when you're angry Satan messes up with your head don't we have road range I don't know if you Canada you have this one in America they just pull their block and they shoot people they s you don't do this you just you know push them with the car over the pay and then I'm sorry sorry okay we move on but shooting people it's crazy people and I get this all the time and this is how I make my money people com and knocking on my door at midnight that sh sh I'm sorry what's wrong I divorced my wife what's for you what do you want no she I'd like to go back to her okay go back to her no you don't understand I was Ang and I divorced it 19 times what is this this is semi-automatic even semi automatic doesn't going to give 19 paa 19 shot at this this rate so they came they come and asked for Redemption how to reconcile they knock on sh's doors that's good for M but it's not good for your Islam it's not good for your kids they cry and we sh I have six children why didn't you think of the consequences and was it worth it no it wasn't she she almost puts too much Sal in the the food but I should have tolerated it it's too late this is what this what anger does for you you have to suppress your anger like you go to the gym to grow your muscles go to this mental gym to control your anger and your emotions two men were fighting in front of the Prophet Alam and his companions one of them his eyes were his veins were pumping and his whole posture was you know out of this world the prophet said hm I know a word if he says it all this hanger would go away now remember the prophet did not go and tell this man why because he knew that it was not the right time one of the companions didn't think this way and rushed to the man he said the prophet says if you say all this anger would go away look what the anger made this man reply by he said go away from my face you think I'm I'm I'm crazy get the hell out of my face he rejected the advice of the Prophet Alat due to his anger and this is what anger does to you and"
