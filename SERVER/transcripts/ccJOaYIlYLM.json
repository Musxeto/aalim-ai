  "transcript": "I love beyond a bebo peace and blessings of Allah be on my solo beyond happy below and blessings of Allah be smelly I ran over him at hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen was solid wassalam wanama borussia motilal al-amin nabina muhammad in water he was so happy he remained back dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still discussing and i hope that which would be the final episode on commenting on the hadith of mahalia abdel hakim may allah be pleased with him and if you recall he's the one who when someone sneezed while in congregational prayer and praise the lard oil he said your hammock whom allah may allah have mercy on you and when the people looked at him because he did something outrageous during salat he cried saying oh woe be to me why are you staring at me like this and then he tells us how the Prophet Alice awesome gave him a fine and kind preaching by advising him and how he said that by Allah I have not seen anyone who is kinder or nicer in preaching others than the Prophet Alice awesome may my father and mother be ransom for him and we commented upon a number of topics among them was the issue of fine preaching and how we can captivate people's hearts when being kind and tolerant unlike what some muslims may behave nowadays in a repelling way drawing people away from Islam and gaining sins over sins because of their bad behavior which is totally against the way of the prophet alayhi salatu salam who himself had said whoever turns away from my son is not off me so these hook aim to want to do good or not off the prophet a little Absalom for turning away away from his Sunnah wow you may allah be pleased with him said I said messenger of allah i was still recently a pagan but allah has brought islam to us among us there are men who resort to karen's and the can is a fortune teller or a soothsayer so the prophet said to him at a solid some do not go to them now the issue of going to fortune tellers or soothsayers of course there is more to this hadith but I just wanted to comment a little bit on the issue of a kahana or going to fortune tellers or soothsayers now long ago there were many forms for this practice and until today these forms still exist however we may fail to recognize them due to the fact that they have different names and sometimes people may confuse us when they claim that this is scientific at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam there was great collaboration between the jinn worshipers who are usually the Sorcerer's the fortune-tellers the soothsayers etc so there was great collaboration between them and the jinn and the jinn would not serve people unless they worship them and provide to them sacrifices the only one who had control over gin by Allah's command was profit Salam peace be upon him and in the hadith the Prophet said array salatu salam after moving in prayer while leading congregation the congregation the companions asked him a prophet of Allah you moved front and back and set things in the prayer what what were you doing the prophet said Al is awesome a devil came to attack me so I choked him until I felt the coldness of his saliva on my hand and I almost wanted to tie him to a pillar of the masjid so that the children and the Muslims would see him but I remembered that my brother Solomon peace be upon him asked allah azzawajal for drain that no one can have after him and he had rain over the jinn and the humans and the power to communicate with animals and other creatures so these gen worshippers would communicate with their gin and we know that gin is drop so whatever a glimpse of what an angel would say to an angel of what Allah has revealed to the angels before they are struck by a meteoroid or by a stone of fire or a comet they managed to steal one bit of to information of something that might happen in the future they give it to their priests and worshipers and they mix it up with 99 lies so they tell you a hundred facts 99 of them are all fabrications and one is true as per the hadith of the Prophet erase a lobster who told us this process nowadays we see that hadith of the Prophet Alice salatu salam warning us from such practices whoever goes to a kahin to a soothsayer or a fortune-teller Allah would not accept the prayers of 40 days in another hadith whoever goes to such a person and believes him then he has nullified his Islam he has become kafir with the religion of muhammad sallallahu luisana so there is two different aspects one just going there for the fun of it while acknowledging that he's a liar and nothing of what he says is true the punishment 40 days of your prayer would not be accepted and if you do not pray you become a kafir so you have to pray but would not get any reward for that but if you go and believe or even if you believe after a week or a month or a year aha this is what he said or what she said and it came became true then this nullifies a person's Islam because he's acknowledging that someone other than Allah knows the unseen nowadays this is manifested and similar but different names for example we have the crystal ball you go to a circus you pay some money and the old lady tells you your future you may go for the fun of it and you may believe we have the zodiacs and the signs where people depend before going to their work upon what the future holds for them and they know this through the zodiacs and reading what according to what month they were born in all of this goes against Islam and shows that the people do not believe in Allah do not follow the message of the prophet alayhi salaatu a sinner if you believe for example that someone can determine and define things of the unseen through modern scientific sword acclaim ways which is not founded and it's baseless then this is part of the belief in sooth saying an unfortunate telling for example a little bit of shoot is an NLP and this is quite a trend nowadays and it's a something that unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are very hyper about neuro linguistic programming i think they call it and they claim that you can do things and you can know things and you can change things as if Allah social does not exist you can do that on your own part of it is telling you what you like what you love what's your favorite color what will happen to you about the things that we're taking place in the past in your past how would they know such things by your signature Subhan Allah so if I sign my name they claim that they have scientists in it's a science that is built on facts and they can tell you all these things from your handwriting they can say that this person is a bit depressed his social he's funny he's grumpy from my handwriting and who is this Sherlock Holmes and they claim that they can know facts about you all of this is part of sooth saying and believing that these people can do this is a breach of your Iman in Allah as a virgin likewise part of it believing in the power of energy of your Chi so of your whatever they call it there's so many different types which is originating from Hinduism and from Buddhism so you have people wearing bracelets or wearing a disc they call it the disc of energy and they claim that you can cure people by aqua puncher that changes the meridian of energy by tapping and patting certain areas of the body so this does the same effort or effect and all of this is part of the minor chick if you believe that Allah is the one who's doing it but these are means of it this is minor if you believe that it can heal by itself this is major shirk healing and I don't think we're gonna finish the studies today because this is dragging too long healing in Islam is by two well-known means and the third is considered to be sure so there is healing through religious evidences honey said to us by Allah in the Quran and by the Prophet alastair salam the black seat offering rupiah with the Quran recitation of the Quran in this applications all of these are considered to be part of the religious methods of healing Zamzam water seven dates of agua etc and there is the practical means of healing or the things that have been tried in laboratories and proven by science so antibiotics these are unknown medical indication that the imma sue t'kul companies produced and the doctors acknowledged it has been tested this is permissible taking two panna dolls would relieve you from your headache this is scientifically proven the third method which is something that people are convinced that is the means of healing but the scientists could not find any reason behind that and not only that they say that this is like the placebo it is something that people think has cure in it while there isn't any cure in it for example wearing a copper bracelet I've seen a lot of grown-up men do this and they say oh it cures our back ache pains and our knees and it absorbs the romit ism and everything else in our body you go to doctor said this is a lot of bogus and baloney there's no proof of that this is minus shake they say yes Allah is the one who cures they wear rings with special stones archaic or eye of the tiger or whatever and they say that it has healing powers or it gives you powers to do things usually you are unable to do again this is shirk minor shirt this is this folds all under the issue of soothsaying also we have something that is quite famous among the children now and the teenagers they I was asked a couple of weeks ago about a game here in Saudi they say it's called Charlie and that's funny because charlie is not an Arab name and they say that it's a board where they put a glass or something and it moves and it tells them answers and it used to be called Vega a board game or Omega different names we have letters and you have numbers and either two or three or more of the participant put their fingers on a device or a glass or a cup or whatever that can move and give them directions and people are believing in that and this is a game not knowing that this has religious implications and it has also a lot of physical and mental implications religiously believing and playing such a game Manila fire Islam because you're calling the jinn and you're requesting their aid and assistance not only that you're submitting to them because you are not allowed to leave without seeking their permission on the physical and mental aspect lots of people got anxieties nightmares because of the possession of the jinn for allowing them to control you and you're giving them total submission when playing the game and our kids don't know these issues of al-qaeda our forefathers knew it o prophet of Allah we go to Karen the Prophet I sallam said do not go to them then well can we can go on forever but let us restrict ourselves to this just to give you information then he says there are men who take omens the Prophet said I assume that is something which they find in their chests but let it not turn in their way from freedom action now believing in bad omens is a breach of your trust dependence and reliance on a larger in Arctic is called a paella or act ashanome so a tiara is derived from the bird and long ago the Arabs used to make the decisions according to where the bird fly so if they shoot the bird and it goes to the left then they refrain from act thing and it goes to the right then they act upon it so the issue of believing in bad omens and that it can affect your life this is part of because nothing can affect your life except Allah social if I go for an interview and I see a dead black cat on my door steps and I said oops I'm not going to the interview today if I see a car accident I'm not going to work today if there's an open ladder and I would not pass beneath it if there's an umbrella turned upside down this is superstition I I'm not going to go near there if you go to and this was in Kuala Lumpur a few weeks back I was staying in a hotel and it was a high riser and I noticed that they don't have the number 13 so what I asked they said no this is bad luck this is bad omens a Muslim cannot believe in such thing as bad luck so 13 has no significance upon us like any 12 or 15 or 17 or any other number in Islam and the Prophet said Anna his salat was Sarah that believing in bad omens is shirk up tiara to and I'm the lovingest road may allah be pleased with him said each and every one of us has this in him yet alonzo gel drives it away with towaco with dependents and reliance and trusting a las ocho so this is a natural feeling that a person gets when he sees something he does not like however a proper Muslim refrains and suppresses such a feeling and belief by overwhelming it with trusting allah azzawajal with depending on Allah subhana Allah and with total reliance on him the all mighty and then wowee I said may Allah be pleased with him among us there are men who draw lines the prophet said array so Sam there was a prophet who drew lines so if their lines coincide with his lines so be it what is the issue of drawing lines in some ancient civilizations they and cultures as well they think that by drawing certain things on sand or by writing few words you can foresee the future and this is found until today we have in some so-called Islamic countries women they do their fortune telling through wiping over sand and drawing lines on it and then say that this is your future this will happen to you some of them read your palm some of them when they drink the Turkish coffee and after it's finished they turn the cup upside down and after a minute or two they read the lines that the coffee made while being upside down and all of this is part of fortune-telling again however the Prophet gave us a new piece of information sallallahu ala of Salem he told us that there was a prophet of Allah who used to draw who used to use calligraphy and this prophet we were told is profit in dreese peace be upon him one of the first prophets of Allah however almas revelation was conveyed to this messenger of allah to this prophet of allah through his calligraphy so he was not foreseeing the future he was not a fortune teller merely he was a prophet and allah is revelation to him was through his calligraphy the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever's drawing coincides with the prophets drawings then this is authentic and this is correct is the prophet giving us a green light at a salsa the answer is definitely no the prophet is telling us is awesome that this was a miracle given to a prophet and what you are doing is soothsaying so whoever of you can guarantee that his writing coincides with the writing of the messenger of allah of the prophet of allah which was a revelation then so be it but because the answer is no one knows that and no one claims that he's being revealed to buy a large l like that message that the prophet of Allah in this case what you're doing is totally prohibited and it's bad and then why are we are said to the prophet alayhi salatu salam that I had a flock of sheep and there was this slave girl that used to take care of my sheep and one day I was passing by and I found that a wolf came and took a sheep of my flock I felt sad I feel I felt angered by this and I'm a human being so I shouted my slave girl and I slapped her on the face because of her negligence this is why I lost my ship so he told this to the prophet alayhi salatu salam whether he is a companion or not the prophet alayhi salatu salam does not favor people over the truth but rather favors the truth over people the Prophet did not erase a solemn shrug his shoulders and said okay it's a mistake you've done this repent to Allah he magnified what he had done and he told him that this was really bad and serious so while you felt sorry and he said should I set her free as an expiation as a form of asking Allah for forgiveness the Prophet said to him my son bring her to me so he brought this slave girl and the Prophet asked her to questions where is Allah she said literally for summer in the heavens Who am I you are the prophet of Allah soldier he said to him such a free she's a believer the issue of fists Emma some people when they translated they say in Heaven's as if allah azzawajal is surrounded by his creatures and this is a wrong interpretation the preposition fee has a number of meanings in Arabic it can meet it can mean in so my wallet is in my pocket p jb but it also can be on as mentioned in the quran when excuse me when Pharaoh threatened and intimidated his sorcerers when they believed in allah azzawajal and they prostrated to him after seeing the miracle of Musa peace be upon him he said to them I will cut your hands and legs alternately and I will crucify you feed you learn in neural not in the trunks of the palm trees but rather on so it can be used the proposition fee it can be used as in and it can be used as on and also fists Emma means that the word s emma has two meanings it has the meaning of the heavens in Arabic and it also has the important meaning of highness so when we say Allah is fists Emma we mean that Allah is in the highness and this is indicating that logic is on top of everything so this is totally wrong what people say nowadays when you ask them where is Allah some people unfortunately some days some scholars would attack such a question I heard a clip for a famous die saying that it is inappropriate to ask where Allah is a stuffed full of a tuba knew this was a question of the prophet alayhi salaatu set up just because you come from a background that do not believe in this and maybe your scholars were a little bit deviant not a little bit a lot of deviancy in them that they go against the arcade of a national jamar you cannot defend this by diluting the issues of our peda he says don't say where Allah is the Prophet said Alice time where is Allah and she told him that Eliza above the heavens so Allah tells us in the Quran that Allah is above his arch Allah is above his throne so we have to acknowledge this and the evidence is beyond this or supporting this are overwhelming from the Quran from the sunnah and from the consensus of scholars and also from your instinct when you pray to Allah you pray to this being above you and we know that all good deeds go up to Allah and all a lot commands come down to us even Pharaoh asked her man his minister to build to build him statue or to build him a high riser where he could climb up the heavens and look at mooses Lord even her own acknowledge the fact that the Lord and the creator of the heavens and the earth is above the heaven so allah azzawajal is not surrounded by any of his creatures because nothing can surround him subhana Allah Allah is above is strong but Allah is not in need of a strong Allah is not in need of anything because everything you see is in desperate need of his existence and dependent on that on Allah the Almighty we have a short break stay tuned in a shallow we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back our lines are open if you have a question regarding the topic or something that may benefit you and the Muslims please go ahead and call one of the brothers ask is the diet which we recite in the first dish a hood and in the second dish a hood is it a conversation between allah and his messenger sallallahu ala here you sell them on the night of the miraculous journey when the Prophet was ascended to the seventh heaven this is baseless some say that the Prophet when he went to meet allah azzawajal he said at the hair to dealer he was so lower to what play a bet and allah allah the almighty responded to him by saying as salaam wat EK un nabi muhammad allahi barik Otto so the Prophet I son wanted to expand this a little bit not only to himself by saying assalamo Elena voila I body la sala hain etc all of this is baseless and it has no authenticity at all and one should not believe in that we have a Amina from Saudi Amina hello re Kaun salam to LA this is this is a she señor Amina okay can you raise your voice a little bit as here oh okay well she's just yes I'm sing loudly yeah I hope and now you can hear you suck enough hair for your beautiful description regarding although soothsayer and on and also informing about that what type of game is available you're in sir jada and even if will give a more description we will make our children aware of that inshallah I have to question shake yes 01 when the question number one that is this not allowed to raise the hand for Dora after after the namaz alone we are playing alone we say tasha hose they do the snail and suppose we want to ask a door either it is my persona I do not allow and question yeah I question number two is some people they give a Hadees that women will be in the Hellfire and such women they will be dragged from their hair dad from their breasts dress from this and they're going to take the men also in the Hellfire so this hadees of dragging the woman to all those private parts and all these things is this correct or

something that is eatable right yes I liked it with the sugar you know you can burn sugar hotela it's the hair look like ink and then you write it on there at least okay second question then I drink it and then I number two and if I make an impatient and then I recite the Quran I was an intention that i'm looking for a lot to grab me something that I want for example i'm looking for a job and then i take Surat Yasin I'm looking for itself from the bank and then I mentioned the name of the bank because i presented my CV and everything to the bank and then I'm expressly acid I recited with the intention that Allah will grant will graduate they do from this back ah is this look and then at the same time I recite this surah yaseen with the intention of my sister my sister is also looking for a job and then is a slightly acid and Allah to grant my sister for theirs for hair looking for this job I gotta Quesada it's also a little allowed but you're welcome Amina anomaly consonantal law ramadan mubarak issues is little question please yes i want to ask the circuits of the property I have a house which my family staying and we inherited a land from my grandparents but it doesn't make enough money to support us the second question is is networking halal is what networking networking means to join an organization to buy product this product you can get it but one of the condition is you have to invite two people ok i will answer a shop any more questions nothing is not allow it what is that we have our she from Saudi Santa la she first of all thank you so much for the program today al hamdulillah it has clarified a lot of our dog doubts that we have back home in India automatic and other things and my question is like for women is it allowed to observe fast while making intention before fuzzy and taking shower of purity after party like six o'clock or seven o'clock due to any reason like impurity of monthly periods or other things okay any quit any more questions thank you ok Michelle from Jordan yeah yes what can I do for you oh oh sorry achieve you at the same time oh ok when I pray when I do so on my I have a one-year-old one in three months and it's hard to pray and watch him at the same time so while I'm in prayer he moves a lot and he's still trying to walk on his own he falls down now and then so some most of the time I have to leave the prayer and watch him and then come back to the I try to continue where I left off I don't know my prayer is nullified or after restart or I can still continue to any more questions no that's all thank you ok you're welcome ok a share from Saudi Arabia says what's the ruling on raising the hands after namaz salat after prayer whether fault or sooner we have a hadith that encourages us to raise the hands when making duaa and we have a hadith that warns us from innovating and doing something in Islam to combine these two we have to read the syrah of the Prophet I sasaram to understand all of his sunnah and implement it on us now when we come to the issue of after concluding the prayer did the Prophet erase asaram raised his hands for do no one would say yes they will all say we have no reports which means that he did not did the companions the answer is no so if the answer would be then in a nutshell if you do this as a regular routine of which I've seen a lot of the people from the subcontinent do after each and every farts Allah they have to raise their hands and then wipe their face and maybe their bodies every single salad regardless of what they say so this is a clear beta but if someone does it once in a blue moon I usually say that I've car after salat without saying any do our raising my hands but today I am about to go and buy a car and I want a la social to make my journey successful and to give me a good price and to make me choose the right car so I raise my hands not because it's after salah because i need to make draw then there's nothing wrong in that inshallah we've lost colors ok i see a second question was women in hell and men there are a hadith that they are being dragged from their hair and their drag being dragged from their breast etc and they also drag men with them to my knowledge that this is not an authentic hadith it is not authentic because the Prophet to my knowledge did not say not that women will not be punished in hell not that men would not be punished in hell we have lots and lots of hadiths describing to us the punishment of both men and help men and women in hell but not to my knowledge of such a hadith Allah knows best Silva asks is it shirk to write the verses of the Quran and drink it the answer is no is it an innovation it's an issue of dispute among scholars I personally believe that this is permissible because it was reported that some of the sella fuse to do it why would we say to something that the Prophet did not dualism to be permissible not an innovation because the general concept is there which is seeking healing from Allah social through the Quran and drinking and eating this is part of the healing so inshallah it's not an innovation however if your diabetes diabetic I suggest that you don't use sugar some would use a mint and others would use saffron and they would write it on a plate and then they wash it and drink the water this may cure from evil eye and it also make you from black magic or sorcery with the grace of Allah because this is Quran so it is not definitely ship sailed out says that what is the ruling if I recite if I want something from Allah I need a job so tomorrow is my interview and i'll be submitting my CD so i decide to rocky a scene and then ask allah so jeal to facilitate this thing or i ask allah for someone else like my sister this is an innovation why is it the quran means of healing yes but it is not to be used in such a fashion this is not healing you're asking a larger for something so simply raise your hands praise Allah offer salutation to the prophetess Oh Sarah then ask whatever you want Quran is being misused and disrespected nowadays lots of people have seen this when they want to do something and they can't make up their mind they open the Quran and they put their fingers and they look ah the ayah says yes or no sort of a story or there is the letter no or the story of affirming something so this is Alice this is Alice choice now this is also part part of soothsaying this is not permissible you're disrespecting the Quran it's like pulling the lots like the mushrik used to do they used to have three arrows and they put it in somewhere and they draw one is written on it go ahead and the other one is don't do and the third one is blank do it again shuffle again and they they choose one of them and accordingly they decide whether they would go on with the decision or not this is soo thing this is not permissible so for you to recite the Quran before you ask a lot something and innovation the Prophet told us has some to offer salutation to the Prophet to praise Allah and to glorify Him and then ask whatever you wish to ask Amina from Saudi Arabia says what's the ruling on the cat on property so many times you've stated maybe we should make a full episode on this inshallah I don't know if there is enough time for Ramadan or not but we should make something about the cat the cat is due on four things these four things other than it you don't need to pay the cat well we have a Muhammad Ali from Saudi family cool Santa la so I'm calling from the dog yes I want to ask about this a lot origin okay so normally

Zaki salah from rana hello share yes allah i will share from an uncaring and to you as well yes yet as you said before it destroyed the games and shrine has no problem from the son of his perspective you know i want to say that from my opinion no don't do us don't give a sháá don't give us your opinion ask your question ok how taught the people who watch your program those teaching and me how cause and they're wrong behavior of the sum of the so-called Muslim good clue this is the salah sabah sabah my friend my friend this is not a question this is an opinion the way we are teaching in this program is the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Ali salatu salam with the understanding of the seller so whatever you create Detroit is your I what religious shrine-- ah hey what are you talking about I am no more and I don't know what you're talking about okey but thank you for calling so if you're from Pakistan family comes Santa la is it allowed to read open crown holding in your hand enter avi Riley mom is reciting okay any more questions that's it thank you you're quite welcome Fatima from Saudi Arabia something la how are you I'm finds ecologic ok I have to a question yes the first one is that during Salah when I do the food my hands usually reach the ground than my knees but I heard someone on TV say that you're Nev she reached the ground in the hands I wanted to know if it's the same or not okay second question and my second question is that I read something online dust is that put in the Quran as your ringtone on your phone is that good and the reason that they wrote is that when you receive the call it stops and it changes the meaning I wanted to know if it's true because nowadays you can write anything ok thank you you're quite welcome so I mean as saying that what's the row ok bashira from Qatar lot more like Oh sample ah um I have a question yes it had permissible for married couples to be staying with your husband sparing is it permissible for who for married couples to be staying with your husband staring I could not agree their father in law or mother-in-law mother-in-law ok secondly in my country believe that stays black magic for example if someone is ill and there is no cost or solution for this illness in the hospital the next thing we got your traditional healers so is responsible in Islam ok thirdly is it true that during the time of prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam I like it men and remained witchcraft to fight but in the end you ask them to return there but they're witchcraft the women refused to return the as the men returned Diaz then my first question I have a sick sister she's very also she can't fast so can her parents feed someone on her behalf of feed people on her behalf how old is he she 17 years old and she cannot fast due to weakness or illness she seeks ors anton it's making her very tired she can't fast okay i will answer your question ishalla okay thank you very much you're quite welcome I think this is the last caller okay I don't think we have time to take more callers because we have a lot of backlog Amina says the the cat on property there's a cat is doing for things that we as we stated i'm not going to go through them i'm gonna mashaallah talk about them later on there's a cat on property is not do except if you are displaying this property for sale so if i have a big housing complex and I'm giving it on rent there's no zakat on it there is a cat is on the rent when I receive it and it remains for a full lunar year in my possession but if I spend it within this period then there's no saket none whatsoever likewise if you have a house you live in or a number half of houses your own there is no Zack at except on the property that is portrayed for sale now she has a land from inherited from her grandfather I don't know about the nature of the land I don't know about whether it is cultivated or not and what kind of crops is being cultivated in it because this determines whether you should pay the cat for that or not she says what's the ruling on network business or network marketing they call it like busyness like all these different gold quest different companies there is a lot of talk about it the scholars say that it is prohibited and I I met a lot of these people two of them the supervisor and one keen brother came to my message it wasted like half an hour trying to convince me that it is halal and then I asked the brother he said I told him what did you buy from them he said they sold me a medallion and they said that there is only a hundred pieces of it worldwide and it's made of gold I said ma sha Allah how much did you pay he said I paid 1500 or 1600 reals and I told him looking to him in the eyes did you take it to a jewellers job to just check how much it really costs and in shame and disgrace he said yes and they told me it cost 200 rails he paid 1500 reals for a lie that only 100 pieces exists for something that is not more than 200 reals worth not a brand name not a designer's name nothing so this is how they draw people it's called the pyramid scheme networking they gained a lot of people at the base and the more you go up because you called these people the more money you make until you reach the top and actually you're not selling or buying anything that is useful Archie from Saudi Arabia she says a woman who was in her menses saw her purity before they identify her so now she is pure and then a nano Fletcher was called but she did not take her listen is there anything wrong no her fasting is correct if she intended it likewise if someone had sexual intercourse with his spouse and then went to bed and woke up after fechar the fasting is valid because it's not connected to his major or minor impurity at that time and Allah knows best Michelle from jordan says that she has a child that while in prayer he moves a lot so when he tries is a toddler he tries to walk and so she may refrain him or stop him from doing something that is harmful or to prevent him from falling so is does this affect her salat no it doesn't such movement is cold for as long as your direction is to the Qibla so you're not giving you back to the Qibla and going to the back all the way then this is permissible it was reported in the authentic hadith that our prophets allah salam used to pray and lead the congregational prayer while carrying his daughter his granddaughter oh mama the daughter of a Bella's and of course the daughter of his daughter Zeynep so his granddaughter was with him in a prayer whatever he did Rikuo or sujood he put her aside and when he stood up he picked her again so such movement does not affect your prayer and you can pray and stop your child take a step or two to prevent him carry him and put him in its cradle or whatever and continue to pray without any problem in sha Allah Muhammad Ali from Saudi Arabia he says that in Saudi Arabia they have to advance for federer and this is the sunnah of the prophet Isaiah throughout the whole year not only in Ramadan unfortunately even in Saudi Arabia this sooner has been abandoned except in Mecca and Medina and some messages here and there and these messages that do it here and there do it only in Ramadan and this is wrong so he's asking can we perform the Hajj Jude before that the first event and the answer is the first event has nothing to do with the timing of your tahajjud it is just a form of notification that pfizer time is approaching so if you want to eat if you want to conclude your prayer with witter then go ahead because it's still time but budget is approaching the second of that you can pray tahajjud before that whenever you want then he said must I sleep before tahajjud no you should you must not it is more rewarding for you to have a nap and then fight yourself and wake up to pray but it is not mandatory helen from ethiopia did not seem to understand why is it better to raise your hands after the mandatory salat it is better because it is not of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alice aslam to make duaa after the conclusion of the prayer the time for door is in the prayer itself the Prophet when he taught us that the Shahada his salatu salam he said after you finish the Shah hood ask Allah whatever you want so between tisha Haute and the Salam to conclude the prayer this is the time highly recommended and preferred by the Prophet idiso salam to make duaa he never said to us to make drunk after salam he told us to make vicar and there is a difference between this and that therefore this is a stance and a la Sol knows best we have like a number of questions pending I do apologize but the time is up I will insha Allah promised you to answer them tomorrow first thing before we take the caller's questions until then I leave you feel Manila was salaam aleikum o Allah he beyond happy below p 7 land and blessings of Allah be on my solo beyond"
