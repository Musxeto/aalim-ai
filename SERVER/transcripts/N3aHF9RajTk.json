  "transcript": "thank you um my today question is um ever since I became a practicing Muslim um you know I started doing Salah and I don't miss Salah I read Quran I fast so I started every time I look at the watch you know at the clock um I started seeing like the same numbers uh you know like and it's it's been for like a long time it's been like five months six months I see the same time every time I look at it so for example like when I look at the time and it's random I look like it's and I see one one one or two two two three three three uh and I don't understand what it what what what does that mean can you kind of explain it to me please thank you maybe you should change the watch okay what do you mean by It's Five O'Clock do you see one one one haseeb yeah uh no no no uh basically when it's one o'clock when it's one o'clock 11 minutes or two o'clock 22 minutes three o'clock 33 minutes that's that when I just look at the watch I just see that this you know numbers okay what's wrong in that look after five minutes what would the time be you know is going to be different time but I just see it this is this has nothing to do with you becoming the new uh um superhero or a prophecy or this is a random thing sometimes our brains work in mysterious ways it may be your subconscious is timing the clock so at 1 11 your subconscious is timing the clock without you knowing it the moment it's 222 you just take a look and it's 222 ah so what change from digital clocks into analogs you know that the one with the dials that would probably eliminate this it has nothing to do with Islam don't get hyped about it it has nothing to do with the Gin it has nothing to do with Satan's it's only games of their mind of your subconscious and of course Satan is fueling it making you think that oops am I the new Messiah or what what is this no it has nothing to do with any of that don't pay any attention to it and just move on"
