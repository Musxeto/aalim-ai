  "transcript": "Al said I heard about and ab may Allah be pleased with him was the last companion to die so he was the last one of the companions may Allah be pleased with him he said I saw the prophet and there is no one left on the face of the Earth who has seen him meaning I'm the last one of the compan is alive he said I said to him that is said to describe him for me so Abu may Allah be pleased with him said he was white handsome of medium size this is the description of the Prophet Alam that is consistent among all the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and when we come to the definition of beauty how do you define something that's beautiful or handsome they say it has to be proportional it has to be symmetric and it has to be of something that is average there's no extremity in it and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was bestowed by Allah both physical and mental beauty of all that's why most if not all Messengers and prophets of Allah were the elite of their people in their lineage in their character in their physical ability and their beauty and how handsome they were and the prophet Salli wasallam was no exception and this is why the prophet Sall wasallam when people looked at him for the first time they would totally and quickly relate to that fact Abdullah Salam may Allah be pleased with him who was a Jew who was a RAB Rabbi among the most knowledgeable of the Jews at the time he said when I heard of the coming of the Prophet to Medina I know his description in the Torah so I said let me go and look at him and see and hear some of what he has to say he says the moment I looked at his face I immediately recognize and realized that this is not the face of a liar and this is the face of the prophet sallallah moving on to the following chapter the Seal of prophethood of the Prophet Alat what is that the Seal of a pro the prophethood is a sign that was mentioned and described in the previous scriptures where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was recognized by so that he would be known and recognized by the people people when they see him and it's like a piece of Flesh between his shoulders on the back of the Prophet a little bit to the left so this is like the Seal of the Prophet Hood whoever sees it recognizes that he is the prophet of Allah said I went to the prophet Alam accompanied by my aunt and my maternal aunt said to the prophet Alat wasam my sister's son my nephew he's in pain so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam stroked my head and he sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam supplicated blessings for my sake stroking the head and supplicating is a form of R then the Prophet Alat wasam performed the minor Ritual Evolution he made wood he says I drank from his Evolution water and stood behind his back whereupon I observed the seal between his shoulders and it was like the button of the bridal canopy now this is a description from a companion and he says that may Allah be pleas him that the Seal of the Prophet Hood was between his shoulders Alat and it was like a button of the bridal canopy which has buttons in it some Scholars like a they say it is a resemblance of the egg of a particular bird so this is how it looked in another narration which is the following Hadith of Ja samur he said I saw the seal between the shoulders of the Prophet ofat wasam as a red swelling like the egg of a dove so the size is small but it is the same description R and this is the following Hadith may Allah be pleased with I said I heard the prophet of allaham and if I wished to kiss the seal between his shoulders I would have done so because of his nearness so she's emphasizing that she heard this particular Hadith from the prophet Alam as she was so close to the prophet that if she wanted she was behind him to kiss the Seal of the prophethood she would have done that so what did the prophet sayat wasam he said that on the day he died he said about him that the Throne of the almighty allaha was shaken on his account and this Hadith is reported in theah and it was report is narrated by almost 10 or more companions so there's nothing to doubt in its authenticity and it means that the throne is one of Allah's creation Allah doesn't need it Allah doesn't depend on it like all other creations of Allah Allah is independent so this creation of Allah the throne though it's the largest of all Allah's Creations when s died it shook out of joy and happiness that s is coming and this was heard by this companion who is describing to us the Seal of the prophethood [Music]"
