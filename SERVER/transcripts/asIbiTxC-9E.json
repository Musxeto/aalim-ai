  "transcript": "ma says is using mandala design on hands as H or drawing it or coloring it in books permissible just the patterns of mandala usually this called mandala is something that was done by the Buddhists in India and then went into Tibet until the present time the monks there use these drwings mandala means a circle if I'm not mistaken so they use these drawings of circles and squares that are shaped in a very nice way to express their religious belief and usually they use painted sand to portray their beliefs and they believe that making such a portrait or a structure or a design that represents their beliefs helps in purification and uh um Soul cleansing and the and and and relaxation as well and it involves a lot of their prayers in the beginning and during and sometimes it involves making a beautiful drawings or uh uh a form of art that represents their religion the altars for example their gods and their greatest god of all and how he comes and and does this and that and sometimes they destroy it at the end of the day but it represents their religious practice and it involves a lot of prayers of theirs and this is their religion it's part of their religion now what's the ruling for us to perform such things it is not permissible basically because the prophet said whoever imitates people he's part of them and they have sort of significance for different colors and they believe in this and those who imitate them in their drawings or in their h on their hands or in their coloring books they believe for example that the color red increases your power of strength and when you're hesitant in making a decision it enforces you to make such decisions and gives you some love and uh uh uh Flawless in in in in your life uh the pink is main used a lot in Coloring the purple is used when you lack the ability of creativity and Creation in your life and at work so it will give you inspiration in your work and it will reduce the negative amount or the negative energy in you um the blue is for self-confidence the green is when you're jealous of people the orange to give you energy and and and so forth now the problem is that lots of the Muslims believe in these colors intentionally or unintentionally and they think that this gives them power and it has an impact on their lives and this is related to shik because such powers are only in the hands of Allah and Allah did not make these colors means of such such feelings or Powers but it is something that is you people are brainwashed so basically speaking this is not permissible for Muslims to imitate the disbelievers uh in their practice and it's a must for them to avoid it f"
