  "title": "Is it permissible for a muslim to use offensive words? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "check uh I have this question uh coming to my mind just to gain my knowledge I'm asking I have my own way of thinking of this question let's check we know that offensive language is totally Haram to use but uh in a narration I read that Umar said when he was stabbed that he said the word dog I guess he said it to make the person how bad the person is to make us understand he said the word and also in Quran who is know that there are lines which says that people are worse than livestocks uh so can we use some offensive words to make the other person know that how much a bad person is this was my question check I hope first of all first of Allah Quran is Allah's words so when Allah says what he says this is Allah he can say whatever Allah wants about his creation and when Allah describes his creation the disbelievers of them to be worse than livestock this is true this is the description of Allah but when I say to you you are a dog I know in the States this is a compliment when you say to someone you're my dog in in Arabia in Muslim countries this is the greatest filthiest insult to call a person a dog Allah honored them to be humans and you degrade them to dogs but this is culture may Allah guide them so when I say to someone you're a dog you're a donkey you're a pig you're this is not only offensive this is a form of profanity and the prophet said a Believer is not a person who Slanders who backbites who uses profanity or obscene language a Believer is not a person like that I don't remember Hadith where Omar accused someone of being a dog but this can happen and it is a medal on rumors chest that only this single word was quoted over the span of 40 Years of Islam he's a human being he may get angry he may need to curse or to do something or say something when agitated or provoked to do something like that so this is not the norm and we can't label a person simply because of a single mistake he made so this is not a pattern to be followed for us Muslims we have to refrain from using this if one slips and says such an obscene word once in a blue moon he seeks A6 forgiveness from Allah and repents and shows remorse and allies most forgiving most merciful"
