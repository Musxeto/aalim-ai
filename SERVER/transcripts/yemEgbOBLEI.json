  "transcript": "in Pakistan why do we call Jamar when bukhari and Muslim and the compilers of the four books of sunnan abidawood The Terminator did not call themselves as such an who cares whether you call yourself or not doesn't mean anything it's not a label that you will not enter Jannah without it the name itself has no significance that would make an issue out of it what are you a Muslim what type of a Muslim a Muslim Muslim I'm a Muslim nowadays because of the so many deviant sects and cults which the prophet Islam told us about his ummah will be divided into 73 sects All In Hell except one so which one is it you call them you call them Hadith you call them salafis you call themsura you call them names are cheap anyone could collect a name what's your name I am the power the most powerful man on Earth prove it I don't need to prove it I just called myself this I'm the smartest person on earth I'm the richest person on Earth I can do whatever I want it's a name but when push comes to shove here is where you have to prove it so if you claim that you're Alessia but you believe that the prophet Islam was created of Allah's light or that it's permissible to worship Graves or to call the dead or to do this or to do that or to innovate in Islam then it doesn't matter what whether you're Alison al-jama or any other label because your conviction is what counts on the day of judgment the terminology which was used by metamia and the scholars who came afterwards in referring to the followers of the favorite three generation so they follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations they would call them why would anybody find it difficult to accept this year we don't want to call ourselves I don't excuse me don't what do you want to call yourself oh we're Muslims you're Muslims there's no problem in that so if a group who want to identify themselves with a label or a name not as a party but rather as a clarification of the methodology of their thinking of their Akida of the manhaji they're following there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
