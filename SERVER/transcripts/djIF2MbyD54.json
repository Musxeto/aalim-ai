  "transcript": "uh I have a question about my relationship with my father actually uh just to give some context my father kind of abandoned us since we were children basically it's my mother who took care of everything uh basically just to give an example recently I was in Turkey I was studying there you know that there was an earthquake there and a lot of people died he didn't even message me to know if I was all right B I don't know even if he checked if I was alive so well I'm a servant of Allah I don't want to Allah from time to time I text him and so on I want to know because basically we don't go far I want to know if I can limit myself to messages or is it obligatory on me to actually call him okay first of all he's your father which means that you are obliged to do his rights as prescribed in the Quran and the Sunnah being beautiful being respectful being obedient and if he needs financial assistance and you have what's extra you have to help him now if he does not rescate if he does not give you your rights or he had not given you any of your rights since childbirth and he neglected you and your siblings and he was an awful person and he was evil Allah will hold him accountable on the day of judgment and maybe throw him in hell this is in Allah's hands this does not justify you not giving him his rights because if you do and you fail in giving him his rights Allah will hold you also accountable on the day of judgment and throw you in hell it's not a justification to say that he didn't take care of us when we were young no he will be held accountable for that this does not uh um make you Exempted from not doing his rights and Allah knows best as"
