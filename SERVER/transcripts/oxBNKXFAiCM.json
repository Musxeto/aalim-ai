  "title": "The time for repentance",
  "transcript": "There are two times, a general time and an individual time. The general time where the door of repentance would be completely closed for all. This is when the sun rises from the west. Whenever the sun rises from the west, then nobody's repentance would be accepted. It's over. It's done. And the time for each and every individual of us uh where the door would be completely closed and Allah would not accept our repentance individually is when the soul reaches our throats. So this is on our dying bed. Once the soul reaches the throats then it's over. Like in the case of Pharaoh as mentioned in the Quran when he was drowning and he felt that kalas he's gone he's he's dying he says now I believe in Allah which the uh sons of Israel believed in Allah tells him now after you have noticed and seen that Allah would not accept your repentance and he will uh uh make you um you will die and Allah will preserve your body so that it would be assigned to those who come after you and Allah knows that."
