  "transcript": "so this question I'm about to ask I've asked many knowledgeable people and they stated that this this there's no answer because there's not much evidence found so I'm going to State my question I'm waiting in Islam it states that all people of Jenna will be recreated with a new body form that is none like this roed life and that is enlarged and which which will resemble Prophet Adam peace be upon him I was wondering will all women in Jenna be made of one body structure I believe all men in Jenna will be made of one exact body figure resembling Prophet Adam and all women in Jenna will be made of one body figure resembling how Prophet Adam's wife so there would only be two body forms in Jen How would how would they know each other they would have like name tags or what how how how did you reach this conclusion to begin with MIP hello yes how did you reach this conclusion to begin with where did you get this information from I've just came across this online yeah do you believe anything you here online then you should believe in Bigfoot this is not logical we don't take our knowledge about Islam about things that we don't have any information of from The Unseen from the internet from Tom Dick and Har what we know from the Sunnah that the people will be recreated in the best of form they'll have the height and the uh uh um they'll be like uh uh 60 feet tall as Prophet Adam not resembling Prophet Adam or or mother haah Eve so to claim that they all have only two forms this is baseless and based on whims and desires no information from the Quran and Sunnah they will be in the best of form they'll be beautiful gorgeous handsome Beyond imagination how this is in Allah's hands not only that every single week they are increased in Beauty where you just thought that this is the ultimate of beauty next week it's more the following week it's even more and this is for eternity something that blows your mind away so as they say in English the devil is in the details don't go to such details that you don't have any knowledge of and say okay if they're going to do this then they require this amount of calories how much food are they going to consume it's not of your business don't focus on the little trivial details that you don't have any information of about and make up things and focus on reaching there and Allah Knows Best"
