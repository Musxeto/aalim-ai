  "title": "Husband not fulfilling financial responsibilities of his second wife - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that she married a person as a second wife and she made a condition that she may not live with the co wife in the same house he agreed after three months of marriage now he wants her to move with his first wife and for three months he disappeared apparently because she refused and he did not provide for her any food money maintenance shelter etc so what's the ruling on that this person he/she says he's an imam and I very much doubt that he's an imam see not everything a person who claims to be a mom is a really ma'am and such an impostor is doing a form of transgression he is doing volume the Prophet said that is awesome el Muslim una a show routine Muslims must respect and fulfill their conditions and she made it clear before marriage that she will not live with his first wife and this is her god-given right Allah gave her the strike so he agreed to that now after three months he goes back on his word he's cheating this is Haram only hypocrites do this and now for three months he doesn't call he disappeared he doesn't pay her maintenance or provide for her housing and food etc this is a debt that he is obliged to pay and if he doesn't pay it in this world Allah would take from his good deeds on the day of judgement and compensate you sister fatima for such a transgression made by this man who does not fear allah how dare you marry someone giving her a condition and then go back on your word only hypocrites do this and you're not allowed at all to make two wives live in the same house this is not your right they both have the right to have a separate home you do not have the right to force your wife to live with your family or with her in-laws she has to have her own private quarters with a kitchenette a room and a toilet that no one including a mom mother and your own mother no one can enter without her permission no one has access to her chambers without her permission so there is a lot of transgression a lot of them taking place may allah azzawajal guide the muslims back to being fair and just"
