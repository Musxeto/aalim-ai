  "transcript": "refraining from like doing a worship in front of people would whether it would be r or not and you said that if I do it fearing showing up then it will be we but what if someone does it while not fearing showing up but rather he's shy you know like when somebody's in like a public vehicle and like there have a lots of people around him and he's making Dua but nobody knows that he's making Dua and then he gets this thought like okay raise the hand because raising hands is better but he doesn't because he doesn't because he's shy so would that be VI because he's you know like not doing it because he's shy okay apparently that this issue has caused a lot of confusion uh confusion among the Muslims first of all the saying not doing something for the sake of the people is r and doing it for the sake of people is shik this is a saying of Scholars it's not Quran it's not Sunnah it's anad and maybe they had looked at it from a particular angle maybe they wanted to raise red flags so that people would be intimidated from falling into this trap of Shan there might be a number of other reasons nevertheless this is not Quran or Sunnah meaning that oh if I do not do something that's Sunnah or recommended or voluntary due to a reason of the fear of of people I'm shy I'm not that equipped to clarify my stance to the others when they ask me and I refrain from it this is not for example I go to AI predominately Masid and I know this area is Extreme they're extremists and when the IM says if I say I would be the only one in the Masjid and probably be scaled for that and probably people would look at me in a strange way should I do it no oh you're falling into Ria no I'm not I'm just weighing the pros and cons and the way I see it it's best for me not to say it so that I would blend in and then if I give advice later on people would accept me and it's an issue of depending on how you see yourself reacting and how people are reacting to your uh action so not every time if I refuse to uh raise my hands when making Dua while traveling in a bus because I don't want people to think that I'm going to blow up the bus imagine if I do this and everybody oh extremist is going to blow up the bus I don't do that for that fear am I committing real no I'm not the bottom line is I'm leaving a Sunnah ah why are you leaving a Sunnah because it's not mandat to do if I do it alhamdulillah if I don't do it I'm not sinful it's up to me when we come to mandatory acts and you don't want to pray in the Masjid it's prayer time and you don't want to pray until it's almost out of time because you don't want your friends to say oh he's a pray pray for us she pray for go go and pray pray for us and they make fun of you n n this is a serious thing and it can be and it can be more than that depending but in leaving voluntary things when there is a legitimate reason or just simply because you don't want to do it this is not a problem inshallah uh"
