  "transcript": "brother Ibrahim from South Africa is asking about why Allah is referring to himself as we in the Quran Allah asael if you read the Quran refers to himself as I or refers to himself with the pronoun we and this is a well-known way in Arabic all Arabs know this that in order to glorify someone or when someone is in a prestigious place he refers to himself that we so the king or the queen could say that we the Queen of England have decided to do this and that we the king of so and so want to establish this and that so when he says we as a king he's not referring to the government he's not referring to his family he is referring to himself as the king and Allah is the only one worthy of being glorified and being praised subhana wa ta'ala so when Allah talks about himself that we have revealed the vi and we are the Protectors of it this is referring to Allah as uh uh the only uh uh provider for Humanity Allah the only creator creat of humanity Allah the only sustainer for all uh uh this universe"
