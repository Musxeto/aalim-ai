  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim masala - uh Sarah mother so didn't Kadeem welcome to our first episode of licensed Norman's I'm your host use of karma where we'll be discussing life's adornments the beauty of this life often times when we hear adornments we think of well if you think of materialistic things however there are things in life there are more valuable than money things that will benefit SNS life in the next as Allah subhana WA Ta'ala said l met with the noon zina - hiya to dunya also in another Isle Osprey Nevada says giulianelli nesaja wotty - eh eh well Benny so in this beautiful episode in the series we'll be discussing the wealth of children how precious children are and how do we properly invest in these in the end this in this and this valuable thing think something is invaluable that will benefit us in this life in the next so we have on this wonderful series with us here our Sheikh our teacher sheikha awesome document and Hakim and as we know our Sheikh awesome is a teacher at that Academy is also a teacher at knowledge International University and he has been an imam and a hottie and a teacher for over 32 years what in the hell happened so far further they do with like we'd like to introduce our teacher and I guest Sheikh an awesome was that cool of here for having me and it's a pleasure being here that's an absolute pleasure so let's get directly into the manage a lot either what are some ways that we can invest and take care of the the valuable commodity of children in our offspring lot of men Rahim hamdulillah salat wa salam ala rasoolillah he wa alihi wa sahbihi were many that be who I'm about children are a gift from Allah so vision as you Shakalaka coated al mal you will burn wound zina too high at dunya wealth and offspring are the adornments of life now we're talking about life and not the Hereafter so on earth this is a transitional period we live of an average between 60 and 70 years as the Prophet said adding is a lot of sin and yet while living this life we think that we are here to stay and this is not true eventually we have to die and when we die as the kids know game over well actually it's not over it's over on earth but the real game the real life starts after death so what we are doing at the moment on this earth is investing we're investing our times we're investing our wealth we are investing our health yet some of us may be wasting all of that so allah azza wajal is telling us something that all humans agree so if you ask the vast majority of people what is your wish in life the vast majority would say dinero's money we want green banknotes this is what counts this is what I can buy a private air a jet plane I can buy a mansion I can marry the most beautiful woman even if I'm the most ugliest guy on earth this is what makes people happy so they think but Allah Azza WA JAL acknowledges this and tells us that it is among the adornments of life this is a separate issue which will not go and discuss what we are interested in discussing is the issue of offspring children any couple would hope and wish to be blessed with a child and this is universal whether it's in China or it's in Europe it's the same thing it's a human nature that we try to reproduce it's in us maybe a guy is a responsible person yet he would like to have an offspring of his own so Islam looks at this fact acknowledges it but like all types of desires and needs for humans it channels it it utilizes it so human beings they seek to have their pleasure through sexual relationships Islam doesn't tell you you cannot have this you must not have this you must purify yourself and remain celibate I think they call it yeah without getting married no no no and at the same time it tells you do not engage in fornication like animals it channels it into telling you you have to go through what is known as a marriage institution get married fulfill your desires through halal means so Islam looks at this and channels it for us the offspring is one of the things that Islam has placed a lot of responsibility and there are so many types of etiquettes that governs how to take care of your children from the very beginning from the very start and this is why allah azzawajal says in the quran oh and Fusako what aleikum protect yourselves and your families which includes the wives the spouses and the offspring from what from Hellfire so Allah is giving us this warning twice in the Koran to protect us ourselves and our offspring and families from Hellfire so how to do that this is a sha Allah what we will try to explain from the very very beginning which is even before having offshore I made to remember a story of a man a very famous story the man who came to I'm gonna shut up and he was complaining about his son being naughty and I'm gonna cut up as we know he was going to punish his son he had a low tolerance for foolishness and the young boy said you know before you punish me could you at least tell me what are the rights of the the parents on a child or does the child have rights over the parents rather and he said yes the first one is that the father should marry a righteous spouse he said the second one is that he should give him a good name and the third is that he should teach him something from al-quran or from Keith Emerson and he's and a young boy said as for my mother she's a fire worshipper and he said the second thing my father named me Jordan which is a cockaroach mm-hmm a little cockroach or a beetle or a beetle a little bug or something like this and the third thing he said my father never taught me anything from the Quran so I the the story mentions you said that you you disobeyed him before he disobeyed you so many times we are asking Allah spinoza allah for blessings whether it's money whether it's offspring whether its position it's a job opportunity but with those blessings come responsibility as you mentioned correct so as we are asking allah subhana wa ta'ala for blessings how are we at the same time preparing ourselves to have gratitude for those blessings to preserve those blessings to increase it to make sure that we are properly thanking allah sunnatullah forth and showing responsibility for it so beginning from the very first step in choosing a spouse and creating the proper ba if you will environment to bring a child into it how do we prepare for those things well this leads the series of its own yeah and I remember that one of the scholars it might be Matic have been nebby or someone else he was approached by a man a newly Wed so he said sure I'd like to raise my child upon the right and correct way to be righteous and to be among the Salif whay followers so I said how old is your child he said four months old no no said you're too late mm-hmm so this is an eye-opener in order to have righteous offspring there are prerequisites not necessarily that these prerequisites can be fulfilled and also not necessarily when fulfilled the results will be positive you have no peace be upon him everything was fulfilled except that Allah did not will his son to be among the saved and righteous so he died a kafir no one can accuse no peace be upon him that he did not do the right thing or not did not who failed to bring his son are all of Allah he's a messenger among the strong willed messengers so there are means we have to try and achieve them fulfill them and make dua that Allah accepts them and at the end of the day we may be or it might it might be fruitful but if it's not it is definitely reward Apple so even if you fail in fulfilling your objectives in this life your are certain to be rewarded not only that you won't be held accountable because as you said with great responsibilities come with great powers come great responsibilities by the way I googled this once I was thinking who scholar which scholar did this and I was shocked to find that it was in spider-man comic books so yeah with great powers come great responsibilities so I tried to help the best to refrain from using that phrase but it's true yeah yeah it's reached so we take the wisdom wherever he is maybe a some Tobia in the book yeah so this is good so prior to a person have a child should they engage in a sort of like test gear to nuts or something like this and within themselves even before they go to engage they're getting married into having children and things with nature first of all this cannot be an objective hmm this by itself is the essence of Islam so no one does this in order that Allah would grant him of a righteous offspring because if you're not righteous yourself you can't have this intention because then you won't won't be worshipping Allah properly so your intention is to be sincere to be a practicing Muslim to be a role model in order to please Allah and once Allah is pleased with you things will definitely develop so first of all yes look at the story of a pillar with Moosa and the two orphans allah azza wajal preserved the treasure for them under a wall which was about to collapse so when i Hildur built it up again and moves to ask why are you doing this for free he said that their father and in some interpretations of tafseer their seventh grandfather law was righteous and allah al wanted to bless these two orphans because of the righteousness of their father or their seventh grandfather which means that yes if you are righteous on your own this would resonate it would radiate goodness to all of your offspring Muhammad Allah we're going to pause for a short break and we will return back for more of this episode and Charlotte Radha you all benefit we will see you students they say stay tuned [Music] welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we've been talking thus far about making the investment and up raising children and up raising righteous offspring now as we talk about an investment of course in economics everyone wants to know what is the return on my investment why am i investing so much time so much effort blood sweat and tears and making sure that I have righteous offspring so we would like to ask our guest and I teach her she got some what are the merits would are the incentives for a person to read watches offspring okay there are so many and if you recall in the beginning we talked about how many years are left for us on earth and the average lifespan of a person on earth after our death each and every one wants to leave a legacy yeah so movie actors their legacy is the movies they leave behind not knowing that this would add to their sins while they are dead in their graves because it's continuous a songwriter does the same thing with this song someone who builds a monument or a building and it lasts for centuries this is a legacy a painting of Michelangelo or of da Vinci when you see the Mona Lisa Wow this is their legacy as Muslims our legacy is focused on three things which the Prophet is a lot solemn beautifully illustrated when he said when an individual dies all his good deeds of course and bad deeds but we're talking about good deeds are cut with the accept accept exception of three number one continuous charity and what we mean by continuous charity building a message it yes so this is continuous because people are benefiting from this particular good deed every single day 360 days a year Allah knows how many years then he says beneficial knowledge and this is for Islamic knowledge so I write a book I give a lecture that people circulate this program of ours is part of beneficial knowledge inshallah I hope it's beneficial of their friend so even throughout the years people click on YouTube they see the program they manage to utilize it and upbringing their children in Islamic way we both of us are being paid Sharla while we are in our graves thirdly the Prophet said oh Salaam and a righteous offspring making dua for you whether a boy or a girl valid in solid Rula wallet in arabic refers to both genders men and women boys and girls Allah says in Surat Annisa chapter 4 you see Kamal no fee I will add the accommodate that carry miserable insane a lot of the Arabs nowadays think that well it means a boy a male which is not true so this is one of the biggest merits that when you die and people see your children they say Oh Masha a lot of Arak Allah whose son is this they say well the son of Ahaz I'm Masha Allah may Allah have mercy on his soul he managed to raise a righteous Imam a good Mujahid a good scholar a good human being the the worse it could be he's a good human being no sins in public and the guy is moral conduct is excellent likewise with girls but if it's the opposite then you are and this is bad news because if he was an evil child they said I would have been laughs what kind of a man is he what kind of a woman is she their deviant they're bad they're evil whose father are theirs and they say well Asha handsome is our who to build and they curse you or if they say something about bad about you so one of the biggest merits is that you leave a legacy behind us or if we were to move on there is a second merit out of investing in your children is that you managed to convey and relay the message so the Prophet says Allah is also an authentic hadith whoever directs others to goodness Allah will reward him with the amount of goodness they do without deducting any of their rewards so I teach my child al-fatiha and this is by the way one of the problems and the means of dispute among righteous spouses a man and his wife they fight over who teaches their son the Fatiha first because they know the reward so the mother says no no I'm gonna teach my son at fatiha and I'm gonna spend with him like six hours a day just to make him repeat it so that throughout his life whenever resat recites the fatiha I'll be accredited for it and the father says no no I'll take him to the fifth circle in the Masjid where they teach him and I'll get the reward and inshallah both of them are rewarded but imagine when you manage to install and program your child to say ashhadu an la ilaha illa ma I remember a lot of good righteous couples teaching there two years old child to say la ilaha illallah la ilaha illallah i saw once a sister and her child was maybe a year and a half or two years she asks him the question of the prophetess of Salaam which a lot of the grown-ups don't even acknowledge she says to him I in Allah which translates to where is Allah and the child who is barely able to speak he does this fist Emma fists Emma and fists Emma the preposition feet has two meanings by the way either to be included in like when I say fee JB in my pocket and this is definitely not intended here because nothing of Allah's creation can't surround him and the second meaning is on top so fists Emma meaning on top of the Highness so Allah is the high there's nothing above him subhana WA Ta'ala so children of this young age they know this why because the parents are programming are teaching are installing in their child to have these wonderful meanings so whatever you teach your child or an prayer fasting moral conduct and the child adopts it you get rewarded for that these are some of what we have more if you wish sure I'm taking about here we have the hadith about everyone being a sort of a shepherd responsible for their own flock so this can go either either way you know if you inshaa allah to raise righteous children you get the reward of that but if it goes the opposite way you can also you know take on sins and take on the ice in which they were disobedient Allah subhanAllah Tejada so in this in this regard to which degree is a father or a mother responsible for the child what are some things that you can do to ensure that I have fulfilled my Amana my right and whatever you do after this is on you or there's this extent a certain age in America we have this thing where when a child is 18 I'm free you know like new your own you're an adult now and an Islam is not like this so how do we navigate these these sort of well our chef heels of this is problematic simply because there isn't any specific age limit and there isn't any clear directive it is our responsibility to Shepherd to take care of those who are under us so as long as my son or daughter are living under my roof eating from my food they must abide by my instructions out of as a father yeah and this is one of the biggest problems in upbringing the children because your fingers are not alike they're different though they're mine and it's in my hand yeah likewise your children are not the same some of them are obedient and kind and humble and these are the coolness of the eyes and the heart to their parents I have children that I make two hour for every single night because they're so loving and caring that I would give my life for them and unfortunately there are children who are disobedient who are rebellious and not only they are disobedient and rebellious to my orders instructions as a father but to a large commands and to the prophets teachings are they his salatu wassalam so this is a big problem can we draw the line and say well they chose this course of life to themselves or not this is an issue of each D hat some look at it and say that no you can't that you are the Shepherd and either do you follow your way or the highway but this is not applicable unless your way is the way of the Orang the sinners not because Simon Says so if they're disobedient to Allah so that a new instructor you order them and they fail to comply and you take a stance you're on the right track but again there has to be diplomacy there has to be weighing the pros and cons so that you don't take an impulsive decision you regret to the rest of your life yet again it is an important issue to be tackled and it's not one glove that fits all you have to look in each each and every scenario separately and independently Thank You sugar awesome we benefited much from your extensive knowledge today in your wisdom unfortunately this is the end of our episode but we think our guests for joining us and our episode of life's adornments charlotta Alice stay tuned for our next episode before I wouldn't forget Gotham thank you very much and
