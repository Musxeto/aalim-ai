  "transcript": "uh she my question is regarding uh you know such beliefs which Indian people have so what they think is if he do not help some people or if he do not if he leave people who are if you leave people in despair in in desperateness it may affect us it may affect our knowledge if if we if the person is asking us for money uh and we don't give them and that might affect our wealth and such things what is the Islamic perspective on this and is believing all such things sh or know stuff like that thank you this is too generic the examples you gave generally speaking because your question is generic there's no such thing if you break someone's heart we don't believe in what is known as karma and that your heart is going to be broken no this is not how it works in Islam because we believe that every action has a reaction but this reaction might be in this life it might be on the day of judgment so there's no concept of Karma in Islam likewise if someone begs us for money and we don't give them nothing would happen to us especially if this is a professional beggar or he does not qualify to be given sodaka he's just a gold digger so thinking of things that are not mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah is a breach of Iman and a sign of weakness of trust in Allah and this is why you find people so uh anxious they have uh uh anxiety attacks and afraid if something happens oh if I don't do this Allah may do this and that to me where did you get this from these are yeah uh uh superstitions that are baseless and we should not believe in that"
