  "transcript": "says if someone dies while paying a debt and at the funeral someone comes and says the deceased owed him x amount of money should we pay him even if he has no proof as the funeral cannot be done without clay clearing debts the answer is no you don't have to pay him for a claim whose opponent is not present if there are two opponents one says this person took money from me this person says i didn't take any money from him we go to the prosecutor the one who's claiming and we say provide us with evidence he says i don't have any witnesses and nothing is written we go to the defendant and say swear you did not borrow anything from him if he swears then he's exempted and the case is closed when the defendant is dead he cannot defend himself so there is no other alternative but to go to this person claiming and say either provide us with a written document that the deceased did borrow money and he signed on it or bring two witnesses to testify that they've witnessed such a transaction if he fails to do so you're not obliged to give him a single penny you"
