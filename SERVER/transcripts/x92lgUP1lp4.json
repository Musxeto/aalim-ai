  "transcript": "and we have Rosalyn and she or he I don't know Roslyn I am presuming that he is a brother he says can you comment on the dress code that a lot of the young females wear nowadays when they adopt to wear tight jeans and tight tops with only a headscarf and because they want the society to accept this as permissible so he says that I've seen this dress code in the Maldives and Malaysia Indonesia etc well I would add to that in Egypt and Jordan in Morocco in so many countries is this acceptable the answer is no this is not acceptable at all the Prophet said in an authentic hadith alayhi salat WA Salam there are two types of the dwellers of Hellfire that I had not seen yet so the Prophet I assume is giving us a prophecy of two types of among the people in hell these people are condemned to hell why because of what they do and what are the characteristics of these two people Oh prophet of Allah he told us about women who are dressed yet naked and when they walk they are tilted and make others tilted as well and their hairs are worn as the camel's back so it's like the hump of a camel so now the Prophet ISM is describing to us a woman who is dressed but naked scholar said that these two though seem to contradict one another yet it is visible a woman who wears tight clothes leggings and tight tops is actually dressed with such piece of cloth yet she's naked because it shows her body structure and her curves and likewise a woman who is wearing a dress that is ample and loose yet it is see-through so she is dressed in a sense that she has a dress on but she's actually naked because we can see everything that is underneath these girls who wear tight jeans and they cover their hair actually what they're doing is totally prohibited and the only thing or the only reason they're covering their hair not because the Koran says so or the Sunnah says so definitely not simply because they're lazy to make their hair up is so untidy it needs a lot of fixing and washing and oiling and conditioners and shampooing etc and they're too lazy to do this so they wear this headscarf not because they feel Allah Azza WA JAL because a woman who does this and wears a tight shirt or a tight t-shirt or a jeans definitely she doesn't feel a lot that was you she's exposing everything that a lot older to hide and conceal and this is a problem dominating these societies because the parents are letting go and this is not only limited to these countries it's happening even in the Gulf area in the in the core of Muslim lands it is happening and it's taking place and we see it and we regret it and we warn people of falling into this trap of Satan but no one is willing to listen and and hear with their hearts people are neglecting Quran and Sunna all what they see is and actresses singers males and females and they take them as role models so they want to look like them but they have a very thin string connecting connecting them to Islam so maybe this hair cover would be that string but it is very vulnerable and it can be cut any time so they should fear allah azza wajal"
