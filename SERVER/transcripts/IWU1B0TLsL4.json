  "title": "Does touching one's private parts nullify the wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says does your wood will break if you touch your private part after making Woodill this is an issue of dispute among scholars because there are two hadiths one of them stated that a man came to the prophet irresolute salam and he said that if a man touches his private part should he perform moodle in one hadith the Prophet said yes and another hadith the Prophet said it is a part of your body it's like any other organ in your body so scholars differed whether one is more authentic than the other or not and whether one abrogated the other or not and they have a lot of dispute and discussion regarding these two hadith it seems and Allah knows best and this is the opinion of share happiness they mean to combine both hadith that we would assume that touching the private part nullifies your Woodill if you touch it with desire and lust and if you touch it as you touch your hand or your thigh or any other part of your body without any feeling or desire then this does not nullify your rule and allah azzawajal knows best"
