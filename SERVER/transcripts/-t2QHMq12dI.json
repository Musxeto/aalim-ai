  "transcript": "in my country when there is an Islamic event like a like an Islamic Gathering after the event ends some Scholars pray to Allah saying that oh Allah send our Good Deeds that we have earned here as a gift to the prophet salallahu sallam and the sahabas and the and the righteous people so uh is this act of sending our Good Deeds as a gift to others is this is this is this a permissible thing no this is not permissible at all because it's an act of Bida it's an innovation how do you know your Deeds were accepted so that you go and sending it to the prophet Islam and to the companions first of all second of all whether you like it or not any good deeds you do that are according to the Quran the Sunnah who taught it who brought it who showed us how to do it it's a prophetizer so by default whatever we do it is accredited to the prophet whether we give it or not so such an act that some scholars in your country or elsewhere may be involved in and in giving their good deeds and and whatever they had done and the Dua to the prophet and the companions may Allah be pleased with them this is an innovation and it's prohibited and not permissible"
