  "transcript": "it says that he's in his fourth year of uni and he has one year to go he met a girl he wants to get married to her his parents refuse and they insist that he graduates first and i've asked him can you afford to get married and he said no i don't have enough money to uh get married so i said to him that what can i do for you so he replied by saying can we get the marriage contract done without consummating the marriage of course you can as a man you don't need the permission of your father and your mother you don't need the permission of your guardian because men don't have guardians the permission of the guardian is only required if the woman's guardian is there so it takes two to tango as they say without music of course music is haram they have to be or spouses so let's let me go back to the topic it takes two approvals for marriage of a woman her consent and the consent of her father who is her guardian usually without one of these two consents the marriage is invalid so if the father says i will get you married tomorrow to xyz he's a good man and she refuses the marriage is invalid and if she comes and says that i want to marry my colleague or my friend or my neighbor and the father says no you cannot marry him the marriage is still invalid so it takes two to get this marriage done of uh two approvals for you if you propose to the family of the girl and the father says yes i have no problem in doing the marriage contract without consummating the marriage for a whole year so that you guys can see one another and have halal relationships without falling into haram and communicating and talking is halal because she's your wife there's no problem in that none whatsoever"
