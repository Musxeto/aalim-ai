  "title": "Made mistake in fatiha that may change meaning Do I repeat salah or repeat the word? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um if during Salah um when we say Surah fa if we make a mistake that may change the meaning or it may not change the meaning on accident must we repeat it in the Salah or we must break the Salah and start again first of all it is not permissible to break the Salat once you've started the Salat if you made a mistake you Rectify your mistake so you don't break the Salat and repeat it because this is not from the Sunnah it's not right and this is how Shan messes up with your head secondly most people who ask such questions don't know Arabic and hence don't know whether their mistake changed the meaning or not so the default is it did not change the meaning if you made a mistake and you know it's a blatant clear mistake then rectify the same word that you made the mistake immediately and move on you don't have to repeat the whole fa so if you made a mistake in one word and you identified it immediately just read that word correctly and move on and recite the rest of the suras and continue your prayer thirdly a lot of the mistakes done are not mistakes I do a lot of counseling sessions and a lot of those who come to me say sheh I made a mistake that changed the meaning and the prayer is invalid and they start weeping and crying and I bang bang give them two slaps on the face it's not permissible to slap the face but they're not in front of me so it's a metaphorical gesture and I wake them up and I say you don't know Arabic how do you know you made a mistake recite it to me and they recite it to me perfectly like Arabs I don't know I I made a mistake I thought said duh it's the same and the guy said no no I said said okay I should have said you're making me confused I need counseling sessions now this is the same really Oh I thought I did a mistake and I was repeating the Salat like gazillion times did this is how shatan messes up with your head so don't listen you have a doubt go to the Sheikh and ask him the IM of the Masjid an Arab and they will tell you everything is fine there is no need to worry about anything if you have doubts but once you know that your doubts are baseless you just shrug your shoulders and move on without paying any attention"
