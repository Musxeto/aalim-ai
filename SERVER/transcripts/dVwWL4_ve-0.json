  "transcript": "what are my thoughts [Music] the only difference I can say between k-pops male and female is the length of the hair because their men look like they're women but the only difference is the hair is a little bit longer for women I think I don't know K-pop I've never listened to it in my life I never watched it and it is so silly if you get positivity from such people who number one they evade paying taxes number two most likely they will commit suicide and I think one or two of them committed already suicide I read somewhere that they committed suicide these people don't have God to believe in they don't have ethics right or wrong and shaytan beautifies them in your eyes but you don't know who they are it's the same thing with celebrities with famous people you think that Sheikh so and so he's a celebrity oh he's mashallah number one he's this you don't know him you don't know how he is with his wife with his children you don't know how he is with his driver and mate you don't know how he is with his employees how he deal with them you cannot judge people by just seeing them on a video clip or on the TV Allah is the judge the K-pop Muslims or non-muslims how you as a Muslim who believe in Allah believe in Muhammad follow such people who say no no no Muhammad is a liar Muhammad is not rasul he's not a messenger Quran is not true this is their belief how can I respect people and follow people such as this secondly music is Haram in Islam dancing is Haram in Islam being or imitating the disbelievers is harm in Islam So when you say that this there is positivity if you cannot get positivity from Quran and from Sunnah you are doomed those who say we watch soap operas and we watch movies because we learn from them you cannot learn except from Quran and the Sunnah this is why Allah sent you Muhammad sallallahu to teach you and to be your role model if you take anyone else as a role model you will not succeed"
