  "title": "Must we rub our body parts when performing ghusl or wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from india says do we have to rob when we perform russell and also when we perform rubbing is highly recommended because it ensures the cleansing of the organs and ensures that the water has reached it but if you simply stand under the shower and you take a thorough rustle under the shower without touching your whole body but you are certain that each and every area of your body is wet or if you dip in the ocean or in the river and come out after rinsing your mouth and nose your russell is totally valid even if you did not rub your body"
