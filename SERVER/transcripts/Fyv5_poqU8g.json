  "transcript": "permissible I hope I I pronounced the name right says that jager in U gur is made in very big kadia that is a big pot and these pots are not covered and not washed sometimes dogs lick these pots and again Juggy is made in these unclean pots is this jery permitted to eat I heard dogs saliva is nabak or NIS so I think that the questioner is asking about a meal that is prepared in big uh uh pots and these pots are usually uncovered and never washed and dogs come and lick from these pots so is it NIS is it impure the answer is yes the greatest impurity is the impurity of the dog saliva when it licks in a pot or a dish or a plate in utensils this is the grand impurity why because you have to wash it once with soil and seven times with water while normal impurities such as urine you simp L wash it squeeze it and that's it and the minor impurity is the urine of a child less than two years of age who is breastfeeding and did not eat and it has to be male you don't have to wash the urine of such a male child you just simply pour water over it sprinkle it and that's it you don't have to squeeze it and and do that again so such a meal this in made in or this jaggery is prohibited for you to eat because the pot and the food in it are all considered to be impure and you have to throw it uh out"
