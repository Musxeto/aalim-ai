  "transcript": "so I used to work for a company I'm part of the uh Team activity is we will go out to a restaurant once a month and uh most of the restaurant will go to my teammates will be eating pork and stuff like that so I became very uncomfortable with it and I told my manager that I wouldn't be able to go with them anymore so they compromise they said okay we go to all restaurant sometime I go to mainstream restaurant but every time we go to a live restaurant some of my team member they don't like the food they wouldn't go and when they go to a mainstream restaurant I wouldn't go so my my manager thought I'm not a team member so they were very uncomfortable with it but anyways when the co started I was one of the team that is fired but before that I spoke to one of the IMS in the country that I was there and they said that you know sometime we need to compromise a little that it's not alcohol because it's Pok you can sit at the same table and things like that but anyway they fired me at the time so I'm Looking Back Now was I extreme with my decision did I do the right thing for not joining them or I should have first of first of all you must not ask people who are not knowledgeable this Imam who told you that you can share the table with people who are eating pork is definitely ignorant you cannot share the table with someone who is doing Haram and you're watching it and noticing it and still being there with them this is totally prohibited secondly you cannot share the table with the opposite gender so a business lunch or a business dinner with men and you're a woman this is not permissible for you to attend if they are your cousins male cousins it's Haram for you to attend let alone a business lunch or dinner or a celebration once a month so no you're not extremist you have to segregate yourself from being with the opposite gender because this defies the purpose of hijab and it goes against Islam"
