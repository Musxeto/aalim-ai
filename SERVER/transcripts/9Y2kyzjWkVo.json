  "transcript": "I'm a student in the 12th grade uh please advise on which of the following path leads to Greater reward and brings one closer to Allah dedicating oneself to Islamic Studies and engaging in dawa or pursuing a career in medicine while also acquiring Islamic knowledge and actively engaging in daa which of these holds more virtue According to Islamic teachings it is not one size that fits all sometimes people are not qualified for Islamic stud in da they don't have it in them and I've seen people so enthusiastic wanting to learn da and they want to go to Islamic University in Medina or J IM in RI or inim or in here and there and they go the first year second year then they're homesick what are you doing I can't stay it's too much I miss my mom's briyani I just want to go and you're here for da you're dedicated for Islam so no no okay if you need someone to change your Pampers go go back so he wasted two three years and he goes back home and he doesn't have a plan B to fall back on and everybody who was with him in high school they already in third or fourth uh year medicine or engineering or business this guy doesn't know what's he's capable of so I said no you're not qualified if he's qualified he said listen I'm 100% dedicated for da I love Islam I've memorized Quran when I was 12 years of age And I memorized the books of Hadith when I was 14 oh wow this is a highly decorated and Scholar to be no no no no no go and pursue knowledge and he says I know if I get a ba in Islamic Studies and maybe Masters and may PhD I'm going to be paid 10% of what a doctor gets or an engineer I don't care I want I want Allah's pleasure I want to help people I want to teach people I want to be someone that's qualified so you're the man you're a boy so I'd like Q to continue someone else he says I struggle in memorizing Al how long you been Muslim say 20 years but I you know when I say the faat I make mistakes but I want to study Islam so no no please don't study Islam gonna make a problem for us how are you in biology said she I'm A+ I'm good no go and study medicine and while study medicine improve your Islamic Studies and learn but you excel in medicine so what would I do if I have a thousand Scholars teaching Quran andah and Hadith while not a single medical doctor and what would I do when I have a thousand medical doctors and without one IM giving fatwas and leading the prayer and and and and helping the community it's an issue of balance so it's not one size fits all what's in you what are you capable of and this is why I say to the people from outside my advice to you if you're not this top niche of a highly decorated student of knowledge if you're an an average yoke I would say get your degree in engineering medicine physics whatever then apply for Islamic uh uh University degree because then you would have a plan B to fall back to if you need to fall back to something"
