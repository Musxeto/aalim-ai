  "transcript": "how to become islamic scholar like you why would you want to trouble yourself like this what is your intention this is what we always tell people sure i would like to be a dairy like you i would like to be a scholar like you i would like to be famous like you uh-huh then you have a problem with your intention all dies when they started in their in their acquiring knowledge being students of knowledge they had only one intention in mind to please allah so all of us dies we are supposedly not after recognition or fame or doing something which causes the wow factor people of public relations know this the wow factor that draws attention because once a day does this then cross him out he's not a real daring or a student of knowledge not a scholar and if you want to be a scholar like me i'm not a scholar i'm a student of knowledge scholars like even bas even if they mean these mega people who are like mountains these are called scholars me and tom dick and harry who are popular on facebook on youtube and you see them on tv channels we're not scholars we're propagators of islam we have little knowledge more than you and allah gave us and blessed us with the ability to explain and to be convincing and in sha allah we are steadfast on the methodology the way that the manhattan of the prophet salaam the companions that have been in the tablet simple as that so if your aim to please allah yeah that's good whether you become a scholar or not this is beside the point what counts is what gets you inside jannah in the highest level of jannah this is what counts but if you want to be recognized to be pointed at whenever you walk through so-and-so the scholar so so the the famous person i've seen you before then this is a breach of sincerity and an accusation to your intention and therefore if you want to become a student of knowledge and if you want to get closer to allah you need to learn and start from the basics you have to start from the language of the quran arabic without arabic you cannot reach places you cannot understand the quran unless i interpret it to you and explain it to you you cannot understand the hadith unless the translator explains to it to you and sometimes he does not do a good job so many times translators make grave mistakes and you are a student of knowledge you don't know arabic and you take the word for it and you make you fall in the same mistake and so on after that you have to learn the quran you have to at least recite one jujo every single day so you finish the quran every single month other than ramadan you contemplate you memorize you read that if you read the hadith of the prophet from different sources you know what's authentic what is not authentic and you know what is what has the scholars explain this hadith because so many times we read the hadith you don't know the context we don't know when it was said why was it said in such a fashion etc so you go to the books of the scholars and you read it then you know also and you have the fundamentals of and the rules and regulations that govern these understandings of the jurors and you go to normal and there are so many other branches that you need to have knowledge in not necessarily turning you off by just mentioning them in less than a couple of minutes and then he said whoa i will never reach that level i will never ever finish all of this this is nonsense if you do it bit by bit you will reach there the journey of a thousand mile miles begins with one step especially if you're making dua puts barakah in your time and there are many many ways to acquire knowledge and to balance your time in reading the seerah when you're fed up in reading some specific sciences when you have a conference or a seminar coming up to prepare for this is what a student of knowledge does he prepares he takes notes he asks so i have for example on my youtube channel allah favored me and blessed me with um which i did in mumbai about eight nine ten years ago for peace tv the whole series is the first to my knowledge to be recorded on high definition cameras in a workshop-like setup and it covers the entire from purity till um yeah uh judging things and transactions and divorce marriage uh custody things that deals with uh prescribed punishments the whole nine yards and it's found for free on youtube so you can watch one every day it's about 190 episodes you can watch it take notes and ask your local scholars about the ruling on such things that you did not understand and within five months time maybe you would have covered the whole the and you would have understanding that is 95 better than any other muslim with the grace of allah"
