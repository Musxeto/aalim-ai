  "title": "Can we use cosmetics that have animal ingredients? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is can we buy Cosmetics which has animal derived ingredients in them because we don't know whether it's from animals that are Haram or from animals that were not slaughtered correctly and do we need to check the ingredients of Cosmetics before we buy them first of all Cosmetics makeups and the likes are used externally they're not used or consumed so the worst that could happen is that before you pray you have to remove it if it's nudges if it's impure secondly the default is everything is halal to be used until proven otherwise do you think I went and checked the ingredients of my clothes before buying it no why I'm buying clothes maybe there is some pork in it maybe they put some dead cows or the eyeballs of lizards and I could care less it is halal till proven otherwise otherwise I'm gonna cast doubt upon myself on everything I use and this is not the Simplicity and ease of Islam thirdly if there were to be animal derivatives or ingredients or substances or materials in these cosmetics they say that it should have most likely undergone a vigorous process of changing its nature to a different substance known as so when things change their chemical and physical characteristics and are transformed into a different material altogether this becomes Halal like the fokaha the jurors jajuras usually give an example of a dog falling into a salt pit and after a month we come and find that the dog is no longer exists all what we see is salt so every single every single particle in that dog has a dissolved and transformed into salt and it's not existing anymore as a dog but it's a different substance all together they say that this is pure without a problem and Allah Knows Best you"
