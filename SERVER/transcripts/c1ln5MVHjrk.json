  "title": "Is it allowed to read morning evening adhkar, other duas, Quran from transliteration assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I know I know that it is forbidden to read Quran from the uh Roman script the transliteration but as I am a reward I read all the atars like the morning and evening atar in the nighttime atar after the uh Salah atar from the translation and since I have been doing this for a long time and these are repeative I have almost memorized many atar through the so should I continue like this or stop doing each and every atar and wait for maybe 5 to 6 months till I learn Arabic at least to read this duas first of all the problem with transliteration is with the Quran because we are ordered and instructed to preserve the Quran in its original form in the transcription so writing it in Roman letters defies this by all means and it distorts the Quran and its writing and this is why it's totally prohibited this is for those who write it on the other side those who are reverts who do not know Arabic who have no access to reading the Quran except through transliteration we say due to necessity it's okay for you to read it through transliteration providing you hear it simultaneously so that you don't make any mistakes because if you read the Roman or the English alphabet it definitely misses a huge number of Arabic alphabets so you will not be able to say it correctly unless you hear it then you can match things up this is for the Quran as for thear of the morning and the evening and the other this is much much easier and it's much much lenient there no problem in doing that none whatsoever inshallah"
