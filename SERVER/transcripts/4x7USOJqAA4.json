  "transcript": "foreign not for this book but for the concept of this book Muslims don't need to know nuclear science don't need to know politics economy they need to go to the basics and our biggest problem is our knowledge and the basics is zero anyone you ask them about the pillars of Iman the 561 usually talks to you about they would say oh shahada Salat say no no stupid this Islam excuse my French I just came from Indonesia right they speak French there sometimes anyhow so they mix our candle Islam with our candle Iman without their Canada Iman you're not a Muslim so if you don't know the basics you have a problem with your Islam No matter what you do in your life you'll always have depression you always have problems you always have anxiety attacks because you don't know Islam and this brings us as the chairman uh yeah he kindly pointed out to my topic so what is my topic wallahi I was shocked yeah any of all people you asked me to come and talk about the alphabet yes I'm a linguist by education I have a degree in linguistics English so you want me to talk about the alphabet I will talk about the alphabet without any problem the issue for us as Muslims is very Crystal Clear homosexuality is huh not a single Muslim differs yeah and you find me one single Muslim says it's Halal I'll take him out of the fold of Islam he's not a Muslim because denying anything known from Islam by default even if you don't do it it's blatant kuffer I don't drink intoxicants I don't drink wine I don't drink Vodka tequila Scotch Black Label gin rum I don't know these things but if I say it's okay I don't drink but I think it's okay for others to drink this is kuffer it takes you out of the fold of Islam so what is our problem our problem now that the people are out of the field of basics in the beginning there was Adam and Eve peace be upon them Adam and Hawa this is the beginning man and a woman which was natural is marriage and humans lived for centuries only in this natural relationship then corruption came immorality came which is known as and they started fornicating out of the Constitution of marriage man and woman having sick sex having free relationship having a a illicit sexual intercourses between a man and a woman they were not satisfied and this is how shaytan works rule do not follow the steps of shaytan shaytan doesn't come to you in one go he comes step by step until you are ready like a an excellent Chef he marinates you before putting you in fire this is his objective he's one of the best chefs ever so now after illicit Haram relationships they're not happy they want to go to something extra so they came up with homosexuality man with a man woman with a woman something not natural will it stop no they have bestiality having Haram relations with an animal then what what what what do you expect from such people now our problem as Muslims is Crystal Clear what does Islam say about homosexuality it is prohibited it is Haram it is unnatural and Islam is not the only religion Christianity says the same Judaism says the same the difference is in their holy book it commands the execution and the stoning and the murder of those who do it in the Quran we don't have this Allah did not have a prescribed punishment so this is something related to the Muslim ruler not to you and me Muslims cannot go around in on the streets and in in campuses and malls looking for any homosexual to kill this is not Islam this is the role of the Muslim ruler whether he prescribes that he's to be executed or to throw be thrown in jail or be taken to rehab facility this is the Muslim ruler he has his laws to be implemented for us as Muslims we simply know that this is Haram end of the story what is our biggest problem today identity as Muslims because we don't know what is this I don't know what's this where is the book ah we don't know the foundation of Islam we don't know what Islam is we lost our identity and now alhamdulillah here in Malaysia you're fine relatively you're fine in countries like Europe North America USA and Canada they're totally distorted they don't know what they are what are you a lizard another one says my dinosaur you treat me as a dinosaur please talk to me as I want to be addressed so you say he said no no don't say he I'm not a he are you a she no okay are you an it what do I refer you to said say they you're one how is they said this is how I would like to be addressed this is stupid you like to be addressed it's your problem I'm not gonna address you except by as I identify you I under identify you as a male you are a male I identify you as a female you're a female but I will not identify you as you wish if I say to you I'm a black dude consider me to be one this is stupid so what is our problem today our problem now with the liberal Islam with the American Islam this is a new version of Islam 0.001 is very bad it's not good you know but it is there in Islam alhamdulillah we have everything everything clear Quran and Sunnah in America they have a new liberal Islam so now you have a gay Masjid in America I know this for 15 years ago I was debating with some people that time and they identified Sheikh so and so as the gay Imam Masha Allah what are you preaching Imam definitely not Quran Sunnah because you cannot even know the Quran with all what Allah has mentioned about this so nowadays they are trying to shove down our throats their American Islam and the biggest resistance of homosexuality is Islam because the vast majority of Muslims they go by the book if we can find the loophole we will take it but there is no loophole it is straight you cannot do homosexuality this is why if when they ask me to come and teach you the alphabet there aren't any left L G Plus One X Y Z no alphabets what what they took all the alphabets for them so what's left for us fuel there's here and there so we have to identify that the best defense of such immorality is Islam how to do this first of all they want to create an issue so there comes oh Islam is a very harsh religion if you're gay you're not a Muslim this is a false blatant lie homosexuality is not kufur is not shirk it's like any other sin homosexuality is like stealing money it is like drinking toxicants it is like committing adultery or fornication it's a sin so don't try to convince people that homosexual you're a cafe no you're not you're a Muslim because when they put this on a scale ah if you commit homosexuality you're a cafe you will create enemies against Islam Islam doesn't say anything about you getting out of the fold of Islam for such a sin but when you make Haram halal yes now you're going against the Quran against Allah's command whether you do it or not you come and say it is permissible to drink alcohol it is permissible to fornicate it is permissible to deal in riba tomorrow in riba and given River this is halal the moment you say this you exit the fold of Islam because this is something known from religion by default but someone says it is halal to listen to music do we take him out of the fold of Islam it's an issue of dispute no you're wrong you're sinful I'll prove it to you from the Quran and from the Sunnah but this is not the time but it's a sin if he disagrees and says no no I think it's okay it's Halal in this case we say that you're sinful but he's not a cafe because it's an issue of dispute homosexuality there is no dispute among any Muslim and as I said the biggest problem is when you come and object to the rulings of Islam and you say no this is freedom of choice I am inclined to be this or that and it's a natural feeling all of this is nonsense I don't care how you feel or how you are naturally inclined I care about what is your conviction and belief is homosexuality Haram yes or no yes you're a Muslim now you can be one of two someone who has the inclination someone who feels that I want to but I'm not doing anything I'm resisting so every time I get the feeling of touching Sheikh I I refrain is pulling his hand give me a break so I yeah I have this inclination but I resist I'm in Jihad I am rewarded Allah will give me great rewards because I am suppressing this evil feeling of shaytan and likewise in everything pornography uh the attempt to lie to cheat to Do's Haram things and you suppress it you're in Jihad this is the beauty of our religion okay what about if I Fell in This sin and I have done it you have committed a major sin so what to do to do repent ask Allah for forgiveness return to Allah and Allah will accept you not only that he will transform your sins into Good Deeds foreign all my bad sins your bad your major your minor Allah will transform them as in Surah al-fur Khan at the very end the last page those who ask Allah for forgiveness and they repent and they do good deeds switch I have a million bad Deeds mashallah Credit One Million Good Deeds this is one interpretation and second interpretation no your bad Deeds such as shirk Allah will transform into the hate killing Allah will transform to safety fornication Allah will transform into Chastity these are two different opinions and both are valid and beautiful with the grace of Allah so regardless of your inclination it's either you're in Jihad or you're doing a major sin and you repent and Allah forgives you our problem is with the advocates with the flag bearers who are holding no come we have rainbow colors and they wear mashallah hand rests bands and and necklaces and t-shirts you find their backpack with what are you doing we have pride month and you Masha Allah in Malaysia wallahi in Saudi Arabia we were saying Malaysian people are men excuse the women we're not talking about females we're talking about two weeks ago there was this homosexual singer who kissed a singer on stage in Kuala Lumpur and the government immediately banned the festival and send them home in Saudi Arabia we're saying bagos this is the way this is how you protect your people and this is how you should stand firm on your beliefs not allowing such disbelievers and caffers and homosexuals to come and change your culture and change your relationship okay sure let's be frank if he's happy and I'm happy where are you why are you angry if two homosexuals are fine with it isn't it enough to have the consent and the agreement what do I say to him of course not agreement does not make Haram halal do you know riba Hassan give me a hundred thousand Ringgit I'll return it to you 110 next month good investment ten thousand in one month he's happy I'm happy Allah is not Allah is considering this as war against him though we are mutually have a consent also in Zina when a person has a Haram relationship with a girl and I get so many questions about this issue because it's a dangerous issue especially among the youth I know it's Haram but I was in a relationship for six years with a girl you know why you're coming to me we broke up Sheikh and now I'm heartbroken what to do how to get her back hello why you're coming to me seriously do you think I'm Dr Phil [Music] you are in Haram relationship and you admit it you still want to go back to it well why you're crazy so this is prevalent this is very widely spread among the youth and even if you don't have a girlfriend or girls don't have a boyfriend they're environment would say you're not normal why not have a boyfriend girlfriend you should have this they encourage you to do immorality they encourage you to sin this is why here is the best environment meaning a place where you come and sit with those who share with you the same conviction the same beliefs the same reference of Quran and Sunnah you don't speak in gibberish and they speak in Zimbabwe no no we speak the same language this is the right environment to be in and in relationships Allah says the unmarried woman or unmarried man found guilty of sexual intercourse lash each one of them with a hundred lashes flog them their Zina was consensual they were boyfriend girlfriend yet their punishment in Islam though this is natural the inclination of a man to a woman is natural in the inclination of a woman to a man is totally natural though you may not notice it every time someone calls me for fatwa on the phone and I say my wife says a woman huh how do you know he said if it's a man you say if it's a woman you soften your voice is I don't notice this but she alhamdulillah after 40 years of marriage this is like life life without parole you know it's a present sentence it's natural it's human nature This Is Why We Fight our nature because shaytan is always pushing the bar raising the bar a little bit huh what's your limit check my limit is here okay what about try here for Allah this is too much okay I'll wait for you I'll marinate you for one or two months you'll be ready and this is why you have to identify am I on the right straight path or not how do I know I don't change if you watch yourself and you're finding that oh last month I wasn't like this and the month before I wasn't like this I'm deteriorating you have a big problem run to the Sheikh to someone who will counsel you who will monitor you who will be your mentor to help you not from plunging into the mud but with when you don't have anyone when you're alone when you are Mr Perfect who do you have friends I don't need friends why oh this one is well hobby this one is selfie this one is this one is Sufi this is when this Shiri this one is nobody is good except me so you will never listen you never learn this is when shaytan hits you the hardest the prophet said the wolf only attacks a stray sheep when the ship is in the herd the wolf Waits okay I'm waiting until one ship comes and says I don't need the congregation I'm going for a smoke the ship goes the moment it lights a cigarette colors rest in peace the wolf had dinner mashallah and barbecue so you watch out because this is what shaytan does so if Allah orders us to flog those who have natural inclination but out of wedlock what do you think those who have unnatural inclination to the same gender same-sex this is even unnatural it is not even in your own nature the change is formed our Nature by the way has changed drastically imagine if I give water to a 70 year old child will he drink it yes if I give him juice will he drink it if I give him Cola so they find the taste and enjoy it if I give the seven-year-old a cigarette and he takes a puff what will happen either faint vomit or engage in a fit of coughing for half an hour why because it's not natural one week later another try five days later another try now he's a smoker the best smoke is after lunch Allah or with a glass of tea or coffee in the morning and they enjoy smoking in the bathroom yes you've been half an hour yeah just this last cigarette they enjoy what is not natural and this is how our nature our fitra has transformed we don't notice this we don't have someone to grab our hands and say watch out shaytan has reached a very high level with you he managed to do this and this and this and you don't know you don't have sincere people to come and advise you because if I come to advise you oh you don't know you're a dinosaur you come yeah I am I'm a dinosaur I was born in the previous century [Laughter] was born in the previous century so we are dinosaurs but we know Quran and Sunnah so the Quran that Allah revealed for all generations and all locations is still the same Quran it is the foundation of our Deen this is why you need to seek advice you need to seek a sincere guiding and touring about your religion why is homosexuality Haram now this question happens with every single thing in the Deen why is any answers why isn't it even numbers might as well make Madrid either four or two why three because Allah says so very easy okay then why this why that because Allah ordered it why homosexuality is Haram number one because it's not natural nowhere you will find an inclination in a normal person to the same gender I know people I was talking in a counseling session the other day yeah a few hours ago with a brother and I was saying to him in Malay in Indonesia every day they bring me a masseuse to make massage for me and he said oh I cannot allow a man to touch me I feel very weird but subhanallah if I bring you a female masseuse it's okay so yeah it's okay look how she yeah this is it is Haram in Islam but people when they don't have Quran and Sunnah to guide them they go astray so first of all it is not natural so when Allah tells you something he knows exactly what's good for you what a mechanic tells you that this car of yours I made it it needs this amount of fuel this amount of oil and you have to drive it in this way I know because I'm the mechanic knows what's best for us that's why he tells us this is prohibited and bad for you also homosexuality is the cause of mental and physical illnesses as for mental illnesses homosexuality is for someone who is mentally sick you have to admit this no one has the inclination to the same gender except someone who has a screw unscrewed it needs to be tightened in his head because this is not natural this is I don't know how you translate this and I think it's Universal it is yet those people enjoy it so this is psychological and mental illness as for the physical illness ask any doctor care for doctors they will show you herpes hey it's cephalus The Whole Nine Yards Cancer of of the rectum all of this is caused by homosexuality and if it's not today wait for a couple of weeks it will happen this is filth so this is one of the reasons and also it makes people who are engaged in homosexuality uh aggressive and their behavior and attitude is not normal and this is found in the West a lot and the therapist know this uh for sure now for us Muslims Quran is enough Allah says in the Quran and they who guard their private parts except from their wives or those their right hands possesses for indeed they will not be blamed so these are the two Halal your wives and right-hand possession right-hand possession today we don't have but inshallah we will have and okay what happens if this happens you will not be blamed but whoever seeks beyond that then those are the transgressors you do Zina Haram you do masturbation Haram you do homosexuality bestiality any form of fulfilling your sexual desire other than what Allah has permitted you to do you are transgressing and also Allah says in the Quran do you approach males among the worlds and leave what your lord has created for you as mate but you are a people transgressing this is not normal and look at the punishment that Allah has placed upon the people of loot punishment unlike any other Allah says so when our Command came we made the highest part of the city its lowest it was taken by the wing of Archangel jibril to the heavens and then flipped and then let go so they fell on their heads Allah says and reigned upon them stones of layered hard clay not only this this is enough they will die but as they're falling of clay said it was thrown at them and not only that this or these stones are marked by the name this is for John this is for Matthew this is for Luke it so happens in the Bible I have nothing to do with this but this is examples for the names a1's name was on that stone of clay and penetrating them and killing them and Allah says and it that is the punishment of Allah is not from the wrong doers very far what a warning wrongdoers it's not far from us if you follow suit you will have the punishment coming to you when this is with Allah but it will come so this is something we have to be careful but I don't think we need to we Muslims we're natural we know that this is wrong but the Sheikh insisted that I speak about this topic so I spoke about it now what about new things we did not have in the past such as transgenders transvestors we have drag queens what to do with those in the past they did not have it a man born as a man will remain a man even if they go to have surgery and they have hormones and they make cosmetic surgery to enhance their breasts their different parts and with the hormone therapy different parts of the body is relocated with in terms of meat he's still a man the voice is different he speaks like this now he's still a man he looks like a woman this is artificial he cannot conceive he cannot have demonstration he could not at all be connected to females likewise a female doing the same procedure for men though it's Elizabeth I cannot elaborate but yeah you know so what to do and this is a question I get I met a woman a sister says and she's a Christian and I spoke to her to her about Islam alhamdulillah she accepted Islam alhamdulillah should I bring her here okay but after she accepted Islam she told me that 10 years ago she was a man and then she done you know the surgery and hormone treatment and she changed from Danny to Dania or something like that so now I am shocked what should I how do I treat it is it a he or a she what's answer it's a he but they lost the equipment and all the tools and is still a he regardless of this and this is why the prophet is there was a man who was not a man castrated so he doesn't have the tools so we call him uh what's what's the English word for it I don't say these difficult words my English is so this man or city man used to sit with the boys but they know that he's not a real man so they take it easy for him to go to the women's section so he used to go and mix with women and they're not they're safe they're not afraid of him most women by the way love amen they take gay men as best friends a brother bearded brother from Masjid he says my wife has a gay friendship and I tell her she says you know he's not a man how do you know test drive he says he's gay you believe he's entering and seeing and touching things that he's not supposed to this man used to do the same so once he was sitting with the Companions and he said tomorrow when you conquer Taif Woman by the name of so-and-so she's good she comes with four and leaves with eight a description of how big a woman is and that was at the time a sign of beauty nowadays the thinner you are the beauty you are so they put you on the scale how much well the 50 kg could if you're 60 not good so when the prophet heard this Allah he said this man must not enter upon women why because he knows beauty he knows how to describe so he's not safe and the same thing with that sister who became a Muslim lost her tools but sorry what to do we have to give her anti-treatment sorry we have to give it and to treatment to get back into manhood although this is not possible to completely go to manhood but at least it can become a man again by hormones and by changing the voice by acting like a man with psychiatric treatment so I pray to Allah that he protects all of us Allah I pray to him that he protects our children and I pray to Allah that he protects Malaysia and the rest of the Muslim countries from such an a psychiatric illness in such filth we have to stand firm by showing the world that it's your choice but you don't have the right to force your choice upon me as I don't have the right to force my religion upon you by saying accept Islam I want to chop your head off can I do this so why do you force your beliefs and your filth upon me upon the Muslims they are attacking the children at six and seven years of age in school there this is why I tell Muslims there come to Malaysia migrate I tell them to come to migrate to Malaysia because here it's a Muslim country and you have the infrastructure and you have everything fine to you but don't live with these disbelievers because a five or six years old child goes to the dentist the dentist asks him how do you feel and the father is standing next to the boy and the father wants to kill the dentist and the dentist says Ah my height is 9-1-1 I'm quick in drawing and the father and the doctor asks how do you feel do you feel like a boy or you're inclined to be a girl this is what they're doing so even if you're not thinking of it they say well I I got out of the closet this is the terminology got out of the closet said meaning I was a man but now alhamdulillah I'm liberated I am a woman what kind of a woman is this so you have to stand strong and show the world that this is our identity this is our belief this is our Quran that we can never let go and this is our Sunnah of the Prophet Islam and this is how Allah created me I'm proud to be a man and if you're a woman be proud that Allah created you a woman and be pure and be safe"
