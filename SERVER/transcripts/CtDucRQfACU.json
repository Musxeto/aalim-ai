  "transcript": "maurice from india says you said in your explanation on uh which was done in kuala lumpur malaysia a couple of years ago or maybe more that the hadith the most beloved prayer the most beloved deeds to allah is praying on time and there is another narration praying at the beginning of time the most famous one is praying on time so what is a prayers on time being and when it is best to pray the prayer at the beginning of the time and when it is best to delay it fajr prayer the sunnah is to pray it as early as possible because the hadith indicates that the companions used to get over with the prayer the congregation while the skies were pitch black though her prayer the sunnah is to pray on time which is 10 15 minutes after the event except when it is blazing hot in summer so the prophet has salaam at the time they did not have air conditioning they did not have um places that would protect them from the sun and of the heat so he told them and ordered them to delay the until it's close to ascertain but not yet so that the temperature would go down and it would be easier for them to pray which means that in normal times or when air conditions are on and you are not suffering from the heat you can still pray it at the beginning of the time assad prayer is to be prayed at the beginning of the time not to be delayed which means that 10-15 minutes after the adhan maghrib is to be prayed on time at the beginning once the sun sets scholars say that you pray two raka's sunnah before you actually give the akama so it's five minutes approximately to ten minutes the sunnah is to delay it because the prophet said alaihis told us that the best time for risha prayer is to be prayed after one third of the night has gone and before midnight islamic midnight but this is for those who have the privilege to pray whatever they want but if you are in a community or in a city and there are messages around you they will all pray 15 minutes after the adhan as a man you have to pray with them on time at the beginning of time but as women pray in their homes it's best for them to delay it until it's 10 or 11 o'clock p.m and allah azza knows best"
