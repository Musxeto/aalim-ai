  "title": "No specific virtues of reciting Surah Rahman - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abu Yussef says that before sleeping we know that we should recite specific sewers such as surat al-mulk surat ar-rahman first of all a Rahman is not part of the bed at car so there isn't any authentic hadith that recommends us to read Surat al-rahman on regular basis it's a beautiful surah no doubt it explains to us the beauty of Jannah and the description of Jenna but there isn't any authentic hadith none whatsoever that recommends reciting it whether before sleeping or when a woman is pregnant and is about to deliver or when a woman is single and wants a righteous spouse all of this is not authentic"
