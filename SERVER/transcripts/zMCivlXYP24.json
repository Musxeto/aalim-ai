  "transcript": "can you hear me now yes okay on raising that thing that offered you to cite the fact you have some people after they said the first how they raise their hands and say I mean as if they're making you up okay let's settling on that okay I will answer inshallah so what zainudine is referring to is during Fatiha some people when they recite it and they come to the end and say I mean they do this of course this is a clear innovation and I don't know where these people are getting this but most likely they are like orangutans we don't respect any they see people do things and say whoa this looks nice sometimes uh while the Imam is reciting the moment they see or hear the shahada they say what are you doing this is not the shahud but they move their finger whenever Allah is mentioned in standing position this is an innovation but I saw people do this it looked cool man so I picked it up after Fajr doing that car all of a sudden one of them just goes in prostration hey what are you doing he said this is shukrana sujood this is showing my gratitude to Allah for what he said for everything Allah has given me I do this every Fajr and six seven people around the Masjid look at him he said looks cool and they start picking it up innovation they're sinful and they'll be punished for that so what they're doing of raising their hands and saying I mean is totally prohibited"
