  "transcript": "he says in the subcontinent we have the concept of and this concept is that no matter how many prayers you've missed in the past whether it's a day a year a decade 20 30 years you have to make them up and they are a debt upon you and this is why you see so many people when they pray maghrib they pray another three raka afterwards what is this this is qaza amari and what is this he said i missed prayers for so long so for the past 10 years every maghrib i pray another maghrib every isha i pray another asia every fajr i pray another fajr and so on this is an innovation and this is prohibited the prayer that you deliberately skipped until the time was done you have no right in making it up and if you do it won't be accepted from you why shaykh the majority of the scholars say that you can do this you can make it up this is an issue of dispute but this is the opinion of the great scholars of islam such as such as and so on based on what based on the hadith of the prophet wasallam whoever misses a prayer due to sleep or forgetfulness must make them up as soon as he remembers there is no expiation for it other than that so the prophet alice permitted the expiation which is making the prayer up only in two cases if you overslept or if you had forgotten but if you deliberately skip it then you did not pray it at the prescribed time by allah so if the prayer is 12 30 and it ends at 3 30 if someone comes at 12 25 12 29 and starts praying lord is his prayer valid the consensus of muslims that it's not he prayed it before time likewise if he were to pray it intentionally deliberately without any legitimate excuse at 3 31 which is ascertained would it be accepted the most authentic opinion that it is not accepted and he cannot make it up so what to do repent feel remorseful ask allah for forgiveness and do a lot of good deeds various good deeds so that you may compensate that and allah knows best"
