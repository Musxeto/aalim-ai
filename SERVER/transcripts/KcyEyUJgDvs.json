  "title": "How to have righteous company when I'm surrounded by people of innovation & Shirk? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "in while Schiffer sent an email saying that I'm unable to have righteous company as is recommended every time in Islam religious gatherings in Kashmir are either full of shirk or innovations I'm unable to find such company in realistic ways what is an alternative to it we usually advise people who are suffering to find righteous practicing Muslims and surround themselves with them 24/7 the Prophet told the salary I saw it was Salaam that the wolf would only attack and anticipate a stray sheep so when there's a herd usually a wolf would not go and attack but it waits patiently until one of the sheep goes away from the herd from the Gemara from the congregation and only then it attacks its most vulnerable at that time when it is alone and this is how Satan works and this is why as Muslims wherever you are you have to be within a community even if you are a minority even if you are in Europe even if you are in the States in a small village or a town you have to look for other Muslims to try and unite and become as a community Kashmir is a Muslim region and to claim that they are full of shirk and innovation is not entirely accepted alhamdulillah allah azza wajal has blessed us by people coming from all over the world to work in the Middle East from their countries with mines fill with and innovation and after a few months no one is taking the time to give them dowa no one cares about them we all care about the buck we all care about the money that we earn we don't have time for Dawa yet Subhan Allah Allah opens their hearts to realize the beauty of the Quran and of the authentic Sunna and they find out through their journey that the beliefs they were brought up to were all all false and that their scholars were milking them for money by deafening their ears from hearing the truth from the Quran and the Sunna because then they would not need their scholars and hence they would not pay them anymore so the grace of Allah a lot of them went back to their countries to their communities and started spreading the Dawa of toe heat the DAO of calling people to Quran and to the Sunnah which led to a lot of transformation in the communities people now are back to the Sunnah with the grace of Allah so to claim Shiva that there aren't people for you to find where you can participate with them in Islamic activities and to mix with them and to be with them hang out with them this is a bit difficult for me to be believed nevertheless let us assume that it is as you have described what to do well a Muslim has to improvise you have to be proactive rather than reactive so if you are in a similar situation you seek the guidance of Allah and create your own Islamic environment look for children where you can teach them the Quran look for normal people kind 9 educated where you can sit together three times a two times a week or me maybe more and memorize an ayah read the tough seer of it learn a hadith go through an issue of the issues of fik where you can learn your prayer your fasting bit by bit you will find that the whole group is gaining a lot of knowledge you're calling scholars asking them about things that are dubious to you and they explain it to you and you gain more knowledge and hence you find that you've created with the grace of Allah your own community where you can be with and feel United with other Muslims and Allah so gel knows best"
