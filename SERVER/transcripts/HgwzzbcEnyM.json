  "transcript": "for Han says is it permissible to make dua to Allah for death if you are fed up with life this question was answered by the Prophet himself sallallahu alayhi wasallam when he said that one of you must not wish for death due to a calamity that he was afflicted by but rather he should say o Allah grant me life as long as living is good for me and grant me death as long as dying is best for me so you should never say I wish I die I wish I'm dead this is not permissible make it conditional or Allah if dying is good for me if dying now is the best for me or Allah make it happen but also combine to it and if living is best for me then make me live and Allah knows best"
