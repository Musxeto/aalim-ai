  "title": "Can I wear little transparent hijab (Abaya) & scarf while praying & when going out? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign and most of the prayer Timar in my country becomes thin after we wash them and I saw after a prayer that my earrings are kind of visible through my Khmer and if I look closely my ear is kind of visible it's not visible from far at all but when I look closely in the mirror then it's visible I saw an Islam keyway that it's okay if it's only visible if someone looks closely so is it okay to wear it during prayer the best and safest thing to do is to ask yourself can I wear this hamar and go out of the house with it or would I be fine if Nan mahram look at me fully covered but with such a hamar or would you feel hesitant if you feel hesitant and that no it's a little bit too transparent it's a little bit too uh clear to show what's underneath in this case do not pray in it and wear something that is thick and Allah Knows Best"
