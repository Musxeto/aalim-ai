  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (15) - The way he slept - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and welcome to this new episode of the role model sleeping is one of Allah's blessings and favors Upon Us humans and sleeping is a natural thing for living creatures which without that would be a deficiency but with Allah azzawajal it is not applicable because sleeping is a sign of imperfection when it's attributed to Allah this is why Allah does not sleep does not those does not get tired unlike humans if they don't sleep this is a sign of imperfection the prophet salallahu was the perfect human being and he used to sleep like human beings do and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not deal with sleeping as if it's a luxury rather he dealt with it as a necessity and if you compare his way with our ways you would find a very big gap people nowadays they spend an arm and a leg to buy lavish bedrooms they would go to extravagance in being spread spendthrift just to buy a place to sleep in but the amount of money spent shows that there is an imbalance in their heads the perfect human being the best of Allah's creations he had a mattress and a pillow that were made of leather stuffed with palm fibers leather pillow that's very uncomfortable and stuffed with palm fibers not with ostrich feather or the likes so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not have luxury in his sleep which made Roma once after entering his room and seeing the marks of his reed Matt affecting his side because of their harshness and toughness Homer wept so the prophet asked him why are you weeping he said o prophet of Allah the Persians and the Romans or the byzantians are living a life of ease and you are in this state they're disbelievers and you are the messenger of Allah and you are in such a state not having the adornments of life like they are the prophet said or Omar these are people for whom their good things have been hastened in this world doesn't it please you that this world should be for them and the Hereafter should be for us then be a few years couple of decades and then what and they're six feet under and then it's hell for eternity while we due to our patience and tolerance Allah would grant us the highest levels in Paradise the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam etiquette in sleeping was well known he used to often sleep on his right hand side facing the Qibla exactly how we place the deceased in their graves whatever one of us dies he's placed in his grave to lie on his right hand side facing the Qibla all over cemeteries around the world they're all facing the Qibla they're all facing Mecca in their graves and there's no similar sign of unity in any religion that I know of of similar to this and sometimes the prophet used to lie down on his back as in some authentic hadiths that he was on the in the Masjid lying on his back putting one leg over the other and nothing was mentioned about lying on the left side which means it's permissible though it's not from the Sunnah but it is permissible then how about lying on your stomach there are a hadiths prohibiting this but the most authentic opinion that all of these hadiths are weak Allah have mercy on his soul said there is not a single Hadith that is authentic in prohibiting lying on your stomach but of course it's best to be safe rather than sorry and to avoid it all together due to the dispute in lying on your stomach routine was to sleep at the beginning of the night so immediately after Russia he used to go to bed and then he would wake up at a later stage whether after half of the night is over or one third of the night is remaining he used to hate sleeping before Isha meaning between Maghrib and Aisha and he used to hate talking after Asia because it's a waste of time unless there is a legitimate reason such as discussing issues about Muslims meeting convo convoys or sitting with the family the prophet sallallahu whenever he went to bed they would not wake him up until he wakes by himself and unlike us the prophet eyes sleep like us but his heart is awakened so he knows what's happening around him and this is why he would wake up sometimes and not perform mudu and when mother Aisha would bring that to his attention he says I'm aware of myself even when I'm asleep I shall unlike all of you we when we sleep that's it we have to perform mudu we don't know what came out of us what happened to us in our sleep but the prophet does now we hear doctors saying that you need to sleep at least eight hours a day and people are convinced people think that this is the right thing to do but when we monitor the lifestyle of the Prophet Allah we find that it was not as such you see the prophets sleeping was not total seclusion or Detachment of life it wasn't running away from problems it wasn't trying to slip from responsibilities he used to sleep a couple of hours three hours at most and then he wakes up it is he whom Allah said all wrapped in your garments arise and pray the night except little of it this is how the prophet dealt with night time he dealt with sleeping as a form of worship even in his sleep because Allah says in the Quran say verily my prayers my slaughtering and sacrifice my life and my death is for Allah the lord of the Worlds so everything I do is for Allah even when I go to bed pleased with a man with his father says the prophet ordered his Salah to assalam whenever you want to go to bed perform ablution why would I perform Evolution I'm going to sleep so that you go to bed in the state of purity and lie on your right hand side and say this long Dua and he taught him the Dua we all say before going to sleep and there are so many duas so many ascar we say before closing our eyes and shutting down one of them is bism in your name I live and in your name I die look at the resemblance between death and sleep because in the Quran Allah refers to sleeping as a form of death and this is why Allah refers to Jesus is a peace be upon him when he resurrected him as put him in a state of sleep which some of the ignorance understood it as a state of death and he did not die Allah said that clearly he was not killed he was not crucified he's not dead he's still alive but in a state of sleep and one of the etiquettes that the prophet used to do Allah teaches teaches us to do is that whenever you want to go to bed the Sunnah is that you sweep your bed with the inside of your garment because you don't know what came after you on it whether it's bed bugs or the gin or the Devils so you sweep it with your the inside of your garment to follow the Sunnah of the prophet and once you're on your bed you start to say the ascar of bad time among them is cupping your hands blowing then reciting the last three cool suratulations then you wipe your entire body as you can then you cup it again you blow and then you recite the set again and you wipe and then your cup blow recite and third time you wipe and sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to often order his companions relatives and loved ones to observe the atkar of going to bed like in the previous Hadith we mentioned likewise in the Hadith of Fatima and alimi Allah be pleased with them when he instructed them to say subhanallah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times Allahu Akbar 34 times before going to bed and he told him that this would give you energy better than having a servant in your home and the prophet himself used to recite Surat tabarak and we know we know that these 30 verses of the Quran will intercede for you will prevent you from being tormented in your grave with the grace of Allah and he used to recite suratul kafirun and sometimes he used to recite suratul Israel and Surah to zumar and these take a lot of time but it shows you that going to bed is not a normal thing rather it is a form of worship that our Prophet used to do now if we were to compare Apple to Apple how do we go to bed every single night do we follow these rituals do we perform wudu do we lie on our right hand side do we face the Qibla do we say that do we cup our hands and blow and then wipe our bodies three times do we recite Ayatul Kursi do we recite the last two verses of Surat al-baqarah as instructed by the prophet Islam so many things that we fail miserably to follow the Sunnah of a role model and this shows you the distance between us and him if we were to enter Paradise I know the vast majority of you hearing this would say is it mandatory is it of course not the answer is no so a lot of you would shrug their shoulders and say okay it's not vanity I'm not going to do it and in reply we would say okay if you're not interested in going to the highest level of paradise then don't do it it's all depending on how enthusiastic you are how interested how serious you are the more effort you put in a business most likely the more income you will get and the less effort the most likely your business will fail and be ruined don't do this with your hereafter he's your role model he was sent to us for a purpose and that is to follow his footsteps so do your level best to follow him to follow him and when you go to bed tonight try your level best to follow these steps and insha Allah Allah will make me and you among those to be resurrected under his flag Islam"
