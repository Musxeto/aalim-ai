  "transcript": "perfect with no flaws at all the laws of a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life all praise belongs to Allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his Prophet Muhammad S alaihi wasallam I welcome you dear viewers to this episode I'm your host MOS San Antonio where we are going to be discussing the rights of the funeral joining us to discuss in this topic we have our dear shim from Saudi Arabia M Muhammad from the USA and from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us in the past episodes we've covered most of the parts of the funeral the burial and all of these matters however now we're coming to some things that are associated with after the burial are condolences one of the questions which commonly comes up is once the dirt has been placed and the grave has been covered many people will say I'm going to plant a tree or put some leaves or something either as an extra marking or you know attaching some reason to it so I'll begin with youim what's the ruling on such matters alul the origin of this wrong practice is an authentic Hadith the prophet Alam once passed by two graves and we know that the prophet was given special features from Allah so among these features he was made to listen to the people being tormented in their graves and the prophet said by Allah they are being punished for something that is not so severe or big by Allah it is big one of them used to walk and do namima he used to try to make two parties angry with each other it's worse than backbiting backbiting is to mention someone of a feature of his that he does not like no namima is to go to two and try to make them enemy with one another and the other one was did not purify himself from urine when he urinated did not take the precautions so that it would not come back to him again and then the prophet ordered the companions to bring palm trees and he placed it on the graves and he said I hope and pray to Allah that Allah would reduce their punishment in their grave as long as these leaves are green so now the people started thinking not the scholars not the companions not those of knowledge the Layman thought that ah okay when I bury my brother I'm going to put this on his grave I'm going to put not only one leaf I'm going to put a whole branch better more I plant a tree so that the shade would be there and it's always green and then they would not be tormented or my brother would not be tormented in the grave and this is ridiculous and to to say it in short because one how do you know that your brother is being tormented and you are thinking negatively of Allah the prophet was made to know he was informed by Allah that this is happening too do you have a special Miracle or something that's so special for you like the prophet Alam the prophet wished and hoped and prayed that Allah would relieve them from a little bit of the torment as long as it's green how do you claim that you have the same thing thirdly and finally did anyone of the companions ever followed this practice not only that did the prophet himself ever followed this practice with any of his companions buried he buried all his companions and the loved ones he buried his grandchildren he buried his daughters he never done this with any of them so this indicates that it is an isolated case and it's only specially for the prophet we can get two lessons from here first when we talk he said most of these not all of them are bidas they begin with something very slight very small and then they start increasing it to the degree that yeah to the degree that we can build a tree build plant the tree planting trees they are planting trees so this is one so we have to be very cautious in this again we still need the support of the scholars we still need to ask the scholars because a person who would read this Hadith by himself and isolate it from the whole context would think that he is following the Sunnah of the Prophet Sall so all of us need to increase our knowledge the third one the third lesson that we need to focus on is imitation I think most of the Muslims who do these practices they are imitating what happens in other countries people throw flowers and they see this on the TV or they see it in pictures so they try to imitate them without going back to the Sunnah so this is the danger of imitation without asking about the Sunnah or the rules of the Islam uh that tells us to do or not and probably it was originally done by a deviant im a deviant so-called scholar who had blind followers so he came and he thought that yes I have this blessing I have this feature in me if I put a green leave then Allah will forgive them and there are some deviant Scholars or so imams like this he now we've mentioned some of the things might be imitating the disbelievers then we've mentioned some of the things might have come from the Muslims themselves one other thing which can sometimes be a mixture of the two is number one putting the tombstone which we've already said is forbidden but on the tombstone you'll see written and this is most commonly like in Australia I see this unfortunately at most of the Muslim cemeteries it says Al okay I'm going to ask you Sal about this matter first of all may Allah guide all the Muslims and our um needs to be educated the umah needs to be educated we are far away far away from the teachings of Islam and because of this ignorance being distant from the dean of Allah subh tala this explains the misery and the suffering that the um is going through answering your question this is another Innovation this is a b this is not the practice of Muslim this is neither practice by the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam nor by his companions or the second generation or the third or the four imams it's nothing to do with Islam people are are just adding new things innovating into the dean innovating day after day after day after day so to the extent that the Sunnah became B this is the time we are living in when you tell the people that this is wrong and this is the Sunnah they say no this is a new religion this is a new religion and this explains the second strangeness of Islam second strangeness of Islam because the people became so distant from the dean so when you want to teach Islam to them bring them to the pure spring they said this is a new religion you have concocted you have made among the bidas also that when a decease passed away now this whatever he left behind it is now the right of the Earth the inheritors so no one has the right to touch that yet you'll find them they make Banquets for 3 days like if it is just a wedding Arab countries I mean I don't know the other in my country yes in our countryes they are doing this like a banquet when the Sunnah is the opposite what they current practice that people will come to the household of the decease and staying there for 3 days they go to sleep in their homes and then they come the next day and they expect meals when the prophet Sall Ali wasallam what he did when jalib was mured ja the flyer okay we all know that said the meaning that the family of jaff now they busy because of the morning the morning so make food for them so it is the duty of the neighbors not the family of the deceased the family of the deceased they are not in the mood to cook or to host people or to host people to receive them it's the family around they should cook for them and send them the meals not the you see this what the sun teaches us in turned around it's the just the opposite I know a Masid I used to pray at unfortunately this was common and whenever someone from died what the family would do is come to the Masid and they would bring sweets and drinks and everything and the first time I ever saw it I said oh sweets drinks all these oh was you know having a ball until they told me this is because someone died and you know I felt a little bit strange after that and I wondered if they're doing this and it's against the Sunnah and it's a am I even allowed to eat this food no you're not allowed and the sahab they used to count this as part of the bewailing but this is an innovation this is an innovation may Allah be pleased with him the companion he said we the companions of the the prophet Alam used to consider gathering for morning and the food being made to feed us part of the Wailing so even the Gathering itself now in the customs in my country in different parts of it they even designate the time between and they have like numbers of chairs and lights and coffee people serving coffee and tea and people just outside sit there the row of the HS of the deceased and the guests come and there is a formality when the recitation of the Quran is posed they go and give their condolences all of this is considered to be part of the waning and it's a sin this is not permissible Subhan Allah inah we're going to stop for a moment and go to a very short break may Allah reward you all dear viewers do stay tuned inshallah we'll be back after a very short moment welcome back dear viewers we're here discussing the topic of funeral the rights of the funeral and all things related to it now before the break we were mentioning some of the acts of mourning which people might fall into which either be innovated or not from the Sunnah one of the things that we were going towards was the reading of the Quran and again you find unfortunately that sometimes you would walk into a Masjid and you would see all of the people reading from the Quran and so the people would say who died as if the Quran is only there for this purpose the mentioned there's connection between this and reading the Quran and you say so Quran is the book for the living not the book for the dead but when it comes to this for example dividing you know parts so each person can you know finish yeah unfortunately this is an Evas that has been introduced to the Muslims recently maybe like 5 10 years ago before some of the Muslims had conviction that it is permissible for me to offer any form of good deeds and like wager it or transfer it to a deceased so I would probably pray 10 Ras and then say Oh Allah this is for my deceased my late father others would probably fast couple of days and said this is for my mother and accordingly why they accepted among the Muslims that if you recite the Quran so no I don't want this I'd like it to be transferred to my loved one or to the deceased to the extent that nowadays and this is present we can see this in a lot of the Muslim countries when you go to give your condolences you'll find on the table the Quran in chapters or in J so the Quran is made of 30 J so you'll find 30 parts parts of the Quran on the table and everyone holds one part and they recite it in less than 15 minutes they read it that is and after they finish the family is happy they say alhamdulillah the deceased now has gained the reward of one complete recitation of the Quran and definitely this is baseless as indicated IM shaf says that the decease does not receive any of these Good Deeds however there are a number of hadiths that prove that you may send some of the good deeds but only limited to these Hadith to the deceased and also we know that the Hadith of the Prophet when a man or an individual dies all of his Good Deeds are interrupted are cut with exception of the three so and what are these three just well well I'll let Sal Dr MD explained these three but I'd like to go back to the issue of sending good deeds and I get this like every single day questions my father died my uncle died my son died how can I benefit them while they're dead the scholars the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that one you can pray for them ask Allah for forgiveness the Hadith after we bury a deceased the prophet said now seek forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah Asel to make him steadfast in his grave when he's being questioned so asking Allah for forgiveness for him supplicating to Allah and this we can do every single night may Allah expand his grave may Allah make it to the end of his sight and make it a garden of paradise we can ask as many the sky is the limit so supplication is one secondly Haj and we know that the prophet alai approved companions to perform Haj on behalf of their deceased loved ones and likewise so and they fall under the permissible acts that you offer thirdly charity as in thei of pleased with him he said my mother died and I feel that if she were to be alive she would have allowed me to give so and so on her behalf so should I do this and the prophet said Asam go ahead and do that and the fourth and last one is fasting and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars some say that you can fast mandatory fasting that the decease did not fast and also oath or vows if he made the vow to fast a month or a week and he died before doing it it's permissible for you to do this other Scholars say no you can only fast the vows but mandatory prayer fasting such as Ramadan Etc they say that you may not do that and alhamdulillah it is acceptable if you feel like doing it because of the dispute of Scholars inshallah would do this is a good point because theith says so so if a person passed away and he has some days he didn't fast so the W who's the wi is the inheritor so for example if he has 30 days and you have 10 children so each one will Fast three days that will do it so they can distribute that among themselves yes and again this takes us to the Hadith that you were about to say that means when the son of Adam whenever you being dies right his deeds are stopped except from three ways one of them is righteous son of course or daughter that would continue making Dua all the time and this links to the issue of Dua that's given that benefits the diseased person particularly Hadith mentioned that right West son which tells us that really you need to bring up your children to be good in order to benefit from them inshah and to let them benefit themselves and the second one is what should they call it charity continuous charity for example you make a school for people who memorize the Quran and all those people who memorize the Quran you will benefit from them this is wonderful also like a will of water you dig a whe of water and people would benefit from as long as it the water is running you get benefit from that or you make a building an apartment building you rent and the revenue is distrib hundreds of ways of yes and the last one is to leave a beneficial for people and the best of the knowledge is any knowledge that's related to Islam related to the Quran related to the Sunnah and this would benefit you but this does not deprive other Scholars good days for example if you do if you make an invention right would it fall under this sh if you to invent something and the people would benefit from it does it fall under I'm asking sh we hope so in yes we hope so this could mean that until the day of judgment you could have something coming in so this is a good push for anyone because we know once we die we can't do all of these things anymore but we could make a very smart investment and say what's going to benefit is there a Masid a Quran school or something and if you can put your money into this an Islamic Channel which goes to millions and millions of Muslims benefiting from these kinds of contribution printing books of other Scholars of some Scholars reprinting them so the same thing not that many people read books nowadays you can set up a website oh websites as the shift is slowly changing it means that of course we want to be smart we're concerned about our Hereafter so we should take advantage of these things and also we have to be from among the especially the parents that we we have to be also keep I mean the ties of the Kindred so after the death of my father or my mother my aunts from both sides so this is also from among the rights of the parents upon The Offspring the children now a few questions about the grave after this because the grave is going to remain for a long time after that some questions may come about for example visitation whether or not women can visit the graves and then also can the grave be moved in a case of necessity can it be dug up so there's still a few things remaining which maybe we can cover for the rest of the episode so I'll start with you know perhaps women visiting the graves this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic in my opinion and also it's the safest is that they should not visit a graveyard now they can offer funeral prayer if it's being offered in the Masjid of course but they're not allowed to follow may Allah be pleased pleas with her saided well I'm going to come to that said we were forbidden to follow funerals but it was not made so strong to us now this is her understanding the second part is her understanding this does not mean it was made permissible she herself said it was made forbidden n we were told not to and this means that it was forbidden but she believed that it was not so extreme and that was her belief and therefore the scholars say we take the Hadith as it is and not follow the understanding we follow the Commandment of the prophet and as I stated before it is an issue of dispute among Scholars my perception is that if she doesn't go the world would not collapse and no one among the scholars on Earth would say you have done something wrong however if she goes those who see them or the the females going into a cemetery is forbidden they would tell her this is Haram so to be on the safe side stay home make a lot of Dua offer offer give it in charity and inshallah this would benefit the decease more and even going to the Grave sorry I beg to differ with you you have all the okay because this issue that we have to take it to the Sun of the Prophet Salli wasallam the prophet Salli wasallam he said I have forbidden you from visiting the graveyard so now you can visit so this ruling covering both because the one of the principles of the the is always applied to both males and females because he mentioned the reason that it reminds you of the here after and no doubt a woman needs to be reminded second thing the visited the the grave of her brother ABD Rahman thirdly she followed the prophet s wasallam to the graveyard and the prophet Salli wasallam did not commented had it been prohibited the prophet Sall wasam would have told her oh Allah didn't you know this that it is Haram fourthly the Hadith of we were forbade from following the funerals but not strictly so what is not recommended is frequently because theith says so this is means those who are frequent visitors or if it is going to whale is going but if frequent occasionally and she feels that this softens her heart inshallah there is no harm and this is controversial issue mentioned reward all of you we have come to the end of our episode even though there's still a few things maybe we can look at in a future episode in it was very good having you contribute to this topic may Allah reward you all and may Allah also reward our dear viewers for joining us we hope inshallah to see you in our coming episodes until then I greet you all of way of life"
