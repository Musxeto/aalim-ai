  "transcript": "thank my second question is of uh putting the hands on the stomach some people you see them on on top of the chest and trying to be to be more Pious why do you classify it as trying to be more Pious how do you know maybe they're protecting their heart from running away okay if it if this is judgmental now you're judging them okay I'm sorry because they will say you put your hands on your stomach because you have stomach ache okay so both ways are accessable alhamdulillah okay as for where to place your hand the right over the left whether on your stomach below the navl above the navl on the chest it's an issue of dispute among Scholars the those who follow a maab must not be blind following it to the extent that anyone who does anything else is wrong how do you know that your maab is right oh I've seen my father and my grandfather and my great great grandfather do it so mashallah and with about the 800 billion Muslims who don't do it they're all wrong they also saw their their fathers and great great great great great fathers do it so issues of Islam is not resolved by power or by majority or by how big your bicep is it's resolved through you have to refer it back to the Quran and to the Sunnah now when we come to this issue we find that it all revolves around the authentication of the Hadith theith of may Allah be pleased with him where he said that I saw the prophet Alat wasam placing his right hand over the left hand on the chest some people say this is Hadith authentic like a albani others say that this is not authentic and it's an issue of dispute I tell you do what you feel you are fine with so I pray with Brothers praying next to me like this some of them even put their hands on their private part you're not a goalie there is no free kick you're praying put it up a little bit so should I be concerned no this is his preference some of the brothers from morania or Maliki followers they put it on the side it's your hands I don't care so when people put it this way this this is wrong some people put it next to their necks this is wrong I'm not going to hey put your hand down don't pretend you're Pious no no no no I'm not going to do this you're Pious this is between you and Allah I'm not going to judge you but I care about my own prayer whatever you like you pray now I will open another [Music] frontier people move their index finger like this they're like driving and going right it's like indicator and some of the brothers move too flasher I have with me in the car Ahmed always does this huh others say no once others say twice other do circling like this other put their hands like this and and sitting they don't sit normal they sit like this what is this so what's the ruling I don't care about them you do whatever you want you come to me I'll show you the Sunnah you follow it good for you you don't follow it I'm happy for you but don't make an issue out of it don't allow shatan to create hatred oh no no this is Extreme he's putting his hand on the chest and I say no this guy is too lenient he's a goalie he's putting his hand for a free kick and each one of us blame blame the others and we play the blaming game and the labeling game this is what Shan wants in the when the is done the prophet used to say some of the brothers say there is nothing of and he used to say don't leave gaps for Shan when we start to look at the brother's prayer next to me I'm better this or try to you know play hide and seek I want to put my foot on his foot the brother is going I'm catching you and the brother on the right is and I'm doing like karate split what are you doing he said I'm trying to foot to foot and shoulder to shoulder your shoulder is one Meer away the shoulders are the most important to align by it if the brother is following the Sunnah and you feel his heart is like your heart stick your foot to him but if you see that whenever you come near he goes see leave him alone no I have to teach him the sun no you don't have to teach him anything because he will teach you MMA after the Salah don't allow shatan to corrupt our Salat to corrupt our hearts let our hearts be loving and caring and full of Mercy to all of our brothers and sisters and Allah Knows Best"
