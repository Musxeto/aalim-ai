  "transcript": "okay uh the second question of Rami was when people pray and say oh Allah grant us the ability to see your face in Paradise or when someone prays you and says may Allah allow you to see Allah's face in Paradise wouldn't this be giving Allah Asel attributes of humans and the answer is no Allah mentioned in his book describing himself a number of attributes that we believe in so Allah tells us in Allah and this is what I call myself and all of my brothers and sisters recite the Quran get your best Knowledge from the Quran don't devote 5 minutes a day 10 minutes a day to the Quran no devote more an hour an hour and a half to recite the Quran and to learn what it says at the same time now in the Quran Allah says everything will be perished except Allah and here Allah Asel is referring to himself by saying that his face will remain which means Allah subhanahu wa taala will not perish he is the first without the beginning and he's the last without an ending he's the creator of the all uh uh what you see and what you do not see and he's not created and he does not die and he does not have an ending subhah wa tala so Allah described in the Quran that he has a face Allah described in the Quran that he has two hands when he addressed El Satan and he told him what prevented you from prostrating to what I have created with my two hands so this is what Allah describes himself Allah says inah Al that on the day of judgment Allah would uplift and show his leg and they are called to prostrate and everyone prostrates except the Hypocrites all the Believers would prostrate and the Hypocrites will try to prostrate and their back goes one piece and they will be thrown into hell Allah tells us about himself subhanahu wa'ta'ala that he has an arm the prophet tells us that the prophet has that Allah has fingers when he says oh Allah the hearts are between two of your fingers you flip them as you wish oh Allah make my heart steadfast on your religion and so on these attributes one would say this is similar to humans how can we say this to Allah I I say I seek Allah's forgiveness so I would say to those who claim this this word is known but the meaning is different when I say that an elephant has a leg and I have a leg and an ant has a leg are the legs similar definitely not and Allah has the highest example we do notel simulate him to any of his creatures but you believe that Allah is alive so why don't you say that living is also part of human nature Allah Asel subhana is alive Allah asael is all hearing allseeing so Allah sees and Allah hears and I hear and I see but there's no resemblance none whatsoever except in the description therefore you have to believe in the things that Allah described himself in the things that the prophet described his Lord asael and take it as it is without any addition"
