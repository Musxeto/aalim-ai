  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 12 (The Prophet ﷺ‎ with the Elderly)- Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our your host for today's show our subject deals with the elderly those who are advanced in their years or however we may choose to define it will open this up in greater detail with our guest Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalamualaikum welcome waalaikumsalam not alive oh I care to thank you for being with us as always nice to have you with us we're looking at a subject and so I guess each society has different understanding conceptions definitions legal definitions for who should be considered the elderly and there are some very serious implications for the the need for the legal definition that can translate into government benefits certain kinds of services discounts when you're buying products and services in the marketplace so interesting story when I was in the u.s. recently I took my mother to the cinema to see a film and she is an an elderly person she is now more than 70 years and for some reason the the the clerk asked if it was she requested her we call him senior citizens she requested her senior citizen discount and she asks if it would be for two and my mom said you mean for my son and I so somehow for some reason she extended that to the both of us so if I've already started to get benefits and I'm Linda when I'm with my mother at least for senior citizen discounts is there an Islamic understanding of this I mean as I said every society is a bit differently some of my African friends tell me that in their traditional African society you don't become a man even after the rites of passage at 16 you don't become a man until you're 40 and then that you have a voice in the community how does Islam view this in terms of being an elderly person so no matter how many Lebanon I mean I'm salam o alikum attended I mean nabina muhammad in water or sahbihi ajma'in the issue of being a senior citizen cannot be looked at with parameters and measurements so if you exceed this number you're a senior citizen a day earlier you're not it is not like this sometimes you can have someone who is in his 60s mm-hmm yet fit strong and maybe more young than anyone else well while you have someone in his mid 40s who's walking with a cane done his bypass and he knows that he's gonna die soon so who are we to define who's considered to be elder or a senior citizen or not this is not clear it's a bit vague hmm and it's too general but the tendency is that Islam highlights the issue of age in terms to yourself so who's ever is older than you he's an elder hmm and this makes it great when it comes to dealing with and respecting those who are older than you if someone was using a cane and is unable to stand then he has the right to be called a senior citizen okay and we have certain things that we deal with them within Islam to show our respect and appreciation to their old age old age is mentioned in the Quran hmm and there's an ayah in chapter 30 verse 54 Allah Allah says Allah is the one who created you from weakness then mate after weakness strength so the first weakness is the infancy after that a person becomes youthful and strong made after strength weakness and white hair so this is the second weakness which resembles the state of childhood when you get someone who is old not just old old and senile the Prophet Aristotle said I'm in his dorm used to seek refuge in allah azza wajal so he used to say o allah i seek refuge from disability from laziness from cowardice and from old age is old age bad scholars say like in am now away old age is meant to be in a state of too old to recognize things when you lose control over yourself when you need someone to assist you 24/7 otherwise like docent with Parkinson disease and Alzheimer's and the rest of the things so it sounds like Islam once again just in our as one of our previous conversations about the disabled persons this also is looking at ability yes I recall some more than a decade ago there was a big issue among in the aviation industry where the US government was wrestling with the subject of when pilots should be retired and the forced retirement based on age alone the pilots were saying exactly what you were saying look it should be dependent on ability we have some who are 65 who are physically fit who have excellent vision so on and so forth and they don't miss days excellent performance they should not be forced to retire so what I hear is that Islam is is is looking at it from that perspective I'd also like to ask you about you you were in your comments talking about the respect I think this also varies from culture to culture some view old age as an admirer Abul thing two to one to live to exist for so many decades beyond half half a century to acquire wisdom to witness life you become a wealthy person and so it's it's a desirable thing and not to be afraid of wrinkles of gray hair but it's not it's not always that way we especially now are afraid of old age we want to cover the hair with with dye and colors and get call it expensive procedures to remove wrinkles and things like this obviously this is not this is unnatural for us to try and hide and cover and evade old age would you agree that Islam that this is not in keeping with with our Islam that we should embrace our lowly old age and and enjoy the benefits thereof well this again has a number of points that you have mentioned and I don't know if the time would allow us to talk about it first of all the issue of white hair okay we do embrace it and we do live with it yet Islam tells us that is recommended to die white hair hmm so the majority would consider it to be a form of prestige and gives you respect I wasn't aware of it as in my case mhm but sometimes when it's all white mm-hmm it becomes of a distraction in the authentic hadith in the conquest of Mecca when abu bakr may allah be pleased with him brought his father about to hava who was in his 80s maybe 90s he brought this old man to the prophet alayhi salatu salam to give him the pledge of allegiance and to greet him the Prophet looked at him and said Abu Bakr shame on you I was more worthy of going to him rather than making this old man come to me look at the prophets humbleness I saw he is blaming Abu Bakr for bringing him his father he said this is wrong you should have asked me to come and visit this elder in his home and then he said after looking at the white hair of abhava he said change this whiteness and avoid black which means that you can dye it with henna with reddish with brownish with whatever colour but avoid black because when you die in black is deceiving okay as if you are like 30 years younger if I die my beard and black people probably think that this is a young man and people will be deceived by this so this is what it comes to white hair when it comes to embracing the fact that you becoming old right before you move from the hair is there something about removing white hairs yeah this is there's a prohibition uh-huh in plucking white hair okay so sometimes people will have black hair and in a single way yeah yeah strand comes out in these pluck it out the Prophet say doesn't don't do this on the day of judgment it would come in a form of light and this is why the scholar said that dyeing the white hair is not mandatory as some understood from the hadith of a before hava it is not mandatory because it will come as a form of light in your face when you come on the day of judgment so plucking it yes there is a restriction for that so coming back to the issue of age yeah everyone is going getting old that's right and the happiest of them all is the person who lives each phase of his life accordingly and happily so you don't spend your time whining complaining regretting about the old days or when I was young I wish I did this I wish it no no it's gone so move on live your life and enjoy it okay great we are ready for our break and we look forward to coming back to continue with the shake in just a few minutes allama alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we're continuing our conversation about the elderly who lived around the Prophet peace be upon him and lessons that we can take for applying it into our lives a sheikh I'd like to ask you about a simple question basic question what attitude we should have towards old age should we view as something good or bad well when it comes to worldly matters mhm it's bad let's not beat around the bush you feel older slower weaker and those who were around you are not anymore those who you grew up with are dying one by one and you are the one left behind so if you look at it from a worldly point of view yeah it's not good and this is why this life is deceiving when you're a toddler or a young person once you were born you grew you grow up in a very fast mode so an infant in your five ten years of age until you reach the age of puberty and from then when you enter the prom of your youth it goes on for twenty thirty years is so long you think that it would never come to an end and then when the curve starts going down you start to look back and regret I wish I did this I wish I did that and from worldly perspective it's bad getting old a Muslim doesn't see it this way okay because we have the sinner the Prophet says added in salat wa sallam when someone asked them who is the best of people the Prophet said Azam the best of people is a person who lives long and there's good or improperly English does well hmm so the age comes with benefits in another hadith the Prophet Ali salatu salam said there is no one better at the sight of allah than a person who is old because throughout the years of his life he said so many times subhanAllah alhamdulillah Allah Akbar no one looks at it from this point of view that I have a lot of credit in the hadith of tal have not obeyed allah may allah be pleased with him he's one of the ten heaven bound he saw a dream and when he woke up he told the people about the dream he saw and they were shocked what is the dream about two men from a nearby country coming to the Prophet arezzo salam accepting islam at the same time one of them used to worship allah more than the other they went to jihad in a battle mm-hmm one of them was martyred the other brother lived a year after him and then he died naturally so the vision the dream that tal has I saw he said that I saw myself with these two brothers and the out gates of paradise hmm and then the gates were opened and the man who died a year later from the martyr was admitted first and the doors were closed closed and then after a while the doors were opened and the martyr was admitted he said I wanted to go in and I was prevented and said it's not your time yet and he woke up so the people were shocked how is it that the guy who died naturally went in paradise first you would think the modern the martyr should have been there first so when this reached prophet aerosol Salam he brought Talha and he said what is it that you are astonished of didn't the man who live a year after the martyr prayed so many prayers fast so many days of Ramadan said so many vicar Subhan Allah and Allah Akbar by Allah the difference between him and his martyred brother is like the difference between the heavens and the earth I got it so old age is a good thing if you look at it from this perspective yeah yeah okay you know as you said all of us are headed towards death the big question is the big issue is we don't know when or how or where we will be and we hope that when we as we become older that we become persons that are respected in our societies that we've done well with our family especially our children to provide care for us I'd like to open the question about how we are treating our parents and you know there are problems with this right now the senior citizens homes where we retire our parents too sometimes it's necessary especially if they are a medical the needs you could have a nurse around the clock and a doctor to visit whatever but some are using this facility as a way of only to remove what they see as a burden in their lives we're busy people you know the world that we live in is very demanding of our time and our energies and so you know I don't want to be unsympathetic to those who are doing this but I'd like for you to speak to this subject of respecting our parents as elderly persons in our behavior towards them well this unfortunately is not possible because the issue of parents is totally unrelated to the issue of elders the rights of parents over us is not related to being older young mm-hmm they have the supreme rights over us to the extent that Allah associated their rights with his right of being worshipped alone when Allah stated in chapter 17 hidaka a lot I will do Ilya mobile Walid a nee-san your Lord has decreed and ordered that you worship none other than him and that you treat your parents well so being dutiful being obedient and respectful to your parents has nothing to do with their age this is a god-given right it was well they may be older than us we're not denying that they may have grandchildren okay but you're saying they're in a different category altogether altogether to the extent that what you're talking about is unimaginable in Islam when a parent becomes old when a father becomes old he becomes a king in his kingdom moving with honor and dignity between the different places that is his children's houses like a king each one of them is begging him to come and stay for a few more days so he picks and chooses they the most privileged of us and my siblings is the one who takes care of his father or the one who takes care of his mother to the extent that there was one of the strangest cases in court when the judge stated that two came to my court over their 70s and they're fighting over who takes the custody and the care of his mother and when he awarded this custody and guardianship to one of them he's in his 70s the other one started crying hmm for being deprived from being able to yeah that's a beautiful story so this is all together to treating the elders week when we talk about the elders the parents are in a category of yeah their own definitely got it okay thank you for that now we're approaching we're running out of time I want to be careful to make sure you have time to get to all the things that you wanted to in this what about respect giving a priority to the elderly we go we leave the category of parents and go back to the elderly when it comes to rendering respect giving priority how about the Prophet in his dealings with the elderly peace be upon him in this regard the Prophet Alice's omelette left no room for us to doubt the priority of the elders in the sense that whatever there was a case and one of the audience wanted to speak the Prophet as some would shut him down and said no let the elders speak though it was his case but you young the elders should represent it okay even in prayer the Prophet as some gave age presidents so he said that when people want to pray who should lead the prayer the Prophet said those who know Koran most and if they're equivalent and are an equal that is in memorizing the Quran then the oldest in them in Hedra in their knowledge and at the end the eldest so the age has a priority the Prophet Allison said I saw a dream where I had a tooth brush and there were two men so I gave my toothbrush to one of them and the angel told me give the eldest give the eldest so the priority is to the age in salat for example the Prophet asaram ordered the to be quick in his salat not to prolong it and he justified this by saying alayhi salat wa salam there would be among them those who are old those who are sick those who have things to do so the prophet Aslam is thinking forward looking ahead according to the consequences of your action so the elders have a priority and they should have their own respect as they should also be fearful of the sins not just just not because you are old means that you have concessions that you have permissions to do whatever you want they must be continued to be careful because even more so yes and especially when the sins are uncalled for the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam that 3 Allah will not talk to them would not look at them would not purify them and would severely punish them and torment them on the day of judgment the first one is an elder person who fornicates hmm the need for fornication is not there he's old he's not like a youngster mm-hmm a strong man he is old he doesn't have the need to it yet he forces himself to do it and hence Allah would double the punishment upon him for that mm-hmm all right we will leave it there I respect you Sheikh and you know honor your seniority over me you're like a couple of years older but when and if we get into the racquetball courts I'm not gonna hold back you wish my friend thank you so much for being with us Zac and Luckett we will conclude the episode for today thank you and inshallah we'll continue with with the Prophet Allah Allah"
