  "title": "Am I sinful for not being able to focus & contemplate while praying Taraweeh behind a Ferrari imam?",
  "transcript": "I have a question SE I go toi in the local M Army and the Imam recites one one and half like 1.25 ju for per day so it is like a highs speed train I just wanted to ask am I at fault if I'm not able to focus I mean at that pace while the is residing or do I need to you know Focus strongly and then I'm not sure how to how to you know conate on that na we are humans we are not machines and hence there has to be a moment where we are absentminded and especially if you have a Ferrari Imam that recites quickly unfortunately as many people focus on qu quantity rather than quality and this is a very bad thing especially when it's with students of knowledge all what they care is how much we've accomplished in tonight's recitation or tonight's prayers can we finish the whole Quran in Ramadan who said you have to finish the whole Quran in Ramadan inwi nobody so where did you come up with this idea said oh she we've been doing it for so many years we don't want to break the habit but this is is wrong it is best that you recite fewer verses with t that so that the people are closer to Allah they enjoy what they hear they can ponder and contemplate on the verses rather than just trying to finish so that you would boast about it among people yeah I I pray and I finished the Quran this is not the right thing to do for you as a follower because you have no other alternative to gain the reward of praying the whole night except by praying with the Imam until he's finished you may pray behind him you're not at fault you're not sinful if you are unable to contemplate and Ponder upon everything he says due to his speed and Allah Knows Best"
