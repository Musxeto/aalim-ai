  "title": "How should professionals muslims be involved in dawah",
  "transcript": "how should a Muslim professional involved in their own activities since I am too busy with my profession will I be punished if I didn't involve in Dharma activities topic and this particular issue during my talk but maybe the brother was browsing a little bit or did not pay attention I said that the best form of Dawa is by your conduct by your Allah by the by your moral behavior so you can be active in Dawa your Muslims attire and in your job nine to five people see that you're honest that you do not change that you're kind that you're generous that you pray on time that you adhere to your Muslims attire and your muslim appearance and they ask why isn't this man's like the others and they say because he's Muslim Muslim okay why isn't he like the other Muslims because he is a practicing Muslim so this is this is the best and the basic way of getting down work that one now you can give that way depending on your time depending on your knowledge depending on the circumstances as I said it is not logical that everybody becomes an orator or an imam of a machine it is recommended but if you cannot reach this level then you can work in other fields of Darwin and I'll give you an example a lot of the brothers and sisters not a lot let me rephrase that all the brothers and sisters that work in my team whether in my on my website whether on my youtube channel or any other activities they are volunteers so we have the top in IT volunteer he says she I need to do something for Darwin the Hokies Alcala here this is my website show me what to do another sister says I'm good in translation there's a sister may Allah bless her she translates my speeches my lectures into Romanian in Romania are there Muslims in Romania we never heard of this and a lot of the Muslims read the translation in their benefit so you can work in your 9:00 to 5:00 topic and be the best in your job in your spare time you can help Tara either through your profession or either through attending circles of knowledge or even through your money Dawa cannot happen without giving money and a business management whose income is halal yet he does not know anything about the sciences of the Quran and the Sunnah it doesn't have knowledge he benefits Islam and there were more than 10 or 100 scholars why because he's providing his money for Dawa to progress for Islamic centers for publication of literature for supporting and financing and sponsoring Diaries and so on with his money so you can be a businessman and you can be an area not necessarily very knowledgeable but you can help the Darwin and I hope this answers your question"
