  "title": "Read something silently & came across Prophet's name, do I send blessings moving lips? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so my question is if I'm reading silently I'm not moving my lips or anything and I'm reading about the process maybe the name of the Prophet is mentioned do I need to say for Allah uh with my mouth or moving my lid for working just because I'm reading in my mind I can just continue to read and say it in my mind as well inshallah you can read it in your mind but I don't think you will be rewarded for it if you move your lips you will get the 10 good deeds and the angels would mention your name to the prophet Etc so it is best to move it but if you don't you're not sinful insha Allah"
