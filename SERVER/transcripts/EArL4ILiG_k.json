  "title": "If we are traveling can we shorten prayers before leaving or can we combine prayers? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "nariman from lebanon she says can a traveler shorten his prayer before leaving home the answer is no because he's not a traveler yet if i'm in the middle of my home my normal routine yesterday i prayed five times in the masjid today i prayed fajr in the masjid i'm about to leave home and go to the airport or travel by car out of my city out of my country but i did not start yet i cannot shorten shortening the prayer can only be done when you are labeled as a traveler in the middle of your home you're not a traveler yet you're a resident so when do i become a traveler once you leave the borders of your city the city limits then this is a trap you are labeled as a traveler then what about combining combining prayers is separate from shortening combining can even be done by residents so if i live up north in birmingham or in scotland when the maghrib is like 10 o'clock p.m asia is like 11 11 30 sometimes and the break of dawn or fajr is like 2 30. there is immense hardship for me to pray 11 30 asia go back home it's 11 11 15 and then try to go to sleep and then wake up for fajr there is real hardship so scholar said to such people due to such genuine hardship they can combine isha to maghrib so at 9 30 or 10 o'clock when they pray maghrib three raka's they can immediately make akama and pray asha for raka's and go home to bed now they can have like four or five less maybe four hours plus of good night sleep that would energizes them to go and pre-fajr a person who is a doctor or a patient undergoing surgery knows that he would miss one prayer due to anesthesia to due to the long process due to the surgery he can combine though he's not a traveler so this is a different issue if you're about to travel and you know that when the time of the prayer is due you'll be on the airplane airborne won't be able to face the qibla won't be able to stand up in this case no pray facing the qibla standing up combining it with the prayer that can be combined with and allah azza knows best"
