  "transcript": "he's one of the greatest desk there was only moral degeneration people come to a little admiration for him and hamdulillah he'll up behind I mean I'm sallallahu seldom Obama Carter I believe he well I sure did I mean maybe and I'm hammered in water alley he was acting here's my assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still talking and studying the cedar the beautiful biography of Oh Marlon haha may Allah be pleased with him and before we go into some of the details the remaining details that is one would ask what is the difference between Marissa and Kurama what is the difference between a miracle and what is known as Kurama a gift from allah azza wajal that he bestowed only on selected followers of His Prophet or His Messenger well a miracle is something that is beyond nature which happens only once and it is given only to a prophet or a messenger for example the splitting of the sea took place only once and that was for musa peace be upon him Moses and other miracles are like this the splitting of the moon took place only once and that was for our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and scientists had proven that there is a split there is a crack in the moon but they cannot justify it we know it it took place at the time of the Prophet Alice Assam and the Quran was revealed showing us that it was split into two halves so this is a miracle and a Kurama is something that is beyond nature as well but it takes place when Allah bestows it on a follower of one of his messenger and it is there to prove that the message of the messenger is correct and to reinforce the faith and the belief in the people's hearts and there are lots of kurama's but what is the difference between it and between the supernatural things that take place at the hands of those who are not following a prophet sort of sorcery magic etc well it is clear it is obvious as long as it took place at the hand of a person or with a person who follows a messenger or a prophet then this is from allah azza wajal the almighty Omar may Allah be pleased with him had an incident or two that were proved to be a Kurama the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us that and this is an authentic hadith before us in nations before ours there used to be men who were inspired who used to hear voices and it would inspire them to do things and in his nation among his followers if any then Omar may Allah be pleased with him is one of those who had death he's inspired and guided to do the right thing that he doesn't know where it came from but it's a gut feeling that he has to do something and he does it and it become masha'allah correct and the right thing to do and the Prophet also told us sallallaahu re-evaluation them in another authentic hadith that Allah has put the right the correct things in the mouths of Omar and in his heart which means that he does not speak except with the right things and he does not think of except of the right things that please Allah the Almighty it was reported and this is one of the Kurama it was reported that I don't want may Allah be pleased with him was once giving a hot ba and he was on the pulpit delivering a narration a hot bub probably Friday speech and while he was talking all of a sudden he interrupted his speech and he said yes area yes area algebra eligible and companions did not know what was that all about and when he finished his football they asked him what was Syria and the jebel about it had nothing to do with the khutba with your duration what was it about and he said an astonishment did you hear me yes everybody heard you he said I don't know while I was delivering the hood but my mind was with the army that I had sent to fight up east the pagans and the fire worshippers and something came over me telling me and showing me that they were being attacked and the enemy was about to defeat them so I seen the the thing that I saw I figured out that the best way out for them is to give their backs to the mountain and to attack their enemies so I called the leader I wished I could communicate with the leader of the Muslim army telling him that go to the mountain al Japan but I don't know how this crossed mind and I don't know how you heard it and subhanAllah about a month and a half later the news comes to Medina from this leader of the army stating that on that particular day that Umar said what he had said on the pulpit they say that they were almost going to be defeated it was this close while they were fighting they heard the voice of Rome are saying the mountains area the mountain so Satya instructed his soldiers to give the backs to the mountain and they fought the enemy and they won with the grace of Allah so gel now this is something that Allah bestowed on Omar and the Muslims it was a Kurama he was inspired by Allah as Odin and that is why if you recall he had given advice to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a number of times some scholars take it up to 20 and every time he gives this advice with the grace of Allah the Quran is revealed confirming and approving his advice with a directive from Allah the Almighty this how great Omer was may Allah be pleased with him Omar was one of the soldiers of Islam and Islam is built on submission submitting your will to the one and only Allah who is worthy of being worshipped and know God is worthy of being worshipped except Allah all the gods you see are false gods they do not have any good or benefit to you and they cannot prevent you from any harm that comes to you only Allah has the power to do this therefore no more may Allah be pleased with him was the guard and the barrier between this belief and Islam and that is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam called him al-farouq the divider because allah divided with remark between right and wrong between evil and good between Islam and disbelief and that is why he used to protect monotheism at though heat with all he had in his power and this is exactly what not only Omar this is exactly what all the companions of the Prophet alakazam used to do and this is what the Prophet himself used to do to keep the people away from associating anyone with Allah even by just simply saying this imagine that it is a sin it is a major sin to swear with a other than Allah in Arabia people usually swear with their honor they swear with a mana they swear with their parents they say with my parents value or with I swear by the head of my parent by the head of my father etc the Prophet tells us that this is shirk this is associating others with Allah and it is a major sin and also it is a sin to join someone with allah azza wajal by saying allah and my manager graced me with the race this is shirk though i know that it is from Allah but associating my manager with Allah this would be part of shared we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be back Omar may Allah be pleased with him protected Islam and he was only following the teachings of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam he was not an extremist no one dares describe him or any other companion to be extremist to be a terrorist to be a fundamental as well we're all fundamentalist in the sense that we abide by the fundamentals of Islam the Quran and the Sunnah but anyone who says that the Companions were extremists this may notify their Islam because they were not they were on the middle path and they are the moderate they are the one who are abiding by the Quran and the Sunna remark is following the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam mother aisha may allah be pleased with her tells us that the prophet i saw when he was on his dying bed he said may allah azza wa jal have or wage war against the jews and the christians who had taken the graves of their prophets and messengers places of worship and she says that the prophet said this Alisal of salam because he was warning his followers not to do the same and that is why she says when the Prophet Allah saw some died we buried him in his house not in the Masjid he was buried in the house of Aisha and they did not raise his grave more than this distance approximately so that people would not worship him they did not raise his grave they did not build anything on it they did not have it as a monument he was buried in his house outside of the Masjid this was the doing of the Prophet as and of his companions may allah be pleased with them all Omar was following the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and that is why when he heard that the muslims are going to the tree of ribbed 102.1 they call it and this tree was near and hudaibiya now known as may see and this tree is where the prophet alayhi salatu salam took the pledge of allegiance to fight till the death from his companions and Allah Azza WA JAL did praise those who gave him the pledge of allegiance and did state in the Quran that Allah so gel is well pleased with those who gave you the pledge of allegiance under the tree la ilaha illa Dena you by Ãºnica - illallah so this tree some people came afterwards thinking that it is a blessed tree because first it was mentioned in the Quran second it is a place where the Prophet al-islam took the pledge of allegiance to die to fight till the death from his companions so they thought and this is from Shaitaan that seeking the blessing of Allah by praying there may be by wiping the tree itself and touching the branches and the bank itself or whatever they thought that this would mean that it would get some of this blessing and all of this is from Shaitaan the blessing comes only from Allah Azza WA JAL and you have to seek the blessing of all the places the times and the things that Allah Azza WA JAL or the Prophet sallallaahu sallam told us to seek the blessings from for example if we eat from one big plate the Prophet says Allah so Sam do not eat from the middle each from the sides because the blessing descends on the middle so if you go and eat from the middle the blessing is gone the Prophet tells us is Islam wipe your dishes completely from even the last bit of rice or whatever because you don't know where the blessing of Allah is the Prophet tells us a little 'it was salam that Zamzam water is a blessed water so we drink it and we seek allah's blessing by drinking it we know that makkah and madinah are blessed locations so we worship a lot there we know that the Kaaba is blessed we know that trauma bond as months is a blessed month we know that the ten days of the ledger are the best days of the whole year to worship Allah in all of these are blessings but when you go out of the line and you seek Allah's blessing elsewhere then you are falling into the trap of Satan and how is that well you find people coming to scholars houses or Imams houses and they kiss their hands why are you kissing the man's hand say dear Sheikh he's a blessing of Allah he's the scholar we kiss his hand so that we get the blessing you know if this guy is a hypocrite or a real scholar how would you claim to say that this is a scholar in even if he is a scholar you are not allowed to kiss people's hands out of respect except your parents your grand parents for example this is whom you are allowed to kiss their hands their foreheads okay you want to respect the scholar kiss him on the forehead show respect by not raising your voice by not humiliating him this is the respect he needs but when we see people for example attacking and this I saw in England a few months ago when Sheikh sudais went there to deliver a few lectures and he's the Imam of the harem the ignorant people of course not the people following the Sunnah all those who attacked him we're people following innovation were people following deviant sex he finished his hot bath of Juma and they attacked him not to kill him but to tear some of his clothes some of his Mishler to wipe over his body and seek the blessing of allah what are you doing the guy may have h1n1 swine flu and you're rubbing him and doing this with him he's human being and beside he is not what you think he is he is a human being with sins he might be righteous he may not be and this is something we cannot judge it's only a lot to judge that is why going to such extreme may make people fall into  I have seen some of these deviant sects people falling to the feet of their so-called scholars or Imam kissing their feet what is this is this Islam by Allah this is not Islam for another religion and call it what you're doing but do not relate this to Islam they carry their shoes and they kiss their shoes this is extremism not Islam at all Omar may Allah be pleased with him he himself did not want people to fall in such mayhem chaos and divergent from the right path of Islam and that is why when he heard that there are these ignorant people doing what they're doing he instructed the tree to be cut down and its location to be erased so that no one would come and do such innovations this is exactly what the people of Moses did when they followed Moses peace be upon him and they believed in Allah and Allah grant them victory against Pharaoh and those who were with him when they passed by a tree where people would hang their sacrifices and they would hang at their swords and so on out of sacrifice and forms of worship the people of Moses looked at him and said give us a similar tree so that we could do the same to them and this is an act of blasphemy you cannot sacrifice except allah azzawajal but this is the tradition the habit that the people are following Ramar may allah be pleased with him did not want this to happen because he wanted to protect Islam how would you demolish how would you undermine how would you destroy Islam simply by associating others with Allah by innovations by adding to the religion of Allah what is not part of it and this is exactly what the Prophet Allah Saul Salam did not want to glorify people more than their status is something that Islam does not allow or permit the Prophet himself is salatu salam whenever he entered his gathering in the masjid and his companions were sitting down he would hate it and he would be angered if any one of them stood up imagine the profit coming while we are all sitting and you come into the room and no one stands up to greet the Prophet Allister and if anyone dared to stand up to greet the Prophet the Prophet would look at him with anger because he did not want people to exaggerate by standing up to greet him this is the Sunnah of the Prophet item and that is why o mark stood firm anything that affected or came close to toe heat the monotheism to worshiping allah azza wajal or associating others with Allah as sol-gel he would completely annihilate it bandit and he would completely stop it because this is a wrong practice that neither Allah is pleased with nor the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam we have to respect our prophet we have to love him to the extent that we are willing to give our lives for him sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and we do but he warned us himself some Allah is LM not to go too extreme in loving him not to think that he knows the unseen not to think that he is not human being some people claim that well the Prophet also some used to walk he did not have any shadow and he never fell ill and he never slept and he never got sick what is easier God he is merely a human being sallallahu sell him but he's the perfect human being and there is nothing that you can say wrong about him so la langue Salim but he's not an angel he's better than an angel he's the perfect creation of Allah Almighty and the beloved creature to Allah the all-mighty we love him we follow him but we do not allow others to go into extreme because this is exactly what Shaitaan wants he wants us to glorify the dead he wants us to look up for the dead not in following the footsteps in righteousness and in following the Quran but in praising them and in some forms calling them and worshiping them and this is what a lot of the Muslims unfortunately are falling into look at the Muslim countries you find graves with marks on top of them people not worshipping Allah worshiping the graves they go to the graves and say I need money pay my debt give me children do this for me prevent harm from falling upon me and all of this is associating others with Allah and its major shirt and whoever does this never ever would he dream of entering the paradise of Allah the Almighty I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila what salam alikum warahmatu allahi wa barakato"
