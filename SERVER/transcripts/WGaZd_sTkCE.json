  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] foreign and welcome to our seventh class on the islamic and we are still discussing chapter number four and in this chapter we are talking about the classifications of people whether they are muslims or non-muslims and we spoke about the hypocrites and how they are divided into two types whether it is major hypocrisy or minor hypocrisy and i think we stopped at the section that deals with the basic rule of people's life and property and this is a common theme that theologians scholars that write in apida usually defer to so the sheikh says in his book the basic rule is that the life and property of a believer are protected and unlawful to anyone with regard to an unbeliever they have no such protection however this does not apply universally and to all an unbeliever may have protection because of his pledges or his promise of security and loyalty on the other hand a believer a muslim may be killed for an offense he commits such as murdering someone or adultery when he is married this statement needs clarification because a lot of misunderstanding may occur to enthusiastic muslims when they read such phrases so what destroys islam the most is half knowledgeable and by half knowledgeable we mean that a person who is not truly knowledgeable and at the same time he's not truly ignorant but he thinks that he is knowledgeable this destroys islam it's like half a doctor so if you go to a doctor he would diagnose your illness and give you the remedy with the grace of allah but when you go to a half a doctor and we have this them in our families among our companions we talk in gatherings oh i have this illness and then half a doctor comes and says do you get these symptoms you have this and that and you should take this medication or this herb and do not eat that specific food and you will be fine the poor person goes for such a recommendation ends up getting worse or even dead with islam it's worse because with medicine the worst thing that could happen is that you die eventually you're gonna die this year next year next decade inevitably you're gonna die but when it comes to religion aha now we have a serious problem when you have half a knowledgeable person teaching religion and giving factors and verdicts without having a predecessor who's knowledgeable without relaying the knowledge from sources that are authentic and reliable we have catastrophes and this is what's happening on the arena where does nicest come from the non-islamic state of iraq and syria not islamic they're not islam where do they come from from such half knowledgeable people people with corrupt so they come to such phrases that are spreading all over books of hakida when they say okay anyone who's a non-muslim is and this phrase is always be occurring and some of them even go to code said blah blah blah and they have facebook pages and i've seen some of them and they have articles with book name chapter and line and page etc anyone who would go through this with whoa man these names are big and this is reliable so yes and when you cross reference and go back to these chapters and to these volumes you'll find that it was miscoated so they lied and they took like when we recite in the quran woe to those who pray and i stop here allah said this in the quran so if it's maghrib time and i quote this ayah to you and said whoa i'm running away from hell if you tell me woe to those who pray i'm not going to pray man if allah doesn't want me to pray i'm not going to pray why because i did not complete the ayah to him those who are neglectful over their prayers ah woe to the worshippers to the people who pray if they are neglectful but if they're not then definitely they have paradise waiting for them likewise allah says do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated well you are wasted so if someone says allah says in the quran look look it's in black and white do not approach prayer do not come close to prayer full stop this is what's happening here so the phrase that his wealth and life is permissible for all to take if i don't have knowledge and i see this phrase so anyone who is non-muslim i can kill him i can take his wealth why because i have no proper knowledge in islam if you go to the books of sunnati if you go to the books of al-imam shafiri ibn taymiyyah imam abdul wahab all the great scholars of islam you will see that they say that a non-muslim is divided into different types there is the vimy there is the muahat there is the musta man and there is the harbin what are these classifications is someone who comes and lives in our country as a christian as a jew or whatever he pays the jizya and he has the permission from the ruler the muslim ruler to live among us so he has the vim of allah the protection of allah azzawajal he lives among us safe and sound and if there is any attack upon our country he lives in his home safe and sound he's not obliged to defend it is our duty to defend him because we gave him the pledge of security to stay and he's giving us the jizya the taxation number two al-mu'ahad a country that has a peace treaty you may call it that has a covenant between their country and ours that we do not attack them so they're not paying the jizya but they are good to us and we good to them so they come and visit visit and they may enter or i may see them in the bahamas or i may see them in the amazon area in our country is good with their country they have treaties he is he's got the pledge i cannot kill him i cannot take his money because we are on good terms as countries not as individuals maybe i hate his guts he's a cafe there's this believer we have a pledge and this is what most countries have so as muslim country we have so many treaties and pages with the vast majority of countries of the world even tahiti we have a pledge or a treaty with them we have diplomatic a relationship an embassy here an embassy there a consulate here i cancel it there so i cannot force them to do anything against their will i cannot attack them i cannot kill them i cannot do anything number three al-mustapman a country that we are at war with definitely yet one or more individual seek permission from the muslim ruler to come and do a particular errand business trip whatever i don't know but we are at war and for example ambassadors coming to convey a message so such a person has a temporary pass to guarantee his safety so he comes to my country people cannot simply go and kill him and if they do they are sinful and breaking the law and breaking the covenant of my own muslim ruler who i am obliged to honor yes but he's my enemy he's this is that you have no authority like when for example abu sufyan who was before accepting islam the leader of the quraishis of mecca idol worshipers a staunch enemy of the muslims he came to medina and the companions were there with their swords etc and they're looking at him and saying by allah the swords of muslims did not avenge the muslims from you abu bakr heard them and he said do you say this to a great leader of the quraysh tribe and he went to the prophet allah and complained and the prophet salaam said to him have you angered them abu bakr watch out you should not anger them over such a person so they did not attack him though they could have because they knew that the prophet assad had given him a pass to come to medina and to negotiate and to communicate though he's an enemy and from an enemy country so these are the three types of disbelievers the non-muslims vim me living in our country a citizen of another country that we have good relationships with and a musten someone who's coming from a country that we are at war with but with a temporary past what about the fourth category the fourth category is that of al-harbi someone that we are as muslims the whole entire ummah is at war with and we have no covenants with them we have no pledges we have no treaties with them such a country the people of such a country are considered to be halal for the muslims to kill and to take their wealth because they are our enemies and one who said oh this is barbaric is it so if a western soldier saw someone from al-qaeda or from isis in the wilderness or in a desert or whatever alone would he kill him or let him go definitely kill him and if he kills him would anybody condemn him or not no it's okay he's an enemy combatant he is a terrorist he's this he's that okay this is what you say so what about what a muslim country says about the citizens of that particular country who have invaded muslim lands confiscated muslims property killed muslims of that land and made them refugees and they are at war with them so do you think that we just meet and kiss and make up no this is a harvey these are the four categories mentioned usually in books of phil however i'm inclined to say that there is a fifth category which is of non-muslims who do not fall under these four categories could that be sheikh yeah for example people of um a tribe or a country so far away that we don't have any diplomatic relationships they're not muslims but they're not our enemies and we don't have any covenants with them or pledges so let's assume that there is an island next to australia and they have their own country but we don't have as muslims any diplomatic relationships with them none whatsoever if i meet their citizens can i kill them and take their money of course not why they're neither them me nor musta [Music] yes but they are a fifth category whom did not initiate any sort of aggression against us as muslims and we have no enmity with them in this case there is no way allowed for a muslim to simply say okay i have the classifications uh they're the me no check musta man check my heart check how to be no so it's not from these four categories then i can do whatever i want no you can't this is not a jungle the companions did not simply wander around anyone who they did not recognize as a muslim they would have killed no they were denied from doing this they were prohibited from doing this so this is extremely important for you as a muslim to remember to understand that we do not live in a jungle we do not just simply go around and classify people whether we can kill them or not or take their money or not no we are civilized we understand the relationships between ourselves as muslims and others governed through the quran and the sunnah not through our own intellect not through simply because xyz said something and we apply it no it is extremely important to understand this fact and this is why the sheikh says in uh the following statement which we will continue to study later on he says no one is to be considered a disbeliever except those whom allah and his messenger sallallahu asalam pronounced as such wow so this is quite important the issue of kufr is not for me and you just to throw randomly at people why because they're kafir they're this they're that where did you get this from um i don't know but they're not muslims so they're kafir hahaha or he's a muslim but he committed a sin while knowing allah is watching him then he's a kafir the vast majority of the counseling sessions i have are with muslims who are being used or abused by shaytan and they are constantly thinking ah sheikh is this kofur when i say xyz is this kufur when i think about this thing have i committed kuffar am i a mushrik and they under this vicious cycle that is about to destroy their lives imagine i get some of my i don't know if i call them patients or clients or whatever or students maybe because i'm not a doctor i'm not a physician i'm not a shrink i'm not a psychiatrist i've never studied these things but i'm a muslim and i have knowledge how shaytaan behaves and how he knows how you think and how he intervenes with these intrusive thoughts well i've been getting people calling me and having these sessions crying weeping not eating not drinking and not i'm not talking about one or ten or fifty hundreds and why is this because this is how shaytan messes up with their minds and this is his ultimate goal to depress you to intimidate you and to have you with him as a companion in hell fire on the day of judgment it's you who's opening the door for him so once you learn once you get the knowledge a proper knowledge my job is not to convince you my job is not to heal you or to cure your illness i don't have this my job is to open your eyes what you have is an eye opener and then you say what the heck i know all of these things how come i never applied it in my life so you have to learn and this is what we're here for to learn that tak fear is not up to me in you it's only up to allah azza and to the prophet to render to label to classify someone as a kafir and we will get to this inshallah so the basic again the basic rule is that the life and property of a believer are protected and unlawful to anyone what's the evidence sheikh the evidence is the numerous verses of the quran and the hadiths of the prophet the most well-known hadith where the prophet assam addressed the people on the farewell hajj when he said to them that your wealth and your safety or life or blood and your honor your reputation our haram upon one another similarly to the prohibition of your day in this sacred month in this sacred land so this hadith clearly indicates that i cannot simply come and kill you as a muslim i cannot simply come and take your money and laugh about it and say i'm a good businessman i took his money i cheated to him off a fortune i borrowed money and i neglected him i can't do that no can do this is haram it's a major sin and this is the default oh but sheikh my neighbor doesn't pray in the masjid and he curses me and my family all the time he uses bad words so i got a chance to steal his car is that okay he said no his wealth is haram but he did this it's haram period you cannot transgress against his wealth not a single penny nor against his health by smacking him or shedding his blood or killing him or injuring him the hadith of the prophet islam is crystal clear he said to his companions do you know who is the one whose stone broke so the companion said yeah the guy who doesn't have any dirham or dinar no euros no dollars he's broke he doesn't have money he said no the truly broke muslim is from among you is the one who comes on the day of judgment with lots of prayer lots of fasting and lusts of charity so he's he looks like a good legit person but he cursed this one swore and abused verbally that one backbitten this one beaten and shed the blood of this one consumed the wealth of that one so these are all major sins the prophet said so he would be brought forward on the day of judgment and he will be given giving from his own good deeds to compensate for his sins and if his good deeds are over if they run out then he starts to take and accumulate from their bad deeds and then he will be thrown into hell what a fate after all of these years that we had spent in this life praying fasting giving charity practicing islam or pretending to be practicing islam this is your fate because you transgressed upon others and it's pay time now having said that the sheikh says with regard to a disbeliever they have no such protection we've gone through this through the five classifications of the disbelievers however this does not apply universally and to all although this is the default there are exceptions what do you mean he says a disbeliever may have protection because of his pledges or his promise of security and loyalty so this is what we were referring to whether he's a vimy or a or simply someone who's a non-muslim is a disbeliever but there is no enmity there's no war between us a simple gi joe someone who has no beef with us as muslims so we treat them well we go to their country we meet them we greet them we don't transgress against them because they're not our enemy the only people and this is a general rule the only people we as muslims are allowed to attack are the blatant enemies of islam who our country considers them enemies of them and of islam that's it simple and straightforward other than that none of the disbelievers or the non-muslims we're allowed to transgress against with regard to a disbeliever they have okay we've gone through this and may have protection because okay on the other hand a believer may be killed ah now we're coming up talking about a muslim the default is a muslim has protection but the the author says a believer may be killed for an offense he committed such as murdering someone or adultery when he's married okay so let's look into this when we say that a muslim has protection this kind of protection is not forever there are red lines and if he transgresses if he passes if he crosses any of these red lines then he has to pay the price he's a muslim yes if he transgresses and kills and murders another muslim and we spoke about this when we talked about the islamic jurisprudence course when are we to execute a murderer this is up to his family his heirs they can number one ask for a life for a life an eye for an eye so he killed our brother our father our relative we demand that he's executed the muslim ruler kills him or we may take the blood money or we may forgive him altogether so this is a murderer and what about a muslim man who is married or was previously married or is a widow and he commits adultery and he either confesses or he's caught red-handed and there are four male muslim witnesses testifying that they've seen the genitals in one another so the punishment for such a crime is execution stoning till death the third reason for justifying killing a muslim is that when he commits the act of apostasy when he exits the fold of islam when he changes his religion from islam to any other religion the muslim ruler appoints a panel of muslim judges to interrogate him to try to advise him to try to bring him back to islam and put some sense in he was into his mind if the person is adamant and he is defiant and he does not want to comply they tell him that the punishment of such an action is execution you'll die and if he still insists then they issue their verdict and give it to the muslim ruler the muslim ruler looks into it and then orders his directive for this person to be executed these three cases were mentioned in the authentic hadith when the prophet said allah it is not permissible to shed the blood of a muslim meaning to kill a muslim except with three things one a soul for a soul the murderer to an adulteress adulterer three the one who abandons the majority the jamaa and leaves his religion and in all these three things the only person permitted to execute such a punishment is only the muslim ruler or his deputy the muslim judge does not have this authority he gives the ruling but he does not execute it only the muslim ruler or whom he deputizes can carry out this punishment so it's not for tom dick or harry it's not for those who claim that honor killing is permissible and there's nothing honorable in such murders a woman fornicates her brother her father are hot-blooded they assign someone to kill her this is murder and they will be admitted to hellfire it's not their call it's the muslim rulers job and duty after ensuring that there are evidences beyond doubt that can stand in a court of law that she fornicated and not everyone who fornicates is executed if she was not previously married it's only flogging 100 lashes not killing so lots of the muslims have their religion confused due to their lack of knowledge so this is something that must be understood when a person learns his akida okay what about the wealth sheikh when can we take a muslim's money well this is again up to the muslim ruler if someone borrowed money and he refuses to to give it back it's the duty of the muslim ruler to issue a directive of taking it forcefully from him and sometimes the muslim ruler has the authority to take double the amount as in the case of people who do not give zakat on time and they try to cheat their way out of zakat so he has the power to find them equivalent to the amount of zakat they are trying to evade and so on so there are many ways and things that allow the muslim ruler to take the wealth of other muslims when it is needed and these things are indeed important for a muslim to be part of his conviction this is part of your akida this is part of your religion if you don't know this then you should learn it because we're not talking about something that's disputable we're talking about the core of our belief and conviction and this is why such classes are important because it makes you firm on your religion it makes you certain of your religion not hesitant and then the sheikh says no one is to be considered an unbeliever except those whom allah and his messenger pronounce as such for example and he starts giving examples for things that nullify our religion that nullify islam and we will get to talk about this insha allah next time we meet so i think we will stop here with and begin to take your questions justin says how can i protect myself from shikh of the heart would having a man in one's heart be a barrier to this first of all we have to understand what is meant by shirk of the heart in order to protect ourselves from it so when someone says how can i protect myself from covet 19. if you don't know how coveted 19 is transmitted if you don't know how carbon 19 behaves when a person is infected with it most likely you won't be able to protect yourself from it so what is the shirk of the heart now remember that shirk is associating others with allah and we will come to talk about this in detail later classes however the shirk of the heart is when the heart looks to someone else other than allah it can be minor and it can be major so if you trust other than allah if you fear other than allah and again i don't know if you followed that or not when we spoke about the three fundamental principles we spoke about the type of fear that takes a person out of the fold of islam there is natural fear which is normal i fear lions i fear crocodiles i fear snakes so if i see them i wouldn't just ignore them and continue to pray because they're going to kill me if the house is on fire i have to run no one any sound mind will say no this is you are fearing the fire and the fire can't harm you without the permission of allah i know but it's burning me yeah if you had strongly man like ibrahim allah would save you who says that allah told me to take the means and get the heck out of here run simple as that and so many times people mix and confuse these great things so one one person once asked sheikh if i am praying in the masjid like i think it happened once in indonesia the land of my great grandfathers and the imam kept on praying while the whole masjid was trembling and about to fall on his head so one said sheikh if if i were in a similar situation or for example if i was praying an alliance sniffing and approaching to i don't know he's not interested in deuteronomy for sure so the lion is coming and getting closer should i continue salat what kind of question is this so i said if you can maintain your wudu you may continue to pray but usually people in such uh situations would either wet themselves or even do something even worse so no allah told you to take the means and run and not to wait for it and this is not shirk this is known as natural fear the fear that is shirk is the one that people have in their heart that is equal or superior to the fear of allah azzawajal so you would not do a particular thing yet you have no problem in sinning or committing a another sin while allah is watching you and trusting other than allah depending on people having your heart 100 percent connected to an individual who promised you to find you a job and when someone tells you make dua to allah that he facilitates this job for you no no the only person who can get me this job is so and so so your heart is totally diverted towards this creature rather than allah shirk of the heart is when someone tells you swear by allah that you did not steal the mobile phone he said yeah well i did not steal the mobile phone so what so okay swear by your sheikh or by your peer or by the prophet that you did not steal the mobile i said um i can't do that because i'm afraid that their wrath would fall upon me yeah i i took the moba i'm not gonna lie so subhan allah swearing by allah is no problem swearing with your peers or with your wellies or with jilani or tijani or badawi is a major sin that you refrain from doing all of these things are shake usually people don't have this in their hearts true muslims love allah azzawajal love the prophet depend entirely on allah subhanahu wa ta'ala they don't fear anyone but allah subhanahu wa ta'ala for real and they trust allah and they supplicate invoke only allah and they depend and rely only on allah they have hope only in allah subhanahu ta'ala so with these things in your heart there is no way for you to fall into shirk of the heart and this is the manifestation of true iman and allah knows west tasdrin says if we were if we are in an area where the only masjid is of extreme railways doing blatant shirk should we attend jumaa it's a rule of thumb that the prayer behind a mushrik is not permissible but first we have to ensure that that individual is a mushrik so if the imam clearly calls the prophet isam oh prophet of allah do this for me protect us from what calamities we're undergoing oh prophet of allah do this for that or if he believes that only the prophet knows the unseen if he believes that the prophet is hazard he's around us and he hears us and he is capable of doing whatever we ask him to do and he controls the universe as if he controls and sees his the palm of his hand this is blatant ship you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that so such in imam you definitely can't pray jumu'ah or normal prayers behind him so what to do the only way possible is to look for a masjid that the imam is a follower of a sunnah or a hanafi masjid or a fairy message anything that is not real me or not committing and if this is not possible then you have to look into your area and see if you can find three or more muslims brothers who follow the sunnah who have correct apida and you guys make your own jummah in a room or in a hall or somewhere so that you would fulfill this great ritual and allah knows best rashid uh kasmani i think says can we pay electricity bill with interest money as i was told by someone it's okay please enlighten me with correct authentic information first of all rashid what is the classification of interest money what is it definitely no one doubts this so interest money that are generated by bank accounts the conventional bank accounts this is river what is the ruling on consuming riba it's one of the major sins in islam so what do we do with it well if there is no other islamic bank around in this interest is forced upon you then you have to take it and to cleanse your wealth by giving it away to poor or needy muslims so in muslim charity okay can i use this interest money to pay my utility bills the answer is have you benefited from your utilities your electricity your water your mobile phone yeah so you are ordered to pay them from your own earned halal money and this means that you cannot utilize the interest money by giving it to such companies because this would be using haram money for your own benefits which is totally prohibited and not permissible so you must cleanse your wealth by giving it to muslim charity karima says what if i lied to help a friend to preserve their dignity and not harming anyone lying is not permissible in islam the prophet alaihis was told us in many hadith as it's found in the quran as well that lying is a major sin however the prophet al-assad made an exception to lie in three situations as the hadith indicates to lie at war so if i'm at war and my enemy army is is dropping or listening to my communications part of the strategy of war that we say okay i'm talking to the commander of the fleet of so and so we're headed tomorrow at 600 hours to the north of this island to arrange an ambush and i'm making sure that the enemy hears this but actually i'm not i'm going south to attack their base there they can't come and say you guys lied you said you're going north and you went south what is this no this is not lying this is war and it is permitted to do such things at war i'm not having a covenant with you i'm not having a peace treaty this is prohibited for me to lie in but other than that this is strategy and it's no problem in that secondly we are allowed to lie a spouse to his spouse or to her spouse so the couple can lie to one another but this is not generally speaking this is related to what increases the love between them and i always give this example when the man comes out of the bathroom after the shower wearing only his towel and he starts to flux flex his muscles in front of the matter and he says to his wife how do i look and she breaks into laughter for 15 minutes and after she regains her breath she says what do you mean look at your belly you're unable to see your toes while standing do you think yourself arnold schwarzenegger this kind of comments would usually end up with divorce be diplomatic be tactical lie say wow man you look so handsome so sexy i don't know what to say you're just gorgeous such lies are okay same thing when your wife comes out and she cooks a good meal so she thinks spending two and a half hours in the kitchen and you take the first bite or taste and say what is this this is dog food it's not suitable for human consumption well this would cause lots of trouble and resentment in her heart you should appreciate that she she spent such a long time in the kitchen doing her best maybe her best wasn't the best but she tried so you should say wow the food is magnificent i think according to the pirelli rate of the mission not that's another tired company the michelin rating you should have five stars i don't think any restaurant or a chef has this the max they have three but it should be out of five i don't know i'm not an expert in these things so such lying is halal the third type of lying is to reconcile between two fighting factions individuals or groups so there are two muslims fighting they don't speak to one another and they have hatred and enmity i go to this one and i say wow i've been to so and so and he said so many good things about you and he cursed shrapnel for not allowing him to get close to you and it's this enmity that shaytan is causing but he says that he respects you and he loves you so he says seriously he said wallahi he said this to me i'm lying and i'm even swearing in lying then i go to the other guy and said by allah he said he wish he could speak to you like before he loves you and he loves your company and he said that you're generous and he said seriously he said that and i tried to get them closer and maybe invite both of them for dinner such lying is halal because allah loves reconciliation and hates division now when you come and you want to lie to save someone's dignity or honor and not harming anyone this is not permissible so to lie and say that oh yes a nadia my cousin she didn't go out with her boyfriend she doesn't have a boyfriend where when i'm i know that she does so lying is prohibited i can't lie you may dodge the question if you want so not to expose her but to go into her defense by lying and covering up her sins or to protect her honor no this is hala if you are unable to say the truth then at least do not contribute in falsehood and this is an important rule that we have to implement as much as possible okay she says several times you refer to hesnal muslim fortress of the muslim booklet there is a hadith saying seven times [Music] and three times in the evening and morning at car the hadith is hasan i'm doing this at car daily but you said that the hadith is not authentic now i'm very confused what should i do please explain with reference is the muslim can be followed undoubtedly or not first of all if i can give you references out of the tip of my mind would i be teaching you guys i would be somewhere else with the major scholars doing this and that i would be i i don't have this ability not because i'm old to remember which is true but it needs to be researched i don't have the memory these guys have so whatever i speak i can't shoot from the hip if i don't have knowledge i have to go back to the references and cross-examine and come up with a verdict so i can't give you references but what i'll can tell you is uh saying it seven times is not authentic the hadith is weak and sheikh al-bani classified it as such now does this mean that i should ditch and get rid of the fortress of the muslim booklet no see only the quran is infallible is fault proof has no faults in it only the quran all other books may have small or tiny or little errors or big errors depending on the book itself so his muslim is one of the greatest booklets on azkar and the vast majority of the afghan and the duas in it are authentic the vast majority you're talking about maybe 98 97 of it and these two or three percent that are not authentic they are not for sure not authentic meaning that it is a disputed issue some scholars authenticate it others don't authenticate it not that it is totally weak and the sheikh just put it there by his own whims and desires may allah have mercy on his soul who allah has placed a lot of acceptance to his small booklet that is that was spreaded all over the globe subhanallah so the hadith is weak yes but some scholars authenticated it my stance is that we follow sheikh al-bani in the vast majority of what he said as for the azkar of uh three times this according to the most authentic opinion of scholars is said only after fajr you don't say it after or during the evening of car but again this is an issue of dispute so what to do if you say it i wouldn't say that you're sinful i don't i don't say it myself i only say it in fajr but you can't simply say i need a booklet that is false fault proof no there isn't anything like that you have to do your level best in finding and acquiring what is most authentic and depend and rely on this fact by selecting and choosing a scholar of hadith who you accept his authentication like to do over this issue put where our hands up our chest or down our belly buttons and navels or what to do there are many confusing verdicts of the scholars well you have to take one particular scholar who you trust his religious uh commitment his knowledge his righteousness and you follow him in whatever he says because you're a layman likewise in hadith i'm not a scholar of hadith so whenever whenever whenever i'm blinded and not able to distinguish whether this is authentic or not i go to my sheikh who is sheikh al-bani and go to his references and see the latest he had written and commented on the grade of such a hadith and act upon it and allah azza knows best so this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave"
