  "transcript": "foreign we have hadith 145 with it we inshallah conclude the chapter that deals with eid prayer and the hadith was narrated by um may allah be pleased with her and who would read it for us yes brother narrated um he the messenger of allah commanded us that we should take out the young woman and virgins for eid prayers and he commanded the menstruating woman to remain away from the place of worship of muslims in another narration in another narration narrated um we were commanded to come out on the day of eid and even bring out the virgin girls and menstruating women so that we might stand behind the men and say that bear along with them and invoke allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and the purification from sins who is the one to command them is so he commanded them to get the young girls and even the virgins in seclusion this is a description that virgins usually are so shy and bashful that they stay indoors that was at the time of the prophet saws nowadays unfortunately shame and bashfulness has been long ago gone away except for those who inshallah are considered to be practicing so the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam instructed the women on mataya and those who were with her instructed them to do what was not usual and that is to get the young girls and the virgins and those who are shy and not exposed to get them to attend their eid sermon not only that even the women who are excused from praying women who has their monthly period the prophet assam said even those let them come and attend why the prophet said said in the hadith so that they would invoke allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and the purification so it is a gathering that is blessed it's a gathering where allah's mercy descends and allah azza purifies those who attend so it would be a waste to spare people and not to have them attend as well yet because the women who are in their monthly period are not allowed to pray the prophet alaihis ordered them to stay away from the people when they're praying but after prayer it's okay so women in their menses must not sit between the rows when other women are praying but as soon as the prayer is over halas they can come and join them now from this hadith scholars differed on the ruling of the friday let me rephrase that on the ruling of the eid prayer and remind me if i forget what happens if a friday and eight coincide in the same day so some scholars say that eight prayer is sunnah it is highly recommended but it is not mandatory and this is the opinion of imam malik and remember that it is sunnah why they said because in the hadith of the bedouin who came to the prophet alaihis salatu and asking him about islam when the prophet told him that you have to pray five times a day he said do i have to pray anything else the prophet said what no except if you would like to offer voluntary prayers then the man said by allah i will not increase nor decrees to what you have taught me what did the prophet say sallallahu alaihi sallam whoever wishes to see a man of jannah let him see or let him look at this man so they said the only thing that is mandatory and obligatory is the five daily prayers have mercy upon his soul said no it is a collective obligation which means that if a portion of the muslims do it then there is no sin upon the others who didn't but if all the muslims don't do it then they're all sinful example answering the salaam we have here about 30 people someone comes and says allah if none of them answers him there will be all what sinful but if one of the thirty only one says allah this is sufficient and they all are not considered to be sinful this is meaning that this is individual obligation this means that every single one has to do it and who doesn't do it he's considered to be sinful example when someone sneezes and says alhamdulillah every single muslim who heard him say alhamdulillah it's mandatory upon him to say your hamkum allah if the 29th do it and one does not do it the 29 are not sinful but the one who did not do it is sinful on the day of judgment so imam ahmed says that praying reid is not individually obligation but it is collective obligation meaning if a portion of the muslims do it then the rest are exempted why he says because there is no adhan and there is no so we cannot say that it is mandatory of every person the third opinion and ruling is the opinion of imam abu hanifa and he says that it is obligatory upon every individual and sheikh islam in tamiya followed his opinion and said yes this is the most authentic opinion so did she that it is mandatory it is obligatory upon every individual why they said because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ordered them to get those who do not have to pray women who are in their menses he ordered them to make them come out and attend the aid prayer and we know that they are not obliged to pray in the masjid when they're pure and clean so to oblige them to come out means that it is mandatory upon every individual to attend this great festival and this is the most authentic opinion of all and it is only twice a year that it takes place and it's not a big deal but there are a number of etiquettes that are not mentioned here i think that it is any adding value to no upon or among the etiquettes one the sunnah in idol fitter that you eat three dates or more before going to the prayer why scholars say because if you don't eat maybe people who think that you're fasting and either is an indication that ramadan is over and that is why the prophet before going for the eighth prayer he used to eat three dates or five or seven depending yet when you go to eid the sunnah is that you do not eat anything so that the first thing you would put in your mouth would be the meat of your slaughtering this is the sunnah the prophet used to go without eating anything and after he slaughters his sheep or his sacrifice he eats from it but if you're not going to sacrifice then it is okay for you to eat if you're going to sacrifice on the third day of eight it would be a little bit torture to ask you not to eat so this is something that is sunnah providing you are going to slaughter soon or after the prayer among the sunnahs is to have a bath to have rusul though this was not reported by the prophet but it was reported by the companions that they used to make russell and to clean themselves and scholars say that cleaning yourself for aid is far greater than cleaning yourself for friday because it is occasion an occasion for celebration and it is part of the sunnah to designate to designate address especially and specifically for it and that is why in arabia we usually buy new clothes to be worn on the day of eight and after that we use it until the other eight comes we buy a new set of clothes so that the clothes we go to read would be our most valuable our most precious without being extravagant we have a short break stay tuned inshallah alhamdulillah and welcome back among the things that are part of the etiquette of eid is that you walk of course medina at the time was very small so walking to the musa is not so far nowadays when you have cities like riyadh like mumbai like dubai to walk to amuse allah that might be at the outskirts of the city would not be a very good thing to do so if there is a musa next to you a prayer ground next to you it is recommended if they're following the sunnah that you go and pray there on foot part of the sunnah is to go back using a different road or route that you used for going to the musa so if you use road a when you're going back to your home you use road b or on any other road why this is a sunnah the prophet assam would give salam to different sets of people on road a we give salam to all the people we met on road b there would be a new set of people to give salaam and others say no there's another or third or a fourth reason either way this is the sunnah among the sunnahs of eight is that you pray read not in the masjid see the prophet alaihis allah prayed so many great prayers never ever it was reported in an authentic hadith that he prayed it in his masjid which a prayer is equivalent to a thousand prayers elsewhere the reward of praying in the masjid of medina is so great yet in eight the prophet we used to go out to the prayer open area which is far a little bit far away from the masjid so there is a weak hadith that stated that the prophet prayed alaihistasm in his masjid when it rained when eight it rained so it wasn't feasible for them to go out and pray in the open area so they prayed in the masjid but this is a weak hadith so the sunnah is to pray in an open ground and unfortunately a lot of the muslims nowadays are so lazy they pray all in messages even small masjids prayer holes and they claim that they're praying eight and this is not part of the sunnah one of the things that the aid has a speciality for is that when the day of eight coincides with a friday the prophet said alaihis whoever prayed eid with us is exempted from praying friday so if you eat is on the day of friday and you pray eid when it comes to the time of jummah or friday you pray lord you pray at home you don't go to the masjid and the only one who is obliged to go to the masjid is the thin and the poor imam he has to make the eid and he has to make the friday khutbah and this is the sunnah of the prophet and that is why he said whoever attended the eid with us today he if he wishes he may attend friday with us and if he doesn't he can pray it and we will pray friday so this is one of the things that aid and friday have in common when they are at the same day i believe almost that these are all the most of the rulings related to aid i'll take now your questions yes brother as we know that women with menses are encouraged to go for eid prayers but today as we know the eid prayers are held mostly in the masjid rather than open areas so what is the ruling on that the ruling is that women are not allowed to enter a masjid when they are in the menses therefore if a woman inherits us and the people are going to pray the masjid she stays home but if she is going to pray in the musa she goes out with him and that is why the muslim is not a masjid that is why when you come to eight prayer in an open area do we pray to raka's tahiti no we sit there is no prayer before it therefore she is not allowed to enter the masjid and one last thing i forgot to describe is how to perform eight prayer the eighth prayer is different than other prayers by inserting a number of takbir so the sunnis to offer seven techbears in the first saka and five tech bears in the second rakah and the rest is the like all other records the seven techbears are they including takbir tularam or we have to add them to take it's an issue of dispute among scholars i personally believe that you offer take birth then you say subhanahu seven times and then you say when you are in your prostration the second prostration of the first raka you stand up for the second raka you say allahu akbar you don't raise your hands of course this is from prostration to standing up and then you add five tech bears and each techbera of the seven and of the five you raise your hands you say allah so this is the format of praying ate prayer which is the most important thing and we neglect it simply because the sheikh did not mention it in his book second question yes brother sheikh last time when we met you talked about uh akrika so when a person has to do an akrika of a child who is a boy so there are two goats to be sacrificed so if that person he sacrifices a camel so is there any different count for the camel that's a good question is sacrificing a camel permissible instead of sacrificing sheep for akika scholars have differed and the most authentic opinion is it is not permissible a camel or a cow is sufficient for seven or seven hadi seven people or seven fidya if you have seven fidiaz to make an offer a camel or a cow is sufficient only on pilgrimage or umrah but for artika it has to be a sheep or a goat a six-month-old sheep or a one-year-old goat that does not have any deformities does not have any harmful things in it it's not one eye it's not limping it's not sick it's not extremely bony and thin it has to be a good acceptable sacrifice yes brother this is regarding the sacrifice uh once we get the animal and say we keep it for ten days or whatever time period it is or maybe we get in the night uh and after we get the camel it gets sick or it injures itself then can we sacrifice the animal or we have to wait till it gets cured scholars say that if a sacrifice was appointed and has to be appointed bringing five sheep in your house without saying that this is my sheep for reid is not enough you have to appoint it scholars say that if you appoint your sheep and it is harmed or defected not by your choice or by your doing because sometimes you may carry it and you drop it and it breaks a leg it's your doing no it was kept on the roof or in the backyard and it was fully okay nothing's wrong with it and all of a sudden it fell sick or it broke an arm or a leg or etc scholars say that if it's not your own doing and after you had appointed it you can sacrifice it still because this is not something of your doing allah azza knows best yes brother you said that uh week hadith narrates that prophet salallahu salaam prayed in his masjid while it was raining what should be done if it rains and we have to offer each salah yes this is permissible for you when you have a legitimate reason such as rain or snow or extreme cases of wind a storm you can pray in the masjid but the hadith that the prophet prayed in the masjid when it rained this is not authentic to the best of my knowledge yet however this is the only thing to do it is not islamic to instruct people to sit under the rain or under the snow in an open area and harm themselves to attend the khutba they have masjids they can go to but i'm speaking about general conditions in normal conditions no it is not permissible or at least it is not recommended to pray in message eight prayer abdul rahman sheikh this is regarding the khudba which is said on the day of eid so what's the correct way of delivering the food boundary of eid without any difference among scholars like in the hadith of even omar and other hadiths the prophet umar they all offered prayer before the khutbah unlike friday so this is the sunnah there is no other sunnah at all in this regard and the difference among scholars is whether it's with sitting in between like friday or onehutbah and the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of that it is only one khutbah it's not two khutbahs like the jummah and the prophet islam gave it without a pulpit so if he stood up in the open and we claimed that it is too hot but where is he going to sit there's no pulpit there's nothing yes bro check what is the ruling like should we have a central gathering place for the whole city or can we have different gathering places on the day of eat the ideal thing is to have a central place but is this logical in a place as big as mumbai for example how many muslims do we have four million five million in mumbai approximately where you gonna put those it's not realistic nowadays in cosmopolitan cities where it's too big too huge and you can't have an open ground but it would be the ideal thing because the lesser places of congregation the better when we have one message that is jammer for everybody it's better than having 10 or 15 or 100 segregated messages because then the muslims are joined in one place therefore it is recommended always to attend the biggest of all because you would be with the biggest majority and the biggest jamaa i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
