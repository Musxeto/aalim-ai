  "transcript": "uh the following question regarding a tomato we know that kamehameha is to offer umrah in the months of hajj what are the months of hajj and why is it the best type of hajj we all know that the months of hajj are the 10th 11th and the 12th months of the islamic calendar which are and why is it the best because it has more rituals indeed than the other two it uh uh exceeds them in in having one hawa and one sari more and because a person travels a journey of a month or two for two rituals for umrah and then he is back to his halal state and he waits in makkah and medina it doesn't go back to his home and then he offers hajj again in the journey so it's prolonging the time of worship and allah azza knows best"
