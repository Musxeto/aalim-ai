  "transcript": "so my question is the majority of Muslims in my country follow the xiafiani school of thought over the Shafi method and one particular thing people do here is to raise their hands and offer who know prayer during the second or Father prayer of the Republican and so on and so forth so if I were to be in a congregational further prayer and the Imam raises his hands and offers so that you join them and raise my hands as well also its latest stand silent and just listen to what the Imam stage first of all raising the hands in the second draca of federal prayer every single day specifically as done in Indonesia in Malaysia in shafri dominated countries this is an innovation what is the definition of innovation it is something that the prophet sallallahu did not do but we do it in order to get closer to Allah azure now all the companions of the Prophet is acknowledge that he did not raise his hands and do kunut in Fajr where did they get this they got it from misunderstanding of a Hadith because and it can refer to not speaking in prayer and to stand still and also to prolong the recitation of the Quran therefore when they looked at some of such Hadith they thought that it was referring to the Dua yet the prophet did Dua against Real the Quan and from Benny Hussain on Benny Legion when they ambushed and assassinated 70 of his companions battle if I recall correct correctly so for a whole month in the five daily prayers not only in Fajr he used to make Dua against them oh Allah avenge my companions Allah destroy them until Allah azzawajal revealed that you have nothing to do with this so he refrained and stopped and it continued to the rest of his life so to only isolate Federal was not done by the prophet Islam to do it every single day was not done by the prophet is nevertheless the shafiri school of thought is a respected and reputable school of thought if the Imam is convinced that this is part of the Sunnah and the congregation alongside with him and they do this Dua what is it that we must do the scholars say that there is no problem because it's a respected school of thought that when the Imam makes Dua you raise your hands and say amen and this is what I do when I travel to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and I pray Fajr with the Muslims and they make the Dua I raise my hands and say I mean though I am convinced that this is not from the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best"
