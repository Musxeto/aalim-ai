  "transcript": "we're trying to go through your um lectures on your channel and I don't know where to start but should I start with an Islamic fit or Islamic and here you have regardless you have two playlists here um the one that you did two years ago and then the one did eight years ago which is okay uh brother Abdullah is asking about seeking knowledge through going to YouTube channel my YouTube channel where I have a number of playlists and he asks which one should I begin with my own preference and recommendation is to begin with the beautiful names of Allah azzawajal this is extremely important because this is the most important form of knowledge on Earth and the science gets its honor and place and level according to what is being studied and there's nothing more honorable than Allah azzawajal so to study Allah's beautiful names and Allah's beautiful attributes that is the most important thing for you to do then there is the playlist which is the three principle fundamentals and this is a classical book and this also deals with an essential part of our atida if you cover these two I believe that inshallah you have started on the right track after that you go to learning issues of that would help you learn more about your prayer your fasting your zakat your Hajj and also other forms of transactions and as you correctly mentioned there are two playlists one is the Islamic which is a contemporary book that has its ups and downs but alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah I pray to Allah that I've made a good job in correcting the mistakes and placing the right rules and verdicts according to the most authentic opinion and it's not very long it's quite concise and I do not elaborate a lot on it once you finish this then you can go on to the more extended virgins of Arcada for example there is the Islamic faith and this is a contemporary book also that may have few mistakes which I pointed out alhamdulillah and I pray to Allah I was correct in doing that so that what you get at the end result would be the most authentic opinion according to your arcade that Allison knowledgehammad and also there is which was done nine years or ten years ago in Mumbai India and it is a classical book taught in universities but it's a longer version based on the Hadith so this is not effect a playlist based on a particular meth Hub rather it's based on the actual evidence the actual saying of the Prophet where we we elaborate on it and it's a workshop and and insha Allah it would be quite uh helpful and beneficial but it's quite long so I would highly recommend you getting a pen and a paper and listening to it and writing whatever you don't understand and search for it and look for it and then this is how you expand your own knowledge insha Allah vastly uh"
