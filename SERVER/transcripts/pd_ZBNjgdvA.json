  "title": "Paid zakat in form of food basket to charity out of ignorance, must I repay my zakat Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "with my ignorance i paid it in a form of ramadan to a charity company a charity for the firm and then after that i figure out that this account should be paid in a cash to the poor people not in a form of buying some stuff for in their behalf so should i repay again i paid 70 percent of my zakat in the form of ramadan to a charity so so those companies so charities they should be responsible of delivering that to the poor people so what do you recommend these 70 of your zakat are are sadaqa and you have to pay it again in cash to the poor in the form of zakat and allah would not let this go in vain the 70 percent you bought these baskets ramadan baskets they are charity they are sadaqa and they are accepted by allah but they cannot be from your zakat"
