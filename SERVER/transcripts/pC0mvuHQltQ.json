  "transcript": "yes so my question is is it permissible for someone who is from a Muslim country to take the nationality of a non-muslim country of of a secular Muslim country like turkey okay uh first of all the issue of changing your nationality from a Muslim country to a cfir country is not permissible unless there is a necessity such as a person being prosecuted or there is turmoil and fighting and Civil Wars Etc and there's no place for him safe to stay and there's no Muslim country that would take him in now taking the nationality of a so-called secular country the vast majority of the people in such secular countries are Muslims so it takes the ruling of a Muslim country and hence it is permissible to acquire their nationality and Allah knows better best"
