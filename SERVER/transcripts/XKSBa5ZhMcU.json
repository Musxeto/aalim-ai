  "transcript": "sh my question is regarding the Blissful ignorance of others who accidentally break the fast during the fasting hours of Ramadan during the fasting hours of Ramadan if a friend is about to take out a water bottle to drink is it obligatory for me to stop him or is Allah feeding him and I should abstain no this is mandatory upon you to remind him if a person is about to drink or eat during the daytime of Ramadan out of forgetfulness then it is not permissible for you to say well Allah is feeding him and giving him drink let him enjoy it no you have to stop him likewise if someone is asleep when it's fer time and you say well he's asleep let him sleep until it's 10 or 11: a.m. no wake him up for fuder this is mandatory upon you"
