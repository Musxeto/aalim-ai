  "title": "Should all Muslims celebrate Eid on the same day? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is an issue of controversy because one school of thought says that we should all celebrate eight on the same day we should all start fasting on the same day the whole Ummah is one but this is not logical because we have different regions so even we have different time zones so if we have people in Australia for example and people in Saudi Arabia there down under so for maybe they're closer just that from the east logically each region has its own sighting and that is and scholars some say that it is estimated by two thousand two hundred and twenty six kilometers so this is the distance for every region to have and you cannot unite them because and I'll give you an example some people say no you have to unite them if someone sees the sights the moon in India the people in Morocco should start fasting well this is not logical because for example for hatch in Hajj if people see the moon of the hedge in India and the people do not see it in Saudi Arabia we follow the sighting of the moon in Saudi Arabia which means that if you say no we have to do you have to follow me this means that those who are standing on Mount Arafat on the ninth of the hedger according to the sighting of the moon in Saudi Arabia they are standing on it on the 8th of the hedge according to the sighting of the people in India and this could not be this means that the three million people performing Qaeda are not actually have performed Hajj and that is why she has mm tamiya and the the major council of elam of scholars inside arabia and and a lot and a lot of scholars throughout the time say every region has to have their own sighting"
