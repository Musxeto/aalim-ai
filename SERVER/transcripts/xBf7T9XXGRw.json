  "transcript": "/my raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabi rahmatan lil alamin nabina muhammad in wada LED wasabi luminous today we had he was nervous phonetically immediate my back assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato our workshop for today and tomorrow insha'Allah is with this beautiful book not all of it because to go through all of it we would probably need like seven to eight months seriously every day because to go through a hadith a one hadith of the Prophet and his salat WA Salam you need volumes the Prophet said Alice Ostrom about himself that he was given the concise of speech and this is this is your course right on us well I don't know this sequence part one okay so when you go through a hadith of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam you find so much knowledge squeezed into a single or couple of words and to explain this you need volumes so for example the Prophet says izembaro voila there are two birds and this is one of the legal Maxim's in Islam of kaleidos up here in Islam and the scholar spoke extensively about it Endemol are malleable yet everybody knows this hadith it is 1/3 as mm cherry says it is one third of the entire Islam when the Prophet said our 'his alot of salami ax ax bar o my mother hadn't arrived for words hadith Imam a shocker he said when Imam he went to a management to sleep over and a footnote don't think I'm wasting time I am the material we have I don't think I'm going to be able to go through it but as long as I'm not going to finish it might as well waste time Imam Shafi went to sleep over at imam ahmed so the mate put water after Isha in front of his room so that he can make wudu and pray night prayer at first time she met him a said this is Imam Shafi you talked about he is not worthy of your praise he didn't even pray night prayer what kind of a Adam what kind of a scholar is he he is mild he did not reply after they prayed for him a Muhammad was chit-chatting with mum Sharon said the mate says also about you she said she's right I didn't pray night prayer I spent the whole night from a shuttle seizure contemplating on the hadith of Ana's when the Prophet came to our house and I had this young brother called about Maya he's nicknamed about Maya he had a small bird nor so the Prophet is jokingly with him because the bird died and the four-year-old child was upset so the Prophet said I borrow my mother for Allen wave what did the young bird do he's joking with him he said I spent the whole night contemplating on these words and I got a number and yannis over 80 / 8-0 benefits out of it he collected from this so when we speak about the Hadees of the Prophet Ali salat wa salam this is not a simple thing to go through it's a serious topic why choose an edible mullet first of all because of the compiler who's the compiler our Imam and Buhari and whenever you hear an imam and Buhari you think of an authentic hadith even if you don't know Arabic if someone says Bihari you know the leader and the president of Nigeria is Buhari at the moment he's a general so when he says something everybody says next week I'll be in Nigeria so hope pray for me that I don't go into trouble they're good people masha'Allah now Imam Abu Hari is Mohamed eben is not Ibrahim Al Bukhari one of the great scholars of Allison l-jamaa the real actionable Jamaa those who follow the footsteps of the Prophet irresolution those who have sounded either who believe in the Quran as it is who believe in the Sunnah of the Prophet our assertion and follow it extensively not choosing pick these are the additional jamar he is the compiler of aljahmeir Asahi known to us as sahih al-bukhari his way of acquiring knowledge was phenomenal and he started acquiring knowledge he started to be a student of knowledge when he was how old 10 years of age when he was 11 he used to debate with his scholars and shoe correcting them them being angry because he is correcting them and when they check they come back to him and say we sorry you're right and they correct the mistakes from this 11 year old child when he was 16 he started to spread his wings and people from all over the world used to meet him and tell him in the thousand to sit and teach them the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he traveled all over the Muslim countries to gain he had a thousand and eighty teacher schewe from each share he learned more than 10,000 hadith authentic and week and he filtered them all to bring a society but sahih al-bukhari as you know is compiled according to chapters in Bedell washy in a salah zakah blue marriage eight transactions according to the fifty books one of the chapters is about a dead book but it is not related to our book because in that chapter of other which is all authentic unlike our book this book inaudible Mahad is not 100% authentic why because Albahari had a condition that in his size he would not report anything except with a particular condition that gives it the highest grade of authenticity 98 octane Supriya premium or ninety which is regular he had premium and so here in Alabama flat it was mixed and the condition was less and the bar was why because the people of a Bihari like today when we meet you say how much is the dollar per the ringgit you say four points so at that time everybody knew the is nad so when I tell you had s an a so and so that so and so said that someone so heard that Abu Hurairah report narrated that the prophet cetera so son they know that this hadith is authentic or not authentic not because they're scholars but knowledge was so spread that as long as you put the chain of narrators it's sufficient it's enough so the Bihari put this which has so much information about adept but not as authentic as the sahih al-bukhari itself okay then why compile it because the issue of adapt the thing that elevates your moral conduct your ethics has so many hadith that may not reach the premium level of hadith but it is authentic so that's why he bought us this hadith which of this book which is approximately three to four times bigger than the one in his cycle behind so that we could learn off and about so what does it speak about Adam is a general word that deals with your moral conduct how you behave how you think how you act in Islamic terminology in Arabic we say he has little a double meaning that he is impolite a little audible narvik this is an insult he is impolite and the word Adam has a general Arabic meaning that includes literature poetry writing of articles all is included in an other however the book that we have at hand which is not this one definitely this one Buhari initially did not call it an audible move read usually when I speak on stage I like to make the camera man's life difficult so I moved from one place to the other so I guarantee that he gets his money's worth yes life is difficult life is difficult I can afford this on the ship so coming back he called it use and adapt the those who came afterwards added the word and move read so that they can distinguish it from other things now usually when people come to a workshop they have deliverables I spent a lot of time thinking why are people coming to this workshop then what are they expecting to have I couldn't find an answer seriously seriously I could not find that why would you come here what would you expect to come out and say masha'Allah I know when to do so do the self before Salam and after Salam hamdullah I know how to perform with their prayer whether one three five seven or nine records with one setup or not there's a cat what are the deliverables that you will have to normal people not much seriously it's going to be refreshing a little bit fun maybe for me I'm going to enjoy it coming all the way from Saudi Arabia not paying anything getting first-class treatment I'll enjoy it staying away from my wife and kids this is a blessing by itself but for you what will you gain nothing unfortunately unless you come with an open heart and you come to learn the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you come to learn how to behave how to fix my inner self some of us has arranged problems some of us are selfish some of us cannot be honest some of us have has to deal with deception and cheating and double-talk in their work in their homes if you come here to fix all of this you will benefit in sha allah but if you come here just you know i don't have anything better to do you will benefit the reward but you'll not get the chance to purify your heart there is nothing this there won't be any crying and weeping also of course if your heart is to open there will be because whenever we are with the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam we remember the beautiful days our biggest and strongest and most profound calamity on earth is the death of our prophet alayhi salatu salam to the extent that he said whenever a calamity strikes you poverty you look you lose a house you lose a son you divorce you have problems whenever a calamity strikes you remember your loss in me and this would make your calamity go away so if you have a problem remember that I lost the opportunity to see and meet the Prophet Aristotle son and he's dead this is the biggest calamity that could ever strike a person so will we be able to benefit from this issue Allah will give it a try if it works and hamda life it doesn't work that's look you can do anything about it so let's begin inshallah with the first know with part one hadith not you who has the book Marcia a lot of other karma good so you can follow with me I don't know if they have notes that they can write down because it's going to be a little bit a lot of information 90 percent if not more is known to you but to have it collected and reminded with may might be a little bit really difficult so chapter number one we discover that an imam al bukhari in his book did not write any introduction so he started right away with the hadith of the Prophet Elisha sonim however this is a piece of information that is quite beneficial for you in sahih al-bukhari not our book in sahih al-bukhari you will find that imam al bukhari also did not write an introduction why because what to introduce when you come to the prophets saying Edessa Ladouceur so what did the Buhari do the scholars say that the knowledge of an imam al Buhari is displayed in the titles so his knowledge his fill what he learns he puts in the small statement the title then he puts the Hadees to show you that the hadeeth exactly is translated and interpreted to his title so likewise the Buhari had done this in the very beginning he said one verbal poley he Tejada were was sign an insanity why did a horse nah this is the beginning of an iron that a large the Virgil has said we have enjoined man to be kind to his parents okay what do understand of this you have to be kind to your parents okay understood we move to hadith number two no no no it's not gonna be that easy there is one hadith in this chapter you find it in English I don't think it is in Arabic is it no it's only in in English so Abdul I have in my throat one of the Companions of the Prophet a lot sooner see if I want to spend the whole day speaking about this hadith I can with the grace of allah georgian talking about abdullah very much fruit by itself is sufficient what do you know about Abdullah throat anyone because I can see people are sleeping we have a long day ahead of us so no time to sleep it is very possible that I will point at you and I say please stand up you say I paid money to stand up who cares the pavement I come from South Arabia don't care about money I will tell you stand up and ask you a question so that I guarantee you do not sleep during the process if you sleep I sleep so what do you know about have the levelness road you raise your hand the brother second row third you raise your hand or you do your head ah my charm what do you know about half the lemon sir with anyone of course he's a companion that's a good yes no it's the clothes the Prophet said learn the Quran from poor people ignore me apt Abdullah and miss route Salim Oda Haditha obey him the cab Zaidan is habit these are the four people whom the Prophet told us to learn the Quran one of them is abdullah abdullah al masud said I took 70-plus shuras of the Quran straight from the mouth of the Prophet also Salaam so only 40 left he took 70 plus so this man is knowledgeable first of all he said to the Prophet I asked him sallallahoalyhiwasallam which deeds Allah loves best so what do we learn from this one we learned that the Companions are so keen on asking what benefits them what gets them closer to Allah compare Apple to Apple what do you usually look up for what do you ask for I personally asked about the exotic cars price when it's secondhand I cannot afford to buy them brand-new this is my obsession ah from 0 to 100 my car is excellent from 0 to 100 half an hour very old very vintage very slow so people have obsessions of a brother has an obsession on motorbikes is it a Ducati or a Kawasaki a sister has obsession on the latest foundation is it waterproof is it breathable so obsessions the Companions obsession was not like this their obsession was what benefits me at the side of Allah what takes me to and therefore those who called me 810 times a week from Australia from Canada from America it costs money but they asked they asked straight questions share what's the ruling on this if I do this better or do that better I feel astonished because they want to get closer to Allah after live Mossad was like this so he comes to the Prophet he doesn't say prophet of Allah should I buy property in Putrajaya or in somewhere else no he wants what gets him closer to Allah so he says to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which deeds Allah loves best so the Prophet Allison lists a number of tasks one prayer to being dutiful to the parents and three jihad in the way of Allah and available wrote said if I asked the Prophet more he would have given me more so what do we benefit from this hadith first of all the keenness of the Companions to ask for what benefits them and this is found in most of the Sunnah of the Prophet Ali system you always find a Sahaba coming and asking the Prophet s-salam about things that are most beloved to Allah yet we find the answer varies why the scholars say because the Prophet answers a day his solo to Selim whenever you hear the name of the Prophet or for Salama otherwise you will be stingy at the sight of Allah anytime you hear the name of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam you offer Selim you gain ten good deeds Allah mentions you in the higher congregation and you get closer to Allah so the Prophet sallallaahu REO Selim gives and according to each one's individual one says o prophet o allah i will say knee give me advice he said do not become angry why because the prophet knows that this guy is has a rage problem the other one says o prophet of allah also advised me he said your tongue is continuously remembering allah the for third one asks and said help me by performing a lot of substitute meaning a lot of players offer a lot of prayers and so on so what is the most deal be to Allah telogen one to pray on time in another narration to pray at the beginning of the time we can go for a long time discussing this it's beneficial to know when to pray at the beginning of the time and when not to pray at the beginning of the time because some prayers delaying it is more preferred to a larger but if we can get engaged in this I promise you will not be able to finish not even one tenth of the course so let us focus on what is essential this is beneficial how many people in Malaysia pray on time I was shocked now people usually when they are asked straight forward questions they get defensive meaning you're not opening your heart when I say how many people in Malaysia pray on time defensive people say how many people in Saudi pray on time ok I'm the one who's preaching not you don't preach me I'm preaching you so don't be defensive even in Saudi Arabia they don't pray on time in Egypt in Syria in Morocco everywhere and this is why we are going downhill because the Prophet told is the most important day to Allah so that is your prayer and our prayer is down him this is why everything in the Muslim world is downhill until we revive the Sunnah I was shocked to find that people are too relaxed when it comes to prayer I am a traveler there is no Masjid I can pray anywhere and I shorten the prayer from 4 to 2 but what about the locals when they pick me from one place to the other we pass by message no one says let's stop and pray and maybe they delay the prayers and I see Muslims there mashallah their offices are open their shops are open the music is open where is Islam I don't know so if we can benefit from this that we put as our objective to pray on time in congregation in the Masjid then we have gained 70 percent of the course if we can get this if we fail to pray on time in the Masjid what are you doing having fun let's continue the problem is that the more you have knowledge of Allah the keen you are to pray on time the less knowledge of a large beautiful names and attributes the careless you are this is a well-known fact now the importance of Salah is a lot we will not go into it except that you have to know in the beginning it was how many 55 0 and then Allah reduces into 5 imagine that if we have to pray every half an hour that would be great for our course because we would have a break every 25 minutes but will anybody be able to do it a lot of the most generous made it 5 and even the five we have 40% discount budget we don't pray on time also we are at work this is how people are unfortunately those who do not pray at all are not Muslims if you do not pray at all not a single Salah you are a kafir even if you say like a long handle solo 1000 times a day and perform Hajj in fact someone will give zakat if you do not pray at all you are a kaffir this is the prophets fatwa not mine and a sorcerer if you pray on and off you're a hypocrite you are a hypocrite because Allah described in the Quran in Chapter nine surah tauba those who are lazy to pray but they pray they are hypocrites so it's a serious stuff number two now where is number two and after that he said no yeah I was following that's nice time said dutifulness to parents what is the meaning of dutifulness in arabic is called bill bill rule valid aim now the word to be dutiful is a very very large word with lots of meanings the majority of the people in malaysia alhamdulillah and in Southeast Asia have this instilled in them the respect the obedience the kindness the majority not all there are always black sheep in the family so allah azza wajal has ordered us to be dutiful to our parents even if they are Kathir so regardless of the religion of the parent you must be dutiful to them now what is the sense of being dutiful first of all how important it is allah azzawajal has combined in a number of ayahs in the karana between toe heat and being dutiful to your parents a book and taboo ilda yahu what Israeli Danish and Allah has ruled that you must not worship anyone other than him and to be dutiful and kind to your parents how strong would you want a lot command to be more than this to associate it with toe heat which is the essence of Islam which is the sole purpose of our existence is to worship Allah after that to be dutiful to your parents now Muslim families pride on having their parents and grandparents living in their homes they fight for it I know families I know siblings brothers fighting over their mother where to stay each one says I'm worthy of herb staying with me to the extent that there was a case in court in Riyadh where two brothers over seventy years of age both went to the judge and complained that their mother should be with him they're fighting to have their parents with them and the people when it comes to being dutiful to your parents are three types one is the person who goes out of his way to be kind loving and obedient he does more than what they expect of him and he never says anything bad to them so this guy is the one who's beautiful now who is the one who's not beautiful the one who is not beautiful and the scholars say is the one who does his obligations to his parents and he does not harm them this is the interpretation of what people are asleep of being not beautiful did you hear me well a person who does his obligations I give my mother and father shelter I give them pocket money I put food on their table I never insult them I never speak rude to them I never but this is it obligations and staying away from Haram they say he is not beautiful the third type is the one who does not do his obligations and he's insulted he's abusive he raises his voice he looks at them straight in the eye when speaking to them you know that this is a sin when your father or mother are speaking to you and you look them straight in the eye so your father tells you why did you come late yesterday and you look at him said I'm a grown-up man I can come whatever I want this is sinful you will go to hell because of this so now most of us are from category number two we do our obligations and we don't do any sense yet we are sinful for that what Allah tells you to do is to be X beautiful extra respectful more than what they expect from you then you will be fulfilling a lot command to you a man came to have the live normal shivering shaking out of fear complaining to him and he said Oh companion of Allah of the Prophet a son I did so many sins and he thinks that these sins are major sins so even aa man asked him are your parents alive he said I only have my mother and she's with me even Hamas said are you afraid of fire do you love to enter paradise by Allah if you speak to your mother softly and feed her food by Allah you will enter paradise as long as you refrain from medicines this is how the Companions used to treat their parents this is how they used to consider obeying the parents coming to hand a questions at the end of the session right any questions quickly okay Angela people are sleep second a date number three hadith number three was mentioned in Chapter number two dutifulness to one's mother so why is this not considered to be segregation why the West is not considering us to be feminist when it comes here they say that we segregate between men and women and men are better than women look at this hadith and you will learn that this is not true the authority of mafia even Hyden was his name in Arabic I don't know Molly Haider me a lot of peace with him the Prophet said that he asked his prophet or or prophet of Allah who should whom should I be dutiful most he said your mother then your mother then your mother then your father then the next nearest relative and then the next nearest so this hadith talks about the issue of being kind to your mother more than anyone else why why does Islam encourage us to be more tolerant more kind to the mother than the father first of all by the experience who do you fear most father or the mother father no one thinks twice you fear your father more than your mother that's why you always take the shortcut mother I need this I need that why ask me ask your father no no no no I cannot ask him you ask him so you keep on insisting on your mother more than your father my wife when it comes to waking up the girls for Fajr prayer she spends 14 minutes waking them up and she comes with years on her shoulders coming I'm tired I cannot do this can you help yes sure hey wake up immediately they wake up I don't know why I don't have a stick in my hand but this is something that Allah has put in the father the mother can don't do this don't do this don't do this awesome they're not listening to me said bent meaning girl and class stops that's it I never beat them I never shouted them but this is sufficient this is from Allah not because I'm a sheikh I know all of you have experienced this this is why it is extremely important threefold than the father to be dutiful to your mother why the mother is weak the mother is vulnerable the mother can be insulted by the Sun or by the daughter well the father wouldn't be the mother had more has more rights over you than your father why it's the father who buys me the car is the father that provides for me the shelter the food the clothes the school what does my mother do the mother does everything she's the one who carried you in her womb for nine months and if you see the agony and the pain of Labor as men who cannot do this then can you be with your wife in labor time no I cannot I sit in crying next to her this is not I cannot do this yes I can go to the gym and I can workout for two hours without them I cannot have the pain she's having and after that sleepless nights for at least a year when the child is suffering stomach ache breastfeeding not sleeping on time I usually keep my wife out to live next door and the SEC I want to I have work I have to sleep she has no problem so all of this and you go on from year one or two and till you are a grown up man and she cares for you whenever you're sick whenever you're hungry whenever your clothes need ironing whenever you have a problem you don't go to your father as a father I met this girl and I loved her he was Mac you in the eye you'll go to your mom is it hot how old is she where does she come from she's affectionate she has a lot of feelings for you she loves your success and she loves you when you fail your father loves you only when you succeed when you're when you fail you're not my son you're somebody else but now when you are doing well he loves you your mother loves you no matter what happens even if you're a drug addict even if you go to prison even if you are the Imam of a harem she loves you and you're always her child until you get married then you're someone else child this is why she's jealous from her sister from her daughter-in-law and problems come this is not our problem anymore let's not go into that so being beautiful to your mother is extremely important in Islam in the book albahari Allah double Moffet there is a hadith beautiful Hadees it's not with us today when even Omar may Allah be pleased with him was in hedge and this year a Yemeni man from Yemen has his crippled mother on his shoulders so she's like 40 kgs nothing much but imagine carrying her all the way and putting her on your shoulder and he's doing Tawaf and while doing Tawaf he says in poetry in nila hibari you Hal was elderly into the ar-raqqah boo ha damn boo sorry he's boosting saying that I am my-mult my mother's humble camel if all the rides around are scared I am never scared and I'm always carrying her a with bravery and then he looked at dibban Omar doing tawaf with your mom on your back I know people ashamed from holding their mother's hands in the market getting her out of the car and getting her into the car helping her when they're 70 or 80 years of Eila shamed this is not befitting why doesn't the maid come why doesn't my sister comes well so he says to even Homer or even Homer do you think I have repaid my mother doing Hajj carrying her this is something who can tolerate this it when Homer said by Allah you have not even repaid one construction of her labor even one pain of her labor just a single one this is not sufficient now compare apples to apple when was the last time you kissed your mother's feet when was the last time you brought joy into your mother's heart being beautiful compared how you treat your wife and how you treat your mother I will not go into rights because this would require probably a different workshop and it will make people angry however this is any important for you to think the wife has to think how does she treat her mother and her husband although her husband comes as a priority this doesn't mean that you cannot be kind call her every day six seven times I know people who live in the same city see their mother only twice a week for half an hour from my relatives they come to see their mother for one hour a week they live maybe half an hour apart what kind of a son is this if you don't stick to your mother's feet even if she is a kafir even if she is not a Muslim this is the time to show her the beauty of Islam by being a real Muslim see talk is cheap I can talk forever but you judge me according to my actions I judge you according to your actions not on how many hadith you know by heart or what you do or what you do not do now if we look at how the people of the Salaf used to deal with their mother you'll be shocked I'll give you a few examples Robles debater is the nephew of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her you know Aisha the mother of the believers he said if your parents anger you never ever look at them straight in the eye with anger how many times have your children looked at you in anger it's like a stab in the heart sometimes we do it and we do not realize it your father your mother says I remarked you don't like what do you do you give them this look that they wish they had not brought you into this world because of that your mother says your wife did not call me for a whole week and you look at her like this you're not a dutiful son you're a bad son he says Muhammad have been sitting may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great Tiberian whenever he was at the court of his mother he used to lower his voice to the extent that people thought he was sick just because he was in the presence of his mother look at the respect they had when you are at your mother's side what do you do you laugh you joke you raise your voice until your mom says lower it down a little bit this is not the way of the self he used to lower his voice until people thought he was sick one of the Salaf his mother calls him from the end of the hall over the house and he said yes mom so that she can hear him and he thinks what have I done I raise my voice he frees two slaves he thinks that he had done a sin he feeds two slaves for the sake of Allah to compensate for his sin a lot of the Salaf and this is narrated by a number of scholars they used to refuse to eat with their mother from the same dish why he says I'm afraid that my mother would have looked at something she liked and my hand was quicker now if you sit with your mom with a dish of fruit in front of you before even she looks masha'Allah tabarak Allah he cleaned the plate white and his mother even did not reach out no the seller would not do this they would always give preference to the mother let her eat after she's finished and satisfied you may try to eat as well a man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam wanting to perform jihad so the Prophet asked him is your mother there he says yes she's alive to stay with her he asked him twice he asked him three times and then the Prophet told him stick next to her feet because paradise is there now compared this hadith to the many youngsters who come and say we want to go to Syria for jihad we want to go to Iraq for jihad we want to go to Afghanistan we want to go to this and that for jihad masha'Allah good what did the Prophet say is a stick close to your mother's feet share this is difficult for ma to stay next to my mother's feet and obey her this is difficult I'd rather have a bullet this is strange people do not understand Islam as it's supposed to be there are priorities follow the priorities you enter Jannah follow your own priorities I don't guarantee that you will enter anywhere you want now one would say my mother is evil [Music] there are evil mothers yes are there are there evil mothers a stuff yes there are this is a fact of life however this is your test I get so many phone calls from sisters crying from brothers complaining of how evil their mothers are and their right but this is their test from Allah if your mother was kind love and compassionate and willing to do anything for you where is the test of being dutiful you have to be respectful and beautiful the test is when it's the opposite so we have a lot of mothers complaining about their sons treatment to their wives especially in what is known as the joint family this is found in India Bangladesh Pakistan etc where wherever you get married you get your wife as a new servant in the house she cooks and cleans and acts like a maid not only your parents but your siblings and to their wives and husbands and you do not expect anything more from her this is Haram this is totally prohibited you have to give a separate home to your wife if you feel a large this is her god-given right she's okay what about the rights of my mother and father be careful these rights do not mix give your father and mother their rights but give your wife that right as well so give her her separate home and be dutiful obedient providing for your mother and father even if you have to spend ten hours with them no problem but your wife has to have her rights one says and I get hundreds of questions like this my father or my mother orders me to divorce my wife what should I do I say you must not go her he says but I have to be dutiful to her being dutiful to your mother does not mean you divorce your wife this is not fair this is injustice one claims okay there's a hadith where Roma ordered his son to divorce his wife and the Prophet say said to her marked soul asylum obey your father so what to do one of the blade imams was asked the same question a man came to him he said my father orders me to divorce my wife and ahmad did this with a son and the Prophet ordered him to obey his father what should I do the Imam said when your father is as great as Omer obey him Roman it's fair number at the second caliph he would not do anything so if your wife is obedient muslimah practicing kind what your mother doesn't like her guts at all she doesn't like her then your mother is transgressing and unfair you cannot obey her in such an issue but if your wife is disobedient rude abusive not kind not a good wife picture hey what are you keeping her for you're still young marry someone else see it is demand and supply don't laugh I know you will hate me for this any time I write on Twitter people attack me like this they don't understand they don't have knowledge it is demand and supply there are so many women out there you can get married to and if you get married to a woman's best strategy is to be a slave in the house there is a woman power not here if you manage to be submissive and treating your husband with humility and weakness is like a ring in your finger but if he marries another man in the shape of a woman he says do this why don't you do that okay can you do this no you do that and she is another man in his house this is not a healthy marriage yes he is obliged to be kind to her to love her to shelter her to provide for her but at the same time she is also obliged to be feminine to be a woman to be fragile if they manage to have this chemistry you have as long successful marriage insha allah azza wajal now being dutiful to your mother doesn't at all mean by the way when I open my mobile I'm not checking my what's up actually this is a lie I am checking my what's up but I'm not checking what's up for personal messages I'm getting snapshots of the book so that I can know the title of the hadith in Arabic which I did not record in my notes that's why I don't think that I'm answering messages so we come to a very important issue being dutiful your mother has to be within the parameters of Islam why do we say that share because a lot of us think that being dutiful to your mother is to buy her a bottle of perfume on Mother's Day when is Mother's Day absent that's the quest the answer every day is a Mother's Day to us Muslims the non-muslims have one day a year and they bring her flowers and they throw it and they leave us Muslims we think of our mother every single day we visit we bring food and vegetables and fruits and whatever she likes we go and massage her foot we asked her do you want to go for Umbra we asked her what do you like to have we do our level best to be kind to our mother this is how a Muslim should be we move on to hadith number number one number four it's in the same chapter is it not where's the moderator it's not a same chapter huh fight and I thought bad for the along one whom a man came I will read from the Arabic because I hate eating English so you follow the English I'll do the instant translation in my head I never read English by the way it's all in Arabic so he said I proposed to a woman and she refused or rejected me and then another man came and proposed to her and she agreed to him I felt jealous so I killed her do I have any repentance so even as I said is your mother alive he said no he said to him then repent to Allah do as much as you can to get closer to Allah Allah the Tiberi went to even Abbas I said why did you ask him about his mother's life whether she's alive or dead he said I know no good deed that would get a person closer to Allah than being dutiful to the mother now this hadith is very strange when you read this hadith what is the first thing that comes into mind my mind this man does he love this woman yes raise your hands now this strange how thin the hairline between hatred and love is and this is an explanation an example to what goes into a man's heart if you loved her so much you would love the very best for her but when you do not love you want to possess only then this hatred can come a lot of our Muslim marriages are like this they're built on possession not love so I want you to be my property you belong to me you're my possession I do not want to share you with anyone else this is not love if something happens you find hatred surfacing and this is why he had no problem in killing her and what actually resulted or caused the killing is Envy and this is one of the greatest sins on earth angry I want you to be deprived of what you have either if I have it or not no problem so if I see you driving a fast car I'm happy for you and I say inshallah I will one day have a similar car if I'm envious I would say well I don't deserve this car may Allah bring you a big crush and it is all into ruin all the villa yeah at least say may Allah bless it to him soon no no no he doesn't deserve it if I see a brother marrying a righteous practicing and beautiful wife I said may Allah divorce them why yeah he's not deserving of it it's not your business I'm not giving it no no still he should not have this the first thing the scholars say ever committed in this universe was due to envy when Allah ordered satan iblees straight on to prostrate to Adam he became envious why prostate I am better I was created from fire and he was created from clay he became envious and resulted in him being cursed until the day of judgment accordingly now why would you become envious why would the person become envious why would you look at some someone's possessions and want to want it to live this is a result of one of the highest and greatest characteristic that a Muslim could have if you don't have this characteristic you become envious what is that content a river if you're content with what Allah has given you you will never be envious to anyone and you will be the happiest person on earth so if a sister is content with her husband even if he's a gorilla she is the happiest woman on earth people come to her his mouth smells like rotten eggs he showers once every three weeks his teeth are crooked he's this short long tall thin fat ugly black white and she says masha'Allah I love him he's the love of my life this content makes her the happiest person on earth if you don't have this content you are the most depressed person on earth you can find someone who is sweeping the floor a janitor and despite is this big yes why are you happy Angela I'm healthy I have a family I have a salary I have a job yes but you don't have a car you don't have a motorcycle you walk so I'm good now I'm healthy and you look at the multi millionaires who have food cars who have everything are they happy no you find a billionaire sad why are you sad you have three air jets airplanes of your own today but my friend bought a new 777 extended version with a saloon and a bedroom and I don't have this subhanAllah so content is the greatest blessing of Allah the Virgin and finally this shows you how great trusting a large the Virgin and being dutiful to your mother what is this unless we finish the course a beautiful nest to your mother so even a bass had it fixed this is common knowledge for all companions being dutiful to your mother is one of the grace this deeds that Allah he raises your sins you don't have to go for a more you don't have it's good if you go especially when they don't have to pay much money for that I think they've uplifted the features I was told that something that so you can go for free now it's not from me from the government you don't have to do a lot of things just be soft speaking to your mother be kind bring her a gift do things that she loves and a large division would love you accordingly okay so we go on to chapter why this is confusing chapter 7 right Hadees number 15 okay ammo Butler is there a spelling mistake is it Abubakar or Abubakar or are they the same person hello where's the microphone it's the same person no it's a different person this man's name Abu baraa a toughy and if you read the seal of the Prophet eyes on the 8th year of hijra when the Prophet diffused 5in after the battle of hunayn he beseeched tired for maybe 18 days and it was a fortress the Prophet could not and his army penetrated so the Companions called to the slaves of Taif whoever comes to us Muslim history so one of them was this man he came down through a rail rail in Arabic is bakla will you put the rope when you know the rail when he put a rope and to bring water from the well so he tied himself to one and came down so that was why he was nicknamed as Abu Bakr so Abu Bakr said that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was sitting with us one day and then he asked us he said shall I tell you which is the worst of the major sins and then he repeated it again and then he repeated it for the third time and this was the habit of the Prophet eras of son that he used to repeat some of his speeches three times so that people can be first of all alert secondly to memorize it so so many times I say a word and 95% of the people do not listen or pay attention to it it happens especially in an eight-hour course if I repeat it again you'll be awakened if I repeat it for the third time it sticks but then we would need like six years to finish the course therefore we will just move on insha Allah so he repeated this he is informing them about the most major sins because he wanted to captivate their attention so that they would pay attention to it so the first they said definitely Oh prophet of Allah teaches so he said first of all associating others with Allah in Arabic  so shirk is V as they call it in English the cardinal sin we don't have Cardinals but is the most major sin that Allah does not forgive at all whoever dies in the state of shirk is bound to Hellfire for eternity not a thousand years Amalie forever so this is pretty serious then the Prophet said as Salam and disobeying parents the word is not the correct translation the correct translation for the word in Arabic is Allah al aliy Dame and O is far greater than disobey it's also disrespecting it's also being not dutiful to your parents so again this is one of the major sins and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was sitting leaning on his side inclined this is usually when you sit on the floor you get a couch or a pillow and you leaning on it to rest your back he was sitting like this then he stood up straight and he said false testimony meaning I think the translation and the book is different right life this is not what is meant here in the hadith it is false testimony lies is general I can lie to a friend I can lie to a judge I can lie to a wife this is general lying false testimony this can only be in front of a judge and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam kept on repeating it so one would ask and argue why would he do that before we get into this first of all the hadith teaches us tells us that there are major sins and there are minor sins what is the difference major sins as the scholars define it any sin that Allah has cursed the one who does it or said that he would be tormented in hell fire or that he would be exited from Allah's mercy or that there is a prescribed punishment for it in this world this is generally speaking the most authentic definition of kabir major sin what is the major sin so any sin that you find that allah cursed or will put into hell or is kicked out of Allah's mercy or there's a prescribed punishment such as killing stealing drinking intoxicants laundering fornicating all of these have prescribed punishment in this life then you know that this is a major sin now we can spend the rest of the day talking about associating others with Allah but this is not is not our topic yet maybe maybe we should just highlight some of the things that people do not know as silk for example frustrating to Buddha is shirk of course no problem this is crystal-clear slaughtering to the graves of auliah and pious people  calling the dead Oh has an auto saying ot Johnny Geelani but that we Knox Effendi anything calling them please help me granting me this protect me from this this is also shirk even going to soothsayers you go to someone asking about something of the future well Allah the priest told me that next week there'll be riots don't go to this route ah and you believe him yes you know the future this is shake Co for takes you out of religion out of Islam completely and so many other things that are involved so now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as for not being dutiful respectful obedient to your parent set a very scary hadith 15 minutes for what we're just warming up [Music] subhanAllah I think we should cancel this workshop we will not be able to finish anything by this paste the Prophet said a little Ostrom the Jenna paradise will not be entered by one element man who's the man man the one who does you a favor and then keeps on reminding you it is I give you ten think it's six years ago yeah you gave it to me huh last word 60s depreciation and the oil prices are falling ha ha it keeps on reminding I did you a favor I gave you my car I lent you my house I helped you in your wedding this will not enter Jenna the Prophet says ah but a person who is not beautiful not obedient not respectful to his parents he will not enter Jannah and a drunkard someone who is addicted to drinking alcohol intoxication he will not enter Jannah and one would ask ok how would I not be dutiful respectful obedient Allah mentioned in the Quran that even the slightest gesture of disapproval of discontent is considered to be a poop so Allah says in the Quran what is the gesture Oh what is this oh nothing so my father says there are groceries in the trunk of the car bring them up head ok Allah says this is being disrespectful and not dutiful just the gesture it is haram it is a major sin to say this to your parents and if this is prohibited what about if someone shouts at his parents what about someone who curses his parents who raises his voice and abuse his parents I've seen this with my own eyes heard it with my own ears people being abusive to their parents a man came to me once in the Masjid crying when he was in his mid-50s mid-50s he said I have the worst mother on earth he's Egyptian and my father died leaving us a very beautiful reputation my mother goes from house to house spoiling his reputation trying to cause enmity between people people come to me and complain your father was a good man why is your mother causing us problems I keep on advising her trying to be dutiful to her one day it went out of hand and I slam I slapped her on the face my mother is uh is in her mid 80s and he comes to me in the Masjid after Isha crying like a baby his mid-50s saying what what can I do how can I repent what do you answer such a person to us his mother needs to be in front of a firing squad she's evil pure evil but you as a son has no right to do anything of this it's your test and exam from Allah you must be obedient tolerant respectful give her kind advice and pray to Allah so that you may not do anything else let alone abusing her or slapping her on the face a lot of the people would justify being undutiful to their parents because their parents were unbeautiful to them so I say why would I obey my father if he prefers my brother over me if he doesn't provide for me shelter I get sisters calling me saying that our father left the house when we were children infants I don't remember anything of him or him sending us money or him taking care of us or calling us or seeing us and after 20 years he contacted us and wants us to become like father and daughter she says I cannot meet him I don't want to see him I'd like to spit in his face is this hell odd I don't know anything about him I said no this is Haram he's your father he's your biological father he is your father by birth in Islam and you must be dutiful to him his sins Allah would hold him accountable for but remember if you don't do your duty Allah will hold you accountable for that as well and at the end of the day its duties and obligations rights and obligations as they say the Prophet said on a histological Salam a large pleasure a large pleasure is in the pleasure of the parents if you want a lot to be pleased with you please your parents so whenever you do something don't do it because you love them we all love our parents do it because it would get you closer to Allah the Almighty and the third thing is of course the false testimony and this by itself I have prepared so many points but I don't think that it would be feasible to go through them however it is extremely important it's one of the major sins in Islam to testify falsely I don't know if it happens here in the countries where Sharia is implemented it's sufficient to bring two witnesses to win a court case so if you don't have religion if you don't have Eman you can buy two and they can testify and this is what makes it scary because repenting would not suffice you have to rectify and correct the damage you have done so me and him have a dispute on this water bottle and you can imagine if this is a 1 million meter property or an island or a hundred million reals or ring it the words of money and we have a dispute so in Islam the way to if you come to a judge and you have a dispute on this property how would I judge very simple straightforward you have to provide the one who claims this is mine share said okay give me the evidence what evidence do you want a written document stating that he took it from you I don't have any documents then bring me two witnesses Muslims to testify that he took it from you I don't have any witnesses share in this case the share goes to the other defendant and say this man claims you took this from him is it true no share is not true this man failed to bring me evidence therefore you must testify by Allah that it is not his and you did not take it from him can you swear by Allah he said yes I swear by Allah if he swears why are not the judge says it's yours I cry it's mine prove it if you can't prove it then anyone claim is as good as mine and this man swore by a light his class it is his so the evidence is important having two witnesses if you go to a court of law and you bring these two witnesses and they testify by Allah that this belongs to him o to him or to him the judge judges according to evidences and facts I don't know what's in the heart so he gives it to you this is why it makes it one of the major sins in Islam because you are abusing Allah's name you swear lying do you think that Allah will leave you go and enjoy the money to bribe the thing that you have gained out of it no a lot if Allah takes the blessing out of anything you have you are doomed imagine I do this sometimes don't think I'm crazy I might be just to appreciate Alma's blessing on me I go into the toilet to answer the call of nature with the lights off and believe me it's a mess but I come out appreciating that Allah has given me sight when you have an injury in your knee and you cannot pray except on a chair how do you appreciate it when you have a stomach ache that doesn't hold any food in your stomach you cannot drink water you throw up you cannot eat anything and you are in pain and agony for a day only after you get well how do you feel do you remember everything we have and do is due to the blessing of Allah if Allah takes this blessing away from you your life is over you are doomed and this is why whenever you do something think of the consequences yes I can like I can testify falsely I will gain money I will gain reputation I will get a better position in my career but what all of this would avail me if Allah has taken the blessing and favor out of it it will become a menace it will become an illness and it will become something that allah azza wajal does not approve of so part of that false testimony is what a lot of us do not in court a lot of the people come to me say share what do you think of brother so-and-so he has proposed to my daughter he has to propose to my sister now whatever I say will impact the life of the sister they trust me so I said Oh Masha Allah this man is one of Allah's greatest awliya he is a scholar he is practicing he is righteous he is like a medicine you put on a wound and it recovers masha'Allah and I know that he's drunkard his fornicator he doesn't pray and he has a cross under his shirt why are you doing this either my friend yes yes I cannot see bad things about him subhanAllah this is false testimony your boss comes to you and asks you about a colleague what do you think of brother Ahmed oh brother Ahmed comes on time leaves on time does all of his work beautifully and you know that this is not true because you want him to get a raise or the opposite he bubala he is like a small snake going around the colleagues and biting them he's bad he lies he's corrupt he doesn't have this why because you want the race to come to you not to him all of this is false testimony and you can cascade this all over your life and that is why part of the adapter that you do not tell a lie that you do not testify accept of what you had seen so many things we get on our what's up this is what I call stupid phones not smart phones these make use more stupid what's up is the menace of society I get little people I usually ignore anything that comes to me except from my groups certain groups and I have so many things coming to me the Prophet said Alice a lot so I'm so and so on so spread it and Allah will give you reward it's a lie hadith lies fabrications and you have rumors people circulating things the government did this and that the opposition did this and that imam of the masjid did this and that share so-and-so did this and so lies have you witnessed it yourself have you if you did not witness it Allah will hold you questionable on the day of judgment Allah says in the Quran and they made the angels of Allah females the idol worshippers they call the angels to be females and the angels are gender less they don't have they don't we don't call them males or females they are without gender so Allah is blaming and condemning people either worshippers who made the angels to be famous females Allah says afterwards and shall he do hunka who had they witnessed the creation of the angels in order for them to say whether they're females or males Allah says afterwards say took taboo Shahada to whom were you alone their testimony will be registered and they will be questioned whatever you get on what's up or on your emails or on your Facebook and you forwarded it without testifying without witnessing it Allah who told you questionable imagine just yesterday how many messages have you forwarded tomorrow I don't know it came from this brother or from this sister they're responsible no you forwarded it you are responsible for it so Allah we have like 15 minutes 7 I'll be generous 15 minutes - Allah and we meet up [Music]"
