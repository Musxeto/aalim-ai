  "transcript": "and we have uh Abu house from Bangladesh my question is uh I had woken up and realized that I was in state of Geneva and uh hence I took the acceptable quickly since the time for Jamara absala was closed after getting out and like uh towel drying myself and wearing the clothes uh I was in doubt whether I missed rinsing my mouth and nose or not uh then and there I rushed to the Basin and rinsed my mouth and nose and it was after I wore uh the clothes uh is Microsoft okay I would answer inshallah well house says he performed Russell and after performing Russell after he dried his body he remembered or actually he doubted that he may not have turned the water in his mouth and uh rinsed his nostrils so after wearing his clothes he did that so is it valid or not it's an issue of dispute first of all according to the hanafi that is according to the hambelly school of thought we humbery we believe that there shouldn't be any simultaneous list I don't know what's a noun simultaneously done or simultaneousness I hope it's right now um between the acts of Russell unlike wudu has six pillars washing the face washing the arms washing wiping the head washing the feet it has to be in sequence and sixthly it has to be simultaneous school of thought say no you can do that in half an hour complete the rest of your body you can wash the upper body and half an hour an hour complete the other half which is not authentic not true however some Scholars say if the time is so close meaning a woman washed her entire body in Russian and after she finished she noticed that there are nail polish remaining so she spent time removing it after her body was dried and then she went on the time is very close so it counts as valid and the most important thing is there is a rule that the scholars have which is the doubts that arise after the form of worship is over are to be ignored I went to mecca for umrah I did seven rounds I finished my seventh round while I was going to pray the two rakas of tawaf I finished my tawaf I get these thoughts that did I do six or seven should I go and add another round the answer is no because my form of worship the tawaf was done so any doubt that comes I have to ignore but if the doubt was in the same form of worship while I was in the third or the fourth or the seventh round and then I got this doubt in this case I have to add one to be safe rather than sorry so for your case what you have done was enough insha Allah"
