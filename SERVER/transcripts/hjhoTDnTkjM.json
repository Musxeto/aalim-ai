  "transcript": "there was a photo from you that everyone who cannot like because of the school that the school there is no jalasco but only haram school that the ones are obliged to migrate but what about the dice will make great role work are they exempted from this law or or are they also obliged to leave even though they make good work in their country first of all i do not give fatwas i give a an opinion and a fatwa has to be from a real scholar of islam someone who is acknowledged by other scholars and who has vast experience and i do not give a fatwa per se rather i convey to you what the scholars have said and i make it in simple english and i try to teach people the origin of this fatwa and how to adopt it and how to understand it now when it comes to schools in the west your most valuable asset are your children of course after your religion after your own chastity blah blah blah but your children are your capital this is what most of us live to bring up and preserve their legacy through allah says in the quran quran protect yourselves and your families from hellfire so by taking your children to such mixed schools where they're stripped of every thing that islam teaches them in regards of free mixing in regards of aura in regards of um evolution theory in regards of the existence of allah azzawajal in regards of accepting immorality such lgbt and and the likes if you do that you would deliver your children by ups to hellfire you're doing that why because allah ordered you to protect him and you're not doing so so whether you do homeschooling whether you migrate whatever you do you have to draw the line when are you going to draw the line and say no this is haram sheikh they forced my daughter to take off her hijab in order to study oh it's okay it's okay they enforce my daughter to learn evolution and that there are doubts in the existence of allah it's okay so because of the degree it's a necessity they order my daughter to wear swimsuits and swim with other teenagers what else pole dancing give me a break what is your religion where's your jealousy where is anything that's related to islam so whatever you do this is up to you i'm just giving you the perspective in the light of the quran and sunnah of what's happening now for dies it is the same concept do you think that i would choose to be a candle giving light to humanity while burning myself what's the end result i'm gonna be burnt but people would have enjoyed temporary light with all due respect to hell with everybody else i want to save my neck i'm not willing to give people da'wah and call them to islam and at the same time perish myself and destroy my own children this is not tawa i have to take first care of myself and my closest to me then yes i would love to give sacrifices of other things but not my own children not my own family the problem is our priorities are mixed i know guys who would say i am devoting myself for dawah like people here going for tafir circles and raising the youth that's good they go to medina they go to abha they go to thai for the kids to upbring them on an islamic way memorizing the quran that's good what about your kids allah will take care of them what is this is this the way of the prophet isalam no this is following your whims and desires not following sharia so i hope this answers your question"
