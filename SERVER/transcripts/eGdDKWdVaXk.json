  "transcript": "mustafa says what's the ruling on the business of opening wedding or function holes people may have music free mixing and even non-muslim weddings and functions well you've answered yourself and it's similar to the previous question are you facilitating sin or not the vast majority of people out there in non-muslim countries would hire your whole to have haram activities and events now it is prohibited for you to collaborate with them and to facilitate such things for them if you were in a muslim country let's say egypt for example and someone comes and says i'd like to hire your whole and you are up front with them you see there's no music there's no free mixing he says no there's no music no free mixing and you lease it or rent it to them this is halal even if they do haram against their agreement with you your rent is halal because you made that clear in non-muslim countries where 99.99 of events are all haram even when the muslims are there there is free mixing and music it is totally prohibited to engage in such business and allah knows best"
