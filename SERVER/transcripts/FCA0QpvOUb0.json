  "transcript": "and which is if I see someone whether a  or any other person doing a sin or doing a mistake is it an obligation upon me to correct him okay let me answer you ask you this if you just came out of the bank and you cashed your paycheck and it's the beginning of the new month you have to pay the rent you have to buy groceries you have to pay your installments or the car etc and as you left the bank you dropped unintentionally your wallet how would you feel if people looked at you and did not bring that to your attention and let you go and and leave and someone else took your wallet how would you feel wouldn't you feel angered of them why didn't they tell me why didn't they bring this to my attention the same thing goes when I do a mistake or I do a sin or I prostrate on my full arms which the Prophet as Salam said that this is the way that a dog prostrates and it's Haram and you see someone do this and you say I'm hesitant to tell him you know that you're not gonna you're not gonna see him after this prayer he's gonna leave you don't know him he's no one - you wouldn't be wouldn't it be a little bit more friendly to say ok I love you for the sake of Allah you're my brother you're a Muslim the Prophet prohibited us from praying like this if you saw someone doing another mistake you correct him you advise him in a very gentle way wouldn't this be a lot of reward for you on your scale of good deeds on the day of judgement definitely it would but wouldn't be a sin if you keep on neglecting enforcing virtue and preventing vice it definitely is this is the virtue of our Ummah that we tell people we advise them we try our level best to bring good into their life and to save them from Hellfire"
