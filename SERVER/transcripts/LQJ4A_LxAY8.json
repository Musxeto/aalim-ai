  "transcript": "when I first was asked to talk about spirituality in Islam it didn't go well down my throat because I usually research the terminology in the Quran and the Sunnah and in the books of salaf and this is one of the blessings of Allah that came to us from the kufar and we wish that inshallah the Muslims will soon be able to give such blessings to humanity they've invented this wonderful machine called the computer where you can in seconds research thousands literally thousands of Islamic books and I have in my laptop about 4,000 volumes stored in my laptop I can get anything whenever I want with the grace of Allah so when I research for for this word spirituality it wasn't there and the prophet didn't say itat wasam so I was stuck between a rock and a hard place either I say this lecture yeah is is is we should look for some other title or try with the grace of Allah to find out something that would make it worthwhile going through this subject so if we go to the word spirituality it stems from Spirit and spirit is a likewise in Arabic it's called the it comes from from the root of R of the spirit and the spirit is from Allah Asel the soul the spirit it's all from Allah subhana wa tala and no one knows what this spirit is but usually when you read of course if we want to drink we have to drink using the right hand not the left hand so this is beside the point usually when you look into religions into some Islamic sects you find a great focus on spirituality and a lot of those who Embrace Buddhism or Hinduism or whatever they they say that it has spirituality in it so what is spirituality and do we have spirituality in Islam the way I see it and Allah Knows Best that an individual is made of a spirit and a body and the things that pleases your spirit are different to the things that pleases your body so if you follow the things that elevat your spirit you me you may reach the level or close to the level of the Angels who do not sin and who follow and comply to Allah's instructions there is a Hadith in Muslim which illustrates this Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him met once one of the companions named and we have two one known as and one this one's story you all know it don't you some say we don't some say we do so those who do tell those who do not was a companion of the Prophet Alat wasam and he was a newlywed he just got married last night and in the morning just before fer prayer there was a call for Jihad for fight someone was attacking Medina so there was deployment of the troops to defend Medina so he went without performing obligatory and he killed so many but died a martyr at the end and the prophet saidat wasam what's with Hanah I've seen the Angels washing him between the heavens and the Earth and this is something no one else can see because the prophet see things that we do not see so they went to his wife who just got married to him and ask her what what what's happening she said he had this sexual impurity the major impurity and he heard the call to defend Medina he did not have time to have so he went out and that is why the Angels washed him HB may Allah be pleased with him this H is a different one Abu Bakr met and he asked him what's happening of course it was in Arabic so but it was how are you doing H said I have become a hypocrite abak said hypocrite you're you're a Muslim what are you saying he said whenever we are with the prophet Alat wasam he reminds us of Allah he reminds us of hell and fire as if if we can see hell and fire and Paradise but whenever we go back to our homes and see our wives and sit and play with our children and work in our Farms we do not recognize our hearts it's it's a different thing so definitely I've become a hypocrite Abu Bakr said by Allah I have the same feelings let's go to our doctor to the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam so they went to the prophet and the prophet asked H how are you H and the prophet said and andah said I have become a hypocrite so I told him why and he repeated the same thing he said Prophet when we're with you you remind us of paradise and hell as if we can see them we are so filled with IM but the minute we go back to this vicious circle of life we live in we forget we do not recognize our hearts so the prophet said by Allah he swore by Allah if you were at your homes like you are here with me while making Vick you'll end up shaking hands with the angels on the streets you will end up elevating your spirit and soul to a degree where you will be able to see the Angels at daylight but an hour and an hour an hour he said it three times and an hour an hour and an hour what does he mean he meant that an hour for remembering Allah for worship for making Vick and an hour to your life to your wives to your children to your uh business which means that the prophet Alam did not approve if H wanted to stay the Masjid and not work and not go to his family and not do anything this is unacceptable Prophet said one hour here and one hour there this is the Islamic way to have an hour for your heart and an hour for yourself nowadays Muslims have an hour for their hearts for for their Lord that is and an hour for the Shan they pray this is Allah's hour and they go out and they fool around and they do sin and they say this is the hour for our hearts no this is the hour for shatan so if you elevate your spirit you could almost be at the level of the Angels but if you descend with your spirit to the level of animals and you serve your desires then you will become enslaved to others than Allah the prophet said May the slave of money of worldly matters fall on his face or fall head first to the ground so he called him the slave of the pound and the dollar and the Euro he called him the slave he's not the slave of Allah and unfortunately this is the case with the majority of Muslims you either go to the extreme right and abandon work abandon getting Provisions for your family neglect your children claiming that you're worshiping Allah I've seen people like like monks traveling and going and what are you doing said I'm going for da I'm going to worship Allah I'm going to purify my heart do you have kids he says yes I have them I have a dozen you have wives yes I have three and who's providing for them Allah Subhan Allah what is this is this an open bank account this is UN Islamic this is something that is unacceptable and at the same time you have people on the far left claiming that they work to provide for the families but they are like a machine and a lot of the Muslims nowadays in Arabia and in the west here are like this they are caught up in working two jobs a day and not because they can't have enough they want more so they're never satisfied with what they have and all of this is on the account of their spirituality on the purity of their hearts they're engaged in working and working and working but they have nothing to offer to Allah no prayers no fasting no charity no recitation of the Quran no attendance of circles of knowledge nothing maybe every now and then they come in e and provide or or claim to have uh uh something for the Muslims once a year and this is more than enough Islam is a religion of balance that is why Allah the almighty says thus we have made you a just and balanced Nation we're balanced it doesn't tell you to be a monk and it Islam doesn't tell you to aband that that whatever means you want to take to become rich this justifies the means you're taking even if they're Haram it's a religion that speaks to your soul to your nature and to your intellect it pays great deal and attention to your soul and to your body as well and without any doubt the best self discipline a one looks for is the one that the prophet Alat wasam had for his companions but how did the the prophet Alam discipline his companions so that would they would reach the level of spirituality first of all the prophet Alat wasam used to fight any attempt to go to the far right or to the far left he would always keep his companions focused on the right path and track for example if he noticed that some of his companions are not engaged in forms of worship to get closer to Allah he would remind them in the sah he visited his daughter Fatima and his son-in-law and cousin at the same time alali may be pleased with them at night and he found them lying down ready to get into bed ready to sleep it was night time and the prophet said Subhan Allah don't you pray and he's not talking about prayer it's been already been performed he's talking about night prayer Ali may Allah be pleased with him said oh prophet of Allah the souls are at Allah's hands if he wishes we will wake up and pray if he doesn't we will not pray and and this this is answer is not the right answer so the prophet Sall wasallam went out hitting his thigh and saying Subhan Allah and man was mostly arguing he argues a lot Ali should have complied he said inshallah we will do that but he didn't likewise the prophet Alat wasam was approached by his wife haar may Allah be pleased with her she said oh prophet of Allah Omar Abdullah Omar my brother saw a dream and in this dream he was brought by two men to Hellfire and he saw the people being tortured in hell but the man told him you're not among them don't be afraid so what is this dream so the prophet said Abdullah is one of the best Servants of Allah if he prayed night prayer so this is an instruction because you've noticed that Abdullah did not offer night prayer so he said that he's among the best Servants of Allah if he prayed and offered night prayer so the prophet alhat brought him back to the right track and he also addressed abdah may Allah be peace with him and with his father he told him Abdullah do not be like so and so this man he used to pray night prayer and now he doesn't so don't ever be be like him he's saying this to one of the great Companions of his abdah and he has a story of his own abdah when he got married his father forced him to marry and couple of weeks later he visited his son's house and he met his daughter-in-law so he told her how is Abdullah with you she said mashallah he is among the best men of ever seen he prays all night and fasts all day he's a good he's a good practicing Muslim figured it out he did not even touch her he did not come close to her he's praying all night long and in the morning he's fasting she's complaining that he is not giving her her rights as a wife so he went and complained to the prophet Alam the prophet brought Abdullah told him what do you say what do you do Abdullah he said I fast the whole year I don't break one day of fasting I fast every single day of the year and I pray the whole night the prophet Alam denied him from doing this he said this is not acceptable this is not permissible and he showed him what to do how to fast how to recite the Quran he used to imagine he used to recite the whole Quran every single night can you do this can any of you recite the whole Quran every single night the brothers are not concentrating hope the sisters are now abdah used to recite the Quran entirely every single night this means that every month he he recites the Quran how many times 30 times can you do this the prophet told him abdah this is too much so he said I can't do it he said no recite the Quran once every month meaning one every night he said I can do more he said 20 nights he said I can do more in 10 nights he said I can do more in seven nights abdah said I can do more said no this is the max recite the Quran once every seven nights and that is it the prophet Alat wasam saw a rope dangling from the Masjid and he said what is this Rob for they told him this is your wife z b may Allah be pleased with her your cousin and wife she uses this Rob so that whenever she feels tired when praying night prayer she hangs up to it and she stands up see the prophet untied this rope remove move it one should pray as long as he's fit whenever he's sleepy or tired he should go to bed this is UN Islamic that you force yourself to do things and this is why the prophet used to bring them back again and again to the Sunnah Abu D and Salman Ali the prophet made them brothers at the very beginning of the Islam he used to come to one from the muhajirin and one from the ansar and Associate between them and they become brothers they inherit each other so Salman Pharisee once visited his brother's house and this was before hijab before it was obligatory that women cover and he saw his wife and she wasn't taking care of herself so he's he asked her why are you doing this she said your brother has no desire for women because he's fast in all day praying all night and Salman said okay I'll fix him and when when when Abu D came Salman Al fari was brought with the food lunch so he put it forward to Abu D and told him eat Abu D said I'm fasting he told him break your fast eat I'm your guest you have to eat with me so he broke his fast and then when it's night time after they Isa they went to bed and Abu was sleeping in the same room with uh uh Salman he wanted to go and pray night prayer Salman told him go to bed said I want to pray sleep not now in the middle of the night he woke up he wanted to pray said sleep 3 4 hours before fuder sleep just an hour before fer he told him let's go and pray so they woke up they prayed together until F they went to pray f with the prophet and then Abu D went to the prophet and Salman said to Abu D he told him AB D your body has rights over you your wife has rights over you your guest has rights over you Allah has rights over you so give each and every one of them their right don't mix things together and this is how you attain and obtain spirituality in Islam Abu did not buy this so he went to the prophet told listen what Salman said he said I have to do this and this and that and right and said yes Abu Salman Al fari told you the right thing give everyone his rights if we look at life in this form we know that we should devote our time to Distributing the rights we have as Allah Asel commanded us to our wives to our parents to our children to our community to our jobs to our bodies if we have to go and train and stay fit to every single thing that requires and has rights over us and when the prophet Alat wasam was asked to Define Islam what about if someone asks you now to Define Islam what is Islam it depends on what school you're following those who follow philosophy and logic would have different opinion and definition to those who follow the Sunnah the prophet has he was asked to Define Islam he did not give any philosophical answers or things that you cannot understand it's like you know in the' 70s there was this program uh uh called Kung Fu it's about a man in a temple it's called grasshopper so whenever he ask his teacher he said the teacher said the grasshopper look at the Moon and when you see the Moon round you will find out he gives him you know puzzles Islam is not like this it's a clear religion it's a beautiful religion and it's a simple religion any man can understand Islam you don't have to be a scholar because it's all in black and white right so the prophet when he was asking about Islam what did he say five pillars of Islam the five pillars of Islam this is Islam so if you want to reach the level of spirituality this is your way the prophet said this before spent 13 years in Mecca doing what he didn't use any philosophical things or any Mystic phrases or any other means he was teaching his companions there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah for 13 years he was introducing Allah to them he was teaching them the beautiful attributes and names of Allah and unfortunately this what Muslims lack the most nowadays brothers and sisters we do not know Allah seriously now you I know Allah okay I'll give you few plain uh uh papers write what you know about Allah Allah is great yes and uh I I have things to do I have to go sorry I can't answer this quiz imagine and if I give you a paper and ask you to write the attributes of Allah the names of Allah you know how many do you think you could reach 20 40 allaham and if I ask you give me the evidence from the Quran and from the sunah that these are the authentic names you'll be speechless most likely if may Allah have mercy on his soul wrote a book of printed book three volumes and these three volumes approximately more than a thousand page Pages more than th pages and you know what the title of the book those who are walking on the straight path between the steps of those who are walking on the path between only on this verse he came up with a th000 pages so if I ask you to write a commentary on the fa what will you do we do not know Allah we perform five prayers alhamdulillah every day we fast we give zakat we perform Haj we make omah but we do not observe Allah we never watch subhana tala especially when we are on our own in our rooms may Allah be pleased with him once a man told him Omar as long as you are among us people will always be fine nothing wrong will happen with them he told him in in Arabic may Allah may your mother lose you and this is an Arabic he's not asking Allah to kill him so that his mother would lose him but this is an Arabic terminology and saying what are you doing what are you saying this is something grave and serious he told the brother of in-law of the prophet and one of the best Companions of the Prophet after the four Khalifa and the 10 uh uh 10 Heavenly bound I don't know whatever you know but I mean yeah you know uh he told this man who was complimenting him he said do you know what your brother from your father and mother's side do you know what he does when he goes into his room and close doors do you know do you know so how can you say that this man mashallah the religion is steady and good as long as he's there there you cannot know you do not know this this is something beyond your knowledge and without the five pillars of Islam you will never be able to reach spirituality in Islam without knowing the three divisions of without practicing them believing in them you will never attain this spirituality in Islam the second pillar of Islam is prayer you want to reach and attain spirituality of Islam you have to fulfill this pillar and if you look at sects in Islam you'll find a lot of them not paying great deal of attention to prayer there are so many soall Muslims that do not pray or claim that they have reached a level of certainty and belief that prayer is only for the Layman we now know Allah some of them say we take our knowledge straight from my heart from Allah to my heart we don't need any intermediat like the prophet like the scholars like no no no no we take it straight from Allah they have direct DSL connection and of course this is going astray going away from Allah's teachings in the Quran you identify Men by prayer so if a man you like how he looks long beard short th masallah wearing or or head scar he looks like he's from Makkah or medina mashallah but he doesn't pray you disregard him but if a man smells he works in clay and and bricks and sand and he comes to the Masjid you look at him what is this guy he doesn't even have a a penny in his pocket or in his bank account but he prays five times a day by Allah he is among the Believers this is the man you should give attention and respect to the prophet Alat wasam told us that the most burdensome prayer over the Hypocrites are F and is f and Isa prayer they are the most burdensome upon Hypocrites especially when the night is short you'll not find people coming neither for fuder nor for these are signs of Hypocrites you want to attain the level of spirituality the prophet used to say to B may Allah be pleased with him Comfort us with prayer B come on make make make Salah make the call for Comfort us with prayer nowadays people come wait in the Masid for 5 10 minutes look at their watches and they say for the MU come on let's let's go let's do it and we want to leave we have work to do to do we have things to do we don't want to wait all day long for Salah and it's a different way and level of IM and asked the prophet alhat wasam and he told him what is the best Deeds that Allah loves most the first thing he said on time prayer on time and this is in theah in another narration he said at the very beginning of the time time so you don't keep a POS with the exception of AA prayer of course so prayer is one of the greatest means of obtaining spirituality in Islam and purifying your heart third pillar of Islam zat giving charity as prescribed by the Quran and the Sunnah the prophets Allah says in the Quran take s from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it so it cleans your heart whenever you're feeling bad or depressed give Sak if you have someone who's ill in your family and you want to treat him treat him with sod the more you spend the more comfortable you feel and the more elevated your soul would B how many times minutes the fourth pillar fasting and in this holy month of Ramadan if you cannot become spiritual not in the sense of having Jin and Sorcerers and so if you cannot become and reach the level of purifying your heart in this Ramadan it's quite difficult to do elsewhere in this holy month of Ramadan the month of patience people recite the Quran people pray night prayer they fast they give charity they good do good deeds they refrain from sin whether by looking hearing or doing so this is a month where people consider it to be a sale it's a season if you are successful in performing what Allah wants from you he you will reach a degree of spirituality you have never ever experienced in your life not through invented Vick or movements or dancing or jumping around here and there and and thinking that you will reach this level no through following the Sunnah of the Prophet wasam through reciting the Holy Quran and the fifth pillar Haj it's enough that on this journey you know that Allah will forgive all of your sins and that Allah asael will provide you with more wealth the more you make Hajj and omah Allah will give you more and more money and risk and wealth among the main things that draw you closer to Allah and purify your spirit is reciting the Quran the prophet sallahu alaihi Ali wasallam complained to Allah by saying oh Allah my Lord verily my people deserted this Quran have we deserted Quran brothers and sisters yes or no no Scholars have disputed some say yes some say no and this is the case with every fatwa whenever you ask him this is why there was a scholar called I Jin and he was a scholar of Arabic language and of Islamic Studies and he used to give fatwa in Masid and once he had to go for 15 minutes so he asked his father to sit in his place and this is you know a joke but it it actually took place uh it's in the books of of of history and he told his father whenever someone comes to you and asks you about a verdict a fatwa say Scholars have disputed and there are two opinions in this issue so one came to him and said oh Sheikh I prayed uh uh before the time was due thinking that it was due said well Scholars have two opinions on this issue one said I said to my wife is this one or three so he said Scholars have disputed in this issue one smart guy was sitting there said this is this is not right and he stood up and said oh she is there any doubt in the existence of Allah said Scholars have two opinions and and the people of the mid wanted to grab him into his neck and kill him but his son just walked in and said what's going on this crazy old man the guy asks him is there any doubt in the existence of Allah and he said Scholars have two opinions in this being a knowledgeable person in linguistics he said yes the question in Arabic this has a beginning and an end and it's a phrase and there are articles and there are words and there are verbs and he twisted the whole issue to be linguistic not to be dealing with AA so going back to the question again have Muslims deserted the Quran do you know how many types of of desertion to of the Quran are there to be a practicing Muslim and not to fall under the category of deserting the Quran you should listen to it and believe so many people listen to the Quran and believe in it and unfortunately they do not practice it so listening for Baraka is good but if you don't practice what's in it you have not taking it fully you're still deserting the Quran some people listen to it believe in it and practice what's in it but they do not contemplate and understand what is needed from them they they just parting it no you have to go deep down you have to open the books of commentary you have to know what Allah Asel wants from you when this verse was revealed how it was revealed how did the prophet Alam tell his companions about it s would probably do all of this but would not use it as a form of treatment and remedy and Quran is the best treatment and medication to our souls and also to our bodies and I've done this so many times to myself whenever I was ill and or feeling pain or had an evil eye I just recite the fa last three chapters of the Quran and blow and mallah one day to day good as new maybe a little bit better if you believe in the Quran you will find it as a remedy to yourself and this shows you how weak our Iman is the minute one of our children Falls sick what do we do where is the tempera where is the the baby aspirin let's go take the child to the doctor we have to move quickly there's a what before all of this you have to recite the fa you have to make the supplication the Dua and seek The Cure from Allah and then go to the doctor not the other way around if your belief is solid and strong and the last way of applying and practicing Islam uh Quran so that we would not be deserting It Is by referring to it as a ruler if should rule Our Lives when I have a dispute with my brother what do we do we go to the court but the court are not applying they're not using Shar say I know they're not using Shar because if I go to the Quran he will win so I go to the court and then I will win this may nullify your Islam if you and another brother go to the UN Islamic Court to settle a dispute that you know that the Quran or the Sunnah says otherwise this nullifies your Islam or at least makes makes you a transgressor for not referring to Allah's book and among the best after the Quran to reach and elevate your spirituality is to know the S of the Prophet W we're so ignorant about our beloved Prophet our about his his his faithful companions that it is a shame I I usually uh make a joke of this with our people back home and I say when I we used to teach in high school I used to tell the children the kids the boys grown up in 19 20 years old and I used to tell them now we have a problem if we go to Paradise on the day of judgment we'll probably not recognize anyone if if we go into paradise and we go inside who's this Abu Bakr Mah who's this is Omar you don't know Omar no Allah but it's nice to meet you have acquaintance this is this is I don't know these guys let's go to hell if you go to hell oh all of these are my friends are loved one mashallah celebrities I know this I know that I know this we have a problem we do not know the good people if someone comes to you and say okay give me a list of the 10 best Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and I did this survey in Saudi Arabia where they're Arabs Muslim practicing by birth and W he none of them in more than a thousand students gave me the 10 Companions of the Prophet Alat shall we make the survey here or no need for embarrassment no need for embarrassment this a big problem if Abdullah Mubarak one of the great Scholars of Islam his companions used to say why did you come out and sit with us every night said why should I sit with you said we just to talk and you know said no no I sit with the comp of the Prophet Alat I sit with the Hadith I sit with the with the biography with the battles of the Prophet with the Expeditions that he used to send s Ali wasallam the more you read W the more you feel life is worthless and you know how to behave whenever you face with a situation now what would the prophet do sallallahu alaihi wasallam in a similar situation what would Omar do what would Abu Bakr do by reading and learning this you will reach it inshallah the lecture has so many things in it I still have a few minutes right um there are so many things that would elevate your spirituality and among them there are forms of worship by the heart we have forms of worship by the body like prayer H we have form of worship by the Tongue that you say but there are forms of worship in your heart that do not usually show among the very best is loving Allah and believe it or not I met a brother who used to pray in the Masjid who used to fast and pay zaka and I asked him uh do you love Allah he said no I was shocked why he said I don't love him so why do you pray because I don't want to go to hell that's all if there was no hell I wouldn't have woried him this brother does not know Allah he loves Allah but he doesn't know it Scholars say that love of Allah is like a bird love of Allah is the head and the two wings are the fear of Allah and the Hope in Allah if one of these Wings is distorted the bird will fly awkwardly but if there is no head there is no life for the bird if you love Allah asael then Allah subhah wa ta'ala will grant you Victory and success in this life and the Hereafter the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says that Allah the almighty says say oh Muhammad to mankind if you really love Allah then follow me follow the prophet Allah will love you and forgive your sins if you love Allah you have to prove it the Christians love Allah the Jews love Allah and every single denomination claim to love Allah but you have to provide the proof If I have a Muslim saying I love Allah but he doesn't comply with Allah's commands and doesn't apply the Sunnah it's exactly like a father saying to his loving child son go get me a glass of water and the son says by Allah father I love you I don't want to get you water son go and get me water W I love you I just don't feel like getting you water would be would this son be a loving child definitely not and so many people challenge Allah there was this man by the name of either s or bahul and he was claiming to love Allah among you know he was an extremist saying he used to pray oh Allah test me come on bring it on test me you'll find me loving you I will tolerate anything and he used to say this so Allah tested him with what they call uh uh urin urinary retention he could not urinate and it's painful so this man used to go to the children when they're playing football and say oh children pray for your lying Uncle I'm Li I was lying I can't tolerate Allah's test no one challenges Allah and claims that he loves Allah a person who loves Allah he has to have certain characteristics in him for example Allah says Allah loves those who repent and you're not an angel but you're not a devil at the same time so by default you have to make mistakes and when you make mistakes you have to to repent and this is the trend and you will live until you die doing this no one is perfect but the minute you sin immediately go back to repentance because if you continue to sin without repentance then and you die on this you're in deep trouble alassan Al basri his companions came to him and told him Abu we have a situation he said what what's wrong he said that we sin and then we repent and then we sin again and feel deep remorse and repent and sin for the third time and repent and sin for the fourth time and then we are ashamed so many times we sin and repent sin and repent so we desert repentance and he said Subhan Allah this is exactly what Shan wants from from you if you sin repent and never ever give up repentance because Allah is most forgiving and that is why his name is the repenting or the one who repents o over people and there are lots of conditions for repentance and I believe Abu Abu Usama did a a lecture on repentance uh uh you all know it inshallah and there's not enough time to go through it a person who loves Allah has to be among the those who keep a barrier between themselves and hellfire this barrier is good deeds and Allah says that Allah loves those Pious and people who keep a barrier between them and hellfire among the things that elevate your spiritual ual ity having complete on Allah andul is dependence or trust as some some may call it Allah says Allah loves those who rely and Depend and have their trust in Allah and the majority of Muslims don't have this the majority of Muslims don't have full dependence and tle on Allah the almighty to believe that only Allah brings the benefit and prevents the harm from falling on you and the more you believe in Allah the more your tul increases people are on extremes as usual and in the middle path some of them have complete trust and dependence on Allah to the extent that they do not work they do not do anything and there are sects in Islam like this they you would find them sitting in the Masjid and depending on people to feed them to bring them water to bring them provisions and when you tell them why don't you go out and work said no we are mut we are uh uh depending on Allah the almighty Imam Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul when he saw someone going for Hajj he was coming from Yemen to mecca for Hajj but he did not have any food and he did not have any drink and he did not have any money so he asked him what are you doing I said I'm going for Hajj and I have full dependence and Trust in Allah and I'm he told him no your full dependence is on the food sack of others because if you were depending on Allah you should have have your food sack with you so that you don't beg from people and this is what the prophet didat wasam when he left from meca to Medina he had a guide a non-muslim guide to guide him he didn't go from meca and saying Allah will guide me no no he took a guide whenever he fought he put on his armor he put on the shields he would not go without any armor or Shield depending on Allah Asel and saying that I will not uh uh I do not need this so this is the far extreme those who do not work do not provide their families claiming that they're depending on Allah and in the far Other Extreme those who do not depend on Allah at all and they depend entirely on their intellect on their degree on their job on their work and refuse to depend on Allah or to attribute anything to Allah like I said in last time that when you make a presentation when you talk about yourself what do you say I managed to fulfill the strategy of 2008 I obtain i i i attained my objectives I succeeded in doing this I will open uh new branches next year I will I will where is Allah Allah is in Heavens there's nothing to do with this this is whaton saidon said whatever I have I have it with my knowledge Allah has nothing to do with this and this is blasphemy because you have to attribute everything to Allah and those who forget Allah and do not have dependence on Allah usually they end up by committing suicide they they've tried everything and that is why suicide is widely spread in societies that do not believe in Allah and now it's becoming quite common with some Muslims who are ignorant of Allah subhah wa ta'ala among the things that increases your spiritual ity is patience and we had a whole lecture last night on this subject so I would not go in details um there are signs for spirituality how would you know that you are on the right track Allah the almighty says and whom soever Allah Wills to guide he opens his chest to Islam and whomsoever he Wills to send astray he makes his chest closed and constricted as if he's climbing up to the sky if you feel that your chest is open and you're always happy and you're not depressed mashallah you're on the right track providing you're applying these things in your life prayer and so on and Etc and this openness in the chest is not a open heart uh uh surgery H open chest surgery no it's it's it's a wonderful life that you sense and feel and this is mentioned in the Quran by the Beautiful Life The Good Life Allah says in the Holy Quran whoever Works righteousness whether male or female while he or she is a True Believer verily to him we will give a good life commentary says that a good life in this world with respect contentment and lawful provis Vision now do people have this good life Muslims most of them do non-muslims do they have this good life some of them claim some of them claim to have this life and that is why you may find non-practicing Muslims pretending and claiming to have this good life and if you see someone who's not practicing not praying and you ask him what are you doing he said well I fool around I go to nightclubs I go to the pub 2 hours a day I gamble I deal in interest I watch movies I listen to music I'm living it I'm living the British dream Subhan Allah you happy yes I'm happy is he is he truly happy well he looks like as if he's happy no he's not these things that make him happy are shortterm tranquilizers it's like painkillers they have this depression in their souls and they are tranquilizing it with these things that they're doing and for example if you see one of them non practicing Muslims watching an action movie while he's watching it he's having a good time the minute it finishes the lecture finishes the minute the minute the movie finishes he feel depressed when he puts another one he's having a good time when it finishes he's depressed so he has to move on from one sin to the other to the third to the fourth and keeps on until he is completely destroyed Jews and Christians came to the companions of Abdullah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and I believe that I should end up here and they told him they told them that you Muslims whisper in your prayer we Jews and Christians we don't have any Whispers in our prayer do you Muslims whisper in your prayer do you well if you don't then you should be sitting here everyone Whispers In His prayer everyone Whispers In His prayer so they went to IB Abbas and told him I Abbas the Jews and the Christians say they do not whisper in their prayer and they're bragging about this and they say that you Muslims do I Abbas said yes they they're right what would Shan do with an empty heart Shayan is like a burglar and your heart is like a fortress with lots of treasures and wealth and a Jew or a Christian's heart is like a Poor's man's house nothing no electricity it's empty when a burglar comes where would he go to the house that has all the jewelry and the treasures and that is why he is in pursue and continuously trying to make you descend from this spirituality that you seek into this worldly matter I have lots and lots of points that I have not covered I hope I didn't bore you to death but inshallah what you have heard is suff sufficient and enough"
