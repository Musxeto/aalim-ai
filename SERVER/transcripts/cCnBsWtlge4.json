  "title": "Are Ahmadis & Qadianis classified as Muslims? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh yeah i have a question um regarding the issue of ahmadiyya and are they muslims and would be classified as muslims as the consensus not my opinion the consensus of all schools of thought and all uh forums of muslim scholars worldwide take them out of the fold of islam because they do not relate to islam though they want to be relating to islam because they have a different religion they even have a messenger after the prophet islam and this by itself is an act of apostasy when you claim that there is a prophet after our prophet muhammad sallallahu singh and they destroyed the whole religion so this is the consensus of all muslims no muslim had ever said that they are muslims as well the media and the are all disbelievers"
