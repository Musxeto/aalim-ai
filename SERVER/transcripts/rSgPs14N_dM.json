  "title": "Can a person be buried in their own home after death? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have a very interesting question here from YouTube what is the ruling on women making masya that they are to be buried in the house where they live is it permissible I don't know what this this is the scholars say that this is permissible but it is not logical meaning that the best thing for a Muslim is to be married in a cemetery because if he were to be buried in his own property this property would not be for sale forever his grave would make selling and utilizing that property gone it becomes now therefore the grave forever and this is not logical that you waste like couple of million dollars just to bury you and why if you're buried in a cemetery imagine the amount of people that would visit the cemetery and say salaam-o-alaikum derecho minene Antonio no no logic una sola no Lacombe and a fear and and they make du'a for all those disease but if you're in your home nobody even bothers to to give dua for you so this is not logical and it is highly not recommended to be done but if if we if done then the poor and the poor heirs would not get a penny out of that makes a lot of sense I mean you want you know this lady should be wanting the offspring to be bla for her because once they want to sell the house and okay yes if she wants adjure sell the property and donate it to Islamic organizations or Slama schools like yours make it a walk through the TV that would generate ongoing hasanat and you can be buried wherever you wish just like a lot is if"
