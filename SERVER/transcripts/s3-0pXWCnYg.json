  "title": "Muslims who claim that Z*onism is not a dangerous ideology.. #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh before starting my question check I would like to say that I don't want to label any uh person so the question goes like this if any I know some Muslims who say say claims themselves as Muslims and quot Ali Scholars like s Scholars when it comes to any F issue but at the same time they say that Zionism is not at all a dangerous ideology and whoever say says bad things about it is an islamist and extremist and blame the this is this is this is this is yeah nonsense Zionism is a plague and it's a disease and anyone defending it is a  someone who has a deficiency in his thinking powers and in his intellect because it's a racist uh based cult and belief that is based based on apartheid so I don't believe any copy let alone Muslim would defend Zionism at all"
