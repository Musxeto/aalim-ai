  "title": "Who was Muadh ibn Jabal? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all who is this man that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasam took his hand swore twice that he loves him this man is Mu he is from the ansar from the Medina and we know that the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam used to sell himself every season in Hajj to all the people that come to Mecca so that they would take him in and give him shelter and support him he goes to all the tribes listen I have this message I have I have Quran listen to me and they all like what they hear and see but none of them had the coitos to go ahead for it and they nope I'd rather be safe rather than sorry so the people of Medina in they heard and they liked what they heard so they went to their people they told them that listen we've heard this from this man and wo man he has something next season they came with more men among them was mu mu at the time was how old 16 years of age some say 18 years of age to us in our standards he was a kid in these days or in those days they did not have this description that we tend to have nowadays we say that oh he's a teenager he'll grow up it's okay he is fornicating he's doing pot he's uh uh watching porn he's skipping Salah it's just okay he's he's a teenage he's 40 years of age it's okay he'll grow up they didn't have this categorization the moment you hit puberty whether it's 15 or 14 years of age or 16 you're a man and you act like a man and you behave like a man so mu at that time was 16 years of age he was described to be tall handsome intellectual a very very smart man to the extent that he was among the handful who used to give fatwa at the time of the Prophet Alat now if you have the prophet and you had an inquiry you wouldn't go to someone else you would go to the prophet there were a handful of Scholars among the companions that were authorized by the prophet Alam to go and ask and take fatwa what an honor come on give me a break the prophet is there and you coming to me and the prophet approves of that what an honor not only that mu did not miss a single battle with the prophet wasam Mah you're all here how did you come SMS Flyers emails at the time of the Prophet they did not have thisat whenever the call for Jihad was there they immediately went with the prophet some of them could have been in his farm some of them could have been away which tells you that mu was always around the prophet he never missed a single battle not only that look at this highest Purple Heart Medal what is the highest in medals I don't know look at this medal that he received the prophet saidat to the companions take the Quran from four of my companions learn the Quran straight from the mouth of four that's it yes these are the most knowledgeable among the companions of the Quran who are they abdah and Ma may Allah be pleased with him and the prophet acknowledged him to be among the scholars how he said mu jabal will come on the day of judgment way ahead of the scholars which means that this is is a endorsement of the Prophet to his knowledge and this is why he also said in an authentic Hadith the most knowledgeable of my companions about Halal andam Is mu and we haven't mentioned Abu Bakr Omar Ali the prophet did not which means that he has something they may have some of but not all so mad was a specimen of his own and he is unfortunately unknown to the most of us you say nice to know you who's he and this is a problem when it comes to our history to our heritage we have no knowledge of it and I always make this joke may Allah forgive me if we were to enter Jenna and then they'll introduce us this is Sal who Sal one of the Great greatest warriors at the time of the prophet and the best Sportsman ever with stamina much bigger and stronger than marathon runners mashallah don't know him never heard of him this is Abu and this is uh so and so and this is I said guys I don't know any of those I can't recognize those in Jenna can we take a tour to Hell the moment you go to hell I know everybody here homies what's happening I I feel yeah related I know everyone here so this is a problem if you're going to go to Jenna you need to know who your neighbors are so we have to go back to our history books we have to study the we have to study the companions of the Prophet Those whom he loved so that we would have the honor to accompany them inshallah on the day of judgment the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent mu to Yemen as a judge ruler teacher and a Muti he sent this young boy he he was almost in his mid 20s or less early 20s yet he sent him in this level to a whole country and he was recognized by the great companions Omar may Allah be pleas with him and you know Omar he said whoever wants to learn must come to Mu go to Mu he doesn't say come to me come to Ali come to abdah go to Mu he's got the yes it was trial and error he made mistakes and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam corrected him scorned him and was hard on him you remember when he once LED Isa with his tribe he used to pray Isa with the prophet Alam and then he goes to his tribe and leads them in is again as a Sunnah for him voluntary prayer but fart for them and he used to recite with Al bak and the people they used to work from Before Dawn till sunset they wanted to go get some sleep they one of the companions just said this is too much excuse me and he continued his is for himself and left so after half an hour when the prayer was over the Good Samaritans went to M and said this man left you and prayed on his own and and departed the congregation He's a hypocrite the same Good Samaritans went to him said didn't you hear what mu said about you you're a hypocrite so he went to the prophet and complained the prophet was [Music] outraged are you causing people to have FNA and you are give them trials in their Religion Don't prolong the prayer when you lead when you lead behind you there are those who are old those who have have errands to attain those who um are incapable of standing for a long for a long time so the prophet corrected himam and this is how he learned when he came back from Yemen he was sent by the prophet he came back from the from Yen what did he do anyone no one okay he frustrated to the prophet Alat wasam the prophet said whoa what are you doing stand up stand up what are you doing he said oh prophet of Allah I went to Yemen and I saw them greet their dignitaries and their rulers like this and you're the most worthy of such greetings he said if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone else I would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband so again trial and error all of this is adding to his knowled he's compiling this and this is why he's among the greatest of the companions when it comes to knowledge and"
