  "transcript": "so there's a Hadith that says that take up Good Deeds only as much as you are able for the best Deeds are those done regularly even if they are few so I was a little confused by this let's say if I have I'm relatively Freer than my usual work I have some time on my hands so on my usual days let's say when I'm working I read half a juice daily uh but now because free I have more time I can read like a full juice full juice daily similarly now I'm free so I can fast alternate days usually I fast only on Mondays and Thursdays so is this like uh all right or is there or should I like okay shuk this is totally right and correct and valid the Hadith is referring to burdening yourself Beyond its ability this is the prohibition so when someone says okay I will Fast every single day the prophet said no this is not part of the Sunnah if someone says I'll pray from is till the prophet said no Haram you have to go to bed if someone says I'm not going to marry at all I'm going to be uh uh single for the rest of my life the prophet says no this is burdening yourself with something that Allah did not oblig upon you to see when you are having time and increase in Good Deeds within your ability this is totally right logical valid and accepted by Allah asael and Allah knows"
