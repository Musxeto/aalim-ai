  "transcript": "bismillahir rahmanir rahim alhamdu lillah Oh salatu salam ala rasulillah holly was so happy o men esta debajo de a movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to a chapter that deals with the night of decree lela2 al Adam this great night which is the greatest night in the whole year the night of decree where Allah as the watch L made good deeds in it better than 1000 days 1000 weeks 1000 months and scholars say Subhan Allah Allah is giving us so much reward why is that so they looked into how long the nations before us used to live and each one of them used to live for so many years no peace be upon him lived for so long we don't know how long he lived but we know that he remained giving Dawa he stayed giving Dawa for 950 years this is how he gave Dawa how long but how long did he live Allah Allah and that is why the nations before us their life was so long and because our lifespan is very short the Prophet tells us a little salaam the ages of my ummah is between 60 and 70 and anyone who passes 70 are very seldom those who pass 70 are very rare look around you how many people do you find over 70 very little the most people that died usually die before 60 or between 60 the prophetess m died when he was 63 years old Abu Bakr died when he was 63 years old and so on so this is the average that is why Allah has favoured us Allah has blessed us by giving us one night the deeds in it are equivalent to about 80 plus seeds 83 84 years on one night it's very easy a lot of the Muslims say stool on praying taraweeh for two hours or three hours with night with a hatchet us a lot okay you will get 80 plus years of good deeds yeah but it is too much I would only pray in odd numbers the night of twenty first third fifth seventh and ninth okay what about the even numbers so no no not important not important and then they would say 21st is too early I will pray only on the twenty-fifth hundred twenty seventh and the ninth and then they say 27th is the night of laila tejada so i don't have to pray any night except that and even that on the twenty-seventh they pray 2 rakats with the imam of taraweeh and they say well why my knees hurt my back hurts and they go home and watch TV and this shows you how lazy we are even when Allah gives us so much good deeds ah I can make it up later on inshallah so this chapter deals with this beautiful night there are a number of misconceptions people say that this night is identified by looking and if Allah blesses you you will see a window opened this we have in some countries of Arabia they say that masha'Allah the window of lailatul qatar has been opened allah will give you so much money and these are all nonsense how do you know later as a cutter you can't know it but there might be signs of it among the signs that it is a night of peace so much less fighting much less car accidents much less of our ument takes place and the Sun when it comes up it comes up cold without any strong light so you can watch it you can look at it when it comes on other days the minute it comes it's so strong that you cannot look at it and there are a number of science but these are only signs and a Muslim a proper Muslim does not care if this night is later to cuddle or that night why because the last 10 nights it is full power he's working because this is one season in the year he will not miss mother Aisha may allah be pleased with that said o prophet of Allah if I think that this is the night of laila to qatar the night of decree and why was it called lailatul qatar other means value so either it means that it is the night that has great value or it means that the night that allah decrees everything that's going to happen throughout the year and scholars say well this night is this night or is it the 15th of Shaban it's an issue of dispute among scholars this is not the time to discuss it however she asked the Prophet is salatu salam what should I say and the Prophet told her to say allahumma innaka a full 12 HED bull alpha phi honey o Allah now I'm describing a la I am complementing Allah you are a fool you are most forgiving and you love forgiveness so forgive me now if allah loves forgiveness then we should also love forgiveness but do we forgive people or do we hate people if you say no i hummed alarm a person that i do not have any hate in my heart and I try as much as possible to forgive people who wronged do me if you're like this I give you the glad tidings insha Allah you are among the people of Jenna so the Prophet told her instructed her what to say let's go to this beautiful night this night where the prophet said alehissalaam whoever prays the night of the keel a little cod whoever prays night prayer for the sake of a large I was anticipating for the reward and believing of its virtues Allah will forgive all of his previous sins so people do not engage themselves in any activities during the last 10 nights of ramadan the Prophet solo solemn whenever the 10 night started that is on the 21st night he used to tighten his apron his garment tightening it scholars have to interpretation one that he used to work hard you know when you want to carry things and do things what do you do you tighten your clothes so that you don't need every time to tighten it up the second meaning is that he used to tighten it that he would not have any intimacy with his wife's it's no time for sexual relationships it is time for night prayer it is time for devotion for allah azzawajal he used to tighten his apron he used to wake up his wives usually in normal days they can sleep maybe he wakes them up for with her the minimum on these 10 nights no wake them up this is no time for asleep thirdly he used to revive this is the Arabic translation little revive the night meaning that he used to make the night alive with what with pairs with taking forgiveness with the Collazo agile dhikr of allah the almighty subhanahu wa'ta'ala so we begin with hadith of even Omar may allah be pleased with him yes brother narrated even our models your loved one some mint the companions of the prophet salallahu alayhi salam were shown in their dreams that the night of qatar was in the last seven nights of ramadan a las prophets allah allah salam said it seems that all your dreams agree that the night of cuddle is in the last seven nights and whoever wants to search for it that is the night of color should search in the last seven nights of ramadan ok zagala here hadith number 205 rated I shall adela wanna said that a las prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said search for the night of qatar in the odd nights of the last and nights from a one circle ahead hadith number 206 i presume narrated abu sa'id a hoodie a las prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to practice your decaf in the mosque in the middle third of ramadan one year he offered air to curve on the night of the 21st which is the night you used to go back to his house in this morning he said whoever was in here to calf at me should continue the last and nights for i have been shown this night and made to forget it i also saw myself in the dream restraining in the mud and water in this morning so search for it in the last 10 nights of this month and search for it in the odd night on that night it rained and the rainwater started leaking through the roof of the mosque which was made of palm pre leaves I saw with my own eyes the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam with the traces of mud on his forehead on the morning of the 21st very well now this hadith along with other hadith have given us the information on when to detect the night of Qatar we have a short break stay tuned and we will discuss this issue furthermore inshallah so we Salaam alaikum and welcome back these hadith differ among them but when you look at these hadith and the other hadith covering this issue you will find that the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us directed us that nail actual codger the night of decree is found where in the last ten nights of ramadan at the very beginning the Prophet of Islam performed a decaf which is seclusion in the message it for the sake of worshipping Allah in the first third of Ramadan from the beginning of our own wall till the 10th then the following year he performed it from the tenth till the 20th and then he was instructed that the night you're looking for is in the last third of Ramadan so he continued to make his attica from the 21st until the end of Ramadan and he told us that lailatul quadri is in there but we're at the beginning he said that the Companions came to him and said we had a vision we had a dream and in the dream we were told that it is in the last seven nights so it means that from the 23rd onwards and not one not two a number of them so when the prophet has to Sarum saw this told them that look for in the last seven days of the month so look for lay little further search for it meaning that you do your best of performing night prayer and vicar and reviving this night and inshallah it will be there another hadith the Prophet said Alice of Salaam look for it in the odd numbers of the last ten nights this includes what the 21st because the last hadith only from 23rd onwards now this hadith says no in the last 10 night now the last hadith of abu zaid Allah be pleased with him he said that the Prophet said look for it because I had seen it that is Layla to Qatar and made to forget it why why did the Prophet forget it because if we knew it then this would have been a lot of good for us you know why yes because if it was made known to the people they would worship only in that night and the rewards that they may have worship if it was not known to them would have been lost this is almost true but do you have another reason he saw two people who were calling among themselves very good this is the main reason what you have stated is the reason for hiding it when one says why did Allah hide it why didn't it Allah tell us it was on the twenty-fifth and that would have made us more comfortable in just praying on the twenty-fifth because a large that was L wanted people to work hard in these ten nights but what was the reason for the profit for getting the dream he saw the Prophet came to them and said that I saw the night of decree lela2 cutter and I saw in it that in the morning I was frustrating in mud and water but I forgot it because when I came out to tell you that it was this particular night two men in the masjid quarreled fought together and their voices raised in the machine so Allah made me forget it la illaha illallah look what quarrels between Muslims caused us to happen that we forgot and we do not know later the cutter which means that the messages first of all are not places for quarrel secondly quarrel leads to dispute and dispute leads to a lot of the Dean a lot of the religion to be lost so the Prophet tells us that I've seen it but it has been lifted abu sa'id says at the day that the Prophet said this was the night of the 21st the second day which is the fuzzy prayer of the 21st the Prophet frustrated and performed fudger after a rain that came in and made the masjid wet so I saw he says with my own eyes that that badger the Prophet offered salat and the traces of mud were on his face and nose what does this mean it means that Layla to cover that year was on the 21st so from this role ama scholars differed that when is Layla to Qatar how many difference of opinion could they have a lot some people made it up to 20 or 30 difference of opinion why it's either twenty first third fifth seventh or ninth what more can you do ah no there is another way of calculating it the Prophet said in an authentic hadith in the sahi searched for it for nine nights left nine nights left seven nights left five nights left three nights left one night left what is the meaning of left the scholars say are this means that we cannot calculate lay little cutter until we detect read so if Rama ban was 29 days the odd numbers would be the night of 20 the night of 22nd the night of 24th the night of 26 the night of the 28th because the 29th is the last day is the tenth day but if the month is complete 30 nights then we have twenty first third fifth seventh and ninth and this is the opinion of shakily slamming Timmy because he said that this way people would not only single out the odd number first which is 21st then they would neglect the even numbers but when we follow the hadith of this interpretation where the Prophet says exactly search for a little cutter for nine nights left or seven nights left how would I know it's left by finishing the month after the month finishes then I start to calculate backwards so this way also you have the interpretation of shekel assignment amia then this means that even the even numbers even night it's a possibility that Laila to huddle can be in it unfortunately nowadays people seem to hold on to that Laila to cut that is definitely and surely on 27th worldwide and these are the lazy people yes it might be most of the time 27th meaning out of every 10 times it can be 6 27th because a lot of the companion said that it is on the 27th however this is not a must in Saudi Arabia we have this habit of people going to the harem and it is fully packed on the twenty-seventh night not less than a million and a half people attend the prayer of taraweeh and tahajjud unfortunately a lot of those who attend they attend only taraweeh the hodgett they don't attend it and they don't know that they have lost the reward the Prophet erased a loss column look how merciful Allah is if we were told to pray the whole night from Asia till fechar the whole nine hours approximately would it be difficult or easy it would be difficult nine hours every day every night you pray for ten days one night it's difficult to make but allah azzawajal gave us a gift the Prophet says Alice lobster he whoever prays with the Imam until he finishes night prayer Allah would give him the reward of a full night so if I pray with my Imam the taraweeh and this usually takes 40 minutes and then I pray tahajjud which probably maximum takes an hour and a half or two hours that's it that's it Allah will give me the whole night as night rare but if I pray with the Imam taraweeh and I leave and I don't comfort to hide Judah don't pray Twitter with him then did I pray the night no I prayed only this much so therefore in Ramadan never pray except in the same message it from the beginning Asia until the Imam makes with it and that's it this is night prayer therefore we should try our best to allocate where this great night is and the safest and the best way is to pray the whole of Ramadan especially the last 10 nights with the Imam until he leaves do you have any question in the remaining time check or what we have seen in the last 10 nights of ramadan people usually they have lectures islamic lectures in the masjid maybe after twelve o'clock one am-2 a.m. so it exceeds till one and a half are to us so how far is it correct and isn't it considered as a Buddha they are having lectures on these nights no it's not considered to be a bitter because lecturing is a good thing teaching people is a good thing now your allegation might be your objection might be that it is a night of prayer so why is he giving a lecture well if you prayed with the Imam for an hour or two and the Imam concluded the prayer with witter your reward is there you have revived late little cutter a lot of the Imams think that this is the only time we can manage to get all of these people in the masjid correct or not and Friday they come but not as often as every single night they come once a week and unfortunately some of the masjid give khutbah and arabic and after the hot bath arabic they give it in their native language what people already leave and go so they don't listen but if it is in the message and in less than nights of ramadan and everybody is eager and later looking forward for anything that revives their hearts they will stay so the Imam says that this is a good idea but having it for an hour and a half this is too much you talk to the people without making them bored to death yani give them half an hour this is maximum yes good maybe an hour yes more than that people will not be listening to you people will be like zombies but they're not listening there daydreaming they're thinking of other things because man has so much capacity and ability to listen for so much more than that he would not be paying attention on larger knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh"
