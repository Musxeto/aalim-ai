  "transcript": "question some schools of thought say that if I perform woodo or I perform a total bath from a bucket and some of the water that I've used fall into the bucket I cannot use the bucket anymore because the water in it has been used again when we go back to the Quran and to the Sunnah we find no reference to what they are saying at all and it is baseless what do you mean by baseless I mean that the water I used there's nothing in the Quran or in the Sunnah says I cannot use it anymore so used water in W or in is totally pure unless one of the three characteristics has changed via or through an impurity if the smell if the color if the taste has not changed by a an impurity urine or feis and the likes in this case it is still pure and I'll give you examples many of us the elders that is may find it difficult to raise their feet to the Basin and wash them in woodo so they have a bucket of water and they simply dip their foot in it and take it out then they dip the other foot in it and take it out is their wo valid according to the Quran and the Sunnah it is valid According to some schools of thought no this is used water it can't be used but as we've stated earlier and we always State bring us your evidences to prove that this water cannot be used and if you fail to do this then we cannot follow what you are saying and Allah Asel Knows Best"
