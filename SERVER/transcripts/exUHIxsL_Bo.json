  "transcript": "this question about building mosques by bricks or blocks I could not understand the question but if I were to think of a reason maybe because someone would say at the time of the Prophet Alice of Salaam they had only mud and they had only the trunk of palm trees and the leaves and the branches nowadays if you build new mosques with blocks and bricks and cement that would be an innovation maybe I'm not sure if this is his point of view and the answer would be no this is not correct you can build the mosque with any material because this is not related to Ramada this is means for worshipping allah azza wajal so having lights having an air-conditioner having microphones having loud skips speakers all of these are not related to the prayer itself meaning that if one of them is not there the prayer is invalid or is not accepted no these are things that are accessories they complete they help but they're not of the essence of their body itself so whether you build a Masjid with wood or with bricks or with blocks made of cement or with play there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah and Allah knows best"
