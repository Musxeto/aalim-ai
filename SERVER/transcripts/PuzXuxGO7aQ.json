  "transcript": "thank you so my question is um there has been a lot of uh of currencies in the West for people born in the Quran and I just want to know that what should be our feelings and if we have to because um I I live in the west I go back and forth from here and I do know a lot of people that do not believe in God that that could do something like this so if we're close to someone or we live around people that wants to do something like this around us what should be our reaction first of all it is a heinous act to disrespect any scriptures of religion because Allah ordered us as Muslims not to insult the idols they worship if that would lead for them to insult Allah himself so it is it is pickable act to do nevertheless how many copies of the Quran do we have millions and hundreds of millions if not billions what happens if we have a damaged copy of the Quran how do we honor it in order to get rid of it we either shred it beyond recognition or burn it so we do we ourselves considered burning the Quran honoring it of course this disbeliever this Cafe is doing it to insult the Quran he's doing it to humiliate the Muslims and provoke them if you listen to what he's doing and start marches and protests and burning shops and attacking the police force you're falling into his trap and you're playing his game and you've achieving his objectives rather turn the table in his head don't do anything just say that this is Despicable this is a heinous act this is a sign of being primitive and uncivilized full stop are we angered by it definitely but there's nothing more islamically you can do a sister from Sweden asked me today about one of the big messages in Sweden and the Imam said that we are calling for a protest in front of an is a a an embassy in Stockholm or whatever to protest and demonstrate against the burning of the Quran this is not permissible outside of the Masjid let alone in addressing the this is not permissible this is unislamic but this is the type of quote unquote Scholars they have in the West who are hand-picked and this is what they teach so you can imagine what would be the result next week when they do this this demonstration few Hooligans would infiltrate the crowds killing a police officer burning a car destroying property and who would be blamed the Muslims in the parliament it would backfire and everybody would call Curb the Advan don't let young women wear the hijab ban the hijab ban the messages don't let them come it has to be supervised no teachings of Islam because of what so-called hot-blooded person came we have to demonstrate we have to do it's an Islamic but they don't know ignorant people were made to be representative Islam to lead the crowds without knowledge and this is our problem in the Muslim world when you go to countries in the subcontinent without naming names you'll find marches in the hundreds of thousands in the Millions protesting over an apostate on uh burning the Quran on this on that masha'allah they are so hot blooded they love Islam what happens in the process the poorest country in the world though it can be one of the richest with their natural resources but the corruption in the government in the parliament in the Ministries in the businessmen in the Islamic leaders they divided the whole nation demonstrations demonstration oppositions demonstration the government Authority demonstration go to the street kill loot do whatever you want we'll justify it but stay asleep don't progress don't evolve don't become a a nation that leads others rather be followers of Tom Dick and Harry so this is problematic hate it denounce it but don't do anything that Islam does not permit on Allah Knows Best"
