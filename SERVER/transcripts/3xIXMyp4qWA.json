  "title": "What increases & decreases our Iman? How to build up our Iman? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question to you is how do you build your iman okay okay what is is something that fluctuates so it goes up as it comes down unlike other sects and cults in islam who do not believe in that so on one extreme we have the khawarij who believe that iman is a total lump sum either you have it all or you lose it all and this is why they say if you make one single major sin like xena like consuming intoxicants like theft this nullifies your iman and you're not a muslim and you are in hell for eternity and this is definitely against the quran and the sunnah on the far extreme to the left we have another opposite sectin cult called al-murjiya and al-murjiya contrary to the khawaris they say no matter what you do you're a full-fledged believer so even if you fornicate even if you uh steal money even if you kill people even if you consume intoxicants and drugs your iman is equivalent to the iman of abu bakr and umar and of course this is preposterous and the quran and the sunnah clearly indicate that this is not the case the middle path is the path of ah those who follow the quran the footsteps of the prophet allah salatu salam with the understanding of the three favorite generations the generation generations of the companions taberine and tabaret taberin what do we believe we believe that iman increases and decreases it increases with good deeds and it decreases with sins and there are so many evidences to back this up i'll give you one example from the quran allah azzawajal says and whenever a surah is revealed there are among the hypocrites those who say which of you has this increased faith as for those who believed it has increased them in faith while they are rejoicing a clear evidence that faith increases and the prophet said allah is is 70 plus branches iman is 70 plus branches the highest is and the lowest is to remove obstacles that harm people from their way this means that iman fluctuates there is a highest and there is the lowest which means that depending on which level you have accomplished and then the companions used to say to his friends and companions come let's sit and increase iman meaning let's engage in the care and studying the quran because this increases our iman and even mr ood used to make dua and he says oh allah increase me in iman and in certainty and in understanding islam and there are so many many evidences i don't want to consume the time to mention them but iman increases and decreases this is an established fact how this is what we will come to investigate a little bit inshaallah as we go on we go on with this interview masha'allah you've already asked the question to yourself even before i asked you so how does it increase and decrease okay so we have to recognize that iman is based on three things it is the belief of the heart and the rhetoric of your tongue and the action of your limbs so these are the three pillars of iman that cannot be established without it the hypocrites say we believe so the rhetoric is there the action is there they go and pray with us but they're lazy the heart is totally against it so they're disbelievers there are people who say i am a great believer of allah i love allah i love muhammad i love the quran okay come with us to pray inshallah he said no i don't pray oof why he said i believe yeah but you have to follow that with walking the talk you have to do actions no this is for you guys for us our belief is sufficient this is not enough we have people like jews and christians and atheists are you muslim he said it's in the heart i will not say okay so how to increase the iman you have to work on these three things your belief how to increase your attachment to allah and there are a number of things among the first and the most important knowing allah can you do something that would get you closer to allah and increase your iman without knowing allah this is impossible i'll give you an example everything on earth if you fear it you run away from it even if you see a lion and you see the teeth of the lion white and shiny you're not going to say oh the the lion is smiling at me let me be kind to animals i'll go and give it a kiss hey what are you doing i can see his thief you feel something you run you fear from snakes scorpions you run except allah azzawajal when you fear him you run to him and not away from him because there is nowhere on earth you can run away from allah where can you hide in the whole universe so you're bound to run to him the more you know allah the more you love him the more you love allah the more you are interested in his generosity and kindness but if you don't know allah azzawajal like some people say i never make dua to allah why and i've heard this hundreds of times when i make dua to allah the opposite happens excuse me he said i said oh allah give me one thousand dollars and i lose a thousand dollars i don't get what i want so i never make dua to allah this is almost blasphemy why because he is thinking negatively of allah thinking that when he asks allah allah does the opposite so he doesn't ask allah are you playing with allah when you ask allah azzawajal oh give me this and he doesn't give it to you do you think allah doesn't give it to you because he is misery he doesn't want to give look around you he's feeding the disbelievers he's giving animals insects birds fish what they need every single day without a count so you think allah is preventing you from a thousand dollars because he's or do you think allah is not giving you because he doesn't have his poor this whole universe is his failing to know allah decreases iman in your heart demolishes it because you don't know allah and this is what allah says and they have not estimated allah and giving him his right appreciation while the whole earth is in his fist and the whole heavens and the universe are in his right hand so you think allah is poor or is it knowing allah his beautiful names his beautiful attributes only draws you closer to allah and this is why the prophet says allah has 99 names 100 minus 1 whoever calculates them will enter jannah what is meant by calculates them scholars says whoever memorizes them understands their meaning when i say osama what does a samad means oh i don't know you read this this is all the only surah you memorize and you don't know what the meaning when we say allah is al-jabbar what does it mean when we say allah al-kafil when we say allah azza if you don't know allah's names how can you love him and if you don't love him how can you expect your iman to boost you know everything about this world where is reynaldo crestino now oh he's in manchester i think i don't know oh where is messi he's in this uh san german where is that oh masha allah you know them all okay tell me about allah sorry i don't know how is it possible things in dunya we know which bring no benefit to us when allah is the whole of the benefit we don't know this is of the heart and this is a glimpse of the iceberg this is the tip of the iceberg there are so many things that increase your iman in your heart but then we go to the tongue what should i do well your tongue should be articulating should be moving in whatever increases your iman such as songs movies no no no no no these annihilate your iman take away your iman then what you have to have zikr diker allah azzawajal and the top of zikr allah is al-quran the best form of zikr you can recite is the quran the most beloved thing to allah is the quran that came out of allah and it shall return to him it's a speech of allah subhanahu wa that allah spoke so when you read the quran when you contemplate upon it and understand the meanings this boosts your iman to the ceiling allah says in the quran indeed those who recite the book of allah and establish prayer and spend in his cause out of what we have provided them secretly and publicly can expect a profit that will never perish profit money in this life profit of all types of tranquility of peace of mind of content and happiness why is everybody around us so stressed so depressed so confused having anxiety attacks going to psychiatrists not knowing what to do because they're far away from kitab allah from the book of allah allah promises you expect a prophet that will never perish in this life and the hereafter and the prophet alaihis tells us that allah says in the authentic uh or other before that this is dealing with actions no it's still about uh rhetoric the prophet said alaihis allah whoever among you is incapable of struggling at night struggling what doing mma wrestling no no no no struggling at night refers to the hatred night prayer i go to bed at 12 o'clock i set the alarm clock at three so that i wake up and pray to hajju every time i put it off and go back to sleep until fajr so i'm struggling to pray night prayer you have to try and you will succeed but if you're struggling the prophet says and he is stingy to spend money in the cause of allah yeah i have money but well i i don't feel good giving it to the poor it it feels that you're snatching something of my heart when you say give one thousand nier to the to the poor i forgive allah will give you ten thousand more so the prophet says if you're struggling with night and you can't pray and you're struggling with paying for charity and you're scared to meet the enemy in jihad i don't want to go to the front lines i'd rather stay and make videos like this i'm a chicken so yeah the what to do if all of these good deeds i'm unable to do the prophet says isam then he should make a lot of vikir if these three things you're unable to do make a lot of thicker remember allah with your tongue the prophet said when he asked him for an advice he said die with your tongue moist with the krilla so you never sit back idle all the time your subhanallah you walk from here to the car you're making the car from the car to the masjid you're making bigger you're shopping you're making vikker and this is what sheikh mehmed used to do when i used to call him on the phone he had two phones we didn't have mobiles or even pagers or even faxes no no fax only telex so he had two phones so he answers the phone and the caller the other line his secretary says yes one second so while you're on hold you're hearing him answering the message no no this is not not good the divorce takes place yes may allah make things easy he hungs up by the time he picks the phone from the secretary you hear him say subhanallah and he answers you and in between he makes this guy was 91 years old blind never gone out and see this the things we know and see yet he was this great by the grace of allah yeah yeah now we are back to positive okay i i hope it's not the electricity no now we are back insha'allah so this is the heart and this is the tongue now the limbs how to increase my iman by limbs oh the prophet said allah the almighty says in the hadith my slave continues to draw nearer to me with voluntary works so that i shall love him when i love him i am his hearing which he hears his seeing with which he sees his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks where he to ask something of me i would surely give it to him and where he to ask me for refuge i would surely grant him it by what by voluntary deeds so i can do monday and thursday fasting today was monday i hope all of you guys were fasting thursdays the white days arafat ashura all of these days are voluntary the more you fast the closer you get to allah you can offer night prayer half an hour one hour reading one two jesus every night nobody knows about you you don't put in your instagram alhamdulillah i just finished one hour of pray night prayer may allah accept and make it sincere what's in syria schmuck you're exposing yourself and good deeds to everybody and you expect allah to reward you people go to umrah alhamdulillah this is my tawaf this is my second tawaf this is my last tawaf i'm going to say what are you doing i'm encouraging people no no you're not encouraging people you can put a hadith to encourage people you are showing off fear allah azzawajal so the deeds we do with our limbs going for hajj giving zakat fasting praying all of these increase your levels of eman and this is why the more you do this the more iman you start to build you"
