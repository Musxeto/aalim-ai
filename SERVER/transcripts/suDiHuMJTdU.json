  "title": "Making up Fasts and Prayers missed due to Negligence - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question for tonight is from a sister she says I am 29 years old and became a practicing Muslim since 2017 I want to make up the missed fasts of Ramadan before I started practicing my question is from what age should I start counting my missed fasts first of all all praise is due to allah azza wajal who guided you back to the straight path and this is a great blessing of allah azza wajal that cannot be evaluated with wealth or money because the blessing of hidayah of guidance is the utmost blessing a person can receive from allah azza wajal secondly forms of worship are usually time-bound so allah as origin has designated a specific time if you do not perform this form of worship at that specific time then scholars have disputed whether to make them up or you cannot make them up in no salata can a trial mini- and motive early prayer was designated upon the believers on specific times so if a person knows that federer prayer begins when the dawn breaks and it continues until the Sun begins to rise the moment the tip of the Sun rises or is up in this case the time of fajar is gone if a person does not pray deliberately at that designated time and he wants to make it up after sunrise the most authentic opinion is that it cannot be made up he cannot pray it and if he does it won't be accepted from him likewise people perform Hajj and we all know that on the ninth of the month of the Haeju the 12th month of the lunar or Islamic or Hitler calendar on the 9th of that month all Muslims should be in the vicinity of Arafat if a person comes four or five days later and he was held at the customs or the immigration Authority and was not allowed to proceed until four or five days later can he go and say that I'm making up for my Hajj the answer is no because this ritual is designated to specific time and the most authentic opinion of scholars there is a dispute but the most authentic opinion is that Ramadan is the same thing so if a person skips a day of Ramadan does not fast for no legitimate reason tonight I know that tomorrow is the fifth of Ramadan I have to fast but I intend not to fast and I go to bed intending not too fast and I woke up in the morning leading my normal life without fasting after Ramadan is over I feel remorse I'd like to make up for the missed day the most authentic opinion is that you cannot make up for that day now this is different for someone who has a legitimate reason such as the sister if she missed seven days due to her monthly menses whether she intended to fast or not she has to make up for these seven days now she's repented and she's 29 so if we assume that she reached the age of puberty when she was 12 11 13 depending she should do the math and she should calculate an estimate that okay her menses is seven days on average if she says no my normal menses is five days in this case we say count from the age of 13 until 27 that is 14 years and in every year there's one Ramadan so seven days in 13 it is 91 days this is what you have to make up for your menses now let's look at the other days of Ramadan the other 22 or 23 days did you fast them if she said no I was ignorant I was lazy I never intended to fast in this case we say there is nothing for you to do just make up for the missed days due to menses if she said well I used to fast half of the day and then feel thirsty drink eat and no one knows about this we say these days that you intentionally broke while you were fasting you have to make them up because once you start in a form of robada and you break it it becomes a debt you have to pay it unlike if you did not intend to fast from the very beginning and you didn't fast this is something you cannot make up so I hope this answers your question with a"
