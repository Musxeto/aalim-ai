  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim (17) Dua in Sujood (Prostration) that Prophet ﷺ‎ used to say Assim Al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign rising from rokur and saying the vikkar the prophet alaihis islam used to fall in prayer to the position of sujud so while prostrating what was his dua he used to say subhana rabbi allah glorify be my lord the most high and why does he say the most high and not the great or al-alim as in rukur scholars say that this was suitable because when you go to prostration the highest thing in your body which is your head is at the lowest place possible which is the ground and you don't glorify allah azza except by explaining and describing him with his beautiful attribute of height allah is over his throne above everything there's nothing in this universe that is above allah so allah is above his throne and his throne is above the seventh heaven of paradise now also allah is above all in status so allah is exempted from anything that discredit him or may indicate any flaws or imperfection in him and he's also above everything in power nothing overpowers allah all of this kind of is only for allah the almighty azzawajal also the prophet used to sallallahu alaihiru islam say the same dua as we've mentioned earlier in rukur glorify be to you o my lord and praise be to you i uh oh allah forgive me also he used to say the same dua in sujud as well as in ruku s perfect and holy he is lord of the angels and of the rooh that is jibril perfect or purified and venerated uh as wajal the lord of the angels and of jibril one of the duas that the prophet used to say in his sujud is this beautiful dua [Music] unto you i have prostrated and in you i have believed and unto you i have submitted this is similar to the rokur in the beginning then he goes on to say my face has prostrated before he who created it so i'm confessing that allah is the creator and fashioned it fashioned it mean meaning that it he gave it the way it looks and brought forth its faculties of hearing and seeing allah is the one who gave me these hearing and seeing these senses blessed is allah the best of the creators what do you mean the best of creators are there any other creators than allah linguistically yes anyone who creates anything is considered to be a creator then how is it possible this is the name of allah these are three names that were mentioned in surat al-hashr so they are very similar in the meaning some scholars say the difference is khalik is the one who draws and strategizes and designs while al-bari is the one who executes and produces and al-musawa is the one who gives the shape and the way it looks the height and the wealth etc everyone can be yet not to create from nothing i am a creator i can create a table from a pile of woods by sewing it cutting it nailing it fixing it i am a creator of this kitchen table but i did not create it from nothing from vacuum i had to have the raw material i have to have a prior sample so that i can build something accordingly while allah's creation is from nothing allah created the whole universe out of nothing subhanallah no one can create anything out of vacuum no way you need raw material allah azza created everything including the raw material out of nothing out of vacuum and allah did not create things according to a prior sample subhanallah so there is a difference though the name tag may be the same and also uh the prophet used to say in his uh sujud the same dua that we've mentioned earlier [Music] how perfect he is the possessor of total power sovereignty magnificence and grinder and this indicates that all of these duas you try to vary in your sujud so you could have a feeling of belonging of submissiveness of expressing your poverty to allah the all mighty this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave foreign [Music] foreign"
