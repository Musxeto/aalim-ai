  "transcript": "so sheikh my question is is it not recommended to talk while eating and is there any instruction in the hadith in this regard jazakallah kharan sheikh wajazak i do not know of any restriction or disliking or not recommending to speak while eating there is nothing wrong in that on the contrary we have an authentic hadith when the prophet alaihis salaam addressed may allah be pleased with him who was the son of um who was eating with the prophet isaiah as a child and he was eating from everywhere and the prophet addressed him while eating by saying oh young boy what could be a meaning eat with your right hand what could be from right what is in front of you so this teaching while eating means that there's no prohibition or even disliking to speak while eating alhamdulillah and allah knows best"
