  "transcript": "you are listening to an association production keep up to date and get involved with the latest events dawa opportunities and much more follow us on Twitter and don't forget to like us on facebook/ you're onstop non-stop source for pure and authentic knowledge indeed it's an honor for me to come in to this beautiful piece of land that seems to me like it's part of Jenna but Jenna is nothing compared or similar to this beautiful land of Scotland it's the first time for me to set foot in it I hope it's not the last and it's an honor for me to speak to you over or on two topics our topic today and I'll try to make it as short as possible because it is quite long and it's quite informative and it touches Our Lives greatly but it's historical more or less yet it is extremely authentic because this history does not come from history books that that men wrote it comes from the last Testament it comes from the greatest book on Earth and as Muslims we challenge this and we are up to the challenge we challenge All Nations provide for me a book that is preserved as it was revealed and they can't provide to me a book that the people worshiping the their lord still speak the language and they can't every Arab in the Arab world if you quote to him a verse of the Quran he understands it he doesn't need an interpreter to understand it when you look at the Miracles that all prophets and messengers of Allah were given no one can prove that they existed only the Muslims believe that they all existed because it's in our book but can any ination any religion say our Messengers miracle was this and show it to us no they haven't seen it yet we have the ultimate Miracle of all miracles and that is the Quran the prophet Alam was given a lot of Miracles none of them exist today but we believe that heel had the moon split for him we believe that the water sprung from his fingers we believe that the Rocks the trees used to Greed him and used to talk to him sallallahu alaihi wasallam peace be upon him yet we don't have any proof except what we read in the Quran and in the Sunnah however Allah did not leave us alone Allah gave us a book that we can challenge the whole of humanity that this is the religion of Allah and we're proud to be part of this huge and beautiful Nation the nation that submits it will to the creator of the heavens and of Earth not to human beings not to man-made laws but to the laws of Allah now if you go through the Quran which I know that a lot of you have done that you will be amazed by its beauty our Prophet sallallahu alai wasallam tells us that there's a Surah that is equivalent to 13 of the Quran do you know the Surah why is it one3 of the Quran Scholars say because the Quran is divided into into three sections one the beautiful names and attributes of Allah without knowing your lord without knowing his description without knowing who you are worshiping you are Hollow from the inside you have nothing to show for so you have to learn Allah's beautiful names and attributes and this is a subject by its own the second half or the second third that is is what we call as or or the legislation the dos and don'ts so onethird of the Quran is governing Our Lives what to do and what not to do things related to prayers things related to fasting things related to marriage social aspects economical political it's all there one third of the Quran talks about that and the last third talks about those who do well in this life and how we call people to be partners with us and what is the conclusion and that is the description of Jenna of paradise and also it talks about those who did not respond to their Messengers and Prophets those who rejected them and what happened to them in this life and their conclusion and their end on the day of judgment that is Hell Fire so as Muslims this is what we believe in simple terms and that is why when we go through the Quran one important third of it speaks about the prophets The Messengers their call to their people those who responded and those who were arrogant and rejected and what happened to them and what is the final destination whether Hell or Heaven and this is our topic how much did that take 10 minutes okay so why does Allah tell us about the parished Nations why does Allah tell us about the Nations before us that we're there we're filling the whole world and now it's only a memory why Allah is telling us about them first of all so that we could learn the lesson and the smartest person is who is the one who learns from others instead of being an example people learn from him it's always nice to see someone doing a mistake and say to myself I'm not going to do that rather than me making the mistakes and people saying we're not going to do that so Allah is telling us about these nations so that we can learn our lesson Allah is telling us what he had done with these nations to show us to manifest to us his power his strength his might we are so indulg in everyday life we neglect to ponder on Allah's greatness and strength and power we think that this or that this nation or that that president or that is far superior far stronger we can't have anything done without his approval or his permission and we neglect that Allah is the Supreme subhana wa tala Allah is the owner he's the king he's the wealthy the rich the power the mighty The Sovereign sub so when we look into these perished Nations we can have an estimation close but not very good one to Allah's wrath and power from going through their stories we learn that whenever you are an arrogant person or a nation Allah will humiliate you and whatever goes up must come down don't ever think of yourself highly and believe that you are a strong person or a strong Nation or that you can do whatever you wish Allah Asel is giving you a chance to go back and repent but if you don't Allah will inate you Allah will destroy you maybe it's not that happen this day or this month or this year Allah is not in a rush Allah is the most merciful who's giving you time to reflect who's giving you time to repent but if you don't you got to see what happened to those who did not Victory is not from our own selves Victory comes only from the one who owns Victory who has Victory who can give Victory so when you read these stories of the fal prophets and Messengers they've went through so much they've been accused of sorcery they've been accused of being mad they've being been accused of lying of dealing with uh a Jin they were slandered they were accused of so many things and now we have to know that this is the path that we must walk this is the path that we must take in order for our message to reach the people and whatever happens to us it happened to The Messengers who are the best of creates of Allah before us so we are not something new from these stories we know that Allah and this is a question that a lot of the people ask why is it so severe that they've been punished that they've been tormented with such severe punishment well before I do excuse me I have to say this some of the brothers and sisters are drinking with their left hand in Islam is this permissible no do you have any doubt why did the Lord create two hands I'm not going to go into this I can answer you but at the moment yeah a reminder as a brother to a brother yeah try to use your right hand whenever you drink and uh uh eat what if I smoke you're not allowed to smoke anyhow let's go this is serious don't joke so what are the types of punishments that Allah mentioned in the Quran to us over these perish Nations I'm going to go through them but for you to know the punishment I'm not going to relate it to the nation just going to mention the punishment and then inshallah we will mention the Nations one drowning so we know that floods and drowning is a part or a form of Allah's wrath and Punishment to the wind and one nation was tormented with this as we will know inshallah and it was described in the Quran in horrific names and all of these names give you the impression that this wind is not fruitful does not carry anything good it is cold it is furious it is so strong that it destroys anything on its way Allah also tormented and punished Nations by what is known as a the aul cry and sometimes we're startled by someone shouting next to us this is on a scale of one to a million is nothing because that awful cry was so devastating that it almost ripped the heart of away from the chests awful cry there was also the trembling and the quake and a lot of nations were punished by that and not necessarily punished by one form of punishment they could have have two or three at the same time and this trembling and shaking and and and the Quakes you can imagine what you see in other countries who are struck by earthquakes and the fear that fills the hearts when you watch it on your TV screens when you see everything is shaking and trembling what can you do if it's something you can fight you can defend okay but this is something no one can ever claim and say Yes gentlemen we have the technology we can make him faster we can make it stronger we can make him better you can't an earthquake is an earthquake it's it's there all you have to say declare your Islam if you not you going to Paradise among the things that Allah punished people with a thunderbolt that had fire that had AOW noise a loud bang accompanying it and it's nothing compared to the Thunder that we see or hear Nations other nations were punished by turning their Villages upside down and this is the doing of Archangel jel with the tip of Wing he picked it to way far in on in the skies and flopped it and they all went down among the other punishment there is the punishment of the and means the cloud and these people uh um that were punished by this they first of all were struck by famine drought heat no water would Avail them they would feel as if their souls were getting out they left the village looking for salvation they found this huge Cloud they went under it it was cold it was cloudy it's nice they called their people in the minute they gathered in Allah threw his wrath from that cloud upon them with fire with Thunders with all that you can uh uh imagine also a part of the punishment mentioned in the Quran I'm not going to go to the details because if we just read the the AY this would consume the time but you should go and and read them inall and you will ponder upon them swallowing of the earth so earthquakes is different but there are nations and there are people that while walking all of a sudden the Earth swallowed them and they are no longer on it and finally transformation and Transformers has nothing to do with this transformation is being transformed into the shape of an ape or a monkey or a pig swine and this is a punishment so and and and when we say it's a punishment I don't want anyone to go to the zoo and say Hey cuz what's happening one think that oh this is why we don't eat pork because originally they were a parish nation and we love monkeys because we have this Bond it's in the jeans no it's not whenever a nation the prophet tell us is transformed that is into monkeys or to apes or to swine they would not have any progeny they would not have any Offspring it is limited to them once they die it's over so it's a diff it's not the same species that some of the brothers May uh think so who are these Parish Nations and Personnel how many do you think are mentioned in the Quran take a wild guess take a guess without huh two 10 give a take seven okay I'm not going to waste enough more time on this there are 14 Parish Nations and personnel and I'm going to not to talk only about uh uh Nations I'm also going to talk about individuals so the first and to come on the list TimeWise are the people of n the people of the messenger Noah and between him and Adam how many how long guys you don't know your Quran is it mention the Quran no from what you you know you don't know the sunah is it mentioned theah no is it where where is it mentioned it's mentioned by AB may Allah be pleased with him he told us that and he did not bring this from his own pocket definitely he heard it from the prophet but he does not relate it to the prophet he says that between Adam and no there were 10 centuries and Scholars say that the century is not the 100 year we know why because in thei of the Prophet The Best of centuries is my century and then the century of those following me and then the century of those following them is it meant 100 years Scholars say no it's meant to be a generation so new for example he kept on calling his people for 950 years and this is not what this was not his life this was not his age this is the period that he spent working calling his people to Islam and we know that for 950 years none of them accepted his call so this is a lesson for the DU for those who call others to Islam he said I'm not going to call this person to to Islam why I I spoke to him for a couple of minutes and he Define yeah this guy spent 900 150 years never give up unless you're doing it for yourself then I'll tell you give up but if you're doing it doing it for Allah if you're doing it for his sake I'm calling him for his sake in I'm going to Paradise I'm going to Paradise I don't care about him and I want him to be with me I want all of them to be with me in Paradise so do it for Allah like did it 950 years calling them for for Islam and they did not respond except a handful what what did he call them to give me 10% of your money elect me vote for me as an MP did he ask him for this the only thing he asked him for was to believe in the Oneness of Allah every single human being on Earth believes this but sometimes it is covered their hearts are covered they are so overwhelmed by the people around them they don't no put them in a Calamity put them in a lifethreatening situation and look what they do immediately seriously I don't know what's your name but the non Muslims huh why because it's natural it's built in they're programmed to believe that there's only one God worthy of being worshiped as Muslims we call him Allah and it's the easiest and the most beautiful word that comes out of your mouth say it try it Allah it relieves you from all depression I'm not going to go through that you have to consult your shink anyhow he kept on calling them to Islam calling them to worship Allah alone but they were arrogant they were defiant and Allah says in the Quran and persisted in their refusal and magnify themselves in Pride so after 950 years no one would say that you should have waited a little so he supplicated to Allah he called Allah this is not working so Allah says in the Quran then he that is invoked his Lord saying I have been overcome so helpy Allah says so we open the gates of heaven with water pouring forth and we caused the Earth to gush forth with springs so the Waters of the heavens and the Earth met for a matter predestined this is something that was done and Scholars differ was the flood specifically to the people of no or was it for the whole of the Earth the most authentic opinion the most correct opinion is that it is for the whole of the world and that is why and if you analyze it you to find out why all the perished Nations before they were punished Allah ordered the messengers to take the Believers where let me rephrase all the perished Nations when their Messengers and Prophets gave up before punishment Allah ordered the messengers to take their people out in the case of no if it the flood was only for that area Allah would have asked him to leave that place but he asked him to build the ark not only that he told him to put the people and to put all the species around because nothing was going to survive and that is why Allah said in the Quran and his progeny them we made for survivors only the progy of no and the rest of the world was covered with water the second Nation the nation of and this nation was known to the Arabs because it was in the Arabian Peninsula they they came after n immediately they were characterized by being huge and bulky you know when you say something this guy is muscular he's 6'4 this is nothing 64 M this is nothing they were really huge and they were like Giants and they lived in the South area of Arabia South to the south of the desert their prophet's name wasad guys this is in the Quran you don't know who the messenger was it was H his name was H and they also worshiped other than Allah so all of the messengers message was worship only one God submit your will to him and he will take care of you they were extremely well in engineering and in building and Allah says in the Quran as for they were arrogant in the land without right when you that big and strong when you're that intellectual you think that you're sophisticated so you become arrogant and you don't accept anything to associate you with Allah what were they punished with with the vicious and uh uh the Furious violent wind for how long for seven nights and 8 days nonstop it ripped them apart it destroyed everything that live on their Villages number three the people of samud and their was and their Prophet was everybody's googling now who's their their was and these people today we can still see their remains their houses where they lived in s where I live about 800 km to the north of J of Mecca they have these huge mountains being carved being engraved being made up to look like palaces and if you try to do this with a jackhammer with all the sophistication we have today you won't be able to do even 1% of that but Subhan Allah they had these means I'm not going to go into how they did this because this is not our topic however by their houses we can know how strong and mighty they were and they were make prosperous everything around them was green they had food they had water they had everything that a man needs will you Allah says to them will you be left secure in that which you have here in gardens and springs and greens crops and Fields and dat palms and you carve houses out of the mountains with great skill is telling them as Allah tells us do you think that Allah will leave you like this Allah gives you something subhanahu waala and he gives you tons and tons of what you deserve and he requests and he demands and he instructs you to do one thing to submit your will to him he doesn't tell you don't do this don't do that kill yourself put yourself and so a confinement he tells you enjoy life do whatever you want to do but these things stay away from them yet the people are arrogant the people are ungrateful no I want this as well you have 100 brands of food that you can eat nope I want to eat this one which you say this is all no this is what I want this is human nature what did Allah do to them he sent them his messenger they did not believe in him they did not want to follow him he said what do you want said prove that Allah exists how do you want me to prove this said see that big rock we want a camle that comes out of it and we can drink milk the whole village and Allah made it happen and they saw this huge creature camel and Allah gave them condition you drink one day as a village the second day you do not approach the wells and the riversides or whatever this is completely for limited for that Camel so one day for you one day for the camel but you have the milk that you want for the entire year and yet they were still defined they didn't believe not only that they took the extra mile they said let's kill that Camel kill it it just K who I wish someone said something okay then I will show you my workout Give Me A Sign next time so they did not only disbelieve they added something extra they killed that sign it's a miracle and nine of them went and collaborated only one did the killing the slaughtering Allah punished the whole village because they collaborated with him they agreed to what he was doing and they did not believe in Allah and their torment was that Allah s sent them the Quake earthquake plus the awful cry plus the Thunderbolt so they were devastated they was they were annihilated by all of these three combined because it was the greatest sign that anyone could see it's V it's visible you can touch it you can drink it but yet they still kept on ignoring Allah's signs the fourth Nation are the nation of L the people who lived at the time of prophet L they lived between Jordan and Palestine they were five Villages and some uh uh Scholars say that their land is under what is known today as the Dead Sea look was one of those who believed in ibraim peace be upon Him prophet of Abraham he lived with him some say he was his nephew so he lived close by and the people knew about the message of ibraim and that is standing and depending on monism yet they did not believe him not only that they added to their blasphemy they added to associating others with Allah a horrendous sin Allah says in the Quran and this is history this is not my interpretation this is the Quran any person reading the Quran would understand this it's in Arabic even the interpretation it's in English or in your native language it states the same this is not something people make up it's found in the Old Testament it's found in the Bible it's found everywhere so what does Allah tell us Allah says and remember Prophet L when he said to his people do you commit the worst sin such as none preceding you has committed in the whole world verily you practice your lusts on men instead of women n but you are a people of transgression Beyond bounds this is what's in black and white and there are other verses and the hadiths are overwhelming what happened they did not believe in R so the whole entire Village did not believe in him the only Believers were his family and not all of his family his wife was among her people and could not and did not believe in him so Allah destroyed that Village by a destruction Second To None Allah destroyed them with the awful shout or awful cry and their Village was ascended to the heavens and then turned upside down and while it was going hail of uh stones and rocks was hitting each and every one of them until they landed and it was definitely not a safe landing what was the reason behind that they abhor anyone who was pure and clean again I'm quoting the Quran Allah says in the Quran and the answer of his people was only that they said drive them that is L and his family drive them out of your town these are indeed men who want to be pure is this an accusation if someone tells me you're a bad man because you want to be pure thank you thank you then comes the people I can't then you have the people of Medan and if I have five minutes their Prophet was very good and they were close by to the people of lot TimeWise and placewise and also they have another name so their name is in the Quran it's they always called as so when you read you know they're the same people the people is the the trees that are so connected this means that it's it's a fertile land so they have these two names Allah their their said was they were not fair when they did their selling and buying so when they weighed someone someone instead of weighing him um a kilogram they would put 950 but when they bought something from someone they added a p another 50 gr to the to the kilo so this is what they used to do plus they're associating others with Allah and they were punished by the awful Cry by the quake and by the cloud the people of pharaoh you know though the story those who don't know it ask those who know it no it's not like this their their Prophet was M please be upon him one of the great five messengers of Allah and they refused to believe and follow pH Pharaoh was the worst of all the people because he did not only associate others with Allah he said to the people worship me and there was of course you know the story of the drowning that is one of the reasons we fast the day of the sisters always know they're all knowledgeable that is why when you get married get married to a knowledgeable sister she teaches you that's why we we I I wanted to say that's why we marry on ash sorry that's why we fast the day of Ash then we have and he's the only individual to be mentioned in the Quran and to be punished the rest were all nations and Villages and people is the only one and he was the cousin of Musa and he was so filthy rich for Forbes is kids play to him and he was arrogant and he thought that all of this was his own doing he did not believe in Allah and Allah had the Earth swallow him this is number how how much seven okay because we don't have time I can see don't say your uh there are those who refuse to go with MSA to Jerusalem and they said let no you go and your lord and fight there there are people who are so strong and powerful we don't have the ability to fight them you and your lord go and fight so Allah punished them we were not told by what punishment they were were they were tormented some say it was by the plague but they were punished as mentioned in the Quran they were the people of the Sabbath and they're not related to Black Sabbath they are related only those who are 60 years of age would know this um the people of the Sabbath are those who Allah instructed them they were villag on the waterfront ocean River and Allah instructed them not to work on the sa on the Sabbath and the whales would come you know jumping on the Sabbath and the rest of the week they would not be able to catch any so they defi uh Allah's instruction and they went to fish on the Sabbath and Allah punished them by transforming them into monkeys the number nine number 10 it's the people that Allah described as the secure Village and when I look at my country I say it is a secure Village when I look at your country and your towns and your beautiful style of of of living I say that this is a secure Village look what and listen to what Allah says and Allah puts forward the example of a Township that DWS secure and well content its Provisions coming to it in abundance from every place but its people denied the favors of Allah so Allah made it taste the extreme of hunger and fear because of that which they used to do and verely they had come unto them a messenger from among themselves but they denied him so the torment overtook them while they were among the wrongdoers may Allah prevent us from being like them then we have mentioned twice in the Quran the the people of the village it's another village where Allah sent two Messengers and they did not believe them Allah sent them a third and then they were still defiant so Allah punished them with the awful cry and the do can I as if I'm going to stop we don't have a lot of information it's mentioned in the Quran the prophet tells us in the islim that was a Muslim but he was not a messenger he was not a prophet and Allah tormented them because they did not follow follow their Prophet or the prophets that were before them and finally what is that feel is an elephant and we have a short Surah in the Quran that every Muslim recites by heart I pray to God that they do I'm not going to test you guys so what is this this is the last punishment that took place over a nation when the rulers of Yemen were at Ed by an act of an individual and this individual was not a Muslim but because they built a big Shrine of worship in Yemen and people instead of going to Mecca instead of going to the Kaa to worship Allah they went there one angry Arab started to think bad thoughts and he went there at night and he pooped in the middle of the building so the ruler of is a horrendous act in Islam in own religions this is not permissible for you to do something to the other uh uh uh shrines of worship you should respect them you don't believe their religion respect them so the ruler came with his elephants and with his soldiers to destroy the Kaa the people of Kaa left meca they left the surrounding we're not staying here what are you doing said this is not our house this is the house of Allah he should protect it and then left and as the Army was approaching the elephant refused to move on at the outskirts of Mecca and all of a sudden the the sky was blackened but was blocked the the sun no one can see it by the number of birds that had three stones one in its beak the be or beak depends if Arab anyhow this thing that comes in front and and two in its legs and it was like rockets throwing it on the Army and it killed the whole thing and Allah mentioned this in the Quan and it's a beautiful Surah you can go through it and I'm afraid we I have some more but no okay now we the lesson to be learned one read the Quran if you're a Muslim it's a duty if you're a non-muslim just for the sake of it read it you're not going to lose anything maybe Muslim so what aren you a man be a man or if you're a sister be a lady read the Quran and know where we're coming from and then you would be able to judge us correctly second of all as Muslims we have to take our lessons from these perished Nations and we have to feel humble we have to be submissive to Allah that he would not treat us like this because we are sinful and we have lots of shortcomings"
