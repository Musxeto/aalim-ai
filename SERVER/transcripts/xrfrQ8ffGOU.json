  "transcript": "I know that perfume is not allowed when a person is in the state ofam but is it also applicable on our everyday scented shampoo and soaps no it is not applicable because the person in when he uses scented uh uh soaps and shampoo is he doing so to perfume himself or to to clean himself so if I'm going to attend a wedding or a party do I wash my hands with soap so that when people shake hands with me would smell a good smell no I would put perfume this scented perfume is the one that is prohibited in the state ofam other than that if it's not for the scent rather it's for purification and cleaning of everyday life there is no problem inshallah in it and if you avoid it just to be safe that would be better and Allah Asel Knows Best"
