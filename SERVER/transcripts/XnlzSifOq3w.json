  "transcript": "sometimes I eat with other people and they ask me to pass a spoon or a glass of water since I eat with my hand my right hand is usually greasy if I use this greasy hand to give it to them they may feel offended so what should I do in this case the prophet saidat when you eat eat with your right hand when you drink drink with your right hand when you give give with your right hand when you receive receive with your right hand because the devil Satan eats and drinks and gives and takes with his left hand so either you tell them that my hand is greasy if I do this I'm going to do it with my right hand or you do it with your left hand and say may Allah forgive me but this is the only clean hand I have and due to necessity this might be acceptable inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
