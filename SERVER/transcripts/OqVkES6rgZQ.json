  "transcript": "foreign vicar that the prophet saw used to invoke allah azza with in the position of sujud he used to say allah forgive me all of my sins the small and the great the first and the last and the scene and the hidden of them and remember the prophet susam has been already forgiven for all of his past and coming sins yet it's a form of worship to ask allah for forgiveness he did not simply receive a carte blanche and said why would i pray like so many of us the more allah gives him the more he increases in showing his gratitude in asking allah for forgiveness while the more allah gives us the more sinful we become so allah blesses us for ramra for hajj do we rectify our affairs afterwards nope what do we do come on man i have balance i can sin i can watch few movies listen to some music neglect few prayers do few sins here and there i have credit this is not the way you deal with allah azza rather you express your gratitude through worshiping allah more and more and more and the following hadith also highlights this fact the prophet used to say so i take refuge within your pleasure from your and within your pardon from your punishment and i take refuge in you from you i cannot enumerate your praise you are as you have praised yourself what a beautiful dua but what's the background of this dua mother aisha says may allah please with her i woke up in the middle of the night and i touched the prophet wasn't there next to me so it was dark so i started touching and i touched his feet combined together while the prophet was in the position of the sujud and he was saying this beautiful dua acknowledging who allah is when you say that i seek refuge in you from you how could that be everything on earth when you fear it you run away from it when you see a lion coming with his teeth showing up nobody says whoa the lion is smiling let us give it a hug run when you see scorpions or alligators close by run everything you fear from you run away from except allah when you fear allah you run to him because there is no escape other than that you seek refuge from allah in allah you run to allah when you're afraid of him asking him for forgiveness and allah would never turn you back empty-handed this is how we deal with allah azzawajal this is how the prophet used to invoke allah in sujud and this by the way indicates the majority of scholars opinion when they say that touching the opposite gender does not nullify your wudu mother aisha touched the feet of the prophet this did not impact his will and he continued to pray i finished my prostration what should i do sit and this position of sitting between the two prostrations is there anything i should do or say yes the prophet allah used to say fairly my lord forgive me my lord forgive me one is the minimum and you can add to that as much as you want and anything else yes the prophet used to say this the following dua between the two prostrations forgive me have mercy upon me guide me enrich me give me health grant me sustenance and raise my rank all of this incorporates all what you need in this life and the hereafter forgive me have mercy upon me guide me all of this is asking allah azzawajal to what benefits you in the hereafter and then says mend my affairs and grant me health sustenance and raise my rank all of this in this dunya i need this without it i can't go on i can't live this is how we worship allah azzawajal this is how a proper muslim worships allah 24 7 it's not going to the masjid on friday and that's it it's not going to church on sunday and then the rest of the week we don't know anything about our religion and how to deal with others it is a full package it's a package deal you take it all or leave it all and this is the beauty of islam this is why all non-muslims come to islam in the hundreds of thousands and in the millions what brings him to it this connection between the servant and his lord no mediators there's no one in between and this is why other religions when they look into how the muslims pray to their lord glorifying him not anyone else he has no associates no one can come and say listen hey listen allah has an associate he has a son and this son of his created mars or venus nobody ever claimed that everybody knows that it's only him who is the creator of the heavens and the earth and what's between them this is why we devote all of our worship and all of our love all of our rebada all of our gratitude and submissiveness to him alone this is all the time we have until we meet next time i live without oh foreign you"
