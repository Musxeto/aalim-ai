  "transcript": "don't solve it do not throw it dip it and then flow it if I speak to people like this Lewis a yr you're crazy and your religion is crazy I will not accept this even if I tell them come on brothers and sisters look these are researchers made by Christians and Harvard lower Harvard Medical School and so unreal and so on all proved by Christians that this is authentic that the fly has the medicine in one wing and by dipping it the community annihilates everything that is bad all rights from America okay okay but before when I said sorry everybody hurry so does this mean I cannot accept anything without the authentication of the White House I'm asleep I believe whatever is in the Quran and in the sooner I don't need people to prove this to me medically because I'm a Muslim otherwise my islam is doubtful therefore you have to understand how to approach people how to address them and give them the proper Dawa and along the common themes that it exposes the plots of the hypocrites subhanAllah the hypnotist need a whole workshop because they are so many characteristics mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah we fail to realize and we have a lot of them in us this is very serious that we think that we are marshall law students of another practicing muslims and when you come to the signs of hypocrisy you'll find a lot in US which means that we are in great danger the prophets is earnest as a power bar one man could nathie yamuna hipon hispanica hope characteristics whoever has them he is purely one up a purely hypocrite then whoever has one of them he has a sign of hypocrisy ever had that occur up if he speaks he lies in the word Allah he breaks his promise he was awesome of a job this no no not for a in a handsome Peter when he disputes he goes to the ceiling how to handle mine all of your talks and rhetoric well either hahaha and when he gives his allegiance when he gives his oath he doesn't keep this and so many other characteristics mentioned for there are five or six and different hadith of the Prophet with her Tamina one once he is interested with something he would betray among the characteristics skipping figure how among us can say below hamdillah for the past month for from the beginning of ramadan i have not missed budget prayer in the machine don't raise your hand but you ask yourself if all of you and this is what's supposed to be there hamdillah now I'm not asking you to say or clarify or justify don't sit sure but I live away from the message here I have work at don't give excuses I'm not to judge um I will ask you and Allah will hold you accountable for your deeds so at the end of the day when I go to my bed masha'Allah a good student of knowledge I Amash a line or the karana it's into this workshop i will go to paradise maybe before the Prophet I still profit me this this shows you how bad we are here in Manila have mercy melody pleased with him and also this is reported to a horrible signal of mercy no soul he says that the hypocrite sees his sins as a fly that stood on his nose i said hello Cisco so it's nothing while the workmen sees this sense as if he is under under under the bottom of a mountain that is about to fall on him what will you do he's frightened it where will you go the mountain is so big no matter how how you run its gonna squash you so this is a movement if you feel your sense and you hope that Allah will accept your deeds then you're a movement but if you are sure that your deeds are accepted in your sensory it's all gone I know Allah it's a mirror well I don't know very well then this is a sign of hypocrisy so to have a workshop on the size of hypocrisy is very important Allah made a whole surah with the name to return one of your food and if you recite the surah al-baqarah you will find the first three is or four is on the believers one or two is on the kuffar and the rest punta muna seafood and they did not they were not present in makkah because Muslims would be why should they be hypocrites to read a Muslim Arab Muslim when the port matilda medina it became different now he has the power he has the wealth he has the army so they started to show up there I believe that this is all the time inshallah we have a break can be touched on my shelf without boo boo if no then how come it's possible to do such that without you do how how possible is to do Sajida without me you can recite it by from your memory right if I pass by Asajj de while reciting from my memory I'm not holding the Quran so i can make sajda but to answer the first question you all you are all students of knowledge we highly respect all schools of thought the school of abu hanifa maliek amma dignity is a sharpie and Muhammad Muhammad Muhammad may allah have mercy on them all they all agree that it is not permissible to touch the Quran without being in the state of Buddha but some scholars said that the allegation behind this is not strongly founded because it isn't a specific hadith clear hadith that states this the prophet alayhi salaatu setup sent in a message to yemen that i am a super and allow power here none except those who are power should touch the Quran but the word for head itself has a number of meanings it can repair to a person who is not on the state of booboo liable Allahu salata hillibip ooh hoo allah allah does not accept your salon without budu so the hair can be opposite to a person who is not in the state of evolution also tire can be opposite to a person who is in a state of major impurity janaba whether it is due to ejaculation sexual intercourse or due to menstruation or possibly a poss delivery bleeding all of this they are considered to be in the state pub impurity major impurity that cannot be removed except with a total bad muscle so this is another meaning of opposite to power also another third and final meaning in contrast to the word power here is the state of this belief has a la mentioned in surah tauba enamel mush Rikuo nuh nuh Jess they are impure which means that the are not in the state of par√° so all of these can be fair to la emisora no helper iono ill no power here and that is why it's not specific it's probable it can be in a can be not and that is why some scholars like if it has them jiggle albani and other scholars say that there isn't a clear indication or evidence that it must be touched with or in the state of purity but again we respect the poor schools of thought and having all agreed upon this gives you an indication that Jonnie there is there is something not right there for you respected to hold that was hot while you are in the state of purity of wood or but if you are not in the state of purity you may still recite from the mishap but do not touch the actual versus you can touch the edges of the paper you can touch the cover but don't put your hand or your fingers on the actual versus or the words or the letters of the Quran so that you will be in the same side so if you recite surah from your memory and you pass by a verse with prostration and you're not under state of google you can prostrate and if you hold this opinion and hold the most hub and not the letters on the words themselves and you are also not in the state of Budo you can do this for nowadays we all most of us have a copy of the Quran in our PDAs I personally don't have a cup of the Quran al is carrying my ipod touch when I have the Quran and I decide masha'Allah wherever i go i finished 23 times the quran i have so much time when waiting for the doctor when going into queue when waiting in the airport you can recite quran do i have to have good on this no this is not the actual for an as this call is say so you don't have to do it but try again to avoid touching the lettuce and the verses and Allah knows best many people use the words of the Quran they do not say they are did to see that moose warning the grave are online and they can help us how do we respond to them so I didn't answer the question many people use the voice in the Quran this is do not say they are dead this is in the markers mothership so these some people use this as in evidence to say that the people in the grave are alive okay so we can approach them for help the prophet Isaiah some is alive in his grave no yes so the pork is yes or no these are life he said I the lives are three stages duniya ahaha and Mirza bursa is the middle way and Mirza is a barrier that's why allah mentions in surah taha baina boomer burzawa liya Brienne between the oceans between the rivers between the two entities of water there is a barrier that this water does not mix with that water it has its own temperature it has all his own characteristics its own animal subhanAllah so battle bursa is the transitional period between this life and hereafter and we that the Prophet is awesome as well as the parties are alive but the way of albenza in the sense that they enjoy and they find breezes from paradise that is not like on the day of judgment but it is similar to it it very little and also those who disbelieve are being punished in their graves has a lot mentioned in surah crapper were way over the hoover circle and now you are all doing a day huh who do one when i see your way omega pupusa acrylic route a shed there either unless talking about ferals and those who followed him they are in their graves they are in this buzzer we see Hellfire every morning and every night it's open and this is the torture this tournament and on the day of judgment make them all go to help so this is not one hundred percent hell it's similar only I gave only a window so we believe that the pocket is alive and it's all of a sudden but he's not alive like us otherwise would've opened his grave and got him out so we believe as well that he does not have any benefit for us and he does not have any harm he cannot prevent any harm from us not even when he was alive the profit Center is awesome yes affiliate a bid that they'll mock pullip the aunt of the Prophet ask me for my money anything goes from my money I give you because I cannot prevent anything from a larger the things that I have you asked but things and I don't have this is between you Allah they are party might have been to Muhammad he's talking to his daughter asked anything from me because I cannot prevent Allah's punishment from you this is something I cannot help you with if this is the case of the Prophet erase errata salam then after his death it's even the same will you go to our wedding and tell him homebody of allah do this for me and do that for me does he hear you this is a question no the Prophet said array salatu salam when the people take the dead person to his grave he hears the slapping of their flip-flops of the sandals as they're leaving so this the dead person here or not I'm asking when the prophet alayhi salatu salam okay in the colitis miro al motel mind that he was made when Phil qubool the prophet alayhi salatu salam after he buried the dignitaries of quraish in the battle of butter after three days he buried them in a well and he said yeah reklama have Mahesh area I'm rogue nation Abu jihad ya heard well no idea yeah shave him never being aha yeah supported know me yup but never yeah so and so and so he mentioned their name we have found what Allah promised us have you found that Allah promised you so who is he talking to no no no he was talking to the dead you're dead and three days stinking that not only that what he did he say is it hey you we can hear you you cannot hear me more than they can which means that they can hear you I'm just teasing you I just want you to work your head so because when someone gives you this use it oh no yeah you right then they can all see that each on each alani oh by the way this is what the allegations people would come so always base your allegation on quran asuna on fact this is start because they will bring you this alonzo just stated that you are able to make those in the grave here and the things that have coated you illustrates that this is general as I mentioned in the today I think early talk with submission that there are general evidences and there are specific this is part of the specific only the dead can hear one the sandals of those leaving the prof Eliza son said when they put the dead person in the grave bury him and leave only that he can hear only the flip-flops before that he was unaware who's washing him who's putting perfume who's wrapping him in the spread and shreds and who's bearing him number two the prophet is La Tercera and said Roma and as you've continued but you did not mention the last verse he said oh ma you do not hear me more than they do but Allah made them here which means that this is only specifically for these character that the Prophet was given this gift Isis on Saturday and finally because the gas is running out the Prophet Elisha lobster on says in one of the hadith known as an whatever hill and there are a number of potawatomi among them is what is known as had eaten how would you know the how the pool where Allah has ocean will make the believers drink from it may Allah sol-gel plant you and I the prevalent privilege of drinking from his hands of Allah Jerusalem in our pie nah Kolkata this is the river that it is endless and it is as white as milk and the cuts that you drink from her as the number of the stars the prophecy that is la cocina in B lofaro cuckoo model how I am the first one to proceed you to come to the house from the first one and then we now see a woman Oh many people from my followers with come to drink and they will be rejected angels will reject him and I would say o Allah how much he only cheap my father was my nation fen Allah and Allah Allah will tell him you and I quote this huh you do not know what they have done after you now the properties in his grave and he's alive and he look sees everything and he is everything he should have no but unlike is indicating you do not know so the prophecies Alice author Sarah so upon serpent him entire body doom and destruction to those who change to anyway after I have gone so this is one of their beliefs is that he does not heed us a lease officer and that is why when people say that whenever you give Salam to the Prophet erase officer he hears you who he does not hear you Allah had appointed an angel to tell him in the day all in the night that show and so give Salam and that is why the grand grand son of the Prophet la salsa ramp zine el-abidine for someone else he saw a man coming to the grave of the prophets a man entering through the window of his great insane a ceremony camaros ooh la la in the man said my brother you had a man in China or in al-andalus are the same should not think that by coming close and you know the closer you get this is all elevations when we give Salam to the Prophet allama salio cinematic here it reaches him even will this chart and this raises to another innovation that a lot of people come instead of facing the Kaabah forgot they face the that the great and give their back to the pillar and they say our prophet of allah who this ship you cannot call anyone except Allah is ever get at the time and I could chew conclude this is another question as becoming a lecture at the time of remodeling her part may allah be pleased with it there was a drought and when muslims have drought they make salaat who is this half the ask allah for rain so Homer came then he said all people at the time of the Prophet Ali thought was set up we used to ask him to ask Allah for brain and now the Prophet is gone we asked a lab busts his uncle because he was the closest to his nephew to pray for us at bascom and supplicate for us a bus came and said people there is no calamity that before some people except with sin and Allah would not lift this calamity except with asking Allah for forgiveness virat so i ask allah for forgiveness and then he said for Allah the people are putting me forward to ask you because of my position from your profit for Allah send the slate clean what's the model of the story the model of the story is very easy a little have Bob did not go to the grave he said Oh profitable la tasca la rosa de Porres to give a saline why because the prophet is dead and he knows that this is not permissible the Companions all know that it is not permissible to call the Prophet Elisha love setup nobody ever did this so those who say we can call the earlier no you cannot if you cannot call the Prophet Alyssa sir you call Tom Dick and Harry who are these what is really do have you seen them you know people talk about them it was reported that two men in Egypt we're walking and they were you know laughing about the people how they have graves in Egypt and Sudan and in these between every three graves there are two and people worship them they're all earlier earlier and they had a donkey the donkey died so he told him let's bury the donkey and weep and whenever someone sees us we say that this was Hawaii of Allah okay and they buried the donkey and they started weeping and building something on it when people came what is this is Willy of Allah so and so he was a righteous person in he died and they started giving sadaqa giving slaughtering putting some candles one of them left and when he came after like a year oh he found his big moss and his friend was worshiping and Corey said what are you doing so this is the winning so and so said we buried him together what is this he was convinced and everybody was convinced so there is nothing in Islam of seeking the guidance the support of earlier this is pure this is what differentiates us from all sects of us now we worship Allah soldier we don't have to go to the cher cher Mawlana I have sinned forgive me this is christian de Oh Father forgive me for I have sinned he says what did you do my son I went and fornicated where son where it was an address son listen number thank you son thank you I'm very grateful me Muslims do not have this our collection with a large though illustrate when I sin i supplicate to Allah in the middle of the night I pray two rak'ahs four rak'ahs sixth circuit I pray and I recite the Quran I remember Allah's forgiveness I remember Allah's law I remember almost mercy"
