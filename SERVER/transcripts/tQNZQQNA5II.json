  "title": "How to soften a sealed heart and get closer to Allah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hammad says how to soften my heart and get closer to Allah this Muhammad requires a lecture it's a great question and it is a question that rarely people ask about allah azza wajal and this is a hadith mentioned in surah Halima Muslim where the Prophet said alehissallaam allah does not look at your bodies and your wealth rather Allah looks at your hearts and your deeds what you do so what Allah looks at what Allah evaluates at the end of the day is what is in your heart and this is something no one knows about except him subhana WA Ta'ala which means that if I were to spend all of my life working out in the gym to build these huge biceps and triceps and have this symmetric body but fail to take care of my heart I'm in great loss and probably I'll end up in hell but if I were to spend my entire life trying to cleanse my heart trying to fill it up with what pleases Allah kindness trust fear of Allah hope in allah azza wajal submissiveness submissiveness to allah purity to all mankind especially to our Muslim brothers and sisters if I were to spend my entire life doing this I would be in the path of allah azzawajal and heading straight to paradise the issue is how to soften my heart because there are so many things that are affecting it so many people attacking so many desires and whims so many thoughts and whispers of shaitaan so how do i soft in my heart there are so many things too soft in your heart among them which is among the famous things are things that we do to others so whenever you do good to others allah azza wajal softens your heart providing that you're sincere and you're doing it for the sake of allah if you take care of the widow's if you take care of the homeless and the refugees if you take care of an orphan Allah would soft in your heart the Prophet said to one of his companions sallallaahu Selim and may Allah be pleased with the companion do you want to attain what you desire and to get your heart softened the companion said yes the Prophet told him go to an orphan and Pat and wipe over his head and this is a gesture and a sign of kindness and being merciful when you see a five year old or a six year old orphan and you do this on their head and you hug them they feel the love and compassion which they miss from their departed father that's why he is or she is an orphan the Prophet said do the solid salatu salam and you will attain what you're looking for and your heart would be softened so doing good to others softens your heart feeding the poor the hungry providing for them softens your heart among the most favorite things to do and this is between you and Allah see doing good to others is between you and people now there are things that are between you and Allah these were definitely soft in your heart such as doing Hajj and Umrah often this cleanses you from sins and increases your provision wealth wise this is a source of income as the Prophet said that is a lot of cinnamon so if you want income you come from rocks it ok share it's too expensive don't worry about expenses Allah would provide for you Allah would give you because it would increase your provision also Allah mentioned in the Quran that if you were to seek Allah's forgiveness Allah would have mercy on over you so seeking forgiveness softens your heart because when Allah has mercy over you your heart is softened so the more you ask Allah for forgiveness during the day and night the more softer your heart will become and if you every one of us must ask himself this question sit with yourself and ask yourself how many times do I seek Allah's forgiveness per day and night today how many times did I say I stopped for Allah or two body and you will find that maybe I said this three or four times when I made a mistake so for example someone said to me ah I thought you said you were not coming and it's always tough for Allah I forgot so I did not say it because I am actually seeking Allah forgiveness rather than to apologize the Prophet says alayhi salatu was-salam my heart is covered and I would seek Allah's forgiveness a hundred times or more than a hundred times the heart is covered by negligence by forgetfulness and in our cases you and I by sins so we have to keep on asking Allah forgiveness so it would become soft again not only that even though I am the great scholar of Islam ask his mentor his Sheikh Abdul taymiyah may Allah have mercy on their souls and he said Oh Shia tell me which is best to glorify Allah by saying subhanAllah will be Hamdi or to seek Allah's forgiveness by saying Estela fear Allah so even Tamiya gave him an example that can be remembered and understood so he said to him when the garment is clean putting perfume on it would be the best thing to do if my garment is clean its white it has no spots on it and no smell perfuming it would be the best thing to do but when the garment is dirty and soiled is it logical to put perfume on it no the best thing for it is hot water and soap meaning to wash it now even Tamiya is telling him no I am that if you have no sins and you're a righteous person saying Subhan Allah is the best for you but if you are a sinful person like us then seeking Allah's forgiveness to purify our books and to cleanse it to cleanse our hearts would be the best so seeking Allah's forgiveness is among the best - soft in your heart and then you can learn more and more from this biography of the Prophet Alice awesome when you read his life's story when you read how he suffered in his life for us how he went out of his way to call people to Islam his modest life his humble way of living his battles whether on the battlefield or back home with the hypocrites his life with his wives and with his grandchildren and with his neighbors and companions this softens your heart if you go in-depth in the biography of the Companions this softens your heart if you go in-depth in the biography in the life stories and styles of the great scholars of the Salif this definitely soft in your hearts and the more you read the Quran contemplate on it read the tafseer the more you will get closer to Allah and you will find that your heart is being revived and as I said this requires a full fledged lecture may allah azza wajal make our hearts softened to his instruction and to meeting him"
