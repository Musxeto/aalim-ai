  "title": "Quran of the Shia, The Mushaf of Fatima and the Deviant Shia Aqeedah - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sent us an email saying what is the reality of the Shia or an is it really existing or what is it guide something about it as Muslims we believe that there is no Quran except the one that Allah has revealed and the Muslims all over the world 1.7 billion of them read from it memorize it by heart and it has been preserved as it is said it was revealed to the Prophet sallallaahu re where you send them 14 centuries ago in the same spoken language that all the Arabs speak of today so it is a living language not a dead language like the scrolls they have or some of the old scriptures some religions have now having said that we tend to hear a lot of talk about Shia with all their different factions have them be the earth nourish of the twelve or the amamiya or the Jeffrey order even the far to the left or right or whatever of is marilhea of Qadiani Ahmadiyya Bahia all of these different cults and sects that are not part of the mainstream Islam they claim that they have their own Koran and they call it must have Fatima and some of them of their scholars who they praise and look up for a to even compiled a book known as first lollipop he is batty terrific katabira bill Albert which means that the decider in proving that the Koran of Alonzo gel has been tampered with and these la fedosya looked up to this person their scholar to the extent that they honored him by burying him in Najaf so his idea was that the Quran which we muslims recite it's not the actual real quran and there are many verses many sewers that have been dropped out of it they even mentioned this in elk a fee which is the most authentic hadith book to them that has nothing accenting in it at all to us where Abdullah Saleh to LA alayhi as they say said Owen was asked about the Quran he said that the Quran of Fatima almost ha Fatima is three times bigger than the one you are reading Muslims and the one you're reading there is not a single letter of it and our must have meaning that what we hold as Muslims and know as Quran it is totally fabricated to them now this is blatant coup fork even if they say la ilaha illa Allah Muhammad Rasulullah if they doubt the Quran they are blatant kafir they do not relate to Islam at all so they have one of two choices either to say no these narrations are false and we don't believe in them which means you're undermining their foundations of the religion because the Caffey is most prominent book in their religion all they say yes we agree with it but then they are kafir Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned in surat al hajj that we have revealed we had sent down the Quran and we will be it's guardians Allah Azza WA JAL will be the protector of the Quran now one says ok this cult the sect the shear they are respected in Islam in the part of Islam okay Allah mentioned in chapter 5 verse number 3 look it up it's in the Quran what else do you want to believe in if you do not believe in the Quran Allah says clearly this is the day that I have perfected your religion and completed my favor upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion now if allah azza wajal completed or perfected the religion at the time of the prophet or a sorcerer and by the way this ayah v 3 was revealed in a holy day the jews came to Omar may Allah be pleased with him and said to him this ayah in your book had it been revealed to us the Jews we would have taken that day a day of feast and celebration and they recited this ayah to him and he said by the grace of Allah it was revealed on or in Arafat on the eve of a Friday which is a read for us so it is eat for the Muslims so Allah has perfected his religion completed his favor was the Shia there there then when this had happened know where the Sufis there when this happened no were the different sects and cults there when this happened the answer is no who was there there was only the prophet alayhi salatu salam and his honorable companions may allah be pleased with them so if you are a Muslim you have no other choice but to follow the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and his companions and this is known as the way of the Salaf of the righteous predecessors whom the Prophet himself Allah so Sam said to us the best of generations is my generation and the generation that follows them and the generation that follows them which is the generation of the Prophet and the Companions then the generation of the tabi een the followers of the companions then the generation of today attain the followers of the followers of the Companions these are our righteous predecessors we follow their footsteps we follow their understanding to the Quran and to the Sunna brother sockem ask yourself are these graffito Shia part of this beautiful synchronized way of looking at Islam the answer is no they are not related to Islam they're not related to the Prophet Isis and I'm neither their Hajj nor their prayer times they pray three times when we pray five northern Roma Bahn when they fast and break the fat not even their marriages they have like dating marriages they don't even have the simple and so what are you talking about anyone who suspects or doubts that the Quran we have and that Allah has preserved for the past 14th centuries and will preserve till the day of judgment anyone who a letter in it then he's not a Muslim so what do we say about someone who says that there is another Koran like they say definitely this is out of the loop of Islam"
