  "transcript": "[Music] dear brothers and sisters thank you for joining us and welcome to a new episode of contemporary F issues we have with us again in the studio today our special guest welcome for having me is one of the well-known callers and du who has traveled extensively across the world giving dawa and lectures to Muslims and non-muslims alike sheam in the last episode we were discussing the issue of beautification in Islam and you mentioned for us uh the ISS the the hairs the issue of hair and the categories regarding beautification that which is permissible that which is not and generally falls under from what we gathered that anything that changes the creation of Allah unless specifically mentioned by the Quran or Sunnah is impermissible we were going over the issues of hair that's impermissible to remove for both men and women we went over the issue of hair that's up to them and the hair that is obligatory to leave what about things like extending the hair like some individuals do they extend their their hair the concept of extending the hair is prohibited in Islam and this is clearly mentioned when the prophet sallallah as in theith of Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet has cursed the woman who adds false hair and fixes hair extensions and he cursed the woman who has this done and the woman who tattoos and the woman who has this done and this was reported by alari in the so this act calls the curse of Allah the almighty and we know that whomever Allah curses he departs him from Allah's mercy and he would not have him in under his Mercy Allah the almighty may Allah protect us there is also another Hadith whereb ABD said that mua AB sufyan may Allah be pleased with him once gave an oration while he was on the mimar and he was holding piece of a piece of hair that was seized by one of his guards and he said to the people where are your Scholars where are your Scholars I have heard the prophet alhat wasam say or forbid forbidding this kind of thing and saying that b Israel the sons of Israel were destroyed when they when their women started to use shut such things so such extensions are completely forbidden in Islam okay and would something like let's say for example uh eyelash extensions we considered as well the same thing well some Scholars say that it takes the same ruling because first of all it changes the creation of Allah MH second of all it is hair that being extended and not only this some Scholars even go further to talk about false uh uh nails or when they extend the length of the nails and they say that it falls under the same category so that when a woman wear these false nails or these fake nails it falls under the same category as hair extensions yes so because it's changing the creation of Allah and at the same time it is extending something that is not there and it's it's very awkward why people do this it's also in effect is it not a contradiction to what the prophet mentioned from the from the natural inclination is for people to cut their nails we know as Muslims we do this every week for jamaa well the concept of doing it every week on Friday is not Islamic because there isn't anything in the Sunnah that covers this people do it out of habit yes but when you connect this to Friday it becomes an innovation we are requested or instructed to remove the nails providing that they're long and in theith of may Allah be pleased with her she said that clipping the nails is part of the F the nature and thei of may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet gave us 40 days and this is the maximum Scholars such as now IM may Allah have mercy on his soul said that this does not mean that one should wait until 40 days days and nights because this to some would have their nails this long but this means that even if your nails do not grow normally on the 40th day or night you have to clip your nails even if they do not grow normally mhm nowadays it's the other way around we find people extending their nails or purposely growing them yes and and and and this is not only found in in women it's all Al so found in men I've seen a lot of men clipping their nails but they're keeping this finger and this this long why why would they do this I asked so many of them and they gave me so many lame excuses some of them say yes they want and they'll puncture the the the the the eardrum most likely something we' use it to remove the dandruff and some said things that I cannot mention here and it's absurd it's pathetic it's disgusting for a man to have such a nail and to use the nail for such activities the problem is now not only for men it's also for women and you finding women prolonging and keeping and growing their nails to horrible lengths and this is against nature and this is now it's become a habit of the non-muslims and so it's forbidden for for the Muslim women to be imitating the as no even though even regardless of the direct rulings because we have direct rulings stating that we have to clip the nails now at the maximum of 40 Days for men and women yes now women went the extra mile so now they're not only prolonging their nails and growing them they are also putting nail polish on top of them mhm and they it it some of them put red nail polish as if their animals you know just waiting for their prey well they're not waiting anymore because they have already killed their prey and they've got blood on their nails and it's so strange I've I've seen my daughters do this and I've I've spoken to them some of them alhamdulillah and one of my daughter puts black nail polish like this emo Trend what is this says this it looks nice so anything that looks nice you imitate don't you have your own own personality don't you have your own character why should we always follow people I remember one scholar mentioned he goes Subhan Allah are the Muslims just sheep that we just walk behind anyone is the Muslim not proud that he is on the face of the Earth following the religion that Allah the creator of the heavens and the Earth has set forth for him should we not feel honored with that task unfortunately this is the problem we have people who look down on themselves and they are not that proud and therefore whenever they see a new trend they just follow it as the prophet said that the people the Muslims will follow the Jews and the Christians um even if they went into a hole of a lezard they would follow it and even even amongst the non-muslims they know the quote which is very famous he who stands for nothing Falls for everything yes the Muslim should be standing for Islam the most glor uh uh the most glorious of things the truth from Allah that Allah is one this is this is true but unfortunate it's there so going back to our topic yes extending the hair is not permissible for women and as you men and also extending the uh uh nails or with false nails or leaving them to grow even past 40 days and also wearing false eyelashes is not permissible in Islam we mentioned the different types of hair that you can remove and that you have to remove what about people who say I don't want to remove my hair from my armpits every week or every two weeks or whatnot can I get laser uh they have now laser surgery which can actually remove the hair and stop it from growing ever again is this considered changing the creation it's not considered changing the creation because you're instructed to remove this hair so if there's a safe uh surgical procedure that would result in stopping the hair from growing and it does not have any side effects M and it if it does not involve exposing one's most private part of the body then it appears to be okay so for example if a woman comes and says listen I'd like to permanently remove the hair from my arms or legs or or legs and this does not include showing my private parts to anyone and it's a female who's doing this procedure and doctors say that there is not a side effect to it because some of these operations may end up in six 7 10 years time and the skin would be allergic it would have lots of side effects if this is the case this is completely forbidden okay can't we say that Allah subhana T created humans with the reason that the hair actually grows here and then made it a means of worship by removing it and obeying the prophet wasam so removing it in one shot wouldn't that kind of defeat the Azure or the benefits that you can get in removing it every time it can be but at the same time there is nothing to prevent it and this is why we have to go by the book The fundamentals we have the Quran and the the the the does not forbid this so it is too much to be more Roman than the Romans and saying oh you have to do this you have to do that as long as the sh allows it alhamdulillah we give room to the people to breathe because we don't want to make the religion too difficult for people and at the same time we don't want to make the religion so easy to the extent that it does not become religion anymore it becomes whims of people and what they desireah we'd like to continue but just after the break virtues of Ramadan the month of Ramadan is the best month of the entire year according to Islam it has many virtues that Muslims should benefit from do not lose the chance of this blessed month and join dram al-h Hadad in his program virtues of Ramadan Ramadan is a very unique opportunity for all of us it is a very unique occasion for all Muslims all over the world we are going to discuss certain issues related to and how to observe the night prayer we are also going to speak about Z inshallah we are going to speak about virtues of Ramadan in Ramadan on hod [Music] TV for those of you just joining us we were just discussing the issue of beautification with our special guest you were discussing for us the issue of extending the hairs and how the prophet specifically forbid it in all its forms what about this modern phenomenon of people wearing wigs or wearing these these hats that have these fake braids or fake hairs hanging from them okay um I love those hat these hats my girls bought them once and when they put these caps young girls they were about 6 or seven years old M and they had these fakes uh uh fake braids going on the sides they looked so beautiful and I I I loved it but then it clicked and said oops this is not right and I immediately told them to take it off they didn't like it they young but again this is religion we have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah the prophet cursed the wom who uh uh extend the hair with false extensions that's really not something we want to be uh relaxed with we have to be very careful the wording of the Prophet is very very specific and very heavy yes now one would might argue and say they were children so Allah will not punish them and the answer is yes Allah will not punish them for sure but he will punish me for allowing it yes because I'm the guardian of the children so if my if I go and and and tell my child here's a cigarette light it and H have a few Puffs here and there or if I uh uh give him champagne to to drink he's not sinful I am or even if you see your child reaching for a bottle of chlorine and he's about to drink it and you have the possibility to stop him and you don't it's the same thing so this is not permissible in Islam likewise it is not permissible to wear anything that gives the impression that this is hair for example um hairdressers where I come from women when they go to weddings they tend to make a trick so they bring a piece of cloth and they put it on their skull and they cover it with their own hair MH so it gives the impression that they have thick and big hair MH this is also considered to be extending the hair because and deceiving yes it's it's a form of uh deceit likewise if they extend the braids with human hair but not their own or with pieces of cloth that would look like hair but it's not hair and people would uh uh uh think and be deceived that this is the true length of the hair when they see it so anything that gives the illusion of hair but things like ribbons or things like a woman wearing a hat or something like that or a man wearing a hat these things are allowed this is definitely allowed so I'm wearing this scarf what what we call autra a woman is wearing hijab uh or scarf on her head this is permissible because it's not hair if a woman braids her hair and puts in between ribbons mhm with nice color yellow brown black whatever and people can see that these are ribbons they're not actual hair they're not actual hair this is permissible going back to your question regarding wearing the wigs MH wigs are hair so whenever you see someone wearing a wig you would think for that this is actual hair this is not permissible but it is permissible in few cases it is not per ible for example for a woman to go wanting to beautify herself she wears a wig with long hair with blonde hair with black hair this is Haram this is forbidden it's even worse when a man does this so if we have someone who's like 50 years old or 60 years old who's bold and he wears like a a um hair on his his head and he looks like 20 years younger this wig is forbidden for him and he's cursed because of it well that's a good point that you mentioned because the prophet in the Hadith mentions specifically women so if a man was doing it it might even fall under imitating women at the same time no well if he has a big beard it wouldn't be as as as so but it is not only imitating women it is the text that the prophet told usam the evidence of cursing those who change the creation of Allah and in some courts of law in some countries you get even the judge the lawyers the the whole people in in the courtyard wearing white wigs and this is not very common in the uh past centuries in Europe that the men used to wear these big white wigs for whatever reason I can't imagine maybe just to make them look like sheep peaceful and fair I don't know but this is not permissible in Islam and it's completely forbiding Okay so we've established that wearing a WG takes the same ruling as extending the hair it's a form of deception it's a fake image of hair on the on the individual on most cases in most cases except you said there were some exceptions what would those exceptions be the exception would be when wearing the wig would be a correction of a deformity or of something that is a a defect so let's say a woman had uh and we ask Allah to protect us had cancer and she had the chemotherapy treatment where she has hair loss and she wants to still be beautiful for her husband and make it easy for him in this hard time as well this is permissible M if a woman becomes bold because of this this is permissible if a woman becomes bold due to any other illness she is like 20 30 40 old and she becomes bold completely no hair at all it is permissible for her to wear a wig because this is a correction and she is not changing the creation of Allah on the contrary she is restoring M the creation of Allah now there is a Hadith which is very important for us to know that a woman came to the prophet Alam and said that my daughter had an illness and now she has thin hair it's not gone altogether but it is not as rich and thick as it used to be and she's going to get married so is it permissible for me to extend her hair and the prophet said no it's not Scholars say that because of the extension of the hair falls under the prophet's cursing the direct uh legisl yes and she had hair MH now the wig is permissible for a woman to wear when the hair is completely gone not when her hair is just a bit unsatisfying yes when she's completely bald as in the case of the chemotherapy or in the case of an illness that causes a woman hair to completely fall what about the case of for example a uh a woman who wants to who has curly hair and wants to straighten it or a woman who has straight hair and wants to make it curly is this considered changing the creation no this is not considered to be changing the creation because it's like wearing your hair uh not your hair of course but it's like wearing a a a woman wearing her hair in a different uh uh style she's just changing around how it looks yes and this is not permanent it goes like 3 months maybe less but what about some permanent ones like they have permanent hair straightening uh techniques it's it's nothing wrong in that because fixing the hair is part of the Sunnah it's like combing or brushing so if you have things chemicals providing that they are not harmful for you anything that has side effects or has more disadvantages than the advantages would fall under the category of forbidden things so what about a woman for example uh coloring her hair we know that uh there's Islamic text that forbid a woman to color her hair black for example perhaps you could expand on that well the text is not for women it's for men but whatever Falls for men Falls for women as well we don't want people to accuse us of segregating in the sense there is segregation in Islam between men and women but not in discrimination we're not discriminating and not in rulings and in legis the prophet Alat when he conquered Mecca on the eth year of his mhm Abu may Allah be pleased with him the father of Abu Bakr came to the prophet and he was 80 plus years old and he was blinded and he had his hair and beard all white like Snow White and the prophet looked at him and said to his family change this whiteness and avoid black so in Islam it is forbidden to use black to dye your hair or your beard you can use any other color but black is forbidden for you to use so a man could dye his beard blonde if you want or his hair blonde true true she can do whatever you wish because this is permissible you can dye it with black and brown so it gives a brownish color this is permissible pure black is forbidden in Islam except in the case of again a deformity a case of a defect a person who is 20 or 25 years old or a girl who is 25 years old and she has white hair would it not still be preferable for her to die at any other color well she has all the right to diet in Black because this is her natural color and she can have this and this is Islamic but if someone is about in his 40s 40s he's got some white hairs going on he cannot dye this in Black he has to do it in any other color or perhaps as found in some narrations of the sun maybe use H H is definitely the best thing for your hair you know scientifically and it's following the Sunnah but it's natural doesn't have chemicals yeah but some people would not like the color if having you know your orange beard and then they say that this is zezy top maybe they won't like this so it's up to the people there are n different kinds of of different shades of Brown of of of red or whatever and you may choose whatever suits you but there's nothing wrong in keeping a white beard or a white hair providing it's not completely white if it's completely white it's part of the sunna to change this it's always a pleasure to have you on the show unfortunately we're just about out of time inshallah please join us again next week when we'll continue our discussion on beautification in Islam you you can try to hold back the way but they will always wash your feet two waters flow with a barrier in between the Salty Sea and rivers fresh and sweet everything Allah commands to be will always become a reality everything a commands to be will always become a reality"
