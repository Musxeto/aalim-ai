  "title": "Interest from a bank account - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "question from brother shirt he says um i'm an indian resident i'm living in the arab countries i get interest in my bank account he says what shall i do with this interest sir he says i want to help somebody with this interest but do i give it to them without telling them what this interest is how do i invest this into so how to give it away okay first of all we have to look into your bank account not only physically of course but we have to look in what kind of bank account it is if you have the choice between putting it in an interest-free account and account an account with that gives interest and you chose the ladder then you are sinful but if the bank you're depositing your money in gives interest whether you like it or not and there is no other islamic bank or any other bank that does not offer the service then you may put your money deposited in that bank and you may take the interest not because you want to but be because you don't want to leave it to the bank and you have no other alternative and you may take the money and dispose of it in the fields of charity and you don't have to tell people so you can dispose of it not to give it for charity with the intention of getting closer to allah you are disposing of the money so you give it to a poor person to a relative you pay the debts of someone who is unable uh for doing that and while doing this you don't have to tell him that this is from riba because the majority would say well i don't take dirty money so you just give it to them and that would suffice inshallah but you do not put the money in building mosques okay awesome okay so that that's one of the conditions that was a question i was going to ask you okay great"
