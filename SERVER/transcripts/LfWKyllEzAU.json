  "transcript": "so my question is um if we buy a gift with the intention for giving it to a specific person but then um we give it to someone else is would would that be Haram or is it okay now the issue of buying a gift the gift is not binding or mandatory until it is possessed by the recipient so I buy this mug and I tell someone this I'm buying this for you and I bought it but I don't give it to him and I possess it then I Chang my mind and I said whoa this mug looks nice I'm going to keep it the guy has no right to say Hey you promised me you're going to give me this no until I give it to him and he possesses it it's not his it's mine and I can do whatever I want so if I buy a gift with the intention to give it to X person and then I I see why person to be a better recipient or more in need or I just simply don't want to give it to X anymore there's no problem at all in changing my intention"
