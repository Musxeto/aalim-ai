  "transcript": "his second question is about a person who has anxiety problem and he is depressed they had given him antidepressant but he doesn't want to take them because they have side effects first of all this is an illness that is found a lot among the people and in lesser degree among the Muslims but it is rising among the Muslims because Muslims are getting away from Islam and an accurate and real and true Islam therefore it is advisable that you consult a Muslim psychiatrist and why do we insist on a Muslim psychiatrist because a Muslim who's practicing knows the ins and outs of the business and knows what is truly good for you and what is not and if he gives you medication for your case then it is a must for you to take it providing that you do not have more knowledge than the sakai psychiatrist but if you do then this is a different story most likely you don't so you have to refer to the people of knowledge in order to seek your cure and healing process through them this doesn't mean that you do not follow the normal procedures in Islamic sharia which tells you to trust Allah depend on him and have full reliance on him if you do this you would not have anxiety attacks nor depression a person who knows that nothing would happen except that which Allah Dajjal has decreed fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation would he have fears from going out definitely not if he gets anxiety attacks saying that maybe you go out and a car would run oh it run you over or there someone would shoot you all of this is nonsense because I'm here in my studio talking to you all of a sudden maybe a big light from the ceiling would come and fall in my head and I would die so in this case I shouldn't be doing this it can happen anywhere if you have full trust and dependence and reliance on allah azza wajal you will not have any words because whatever these anxiety attacks come to you you say audhu billah min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem this is Shaitaan he's the one who is steering the wheel and in driving me to such depression secondly do a lot of rukia bring water recite Fatiha ayatul kursi Loiselle baqara the last three holes of the quran seven times after each time blow under water and drink a lot of it in the morning in the afternoon the evening before you go to bed thirdly make a lot of dirt on your suit oh Allah strengthen my Eman strengthen my tawa : dependence on you and you will see miracles insha'Allah within few days"
