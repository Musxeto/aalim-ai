  "transcript": "the next question is sometimes for offering Salah I happen to forget the number of what should I do in this situation should I continue or restart it depends if you are suffering from this in every single Salat or every day this means that shatan is messing up with your head most people who suffer from this illness on daily basis they know what they prayed but shatan comes to the 5% maybe you're it's not fourth ra maybe it's third deep down I know it's 99.99% I've prayed for but this is something that is you know scratching me from inside I don't know what to do yeah Allah let us add one this isan but if it's normal no I'm Every Day I'm fine I have no issues one separate Blue Moon seriously I am lost I'm confused H three or four 3 or four in this case the prophet says to those who have it once every blue moon disregard the doubt where is the doubt I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four where is the doubt the fourth because three I'm certain I've prayed but the doubt is whether I prayed the fourth or not disregard the doubt number four and add another ra and then prostrate for uh uh forgetfulness before the Salam and that is concluding your prayer so I hope this clarifies it a bit"
