  "transcript": "says what does islam say about deja vu de ja vu is a terminology used for people when they see something and it seems that they've been through a similar experience and some people say that this happened to you in a previous life and we as muslims we don't believe in such nonsense because you only live once on this earth and then you die and then you wait until the day of judgment whether you go to heaven or to hell but we don't believe in reincarnation so that you will die and then live another life and die live another life this is not in islam at all this is blasphemous muslims don't believe in that so how can you explain that i have recollection that have been in this neighborhood before and i think after that house there's a small shop and wow there is a small shop and if i turn left there's a big tree and whoa there is a big tree i've been here some how how can you explain this chef this is not mentioned neither in the quran nor in the sunnah so what's the explanation to it it can be a number of things but no one can pinpoint and say yes this is the one it can be a previous dream you've seen and that dream was a vision from allah and you know we've spoke about we have spoken about dreams before and that either it's a vision from allah or something from shaytaan or is something that your subconscious is bringing up maybe it is the jinn making you see things or recollecting things that you've seen before where when you did not maybe it's your intuition allah knows but definitely this has no relation in the quran or the sunnah and it's definitely not related to a previous life you had and allah knows better"
