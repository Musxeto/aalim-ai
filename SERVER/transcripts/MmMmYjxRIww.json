  "transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] and welcome to this third episode of the islamic faith i believe that before let me first check where is okay chapter 2 which happens to be the chapter that we studied last week thursday that is and we didn't finish it all we took half of it so in a nutshell we talked about the sources of the or the the the religion every thought every concept every school it has to have a certain methodology a certain way that it approaches things it authenticates things it rules things islam is a divine religion therefore it cannot be understood without going back to the original sources the quran and the sunnah so this is an essential part of the religion this is an essential part of our akida now i know a lot of you would say that everybody says this all muslims believe in this is no if you go to different schools different cults different sects and you study the fundamentals you study the principles they act upon you will find that they have a serious problem and this is why the prophet says will be divided into 73 sects all will be in hell except one and this is the jamaa this is those who follow the quran the understanding of the previous predecessors righteous predecessors if you go to deviant sects and cults you will find that they say we abide by the quran but in reality they put forward and put in front of them their scholars opinions their peers opinion to the extent that some of them say clearly that if you do not follow our school of thought that is an extreme opinion of the hanafi thought if you don't follow our school of thought you are not a muslim even if you found something in the quran or in the sunnah contradicting it the madhhab is what you must follow of course this is too extreme this is blasphemous but this is cascaded everywhere in all sects and cults of islam you'll find it with the rafale you'll find it with the khawaris you'll find it with el mortez you'll find it with the jahamiyah you'd find it with al-qaeda who claim to be muslims but they're not they find it dude you'll find it with so many people with the sufis and moderate the the super sufis all of these have it in them that they don't abide 100 to the quran the sunnah and this is why it is part of our akida and without it we cannot progress we cannot move forward if someone says i say muhammad rasulullah but don't oblige me to believe in your akida which says that the main sources of knowledge and of religion is quran sunnah there are many other sources we have our dreams we have our visions we have our ancestors uh tales and and fables and stories and this is not islam then we moved on to talk about the companions may allah be pleased with them and how their opinion is the closest to the truth their understanding because first they spoke arabic fluently secondly they were closest to the prophet allah thirdly the quran was revealed when they were there so they actually knew what it all was about and they were closer to the source than we are so their understanding is definitely better than ours and then we moved on to speak about um [Music] making things halal and haram which is in short legislation and we will talk in detail later on about legislating with other than what allah has revealed and the ruling of that and the difference of opinion on that so the issues of making things halal or haram this is only in the hands of allah and those whom allah delegates such authority to and that is the prophet sallallahu alaihi so having this out of our way we continue in chapter 2 the sheikh says when allah revealed his book his words carry meanings that he wanted to convey and this is part of our akida do you have any doubts i can tell people are nodding their heads no we have no doubts unfortunately lots of the muslims have doubts especially when it comes to verses that they think to be ambiguous when they're not example when allah talks about himself and describes himself know what faith means in arabic what hand means in arabic knows what allah loves and allah abhors means in arabic so they understand it as it was revealed to them people of deviation don't take this as we do so they misinterpret they distort the meaning they simulate it they do lots of things which were not intended and that allah azza does not approve of when allah revealed his book his words carry meaning that he wanted to convey allah revealed the quran clear and in arabic language so no one has doubts in understanding it or would say that i don't know the meaning is with allah yes the meaning is with allah but allah spoke to us and talked to us in arabic so that we would understand what he wants to us otherwise when allah says that intoxicants are prohibited so stay away from them we say allahu alam what allah meant by intoxicants so you don't want to say that whiskey is intoxicant vodka tequila so this is not what quran was revealed for it is to convey a message that allah intended the says the meanings he intended are explained only by him and whoever of his creation is permitted to do so so the meanings are clearly explained in the quran and when you fail to understand some of it due to lack of knowledge then you should seek the interpretation through people whom allah permitted them to do so the says a scholar who studies the quran may deduce its meanings provided he observes two conditions one he sticks to arabic language and its grammar too he does not contradict a clear meaning that is already established in the quran now this needs some elaboration interpreting the quran is one of the most noble sciences in islam so the tafsir to understand the meaning of what was mentioned in the quran is one of the most honorable sciences in islam now scholars said and this is a no-brainer that the best way to understand the quran is to understand the quran through the quran itself and how is that done first of all there are a lot of verses in the quran explained elsewhere for example i think we spoke yesterday about this those who believe and do not associate their belief with any form of transgression they will have full security and they will be guided so the scholars the companions came to the prophet and said to him that okay we have a problem and our problem is that all of us are humans and we have to have done some form of transgression one day or the other so does this mean that we won't be secured on the day of judgment so the prophet explained to them allah with another verse and he said to them no this is not what was meant didn't you hear what the righteous uh servant of allah said verily that associating others is a great transgression this is the transgression which allah warned us from associating our belief with which is ship so this is the first and the best of interpreting the quran in two places [Music] who believe protect yourselves and your families from fire that is fueled by people and rocks so what kind of rocks are we talking about ranit um [Music] this or that well in another ayah allah says and what you worship with allah azzawajal are the fuel of hellfire the stones of hellfire and this is an indication that the rocks are the idols that were worshipped with allah azza wajal so this is the highest level of tafsir and nobody argues this the second level if you can't find an ayah a verse that explains the one you want to understand you refer to the sunnah so the prophet himself alayhis salat comes and explains to us for example the ayah in surat al-baqarah in reference to fasting that you should eat and drink until you distinguish and recognize the white thread from the black thread may allah be pleased with he used to sit in his room and put on his blank his pillow a white thread and a black thread and he used to eat and drink in the darkness of his room until there was enough light to distinguish so when he told the prophet assam the prophet clarified to him the verse of the quran by saying no this means the thread of day from the thread of night so this is the brick of dawn this is the white thread that was meant in the quran so this is the explanation of the prophet alaihis wasallam and likewise this is one of the greatest ways of interpreting the quran because we cannot understand what was mentioned in the quran when it refers to salah prayer had it not been to the prophet we would have not known that the prayers are five that the fajr is two zohar is four assad is four male rabbis four we would not have known what allah meant by zakat and the threshold and the duration that we have to give the zakat had it not been to the sunnah of the prophet sallam who explained the quran to us so this is crystal clear the third way or level of understanding the quran is through the understanding of the companions so if we could not find the understanding in the quran the interpretation and we cannot find the interpretation through the sunnah of the prophet wasalam then we have to refer to the companions for the previous reasons mentioned they were more closer to the prophet sallam than anyone else they knew the language better than anyone else and the quran was revealed in their presence and they were purer of hearts simpler in lifestyle and much less baggage when it comes to this dunya and if we cannot find it in the companion's interpretation then we go to the taberine whom the companions invested a lot of time and effort teaching them so mujahid one of the great imams of tafsir was a student of the companions etc and he learned so much of him that scholars acknowledge this and this is the weakest because then we have to look at other tabi if they did not differ with that opinion then we would take it so this oh these are the four levels of tafsir by what was reported to us now if we don't have any interpretation from these four sources then we head on to what the sheikh has put in his book a scholar who studies the quran may deduce its meanings provided he observes two conditions one he sticks to the arabic language and its grammar two he does not contradict a clear meaning that is already established in the quran and he should have also said and the sunnah so these two conditions are essential we get people interpreting the quran out of their own whims and desires and this is wrong it has to fit the arabic language and it has to coincide with the grammar so someone comes and says ayah number 34 chapter number four those women those wives of yours if you fear that they will be disobedient you have to do one two three and in the third instruction allah says and beat them so people did not like this so said no no no no beating them is not intended in the quran and they started talking falsely about another meaning of burb and try to twist the meaning of the quran so that they would be defensive they would not have to defend themselves in front of the media in front of this in front of that and islam is not a defensive religion islam stands by its own this is a religion of allah but their ignorance led them to do this when a person follows a deviant sect or a cult he interprets the quran in a in a fashion that fits his thinking and school of thought so when you come to allah saying allah has risen above the throne he says no no no no this is not logical allah is not like that is to conquer not to rise over so he changed the meaning that has no relationship to arabic just to fit his own sick cult insect and some people may interpret the quran out of knowledge out of ignorance some may come and say that the throne of allah is the same as the kursi you know ayato kursi i heard one of the brothers interpret the kursi to be the throne of allah this shows extreme ignorance because the hadith is crystal clear that the heavens and the earth compared to the kursi are like a ring thrown in an empty piece of land in the desert the whole desert to that ring is negligible that is the ring and the corsica compared to the throne of allah is like that ring to that desert so they are different but when people don't know proper arabic they think that the kursi also means the chair that i'm sitting on so it is the throne not knowing that even ambassador allah be pleased with the man with his father interpreted as the place the pedestal that uh the feet are placed on now we have a problem when it comes to the tafsir of the quran so many people are jumping the gun or jumping the wagon because we all love tafsir yet this like muhammad evan serene said one of the tabern and if i'm not mistaken he was the son-in-law of abu hura so he had a big huge source of knowledge next to him as a father-in-law muhammad says this knowledge that you acquire is religion so scrutinize those you are taking religion from meaning those you're learning from scrutinize them are they knowledgeable do you have do they have the credentials and the qualifications because not everyone who is articulate who is using the language beautifully who's fluent in his expressions not everyone is a scholar and you have to be careful about this there are so many out there who you listen to them and you're quite impressed i'm one of them who is impressed with so many speakers when they talk how beautiful they react how beautiful they uh say what they have to say and present their oration beautifully done captivating but when you look and search to what they had said it's full of hot air it's like a big loaf of bread and that's an ad for wendy's in the 70s i think mid 70s late 70s there was an ad for wendy's hamburgers three big three women tall medium short over their 70s elderly come to see this big cheeseburger so the tolls say a big loaf of bread the second one says a big big loaf of bread the shortest one the granny takes the top and says big loaf of bread but where's the beef and most of the dyes we see nowadays this is this fits them as a glove a big loaf of bread but where's the beef one of the sisters sent me last month a clip here in saudi arabia telling me that a lot of the girls are circulating lectures of this brother and they are enjoying watching it because he has beautiful way of speaking english and in this clip this brother is talking about the beginning of surat yasin i think it was a friday sermon and he spoke about the warners who came and that allah sends usually one messenger for this tribe or nation he sent three messengers to then reinforce them with third and then he spoke about this and that and then he came to the issue that the prophet salallahu salaam was described as light in the quran and then he went and talked about light in one way or the other he connected the light of the prophet sallam to the light of the stars of the moon of the sun and this guidance that we get from the prophet is similar to this light that we are guided with and at the end he said and therefore you don't have to wait to hear the name of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam everybody so so lord your son of course was good you don't need to hear his name to offer salutation rather as a muslim whenever you see the sun and the light from the moon you say allah and i was saying what the heck what is this related to the salutation of the prophet isaiah this is the tafsir of al-bataniya or sofia they get things embedded that no one can see except them and they make it as eureka i found it so he's sharing his thoughts with the masses without any proper justification or evidence neither from the quran or from the sunnah and definitely not from the self because these guys hate the self it reminds them of a cult or a sect nowadays called self who can tarnish the the reputation of everyone they know which is wrong but the concept of salaf is part of our religion the prophet mentioned that in the hadith and the word salaf means the righteous predecessors the three favorite generations companions so the name itself you can change it i have no problem with that but to bring tafsir it shows you that it does not coincide with the quran with the sunnah with the sahaba and it does not coincide with the arabic meaning and it contradicts clear meaning in the the quran and in the sunnah which is very serious and people must really take good care of whom they learn from so shaykh we should only learn from you i haven't never said something like that on the contrary i tell people not to learn from me i'm not a scholar i'm just a student of knowledge but the thing that i express my gratitude to allah and praise him for is that allah has guided me to take from real scholars so i don't shoot from the hip i make mistakes yes i have shortcomings big time but i don't say ah this is halal this is haram the meaning of this ayah is this the meaning of this from my own desire no it has to be something that real scholars had talked about etc because these are those whom we take as a beacon of light may allah have mercy on their souls others may fail to do this others may refrain even from telling you we got the where they got this piece of information so that they won't expose their school of thought and the way they've learned it and this is very dangerous so one when it comes to quran you have to know what the sources of that individual are it's not sufficient to say this ayah there are many benefits one two three where did you get this from show me your books show me your scholars no we don't need this i know arabic this is not sufficient you know arabic but you do not know the sunnah you know not have a correct so people be careful when you go and venture with some with with such people the sheikh says not everything that is attributed to allah actually comes from him aha what does that mean it means that it's not sufficient that i come to you and say the prophet said allah to assalam eat pasta because pasta make you a moroccan said it wait where did you get it from i know no anything that comes out of your mouth has to be proven with evidence so if someone comes and claims that this is from allah it doesn't mean necessarily from allah we have to verify this and followers of earlier divine messages jews and christians went astray when they made arbitrary deductions twisting that what is definitive in order to contradict what is equivocal so this was done by previous religions and this is why allah azzawajal tells us that they twist these words of allah to mean something else allah says about the people of the scriptures there are among them who twist their tongues when quoting the scriptures so they twist their tongues when coating the scriptures not something they made up make up or their own words no they twist their tongues with when quoting the scriptures so that you may think that what they say is from the scriptures when it is not from the scriptures they say it is from allah when it is not from allah thus they did deliberately say of allah what they know it to be a lie and this is what the jews and christians had done allah azzawajal thus they twisted the words when quoting the scriptures and their aim was to make you think that what they say is from the scriptures because it is very close to it they did this with a definite with a definite uh aim with a definite aim to lead uh people astray so what was their intention were they like a muslim ruler when he makes a judgment if he's correct he gets two rewards and if he's wrong he gets one reward the answer is no they had a definite intention to divert deviate distract people from the words of allah and this is how they gain power and i told you this before i think here or somewhere else i got a clip from one of the scholars asking me about a clip he saw for the pakistani mawlana and this clip was filled with nonsense about fajr being a form of gratitude upon the muslims because allah reunited adam with eve and then we pray lord for as a form of gratitude to allah because this is when the ark of noah uh embarked on the mountain of judy and for rakhas of asir because ibrahim was given the sacrifice of a big ram so that he would not slaughter his son is married where did you get this thing from this is a sufi peer or scholar or mawlana who people pay him money monthly he is filthy rich and he captivates people with such nonsense that is not related to islam it's like the jews and the christians twisting their tongues with the scripture this is exactly the same thing and this is why we so many times go out of our way to warn people from such individuals saying to them be careful watch out learn from those who are trusted in their religion in their habit who are keen followers of the quran the sunnah otherwise you will put yourself in harm's way so this ends our second chapter and we move on to uh the questions and our first question is from antonio he says what are what is your opinion on table i just heard about them but i can see people are divided on that tabliri group we spoke about this so many times when it comes to islamic judgment they have good and they have that so the good they have is that they call muslims to practice they invite muslims to pray and to be punctual they invite them to abide by the sin of using the siwak and shortening their garments so that it would not go below the ankles to be clean to perfume they encourage one another to not do offer night prayer to fast mondays and thursdays all of these to recite the quran to gather and remember allah all of these are positive things bad things are they do not focus on akhida they disregard issues of apida because they bring disputes among the muslims they disregard any argument or discussion even when it comes to issues they talk or never talk about jihad about enforcing virtue and prohibiting evil advice and they have based their belief on a number of books that are filled with innovation and weak narrations such as sahaba by the kandahari such as and in arabia they depend on riyadh which is an authentic book it's a good book and mainly speaking those who are in arabia have a correct valid akida so we don't uh yeah any fear the destruction or the disturbance of alpeda with them but we warned them about the weak narrations about the innovations they have now in regards to their character i know a lot of them and they are the kindest of people the most generous the purest of hearts they will do whatever they can for their cost unfortunately the issue of lack of knowledge and insisting in limiting islam in these few things in addition to the innovations of their six uh fundamentals and the bayan they give before every meeting and they're i wouldn't say exodus but leaving their families for three days or 10 days or 40 days and sometimes more than that in months saying that we are in jihad and we are fisabilillah and they just stay in masjids depend on people's feeding them mostly some of them know they're well off and they would provide for the others and themselves these are all not part of the sunnah or the way of the prophet yes there are people who were guided by them but there are many others who were misguided after being guided with them because the foundation was zero so you find people masha'allah bearded becoming practicing in the surface go out with them for a year or two maybe five and then all of a sudden flip and go back even worse than they were before and when you asked what happened said not interested anymore so this is a serious issue what to do if you're a student of knowledge and they invite you to come out with them go and correct whatever wrong you see and if they won't allow you to do so then leave them but if you're a layman i would definitely advise you not to join them and allah knows best says if i were but if i was asked what is islam what should i say first you should identify islam to be to believe in the allah in the existence of allah and him being the only one worthy of being worshipped without associating others and to submit your will to allah this is islam and this is how you should introduce it so first prove to the individual that allah exists if he believes in allah that's that's half of the trouble so believe let him then convince him that allah is worthy of being worshipped without associating any others with him because there's nothing like unto him and this is easy to explain and if he agrees to that then move on to prove that allah would create this universe and would send to us someone to tell us about himself someone who would teach us who would show us and he would reveal to him a book that would be emmanuel and which is the quran and you can go on from there sadia says dissertation of ayat al-kursiya question mark what is your question write a proper question please so that i can understand so what is the ruling it is a highly recommended sunnah the prophet said if a individual maintains reciting ayat al-kursiy after every salat nothing would prevent him from entering paradise except death so the only reason that you're not in paradise is because you're alive once you die you will go to paradise of course providing the conditions are fulfilled so it is one of the greatest sunnahs that we should uh maintain for protection and for the reward brother marouf says due to the current calvin 19 lockdown situation in my community children are kept away from masjids and no congregational prayers are allowed i would like to lead my children in prayers as they just learning how to pray properly can i pray some salat with them at home in the scenario the answer is no if the messages are open for you you are obliged to pray five times in the masjid however the sunnah prayers you can pray them home and you can lead your children while praying the sunnah this way you would have a win-win situation tajreen says enlighten us the difference between apida and manhajj is what you believe in so what we're studying in our islamic faith course is apida and i gave a definition in the beginning if you remember that is your belief in allah and they have judgment and the angels and the uh the messengers the unseen uh the hereafter the destiny etc all of these are part of your akida believing that the quran and the sunnah are the sources of islam believing in the status of the prophet salam to muslims and the status of the companions to muslims etc all of these are happiness since 1990 before that we had no problem with the issue of a peda and manhattan because they are the same thing manhattan is not mentioned as the people who use it nowadays after 1990 this terminology started surfacing why because akida is something that we all share and believe on in we are all so we study the same books we follow the same scholars we pray in the same fashion we follow the same methodology of but after 1990 a group of salafis i wouldn't say went rogue but rather had their own understanding and they were too strict in their understanding that they went extreme so they thought and they looked at the different quotations from the self of how to be harsh with the people of innovation and how to be strong and firm in not giving salam back to them and they mix apples with oranges so someone who's an innovator who probably uses prayer beats which they may think it's an innovation is like someone who worships graves they're all innovators so i will not return salam and they built the big building on a foundation that is thinner than the shell of eggs so they said okay individuals we don't give them salam we don't reply to their salaam and we can back bite because backbiting them is a form of worship so we can talk ill about them and they started spending their time scrutinizing people looking for their faults a great sheikh who has 30 40 years of efforts in dawah books publications ah we found a line that incriminates him he made a mistake so what no no no no he's a people he's among the people of innovation he has to be crossed over and they started attacking guys students of knowledge scholars and if you're not with them you're against them so they started using the methodology of george w bush bush if you're not with us you're against us so if you don't believe in their allama in their samaha they are four or five scholars top-notch in their eyes who are almost infallible though they know that they say no no they are human beings they make mistakes but they consider what they say as revelation one of the mistakes they've made was taking quotation from the self which is okay and making it a cornerstone that we build everything around it even if there are other salaf who acted differently regardless we follow this particular quotation and they base everything on that quotation so nowadays scholar so-and-so is an innovator that is so-and-so he's a face-up so everybody on the arena are out of their record books why because yeah they may have a good arpeda but they don't have the correct man hatch man hajj what is manhattan well the same question was posed to the permanent committee of ifta headed by and his deputy the renowned sheikh baqarah mercenary and a number of other scholars they asked them what is the difference between apida and manhattan and the fatwa came crystal clear it's the same there's no difference so these guys are building a castle of sand and they are trying to make a movement and this movement is entirely bogus they pray like we pray they study the same books of that we study yet they say that we are not following their scholars so we are not in accordance to the correct man hash and we are innovators we have problems with apida we have this we have that we try to tell them okay we do have our shortcomings like yours you'll have shortcomings big time but they don't want to do this they focus entirely on the issue of the muslim ruler being something close to a prophet but that you must not by any chance criticize or talk about or do anything that may insinuate that you dislike what he does and in essence our akira is similar we have full obedience to the ruler as long as he does not order us to disobey allah this is part of we believe that it is not permissible to publicly denounce him as this is insulting and humiliating him where allah has given authority so this is totally prohibited unlike some other groups who say no we if he does a mistake we should point out to the people criticize him do this no this is not permissible because his job description is different than ours he has to be honored even if it's sinful even if he disobeys allah but still if i meet him personally i would criticize him in his face he may kill me afterwards so what i would be the best of martyrs but to go publicly and denounce his actions humiliate him degrade him this is totally not permissible now this is something we share yet they go the extra not single mile miles in justifying what the sinful muslim ruler is doing and legitimizing it and this is where the thin line of the thin line separating islam from hypocrisy lies see if you're unable to say the truth that's okay the least you could do is not to speak evil so yes if you cannot criticize him publicly this is my akita and if you cannot go to him and speak to him privately then the least is not to shine him not to do things that would make you look like a hypocrite for polishing him and saying things about him that are not true and legitimizing all the evils he does no if you can't criticize the evil then shut up but don't praise his actions and portray him as a messenger from allah or someone who was sent as a blessing to us from allah so in short [Music] manhattan is the same fida bin a man a cockroach fell inside a honey pot can we use the honey or did it become negative and contaminated well if you have the guts to use it good luck an impurity falling in a pot is one of two either the liquid or the medium helps in spreading and mixing the impurity as in the case of water for example in this case the whole thing becomes najis but if it's like ghee or honey or butter where the allocated area of najasa can be isolated taken out and the rest is not contaminated it can be used now this is providing that what had fell in the pot is najis and there is a difference of opinion among scholars when it comes to insects so ants spiders approaches are considered not to be nudges to a great number of scholars due to the fact that they don't have liquids they call it enough meaning that a soul that is liquid liquid liquidated what do they mean by that they don't have blood like animals circulating their veins so this is why when you squash a fly when you squash a mosquito they don't have the blood of their own usually and if you squash roaches you get white fluid out of it so they say that this is not najis this is not blood when it comes to lizards uh no this is bigger this is nudges when it comes to mice there's no difference of opinion so even if you look in the books of ibitemia he says when a rat falls into a bowl or a pot of ghee you can simply take the area surrounding it and throw it because the ghee is solid contamination is not spread uh throughout it but if it fell in milk for example or water no this the whole thing becomes impure allah says can we greet each other by saying only salaam or salaam alaikum is it permissible the sunnah is to say assalamu and this is the minimum however scholars said that saying salaam is even less but it won't get you the reward of 10 hasanat so if you say salaam then it is mandatory upon you to say but the person saying it is not doing it according to the sunnah likewise saying salaam alaikum this is not the greeting of the muslims on earth yeah maybe it is used in jannah but not on earth so you should uh stick with that and allah knows best medina and wow what a name that is if it's real medina says there are sisters coming live on social media or post pictures without hijab or not proper hijab makeup skin or legs showing and other sisters comment with masha'allah [Music] can you please respond to this misusing of allah's names with this improper behavior first of all visiting such websites or social media post is haram one should not look if they're men at other women and if they're women they must not look at such women who show and expose their hour publicly and without any doubt endorsing them by liking that post or commenting positively to it is sharing the sin so you are with that person in the same shoes because you are clapping to her endorsing what she's doing as if it's halal so you will get your share of her sins now saying masha allah this is not abusing allah's name if i see a if a sister sees another sister and masha'allah she's nicely built or she's working in the gym or she's exposing her figure and she has good figure and she says allah mubarak to ward off evil eye this is not insulting allah's name this is done toward the evil eye out now she's sinful for what she's done she's sinful for positively commenting but no she's not insulting allah's or misusing allah's name when she does say that and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have so until we meet on thursday i leave allah"
