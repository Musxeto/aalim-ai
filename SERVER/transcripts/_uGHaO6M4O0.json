  "transcript": "finally Shiva says from India that after the Imam offers salaam because I've missed a raka or two I do not have a Sutra I visor or something that protects me from people walking in front of me so is it permissible to walk a step or two forward or sideways so that I would be close to someone who's sitting or a pillar or a stand for the Quran answer is totally permissible there's no problem in that none whatsoever because such steps are taken for illegitimate reason and this is permissible insha Allah"
