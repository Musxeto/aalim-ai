  "transcript": "I remember making an oath but I am not sure if I had broken it I think that I had maybe broken it much to expert for it so brother farok's question is about an oath he is certain that he made one I swear by Allah not to smoke and now he's doubtful whether he did actually broke it or if he actually broke it or not whether he smoked or not the default is that you did it so unless proven otherwise there is no need for you to expiate otherwise you would open the door for The Whispers of shaytan in everything you do did I pray or didn't I did I pray after or didn't I did I pray yesterday or didn't I did I say shahada did I do this did I do that and you keep on opening the door for shaytan to mess up with your head you made an oath not to do something abide by it you're not sure whether you broke it or not the default is that you did not break it and Allah Knows Best amiral"
