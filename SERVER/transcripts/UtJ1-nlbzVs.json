  "transcript": "I believe that any person hating a child who is 2 years old would be considered a monster children who are two who are three who are four years old they are children you can discipline them by reprimanding by shouting but hitting them this is is too extreme now now having said that sometimes very seldomly you may spank a child you know something that is not harmful that it does not leave a mark that does not break a bone uh just for the child to be reprimanded maybe this would be accepted but what I've seen some do with children who are two or three years old it is so extreme that this cannot be uh uh Humane therefore no I believe that one should not spank a child who is 2 years old remember that in the most important thing in our religion which is prayer the prophet said instruct your children to pray when they're seven and spank them over it when they 10 so from 7 years old until they're 10 years old you simply instruct them order them to pray but when they reach the age of 10 only then you can than them and this is over prayer so let alone if they take a a cookie from the cookie jar when they're 3 years old and you would like to you know hang them from the ceiling for what they had done this is definitely not the proper thing to do uh yet I would not recommend that you keep on just shouting or teaching your children without uh disciplining them but the that Resort would be stanking them try your best to you know discipline them by making them sit in a corner uh no desserts not to come out of the room um deprive them from uh playing do something that would be considered logical and would be considered uh uh full of affection to your child and always not think of do not think of reprimanding and forget at the same time awarding and uh being kind and nice and rewarding your child whenever he does or she does something uh good and Allah knows that"
