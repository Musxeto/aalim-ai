  "title": "Prohibition on burying the dead when the Sun is Rising, Setting & at it's Zenith? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "jabot says what was the wisdom behind prophets prohibition on bond burying the dead when the Sun is rising setting and it at its zenith is it because it was a practice of the fire worshippers to do this now job it's question comes to a lot of us when it's pertaining to rules of Islam what he's referring to is the hadith of above-knee honor may Allah be pleased with him where he said that the Prophet Isis Salam prohibited us from praying at three times and from burying our deceased at these times and he mentioned that when the Sun is rising and when the Sun is setting and when the Sun is at its zenith and that is approximately five to six minutes before the event of or so a person says what's the wisdom and the answer would be that as Muslims we do not require a justification for everything that comes in the Quran in the Sunnah otherwise we would not be good servants and slaves of Allah whenever a master tells his slave go and fetch me this item from the market and the slave says why what are you gonna do with it where is the wisdom of me going now why can't I buy it next week this is unacceptable because this is an instruction from your master you have to adhere and obey you don't have the luxury and the choice to ask for justification this is exactly what happened with Satan when Allah created Adam with his own two hands subhanahu wa'ta'ala he ordered the angels to prostrate Satan was not an angel he was from the jinn and Allah told us in the Quran that he was from the jinn and we know that the jinn are different from the angels but Allah Azza WA JAL made him in the ranks of the Angels so the instruction was for him as well to prostrate Satan did not and when Allah asked him why you did not prostrate to Adam as I've commanded you he replied by expressing his logic expressing what he thought and he said I am better than him you created me from fire while you created him from clay and fire is better than clay hence why would i prostrate and we all know the fate of satan because of his ill decision because of his disobedience to Allah Azza WA Jalla that he was cast in hell for eternity now the same thing goes for you and me may Allah forbid when we ask for justification so a man says ok I've looked into Islam and I found that 95 percent of everything in Islam is logical and perfect any non-muslim studying Islam if he brings a pen and paper and writes a table with the pros and cons and lists the things of that are essential in our religion well why he the least he would find is 95 percent if not 99 percent perfect logical unfortunately you cannot find such fair people except rarely the vast majority are so influenced by the media that they don't even put some effort or time to study what Islam says this is beside the point so someone says mashallah 95 percent is perfect but there are few issues like 5 percent or 3 percent or even 1 percent that I'm not convinced of that I'm not at ease with the logical thing to say is if 90 percent is perfect and correct you should accuse your own intellect your own understanding for not accepting these 5 percent and you should accept them blindly but this is how Satan works he comes to you says why can't we muslims eat pork i can produce for you so many medical reports telling you how bad pork is for your health ok understood why can't we drink intoxicants anyone would tell you the reason after a night of partying and being wasted and suffering from the hangover ok understood why is usury or RIBA Haram why is stealing Haram why is killing others Haram why is being abusive to your wife Haram why being undutiful to your parents is how everything is crystal clear logical why do we pray 5 times a day why do we fast why do you give zakat to the poor who don't work and they are underprivileged while we are privileged everything is logically then Satan creeps in on one of the issues of the 5 percent and then he tells you ok why is it that a man is prohibited from wearing gold I'm rich I have millions why can't I wear a golden ring or a golden watch I don't know ah then there's something wrong in Islam if I can wear a ring of me with a piece of diamond that is maybe a couple of million reals I can't wear a golden ring that is 500 reals or a thousand reals worth said yes this is Islam ah this is not logical why does a man marry for if he wishes and a woman marries only one why is a man an inheritance is granted double what a female is granted and so many doubts that if you sit with a scholar he would clarify it to you but Shaitaan or Satan this is how he works he diverts you from what is right into what is dubious forcing you to neglect and ignore the 95 percent of actual proven facts and focus only on one or two issues and then you get some infidels coming and saying or I don't like Islam because it has this and that okay no problem what are you picking instead I said I'm picking this religion but in his religion that he has chosen there are 95 percent illogical things and 5 percent that are logical yet he accepts it if he then if he's an atheist there are 99 percent things that are illogical yet 1 percent that he's mesmerised by and he holds on to it as if it's the only ultimate truth in world so again jabot this is something that we have no knowledge of our prophet told us had a sort of salaam we comply it's like Wi-Fi historica Mugabe's three and the rest of the prayers are for I don't know this is how it was prescribed and this is how we take it and Allah knows best"
