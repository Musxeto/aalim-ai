  "title": "Is it permissible to draw starfish (for educational purposes)? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible to draw starfish or something like that if there is a educational purpose because we know that these are living creatures so the ruling on drawing living creatures is that once you see it you can see that there is life in it a starfish does not have facial features like an elephant like a fish like to my knowledge I know I don't see their eyes their face Etc therefore just the drawing in 2D not 3D 2D of these creatures is permissible especially if it is for educational purposes and Allah Knows Best"
