  "transcript": "okay um brother razi is asking about a question that we're frequently frequently asked about and that is i have a bank account so when i give zakat do i give zakat on the beginning of the year or at the end of the year meaning that i've opened my bank account today with 10 000 reals after a whole year i'll be having 50 000 reals so zakat is due now because i've been having this account for a whole year what should i pay it over the 10 000 or the 50 000 or should i take an average scholars say that zakat is due on the amount which you possess providing it exceeds the nisab which is the value of 595 grams of silver and it stays with you for a whole year and now nowadays it's quite difficult to calculate your zakat because the majority of muslims have monthly income their salaries or they have benefits coming to them in the first month so a whole year afterwards i would give 2.5 percent on what i've deposited on the first month the second month when i deposited the 2 000 reals i should give 2.5 percent of that on the second month a year later and likewise to what i deposited on the third month it would be the same now um brother razi's question so we have to pay the zakat for every month and this is almost difficult if not impossible because although i deposited 2 000 reals in the second month i've also taken 300 reals of that and then deposited another on the third month and also took portion of it and it keeps on going on and off so how do i calculate it scholars say that well this is the only way of doing it however if you would like to make life easy it is permissible in islam to offer the zakat before time it is forbidden to delay it but it's all permissible to offer it ahead of time so if my zakat is due in six months from today but i see someone who needs urgent help it is permissible for me to estimate that after six months i have to pay 3000 reals so i give the 3000 reals to that individual who needs the help and six months afterwards i calculate my money if if the zakat is more than 3 000 then the 3000 is already gone and whatever is more i have to pay it off if it's less alhamdulillah i gave three thousand and the remaining would be uh asada this way i would what that what i do is and what i advise uh brother razi to do is to come to the zakat and at the end of the year look and calculate what you have of assets in financial assets that is stocks or money in the bank and give 2.5 of whatever you have even if it came to your possession six months ago or four months ago it's okay this way you have this fixed date every year you don't have to look in what went in and what went out every year on that particular day look what you have and give 2.5 percent and this would do inshallah"
