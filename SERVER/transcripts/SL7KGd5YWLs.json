  "transcript": "foreign hmm islam now is taking a leap step to the future after 13 years of being oppressed tortured and sometimes killed the followers of the prophet alaihi wasallam finally got the chance to travel to a new state to a new city to a new place where they could worship allah azzawajal freely and with the support of the brothers from that country the prophet sallallahu alaihi through the last three years in mecca met men on the seasons of pilgrimage on the markets of the arabs presented his case recited the quran some of them accepted islam some of them rejected it but no one gave him the support and protection he needed two years before his migration to medina he met six men from the tribe of khazraj from yathrib from medina who were convinced of what he said and embraced islam on the spot he sent with them may allah be pleased with him who left who went to medina and started to call the people of medina and he succeeded in his mission the following year on the thirteenth year after the first revelation was given to the prophet 73 men and two women came and gave the second pledge of allegiance to the prophet salallahu sadina now it was a turning point soon afterwards the prophet salallahu sallam decided that his companions should migrate to medina and they went one by one among the very first to go even one of the great companions of the prophet and his brother who was breastfed with the prophet sallallahu alaihi by the maid of abu lahab also who went there before everyone else to prepare and and pave the way even um the blind man who the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was told by allah subhanahu ta'ala that he should not have turned his face from this blind man trying to call the dignitaries of quraish and instead he should have answered and attended the question of this blind man because he was a true believer of allah um and so many others tried and went to migrate to medina and succeeded but many have failed many have failed because the pagans would prevent them either by not allowing them to take their money in one case who was a slave and then was bought off and set free so me may allah be pleased with him wanted to migrate to medina so he left the pagans did not leave him alone they followed him until when he was in the middle of the way he told they told him that you cannot my great he told them why can't i migrate i am going to worship allah freely and i'm fleeing your country so what else do you want from me they told him we have to prevent you because you came to us as a beggar a poor man you did not have anything and over the years you managed to raise a fortune because he was a craftsman he used to make uh swords and so on a blacksmith or something of that kind so he told them after spreading all of his arrows that he had with his with him in his sack all pagans of mecca you know that i am among the greatest of you in archery if i shoot one of my arrows i usually hit a bull's-eye and by allah you come closer to me and i will shoot you with all the arrows that i have and then fight you with my sword until i die but if you want to save me and yourself the trouble i will tell you where i hid my money you can go there and you can claim and take it and i have no regret on that imagine when a slave when a poor man when a stranger works for so many years and after saving this much amount of money someone comes and takes it unreasonable and you are from scratch to begin again and what is the reason behind that just because you simply came to us out of arrogance you came to us poor and now you want you want to go rich no this is not possible i think in these days freeze the money of the muslims in in sudan and blast okay this is again a political issue where the non-muslims utilize their sources to harm the muslims in any which way they can for example hamas they have frozen their accounts worldwide but to their surprise they did not have that much accounts because all that what they had was invested in palestine to the palestinian people also what we hear nowadays whenever someone is in the position of opposing the superpowers or the europeans or so on they use this method with him they freeze his assets and to tell you the truth i think that the muslims deserve what they get why do you invest why do you put your money in their banks as long as you don't have anything to fear but usually the tyrants and those who embezzle and those who steal from the treasuries of their countries take these money and hide it in swiss banks so that one day if they had to flee and go away and run from their crimes they would have a place safe for them to stay so haybar rumi showed them where his money was and they left him and he went to medina the minute he reached madinah the prophet salallahu sallam because he traveled and migrated after the prophet sallam the prophet told him you have succeeded in your trade abbas whose name was he told him that it was indeed a successful transaction because you gave them this worldly money but you've gained your freedom and you made your migration which meant that the price he paid was everything that he ever owned in his life this is a successful treat of course he was trading with allah because he migrated and left everything so the first thing they tried is to block the money and prevent them from taking their money the pagans the second thing was trying to stop them from taking their wives and children in this exactly what happened with and abu salama may allah be pleased with them both wanted to migrate with her husband when the husband went she wanted to go she was faced with the family of her husband and her own family al-murira and each one of them prevented her from going for her family the tribe of they said we cannot allow you to go and follow your husband you stay with us and she had a small child with her the family of the of the husband the family of abi salemma said that well if she cannot go then the boy stays with us because the boy has to go with his father and we will not keep him with you and your tribe and they started pulling the boy until the boy's arm was dislocated he was a child and they took the child away from her her husband's family and she spent once every single day she goes to the border of mecca from a morning time until the evening crying until the sunset and goes going back because she was deprived of her husband she cannot follow him and she was deprived of her child until she was met by uh uh athman even a shaby who saw her once and she or the family her family felt sorry for her before that and they said well okay after seeing the situation you have reached seeing your crying and tear and weeping they felt soft for her they told her you may leave and follow your husband and when the family of her husband saw this they gave her back her child and told her okay then if you are allowed to to go and and follow your husband then you may take your son so she took a camel and she wrote on the camera with her son and went outside of mecca she did not know the road and she was on her own a female with a child traveling at a this distance it could have taken them two or three days that was too much so one of the dignitaries and noble people of makkah saw her and he was uthmanim talha a sheibi one of the people that the prophet sallam gave the key of the kaaba too so he told her where are you going oh daughter of abe she told him i'm going to follow my husband in medina he looked at her and said on your own this is something that cannot be accepted and he guided her to medina she is telling us by allah i have never seen a companion more honorable than him he never talked to me and he were look never looked at me and whenever we wanted to rest he would do something with the camel so that it would go on us down and sit on its four feet and then he would retreat and give his back to me and ask me to dismount and whenever i dismounted he used to go and take the saddle off the camel feed it water it take care of it while i am away from him also he he was non-muslim he was not a muslim but i'm going to continue inshallah just after the break if you're 18 or if you're 80 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hoodah.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you exactly as you've mentioned uthman event was not a muslim yet he was an arab which meant that he had the pride in him that he had the jealousy in him that he had the generosity and bravery to do whatever a gallant man would do he took um and her child to medina and just what as he was at the outskirts of medina he told her there is your husband's house and he left her and went back to mecca who would do such a brave and courageous thing like this by the way utman evan was or became a muslim afterwards on the day of fatih the conqueror of mecca and the prophet sallam gave him the key to the kaaba as it was in his ancestors to take care of the kaaba so the pagans tried to stop them by taking their money by preventing them from having their children and wives and by tricking them this happened with um may allah be pleased with him and uh even they all agreed to go and migrate to medina together but they didn't want the pagans to know about it so they had a rendezvous and they said that we will meet on this area at this particular hour and if any one of us does not show up this means that he was prevented and we will the rest will go on their way when um went there he only met ayashi nabirabiya and they knew that hashem could not make it and actually was prevented from accompanying them and he was tortured afterwards and so many things happened to him they all migrated to medina and just as ayash reached medina with umar came to him abu jahl and another one of his companions telling him that your mother has sworn not to eat anything or drink until she she sees you and ayash loved his mother a lot omar warned him this is a trick they're going to take you away and then they're going to torture you until you abandon the deen the religion of islam he told him no no it's not going to be like this i trust them and it's only that i will go and comfort my mother and tell her that everything is fine and come back omar kept on warning him i know these people you know them they don't say the truth they're going to betray you he insisted when umar felt that there was no hope in convincing him he told him then i will give you my camel which is the fastest camel around if you felt anything fishy just kick the camel and it will immediately get you back here so ayash went with them and in the middle of the way abu jahl or one of the the two men told him that your your camel is very strong uh my camera is getting tired can i uh ride with you certainly that's true it's a strong camel and the minute he got next to him they tied him and they took him to makkah with their trick they did this with so many people either preventing them by taking their belongings the prophet salallahu himself was the pride of his property and whatever he had in mecca and that was clear when he came in the father of mecca and they told him do you want to go to your house or prophet he told them did his cousin leave us any property the minute we migrated he took everything to himself which means that even the prophet salallahu was deprived of his property so most of the companions were beginning to migrate to medina when the pagans saw this they've realized that now this is a really serious issue because muhammad if he succeeds allah in moving to medina he would have a muslim state and he would have a power able to threaten our interests and maybe expand more and more so they were determined to kill him they were determined to assassinate the prophet israel the books of shira tells us a lot of stories some are authentic and some are not one of the most famous stories that it was the satan's advice to them because his family his tribe was a very noble one and a strong one so they felt that if they killed him what would happen the people his tribes will call for his blood which means that someone has to die for that so satan gave them an idea and he told them that select one tough strong man from each tribe and you have a collection of 13 15 men and then let them all go and attack muhammad and kill him with their swords so when his tribe wants to call and ask and demand for his blood they would find that his blood is has been had been scattered in the older tribes they went there they gathered at his doorsteps allah azzawajal told him that they're after your blood so he asked his cousin alibaba to sleep in his place and cover himself pretending that it is him and he took a handful of dust and sand and he threw it over their heads and he walked right between them and they could not see him it's a miracle it's one of the miracles that the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam had the prophet then went to the house of abu bakr a ish pleased with her said that the prophet used to visit abu bakr's house in the morning and just before nightfall but on that day he came in the middle of the day and this was before the attempt of assassination of course he told abu bakr when he saw him the prophet came covering his face so that nobody would recognize him and the prophet sallallahu came into the house asked abu bakr to let out whoever was in the room so abba said oh prophet of allah they are your family it's my wife and my children so you have nothing to fear so the prophet saw assalam told him oh abu bakr allah has given me the permission to migrate to medina so the first thing that jumped to abu bakr's mind was the companionship or prophet of allah can i come with you can i accompany you so the prophet saw sallam approved him and agreed to him so he burst into tears out of joy because of this great honor aisha may allah please with her said i've never seen anyone cry out of joy except this time this was the first for me to see someone crying out of joy just indicate great love to the prophet muhammad indeed no one loved the prophet salallahu shallam more than abu bakr and the prophet sallam had never ever loved anyone from the companions more than abu bakr we are told amras who was one of the enemy enemies of islam once he reverted to islam and accepted it he said there wasn't a time that i have had seen the prophet islam without him smiling in my face this is the nature of the prophet whenever he sees someone else he smiles in his face but thought that the prophet sallallahu alaihi liked him and respected him more than the other companions though he was only six months or one year in islam so he says i approached the prophet i told him o prophet of allah whom among the people that you love most so he said aisha so am said well i missed this one no no let me rephrase i mean from men who is the most man among all the companions i want all the people that you love most so he said her father and that is abu bakr al-assad only then amras knew that it was not him so he left this issue abu bakr had enormous love for the prophet alice of sam as the prophet salallahu himself had great love and respect to abu bakr so abu bakr immediately said o prophet of allah i have two camels take one of them it's a gift the prophet said no way i have to pay you for this because this is a form of worship i am migrating to allah and this has to be from my own pocket and he accepted that this was the preliminary stages for hijra they had assured their a right they had assured and ensured that they had a guide because they had abdullah had been who was not a muslim at the time but he was a knowledgeable person of the ways and the roots to medina and they needed a guide and also the prophet sallallahu alaihi ensured that abdullah ibn abi bakr would bring them the news of what's going on in medina and amir bin fuhrer who was a slave and servant of abu bakr would take the shepherd the sheep and every now and then at the beginning of the day at the end of the day give them some milk of it as if he was caring for his sheep not as if he know knew where they were on that designated night the prophet sallam and abu bakr left makkah headed to the cave called the cave of thor and they stayed there for three nights the people of mecca were on their heels they were trying their best to locate them because they had a problem if he succeeds in fleeing mecca this means the end of quraysh and the ends the end of their idols they knew that he will prevail so they put a bounty on his head and everybody was looking and to the extent that they once reached to that cave where the prophet was hiding with his companion abu bakr but unfortunately we have to stop here and insha'allah when we meet next time we will continue with the great story of the hijrah of the prophet until then allah"
