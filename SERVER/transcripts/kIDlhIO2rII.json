  "title": "Is it permissible to make dua in the first tashahhud based upon the hadith? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sorry I got to start thr um so the prophet Islam said and I quote when you sit following every two then say that and so on and so forth then choose any supplication that you like and call Allah the almighty with it end quote shik albani writes under this authentic Hadith in his commentary and I quote this Hadith shows a tremendous benefit and it is the permissibility of supplicating after the first T and I did not find any other imams other than Imam who had this Viewpoint and he was correct so what is apparent is that it is permissible to supplicate in every tah even if followed by saying Salam and quote Shake um based on this authentic evidence what I wanted to ask you was would it be considered bid or an innovation if I were to make a supplication after the first theah and all my obligatory and optional and prayers first of all the Hadith is crystal clear but it does not indicate whether this is the first tah or the second T so those who said it is in any tah as you've quoted about albani and Imam they have an Evidence however if you look at the other evidences you will find that the prophet Alat wasam used to offer in the first and he was very quick in it as per thei of may Allah be pleased with him and others so he used to immediately stand up without giving any time for Dua or taking his time in it so the first tah by Nature by Sunnah is very prompt and quick which indicates that there was no time for Dua alongside the issue that the vast majority of Scholars state that this Hadith is particularly referring to the last tah which is followed by Salam so it's not the first tah rather it's the last tah and I've asked some of the major Scholars about this and they stated what I just did therefore if a person is on his own I would say that it is not recommended to do it and he should delay it until the last tah if he's praying behind an Imam and the Imam takes his time in the first tah then he may uh um supplicate and make Dua according to this Hadith rather than sitting there idle doing nothing but if he's on his own then it's best to be with the majority of the scholars and delay it to the last tah and Allah Knows Best"
