  "transcript": "alaykum um many Muslims nowadays take part in doing Vick in congregation um and they do this by turning the lights off sitting together and doing things like that um they say that it's supported by Quran and Sunnah and I just wanted to find out whether any of you shakes have heard of any Hadith that supports this claim it is not supported by the Quran nor the Sunnah it is an innovation and there are or original Innovations and there are extra Innovations so part of the extra Innovations is when you come to two different things and you combine them to have the result of a third thing so for example the prophet saysat in the authentic Hadith the prayer of two men is far superior than the prayer of one man and the prayer of three men is superior to the prayer of two which indicates that the more the congregation is the more the reward is this is well established right now you look at another Hadith and you find that the Sunnah of the Prophet is to pray two R after after two after two before four before two after 12 during the day and night this is Sunnah and whoever does this and preserves this Allah will build him a house in Jenna so one uh person trying to come up with something new he says okay let's combine both after we pray Isa don't leave the IM would say allahar and you pray two in congregation what are you doing so I'm we're praying sunah of the is prayer but why you doing it in congregation because the prophet said it's better so is this an innovation or not this is an innovation how do you know it's an innovation it's very simple whoever comes with such a thing we would say to him did the prophet do itam the answer is no did the companions do it do it may Allah be pleased with them the answer is no then it is an innovation so follow what the prophet used to doat he never ever did the uh uh Vick in congregation after finishing the prayers never ever and why wouldn't we do it yeah what it's not personal huh it isn't anything P personal between us and making in congregation if it was there in the Sunnah we would we would have done it we would have encouraged people to do it but because the prophet did not do it we say it is an innovation and Allah knows rest"
