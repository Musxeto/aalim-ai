  "transcript": "al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam ala muhammad and allah ameen nabina muhammad in water or sahbihi ajma'in and back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to a different field other than wiping on the socks something that is related to removing impurities and we have the Haditha of Ali may Allah be pleased with him and I will read this hadith myself Adi may Allah be pleased with him said that I used to get emotional urethral discharge frequently known as methi or prosthetic fluid and being the son-in-law of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam I was embarrassed to ask him so I requested a miracle dad even as well to ask him so he did and the prophet sallallaahu re where he seldom said to him he should wash his penis and perform ablution in another narration of Muslim it contains the words perform ablution and sprinkle some water on your private parts this hadith is referring to a substance that is discharged from humans once they are emotionally involved intimate or they're aroused by something they see the here it's emotional feeling which happens with the opposite sex usually however what comes out of a private part has different categories we have urine which is nauseous we have what is known as Mavi ma th I may V which is a white substance that is a little bit sticky that comes out usually after seeing something that arouses you sexually we have many and many is semen which usually comes out with ejaculation with pleasure with less than desire through intercourse nocturnal emission or ejaculation in different ways then we have what is known as woody waa di it's a yellowish sticky substance that usually comes after urinating caused by usually carrying heavy things too much heavy for you this comes out or in extreme cold weather this discharge comes all of the four are considered to be images impure with the exception of semen semen or many is pure and we will get into this inshallah later on so Ali who was married to Fatima the daughter of the prophet Alastair am huge with people who are sexually strong get this often and Ali was one of those so he was ashamed he was embarrassed how can I go to the Prophet I just wanna tell him I'm having this knowing that I'm married to his daughter so he sent and make that and when he asked the Prophet the Prophet as I knew who sent him so he told him tell him he did not say you should he told him tell him that the Prophet I some knew what was happening and he is the father of all Muslims so you should not be embarrassed of him because he will tell you he will guide you so the Prophet Ali salatu salam instructed him to wash his private part and to perform ablution in another narration prinkle water over your private parts and this is why when looking at all these different narrations scholars say that ma vie is among the minimum types of Nagase remember it and wayback programs we mentioned that Nagase is divided into how many three one maximum one middle and one minimum the maximum would be people are asleep the maximum no what would we do when a dog licks into your pot how many times do you wash it once with soil and seven times with water this means that it is not normal impurity it is maximum impurity maximum Natasa unlike in other nodosa middle natasha is the normal impurities such as urine deification blood of menses it said to all what you have to do is wash it clean it wash it again that's it so washing it is necessarily seven times no once or twice maybe maximum three times and it's all clean the minimum measures would be maybe no before that how quick you guys forget the urine of a boy child who did not eat who was only dependent on suckling on the milk a male child what we do with this we just sprinkle water we don't have to wash it and rub it and squeeze it and put water only doing this and Maddy Maddy is the same thing you just sprinkle it and that is it and for the private parts you also sprinkle water or wash your private parts all together but the traces on the body or on the clothes you just sprinkle it why do I wash the private part scholars say because this is sexual desire and it cools down if you wash the whole organ of your private part now do women have this as well the answer is yes women have this as well it's a different form to men and women have another thing that is different which is continuous discharge they have this discharge from the morning until the evening all the time and they usually ask what should we do does this nullify our woudl do we have to change our clothes the most authentic opinion is that the women who get this this is not a disease this is not an illness it is like sweating so these discharges are pure however they have to perform woudl whenever they have them or want to pray but due to its continuous e due to the fact that it is always continuous so some scholars say that if a woman performs woudl forfeiture and she's still having these discharges and she is still state of voodoo until the her and she did not nullify her wudu with other than this discharge she did not pass when she did not you she did not defecate she did not sleep she did not eat camel's meat if this is the case then her water is still intact and she may pray again but it is highly recommended that she prays with and you will do for every prayer every mandatory prayer between the two mandatory prayers she can do whatever she wants without performing would look again very well a question I don't know if you can help me in this or not if I don't have water can I use Eastridge MA with Maddie can I use hard substances stones toilet paper wood to clean myself from heavy like urine no you cannot because the Prophet Alice Aslam singled out water and he said he has to wash his private parts with water and sprinkle water on the clothes or whatever so scholars say it is not sufficient to treat it as urine or when you pass stool you cannot use hard substances you must use water to clean that hadith number 25 the hadith of Abdullah just a question in that reference what happens when you don't have water do you do them or them definitely yes Zach Lockley who will read the hadith yes Kaleem narrated a bad Binta mean abdullah bin zaid been awesome almani asked the Prophet about a person who feels to have passed wind during the prayer a las apostle reply salallahu alayhi wasalam he should not leave from the prayer until or unless he hears a sound or smelled something okay now this hadith is a great hadith for those who have whispers of Shaitaan the Prophet was asked about a situation when a person is in prayer and he feels that something came out of him now this person is usually having these thoughts every single prayer and it is destroying his life because whenever he has this feeling what does he do he go make food oh and come back again and a while later what happens he gets the feeling he goes back to make wudu and come back again and it keeps on going and going and going until it destroys his life I was once in Damascus Syria and I went to pray in one of the messages so I went to make woudl next to me a man was doing Woodill we exchanged smiles we went to the salah there weren't so many people in the masjid he and I started prayer 10 20 seconds he said assalamualaikum warahmatullah and he went in few minutes later he came but a little bit further because people came I could notice by the way he said Allah Akbar what happened mrs. Shalala is what I'm going to tell you after the break so stay tuned I said I'm already come and welcome back the man I was talking to you about just before the break went in and out of prayer 10 times making wudu coming back Samsung and goes and makes after the prayer has been over he came also a few times doing this with the other Jumeirah and making good one come back why because Chapin was controlling his life and when Shaitaan controls your life and you're not following the Quran and Sunnah you'll be doomed and destroyed so those who have these feelings the Prophet said a lustrum do not leave your prayer until you hear a sound or find the smell meaning that it has to be concrete evidence this is those who are having these whispers but for you and I normal people who never have these doubts in their prayer if someone well is in prayer 100% is sure that a past winter odorless and soundless would he say I'm going to continue no now in your case you're 100% sure the Prophet is addressing those who are doubtful if you're doubtful in a prayer you don't leave and this is one of the greatest rules of Islam what is it a loss loop vaca or shaky anima who are they what does that mean roughly translated to the things are as they are unchanged until changed by something that is certain so doubts can never remove certainty doubts can never remove certainty now if you understand this rule well my life will be much easier for you but you have to understand it and I'll give you examples that would make it a shallow understandable what do we mean by saying that things are as they are unchanged I'll tell you I'm fasting and without knowing I ate does this break my fast why because it was not done intentionally and the thing remains as it is it's nighttime the event of fire has not been cold so I eat and I drink and I eat and I drink and I eat and I drink after a while someone calls me and he says Fletcher was not cold because the speakers are not on but it was time half an hour ago and I did not know so scholars say your fasting is okay why I was eating they said because the night was still continuous and you're not sure that it is gone so the night remains as it is still not clear I'll make it clear a man makes wudu in his house goes to work it is time for Doha he goes to the Masjid as he enters the Masjid shaitaan comes to him and says are you in the state of voodoo didn't you pass went didn't you go to the toilet and the man scratches his head said I don't remember what do we do you tell me applying the rule I told you arching you can offer your salon Shallah without the rule you can offer your salon without who do who shares this opinion one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven who differs one two three four nazar buy why because he's in the state of yes is his widow correct or wrong is there I'm saying who isn't I said who is not sharing this opinion who says that he has to make wudu yeah I say he doesn't help yeah no no no I want I want to hear from those who say he must make wudu again yes please speak to the microphone and slowly so I can understand I I mean there is a doubt I demand in his mind so whatever is in the mind I mean it should get clear because no this is completely against this hadith because there is the element of doubt what do we do with the doubt because we throw it away see this is what the hadith is about and this is what the rule I told you about the things remain as they are unchanged because there isn't anything certain to change them so the wouldl is accepted it's authentic now let me reverse this someone goes out of his house what goes to work lower time he goes to the Machine and says did I make you or not oh my I don't remember did I make wudu or not what do we do he has to make what why because what is certain he didn't make good oh now the doubt is did I make or didn't I because of this doubt we cast it and he remains as he is not making wudu the first one he definitely made wudu but the doubt is did he noona fight or not so we cast the doubt and said no you still are in the state of wooden so this hadith is extremely important for us to look for and to apply in all our lives in every forms of bad even in prayer even in prayer look the Prophet says in the authentic hadith re salat wa salam whenever someone prays of you and he's in doubt did I pray two or three what does he do the Prophet says in the hadith he should build his prayer on what is certain and he should cast the doubt away this is the Prophet saying and complete your prayer so which one is the doubt the free the whole the third one these two I am certain I've paid them this one is the doubt what does the Prophet say throw it in the dustbin neglected and continue your prayer as for then offer your tisha hood and then prostrate for forgetfulness and then offer your Salaam and we will come to mention this in sha Allah when we reach the SuJu this ah-hoo because forgetfulness sujood prostration can be before salam and it can be after salam there are different scenarios for it we will explain that easily insha'Allah we move on to hadith number 26 who will be kind enough to read it for us yes man I did um case bent a machine I brought my young son who had not started eating ordinary food to a los Messenger may peace be upon him who took him and made him sit in his lap the child you donated on the garment of the Prophet may peace be upon him so he asked for water and poured it over the garment and it and did not wash it okay continued the following hadith number 27 as well narrated I shot the mother of faithful believers a male child was brought to a los prophet may peace be upon him and it you needed on the garment of the Prophet the Prophet asks for water and poured it over the soiled place okay so this is an emphasis to what we mentioned before and that is the urine of a child who did not eat who is dependent on his mother's milk his urine is one of the minimum types of natascha because we don't have to wash it we simply pour water on it or sprinkle it and that is it while the same age if a girl urinates then you have to wash it as and treat it as the urine of an adult why is that scholars have different opinions some say because the passage is different and others say that a male has this heat in him that burns all the food so the result which is the urine is very less in ingredients and material than the female others say this others say that some scholars say because men love to carry or people love to carry boys boys are more favorable than girls and that is why they often carry boys and they often urinate so it's difficult for them to wash while girls they seldomly carry and I find this very strange because I love to carry girls more than I love to carry boys boys are so horrendous they're wild they pull your beer they punch you in the nose little girls are so cute so lovable so yeah embraceable very nice to get to carry so all of these justifications do not have basis in the sense that it is not backed by the cornerstone and therefore we just take it as it is a prophet instructed us to do this I stopped we do this and we follow it so with this we conclude inshallah if you have any questions yes ma'am Sheikh this is regarding passing of the winning Salah because of lack of knowledge or embarrassment even if people pass when in the Salah you don't break and go and go out of the Salah some scholars say that those who break their voodoo those who pass wind while in the Salah yet continue to pray they have notified their prayer not only that they have nullified their Islam it's an act of apostasy they say some scholars why now while in the middle of the prayer you pass wind so you're not in the state of purity who are you bowing to and prostrating to and doing a particular motion with the congregation what are you doing it for what's answer Allah you're not doing it for Allah you're not in the seat of Voodoo you're convincing the others so it's an act of shirk they say because you're praying not to Allah but for them this is what some scholars say however it may be it has some legitimacy to it but what to do he don't be embarrassed of the people be embarrassed of Allah Azza WA JAL and therefore if the hadith the authentic hadith says that if someone passes when during prayer he should put his soap or his garment over his mouth as if he is nose bleeding and he should leave prayer so if someone does this while you're praying and breaks the rose and goes you will think that he has a nose bleeding in this way you would have escaped embarrassment I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time ta Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
