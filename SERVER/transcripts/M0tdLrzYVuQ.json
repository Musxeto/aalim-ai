  "transcript": "sh uh my question is uh in India it is a compulsory subject to chemistry is a compulsory subject to get admission in a medical course in chemistry you know there are so many chemical formulas with subscript and superscript to denot number of atom in a molecule like in Formula H2O two denotes two hydrogen atom in a water molecule my question is it sh or Haram to write the number in the base of a alphabet like that or which we call subscript why would it be shik can may I ask uh Shake I don't know in you know in some cases in some simple cases I feel is it sh or not and I get confused and I feel a fear in my heart that if it is s then I how what what is the meaning of shik Muhammad what is meant by shik uh associating partners with Allah okay so when you mix uh this with that where is the shik no uh is it to write uh something uh you know a letter in the base of alphabet like that H2O the two is in the base of the letter H is it some because I sometime I feel that am I worshiping the letter H then I feel is it sh hi what where is the shik in pronouncing hydrogen whether it's two or three or 10 where is the shik in saying hydrogen two no writing the two in the base of the letter H is was is it sh and this is my question where is the sh let me ask you another question is asking me about something shik or not because you're asking someone other than Allah is that shik yes or no uh no why oh now you're confused you see the definition of shik and kufur is totally distorted in your head you have no idea what is the meaning of shik and how to associate others with Allah what does the number two or the number 10 or the number 100 has to do with shik when you write it under the H or even under the name of Allah not H hyro hydrogen or oxygen or whatever substance you're writing in chemistry this has nothing to do with shik this is shatan messing up with your head and if you continue to allow him to do this you will very very soon leave Islam you will leave the fold of Islam I'm I'm telling you because I do counseling sessions like this and I've seen people like you without knowing what is the definition of without knowing whated is people have no idea about Islam they look Muslims they may pray they may fast they have zero knowledge ofed and whenever you speak to them about oh he's a wahabi you don't even know what the basics of Islam what is what is what is and even if you know them theoretically practically in your life they're not implemented unfortunately in the vast majority of the Muslims they don't trust Allah they don't have Reliance on Allah they don't invoke Allah they don't fear Allah they don't have hope in Allah all of these things are part ofed when you don't know it then you fall into these Whispers And little games of Shan that would totally destroy your Islam what to do Sheik at the moment moment you have to study your religion how go to my YouTube channel there's a playlist by the name of the three fundamentals The three principal fundamentals The three principal fundamentals and it gives you a very very introduction uh um summary ofed but it is extremely essential for each and every Muslim to know this book written by no other than she Imam Muhammad Abdul wahab may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the greatest little booklets that SN you with Islam with Quran and the Sunnah it's not rocket science it's all Quran and Sunnah going back to the roots going back to what the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam taught us"
