  "transcript": "Um so sometimes I might not concentrate in the and I say I might say like subhanim without intending to do it and um that is something a problem that I have. So do I have to repeat it again? When you say subhim are you saying it while in the position? Yeah no problem. But I don't intend it. No no no no. This is something that happens by default in because if you open the door for shan to say to you, oh you said Allah abbar but you didn't intend it repeat the salah. You'll end up repeating the salah 50 times a day and this is will this will drive you crazy. This will drive you off the wall. No, you've said it in the correct position. Whether you were tentative or not, it doesn't make any difference. Try your level best next time, but don't repeat it."
