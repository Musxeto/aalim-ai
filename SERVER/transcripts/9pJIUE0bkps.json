  "title": "Will Angels & Jinn also go to Paradise? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says will angels and jinn also go to paradise as for the jinn we know that they will enter paradise because allah azzawajal created the jinn and the humans to worship him and the prophet alaihis was sent to the jinn and to the humans as well and allah tells us in surat al-rahman that there are the in paradise who've not been touched by neither jinn or humans which means that the jinn and the humans will enjoy the in paradise so they are accountable like us humans and they are told to pray and to fast and to perform hajj like us the humans they have their own world and they will be admitted to jannah as well as for the angels we were not told about whether they are to be rewarded in jannah like the humans and the jinn or not and whatever we don't have info about the muslims simply refrain we know that the angels are obedient servants of allah that never disobey him and never go against his commands and never act out of their own will rather they do exactly what they are told and this means that they are not like us or like the jinn where we are given a test and we are told to do this or to do that and we are to be punished and tormented in hell if we disobey and we will be rewarded uh with allah's blessings in paradise if we were to comply the angels are not tested in this fashion they are by their nature obedient servants of allah that never disobey him where will they be rewarded in jannah this is something only allah knows and it's not to us to discuss such issues and allah knows best"
