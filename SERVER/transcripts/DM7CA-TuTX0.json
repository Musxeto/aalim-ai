  "transcript": "uh wearing mascaras or eyeliners to uh the eye lashes so this is different from wearing eyeliners to to the eye itself which is known as K the uh mascaras are two types I'm not that good in in these things but they are theoretically two types one that is waterproof and they advertise this like any other makeup they say that this is waterproof this means that when you wash your face uh uh if you have the foundation if you have any shades on it or any makeup if it's waterproof meaning that the water would not penetrate this layer and will not reach to your skin this means that your wo is invalid so if these eyeliners that you put on your eyelashes are waterproof this means that you have a layer that is preventing water from reaching the eyelashes and your woodo is incorrect but if it is not waterproof and it washes off when you wash your face in this case or it allows it's transparent that to the extent that it allows water to go in and reach uh down in this case your woodoo is correct inshallah"
