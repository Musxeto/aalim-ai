  "title": "If I don't correct imam in prayer am I sinful What if I'm uncertain if it was a mistake Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "so if someone is praying behind the imam with many people or maybe even a few people and the imam is reading out loud and he makes a mistake and this person doesn't correct him is he sinful or responsible for the prayer of everyone else or is something optional to correct me why didn't he correct the imam maybe because he thought he wasn't sure about the ayah maybe they love you better or maybe because you didn't want to call us in this case there's no sin on you if you're not certain better be safe than sorry so if a person hears the imam making a mistake if he's 100 percent certain that this is a mistake he must correct him and if he doesn't he would be sinful but if he's 99 percent certain there is a room for one percent of error no keep silent because you may say something and then discover that it was wrong and it's best to be safe rather than sorry but if you're 100 percent certain that he's he had made a mistake you have to correct him and this is an obligation upon you and allano's best"
