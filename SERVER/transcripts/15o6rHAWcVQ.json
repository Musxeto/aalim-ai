  "transcript": "by having a whip at the back so my question is are we allowed to lie about our good deeds in order to protect ourselves from being a real or something like this because uh in the regular Muslim said he never witnessed Allah other than the three situation which is in war or to bring peace or between wife and husband so are we allowed to lie to someone saying that no no I'm not fasting today just I don't want to eat that's all okay thank you the Hadith is authentic but I don't know if it's by even shihab because I don't know who the narrator is uh the Hadith is authentic it is not permissible to lie except in three situations so these situations are in war number two when reconciling between two fighting individuals or factions to reconcile between them number three uh spouse lying to his or her spouse in things that would increase the Imam the love between them so your wife says am I beautiful assistant you get a smack on your face and you will not be able to see for five days until this one is gone I tried this so many times so don't try it at home she says am I beautiful Allah I don't know when you ask me this question she comes to you in a dress am I beautiful the dress is always going to break you know because of her overweight but you say I don't know is the dress making you beautiful or you're making the dress beautiful this would give you six months pass you can do whatever you want so this kind of lying is halal but when you expand it then you say okay can I lie when my father says did you pray in the Masjid when my father says did you do your homework and you didn't now here lying is Haram so what to do the prophet said in Arabic means to camouflage your answer not just any straightly answer someone says Sheikh do you smoke or did you smoke and you say and you did smoke for example and you say who in his right mind would smoke Palace did I lie I didn't likewise the prophet one was asking which tribe are you from he said first of all tell us how many were the army of quraish and the man told them that he said okay now you answer my question which tribe from Quran she says from water is the name of well The Well of uh um Kuala Lumpur The Well of Perles the will of this meaning as a location but the prophet meant that we are from water meaning semen like all humans are born from water so the prophet did not lie and he left Alexan so whenever you're asked something that you cannot answer Dodge the question some people come to me and say Sheikh I propose to a woman last week and I asked her if she was a virgin or not or she did she have relationship or not what kind of a man is he and I say to sisters who ask me this question a proposal came and the man asked me this what should I do so he came out or at least let your father kick him out no reputable woman would accept such a question even if she had a relationship any woman who had a relationship she should conceal it between her and Allah was forgiving was merciful someone asks you you don't answer so what do I do you kick him out he's not worthy this guy is an up case in three four months you're gonna come to me in counseling I know I'm gonna get rich I'm gonna pay the down payment of my boat inshallah I don't know so no avoid this totally inshallah so lying now there are cases that may not be mentioned in the three but logic indicates that they should fall I'm in my house someone is running away from a cafe who wants to kill him or from an oppressor and I know this guy is innocent or at least he is a passerby he comes and hides in my house and the killer comes and says is so-and-so in your house Allah don't lie I'm killing him no you have to lie in this to save a soul so this is higher it's it's greater than the three mentioned and you have to do the math all right thank you very much"
