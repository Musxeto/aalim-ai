  "transcript": "if I want to get one Zod Academy but the problem is I don't know Arabic fluently so how could I learn Arabic in the best way possible and in a Dean from the UK his first question how to perfect the language the arabic language arabic like any other language it depends on a number of factors number one your interest in it and this constitutes the vast majority of the problem if you have a strong interest in a language you can pick it up easily if you're not motivated if you're being pushed by your parents or your teacher to study it while you don't like it then it is gonna be a difficult task so if you have the motivation and you have the interest in it this may be is seventy percent of the difficulty is gone after that you have to learn a lot of the vocabulary so a lot of the time people make the common mistakes of focusing on grammar which is good but it is not the language so if I know that the subject has to come in the beginning and then the verb and then the object this wouldn't help me if I go to a rest restaurant and tell them this rule of grammar if I don't know how to say chicken soup I'm gonna starve or at least I have to behave in an act like a chicken so that they would understand so vocabulary is very important and this comes by listening and reading so when you read a lot of Arabic and you try to know the roots of these words where are they stemmed from and you listen and you hear it being spoken especially if you relate this to the Quran and to the Sunna this becomes much easier but there isn't any easy way of doing it sometimes you may need to read a lot of newspapers so that okay if you read the English newspapers you know what had happened in Minnesota a couple of days ago and then you read the Arabic newspaper and you read the same article you can compare and relate the Arabic words to the English words and this is how you improve your vocabulary but it will take some time"
