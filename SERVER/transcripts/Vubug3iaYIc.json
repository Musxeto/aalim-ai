  "transcript": "me of mercy to the world's and he tried to convince him to prolong and renew the agreement again and the prophet sallam did not give him a straight answer he went to abu bakr and tried to convince abu bakr to talk to the prophet sallam but again a worker could not give him any reply he went to omar he went to ali and that he told him something that was soft and when he went back to his people and asked him what happened when he told them they told him he was playing with you he didn't give you an answer so what what are you happy for he did not give you any answer straight answer for prolonging the agreement the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam supplicated to allah that all the spies all the eyes observing and monitoring the root that they would not see him coming so that his attack to makkah would be a surprise complete surprise and allah subhanahu ta'ala the almighty answered his prayer the prophet sallallahu alaihi al-islam ordered his companions to mobilize and within hours an army of 10 000 people were ready to go wherever the prophet sallam instructed them to go these people were from medina they were from also uh the tribes who reverted and accepted islam around medina from johanna from zaina from different places they made this army of 10 000 soldiers ready to attack whomever the prophet sallam orders them to do and if we compare this army to the army that went to makkah on the truth of her debia how how many were there 1400 they were 1400 and now they are 10 000 which means that the period of one year and few months added value to the muslims so this truce indeed was a victory to islam and to the muslims because everyone was able to ask about islam debate dialogue and then accept islam so the number of muslims grew rapidly to unbelievable proportions and the prophet sallam did not tell anyone of his heading he just asked them to mobilize can we say that the meccan image of the umrah which the muslims went with the prophet a year later of the agreement of hadabaya and making that pilgrimage in front of the other you know policies uh was it like an advertisement or something for the non-muslims to know about islam or was it like one of the reasons to know for the others to learn about islam and come and ask about it unfortunately it was not pilgrimage it was umrah had it been on the season of pilgrimage then yes because the season of pilgrimage all polytheists come from all over arabia to perform pilgrimage but not on the islamic principles rather on the old principles of abraham peace be upon him which was polluted and corrupted with idol worshipping so yes it was form of advertising but it was not as good as the messengers that the prophet sent to different regions of arabia and outside of arabia calling people to islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam did not tell his companions where he was headed until it was the d-day so they went out and he told them that we are going to besiege makkah the holy lands one of the companions of the prophet allah salaam and his name was we've heard this name so many times as he was the head of a number of expeditions military expeditions and he himself was a messenger of the prophet sallam calling a people to islam he himself did something that would be considered nowadays as treason and grant reason that should be punished by capital punishment he did something that was very offensive to the extent that um may allah be pleased with him requested the prophet allah to behead him though himself was one of the soldiers in the battle of badr yes and we know that allah had forgiven the sins of all of those who participated in badr may allah be pleased with him did something but allah revealed to his messenger that thing the prophet sallam called zubair his cousin his other cousin and and told them you have to ride immediately and go to a garden by the name of hach on the way to makkah there you will find a woman she has a letter to the people of mecca bring the letter and come back to me so they went and they found the woman exactly where the prophet sallam had told them and she was a very old woman in her 60s so they requested the letter from her and she denied i don't have anything so again they repeated their request please give us the letter and she again said i don't have anything i don't know what you're talking about as zubair may allah be pleased with him told her listen we did not say a lie and we were not lied to our prophet told us that you have a letter now you either give it to us or we're going to strip to you strip you and search you and once she saw determination in their eyes she took the letter from her braids and gave it to them they wrote back to the prophet and in his court there was the companions of the prophet there was omar and there was hatred and the prophet sallam showed the letter to hatham now the normal thing would be is chop his head off but again the prophet is teaching us never do something and regret it later on ask try to investigate and once you reach a verdict then act according to the knowledge you have so the prophet sallam may peace be and praise of allah be upon him fair and just brought hatha and told him how to what is this so hatha said o prophet of allah by allah i did not betray allah and his messenger and i did not reject islam you know me i'm a muslim i'm a believer i'm your companion and by allah i know that allah will make you prevail and will grant you victory over the polytheist but all your companions had their families had their tribes in mecca so they all had people to go back to i was the only one who my family came from outside of makkah and we're not originally from mecca so i knew that you will be granted victory from allah azza and you will be victorious so i wanted to score a point with the people of makkah i wanted to show them that i was there for their help and rescue though it would not add any value to them but this would help me in the future that whenever they remember what i had done to them they would hold it a form of being grateful to me so the prophet sallam accepted his apology however stood up as usual being strong and firm in islam told him o prophet of allah he had committed an act of hypocrisy he's a hypocrite he's showing something different to what he intends in his heart allow me to kill him so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told him that omar yani let him go didn't you know that allah said that the people of badr may do whatever they please because i have forgiven all of their sins so the prophet sallam approved the fact that this act was an act of treason yet it was forgiven because intentions were accepted and because allah azzawajal had previously forgiven all the sins of those who participated in the battle of badr the prophet sallam started moving his army to the people of makkah to besiege them they did not know about this on the way the prophet sallam was met by al abbas his uncle and the whole of his family and children they all came embracing islam to join the muslims now the story says that abbas was a muslim long ago and some historians say that he was even a muslim on the battle of badr muhammad do you remember when buddha took place yes of course i remember and which which year second year the second year that's correct so he came but the truth is that he was not a muslim then because the prophet sallam requested him to pay the ransom as all the prisoners of war from the people of oregon i believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we will be right back according to the quran we live in a universe that worships allah it is not just human beings who celebrate his praises but animals as well join us every wednesday at 20 gmt for your show even animals glorify among the dignitaries of quraysh who came out to receive the prophet sallam but accepting islam abu sufyan ibn al-harif even abdullah and one who looked so much like the prophet sallam that was strange and one who was so close to the prophet throughout the past first 40 years of his life until he was revealed to and then he became the most fierce enemy of the prophet his cousin and his buddy his friend and throughout all of this these years the 21 years he was one of the fierce and strongest enemies of islam and the prophet he came out with with the second cousin of the prophet sallam abdullah even the brother-in-law the brother of um may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers they all came and accepted islam and subhanallah they fought so bravely to protect islam and the muslims to protect the prophet allah abu sufyan himself did wonders on the battle of her name standing alone with the prophet sallam facing the thousands of archers and soldiers and protecting the prophet sallam with his own body transformation that is second to none and this is not new there are so many times that we know people we see people that we think that they are in hell they cannot by any chance accept islam and subhanallah allah azza opens a window of opportunity to them he casts the light of faith in their hearts and they are transformed in matter of seconds people who by no chance you ever thought that they would accept islam so this teaches us a very good lesson even after 21 years of personally attacking the prophet and undermining the efforts of muslims killing muslims in the tens and hundreds whenever it was possible even after this long period of time never ever give up hope the man accepted islam the man became one of the defenders of the prophet allah and of islam this teaches us a lesson don't give up on anyone keep on giving dawah keep on keep on keep on introducing islam to the non-muslims and always hope for the best i read a report for the prophet saw sallam that one day he came to abuja's house and looked at his door and when abu jahl opened the door he asked him asking him you are you you are the most wise and you have big mind isn't the time for you to be a muslim and abu jahl replied isn't the time for you to give up well i don't have any recollection of such a story but i know that it was reported that the prophet alaihis al-assam once said that i have prayed to allah to guide one of the two omar and it was so this is possible and i believe that 13 years in mecca the prophet saw must have visited each and every individual in mecca calling them for islam if he himself went to taif which is about 100 kilometers away or or less from mecca on his on his feet and he went there walking all that distance just to call the people to islam and when they assaulted him when they had their slaves and and children throw him with stones until his feet were bleeding allah sent gabriel with the angel of the mountains and he told him the angel of the mountains muhammad if you wish if you wish i could collapse the two mountains over them and kill them all just give me the instruction and he he did not approve of that he said no i pray to allah that he might guide their sons to accept islam and this is exactly what took place allah azza did not guide them he guided the sons the son of abu jahl was a strong believer and companion of the prophet saw even um he was also a strong a companion and a believer of islam ibn abi sufyan who was the brother-in-law of the prophet sallam and also one of the companions that used to write the revelations and the quran for the prophet the himself was the son of and he was one of the greatest enemies of islam this all teaches us that never despair never give up hope you yourself don't trust yourself that you might change a second a day a month a year later and that is why we always ask allah to strengthen our iman and to keep our hearts on the right path because you never know how your life would end and at the same time you never know how a non-muslim's life would end so always keep on thriving and and trying to call others to islam is it too hard for us as muslims these days to follow the same manner of the prophet may allah be pleased with him like in such instant the one which you have just mentioned now about him when jibreel may allah be pleased with him he's offering him to destroy the people which they have just insulted him and abused him physically and everything and then he shows his mercy and he instead of accepting that offer and punish them and showing them that no he's strong he's in the strong side he offered them the message and made prayer for him so for them so do you believe that we could reach that level of mercy well whether we could reach it or not this is an issue that needs to be studied because the prophet was a human and allah if he wanted us to follow something that cannot be followed he would have sent to us angels but he didn't he sent a human being from amongst us who talks like us who lives like us and who is a normal human being but he was the perfect human being and if you follow his footsteps you will eventually be as close and as perfect to him as possible the prophet salla did something that is very difficult for us to do and that is to forgive and to pardon those who had assaulted you and did bad things to you having said that the prophet sallam was once approached by a companion and he told him oh prophet of allah advise me what was the prophet's advice don't be angry do not be angry so the man said well okay this is a good advice give me more the prophet kept on repeating allah do not get angry don't be angry which means that it is part of islam not to do something out of haste yes and then regret it because of anger we it's it's normal everybody you have to be angry if you're not angry you're not a man but what you're denied from doing is on acting according to your anger or out of rage this is not permissible and if you look at the seerah of the prophet sallam which we are studying you would find tolerance to the maximum to the extent that in one narration a man a nomad from the bedouins came to the prophet sallam as narrated by anastasi with him he said that the prophet was once wearing a jacket that was made of hard wool and a man came from behind the prophet and he pulled him so hard from his clothes that it affected his neck and back you can see the redness and the scratch the scratches of that wool jacket and adding to that he said muhammad calling him by his first name muhammad give me from the money that you have because it's allah's money it's not yours now i cannot imagine me being in the prophet sallam shoes at that moment being startled by someone from behind and being assaulted in a sense because it affected your body it harmed him it hurted him and also talking to him in this manner muhammad and i am the man i am the head of all of arabia was it the the people were around him that time his companions or was he or was he he was along with anas may allah be pleased with him so the prophet saws did not do anything more than looking at the man giving him a nice and gentle smile and instructing his companions to give him money but what kind of tolerance is this the prophet was always setting the best examples to his people in generosity in bravery in kindness intolerance in mercy in being kind to his wives the prophet told us hasan the best among you are those who are best to their wives all of these are not simply stories to be told or to be you know discussed yes as form of stories these are the fundamentals of our religion you cannot be a muslim you cannot be a practicing muslim without going through these stories and applying them implementing them in your lives otherwise you're just a hypocrite saying something and doing something that's completely contradictory to it or not even believing in it the prophet always set the best example for us to follow and wallahi by allah if we follow his footsteps in everything not only in the way we look but even in the way we feel and love and tolerate and the compassion that he had to the people if we have this everybody among us and around us would accept islam and at least would eva would value the principles that islam calls for i believe this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time um hmm uh hmm"
