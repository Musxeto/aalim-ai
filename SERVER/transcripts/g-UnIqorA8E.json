  "title": "Is giving adhan in a newborn's ear authentic? Sunnah acts to do for a newborn baby Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says we heard that offering the adhan in the right ear of a newborn child is a sunnah but now we learn that it is not authentic so what's the verdict the answer is true it is not authentic and the hadith backing it up is not authentic so one should not do that not only that some people make the adhan in the right ear then they make the on the left ear why not complete the whole thing and let the child and the infant lead you into raqqa prayer this is not from the sunnah if it's not authentic how could i insert it in my islamic book how can i ask people to do it if it's authentic wallahi we would never stop doing it and we would do it all the way but what defy defines whether to do it or not is the authenticity of the hadith and the hadith is not authentic so what to do to a newborn nothing just praise allah azza there are a number of etiquettes such as technique which is chewing a very very tiny amount of dates until it's softened then you take it and put it in a small tiny very tiny like liquid-like and put it in the ceiling of the newborn to be the first thing he tastes and such glucose such uh material would help him in breathing would help him in so many things beside the fact that this is the sunnah of the prophet also shaving the head circumcision slaughtering a a ram or two depending on the gender of the child on the seventh day and giving the weight of the child's shaved hair in silver for charity all of these are part of the sunnah"
