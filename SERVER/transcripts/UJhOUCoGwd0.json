  "title": "Need husband's permission or Father's permission to go out before consummating marriage? (Rukhsati)",
  "transcript": "says i did meaning marriage and didn't do rosati in urdu means consummate the marriage yet so if i want to go outside should i take my husband's permission or my parents permission is enough because i'm still in my parents house does the question is clear i believe a lot of the muslims when they get married first of all they have the engagement period he sees her she sees him in the presence of her guardian and they talk for an hour they have mutual liking to one another this is engagement he the the boy says i like her the girl says i like him they're engaged yet they're still considered to be none they cannot communicate afterwards they cannot chit-chat they cannot socialize or see one another after that initial interview usually it's a month until preparation is done then they make the marriage contract so the family of the boy goes to the family of the girl and they meet and they set a date where they make the marriage contract with the proposal and acceptance in the presence of two male witnesses muslims now they're married but the wedding night is like a month two or three away so during this period she is his wife she is his mahram he can sit with her he can speak with her he can go out with her he can touch her but before consummating the marriage while she's in her father's house the husband is not obliged to provide for her because she's still in her parents house she did not move her responsibility were not transferred to him totally so her responsibility lie with her responsibility lies with her father still as long as she's living in his house and he's providing for her and therefore if the husband tells her do this and the father says no don't do that she's obliged to obey her father though he is her husband but he doesn't have full control because he's not providing for her he doesn't have a house for her so coming back to your question mona if she is still living with her father and she wants to go somewhere she is not obliged to call her husband and say listen i'd like to visit my friend or we're going to my uncle's house or i'm going shopping with my father she is not obliged to do that having said that in couple of weeks or months time you will move with your husband so would it be wise to begin your marriage by defying his instructions and doing things he doesn't like so that when he consummates the marriage he's already not feeling good about it of course not you should be wiser you should be more diplomatic yes you can go places without telling him but if he tells you no do not go to that certain place because it's evil and i don't like my wife to go there and you defy his instruction and you still go this is not very wise of you though you did not do anything haram as i stated earlier because your obedience at this moment is to your father and allah azza knows best you"
