  "transcript": "what's the punishment for someone who missed a prayer without an excuse and is it even an act of cover if someone missed every day one or more prayers without the excuse okay so siddhi is asking about the punishment of someone who misses a prayer without an excuse a group of scholars considered that to be something that nullifies islam skipping one prayer without a legitimate reason falls in their opinion under the hadith whoever abandons it he has committed an act of a kufr but the most authentic opinion is that it is one of the greatest and severe major sins in islam but it is not kufar a person who deliberately skips one salat a day or more is in great danger but again he is still labeled as a muslim and his faith is in the hands of allah whether on we treat him as a muslim when he dies we bury him as a muslim and we seek forgiveness for him but only allah azzawajal can hold him accountable for what he had done over that major sin and allah knows best"
