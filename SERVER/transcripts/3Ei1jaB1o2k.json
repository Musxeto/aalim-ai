  "title": "Can women cut hair upto shoulders, 1 inch below earlobe or would it be imitating men Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign that she cannot cut it more than her shoulder length because men are allowed to keep the hair till shoulder now my question is can a woman cut her hair just one into one inch longer than her earlobe and can she cut her hairy it's against the custom in regards to what you had heard because men are allowed to prolong their hair till their shoulders so let me ask you if a man prolongs his hair longer than that to his back for example is this Haram there is no it depends on the customs and the tradition if a person lives in a village or in a tribe that men Pride on having long hair as a sign of being masculine then there's no problem in that likewise if a woman cuts her hair a short like an inch or longer than her earlobes or in this uh similarity and when people look at her they would not say oh she looks like a man or this is a man's haircut rather they would recognize that this is the haircut of a woman there's no problem in that insha Allah at all"
