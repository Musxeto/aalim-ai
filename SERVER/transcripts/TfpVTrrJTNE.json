  "transcript": "uh she there are parents that are incredibly uh strict in creating like an Islamic environment for their children and due to this strictness when the child gets even a little millisecond of Freedom they go Haywire so how to create a balance uh so that these kinds of this doesn't happen children don't turn out this way what do what do the parents do to uh ensure that they raise their child up correctly first of all we have to acknowledge and agree that there is no one size that fits all and no matter what you do and how hard you try guidance is in the hands of Allah look at Prophet n peace be upon him one of the first five strong will Messengers he as described in the Quran remained in his people giving dawa for thousands of year for a thousand years minus 50 950 years 950 years giving dawa yet when the flood took place he called his son come and Embark and get uh with us on the ark and he says no I will go to somewhere safe he rejected his father's dawa and died as a cafir now no one could ever have the audacity to blame no that he didn't do a good job he was the best in his job but guidance in is in the hands of Allah you do your level best you do your due diligence you pray you make Dua but you never cross the parameters set To Us by Allah in the Quran and the Sunnah we never cross red lines if we look a little bit the other way and our children take and seize the moment and do something Haram it's on them not on us we have to apply Shar and we have to weigh the pro and cons of dealing with them by seeing okay should I be harsh in reprimanding would that pay off or should I pretend I did not see a thing and hope that this is a one one uh uh in a lifetime uh uh chance or should I sit and communicate with them or should I investigate the Alternatives that I'm giving to them at the end of the day our children are adults they're old enough to make a choice and they're accountable for their choices my role is to guide to discipline to put set the parameters according to what the Quran and Sunnah uh are and at the end of the day the guidance is in Allah's hands and Allah Knows Best"
