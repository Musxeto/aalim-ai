  "transcript": "now having talked about this visualizing knowing which category and then is it applicable or not there's a fourth uh type or fourth a procedure which is if I did not still reach a verdict what to do after applying all this process I could not reach a verdict what to do the safest and the most acceptable thing among Scholars is to abstain I do not have the knowledge maybe someone else would come later on and give this but you have to be aware not to go into deep Waters without being able to swim so we find often though that there are some Scholars that unfortunately or people who claim to be Scholars that actually do do this they go in over their head and they end up misguiding the people as a result of it so what would you say uh are some of the common mistakes that some Scholars make when addressing these issues that's a good question people by Nature make mistakes and that is why we do not exclude Scholars from this human nature thing however it is very important to know that these nawazil these incidents or new contemporary issues should not be addressed by One Singular single scholar it should be Collective and this is why the First Council of so many organizations and countries they collaborate they gather once or twice a year to discuss these important issues that maybe if one scholar gave his fatwa without consulting them he would regret this later on so the most important thing to avoid is to give a fatwa without having a reference of a collective decision-making body which is usually composed of Scholars who are excellent in their knowledge and also they are excellent in their righteousness among the mistakes that a lot of uh or some of the scholars may fall into is dissecting an incident that they're asked about so whenever they try to visualize an incident they come to it and say okay this incident is divided into four contracts for example I'll give you an example there is what is called as an Islamic transaction in Banks where you go you actually want a loan conventional Banks tell you we will take seven percent here's a hundred thousand you pass seven percent a year Islamic Banks so-called Islamic Banks would say well we don't lend you by interest but what we can do is you give us power of attorney to buy something on your behalf you give us a a promise or a signed contract that you're gonna buy it of us once we buy it for you and then you authorize us to sell it to someone else and then you pay it to us in installments so basically they're looking for like a loophole in the system like trying to get around it sort of like what the children of Israel did by putting their Nets ahead of time because they weren't allowed to work on the Saturday so they would put their things ahead of time and then collect it after Saturday it's exactly the same ruling they are making a trick the funny thing is that when a scholar come and looks at this transaction he dissects it he divides it so he says power of attorney is permissible in Islam giving a promise that you will do something is permissible in Islam uh giving them the power of attorney to buy or to sell is permissible in Islam buying items in installments is permissible in Islam so if you look at it individually it's all permissible but when you come to the actual transaction it is something of a trick to make usually or to make riba Halal so they forgot about that every action is by their intention yes and this is extremely important in transactions that the intention is meant it's meant and it is intended so it has to be looked at when making a transaction we'd love to continue but unfortunately we're just out of time uh join us again next week Lord I am just a simple man trying hard"
