  "transcript": "yeah my friend he told me that he he will SC 19 out of 20 as a general grade at the end of the semester he was he was doing what he told me that he would score 19 out of 20 as a general grade at the end of the semester okay at school so I told him this is not possible but if he manages to do that I will give him 100 din so now I know this is halal because it's only a reward but my concern is that two weeks approximately later he told me if I manage to score 12 or more he would give me 100 din so now I don't know anymore is this now again your pledge to give him this amount was it if he were to score 19 out of 20 yes yes this is binding what he said afterwards 12 out of 20 this is up to you if you say okay again this is a conditional gift and this is not a bet and there is no gambling in it it's a Halal gift you tell your friend you tell your son you tell your neighbor if you do do this task I'll give you this this is called in in Arabic it's a gift appointed upon a particular and specific task so again if you're friend is greedy and he sees you as a sugar daddy and says okay if I get 12 out 20 you should be ashamed of yourself 60 out of 100 and you still want to be rewarded what is this but if you're generous and you have money and you still don't believe in him and think he wouldn't get 12 and you agree that it would be binding but it's not uh uh Haram or uh anything else alhamdulillah"
