  "transcript": "smell of manova he-man hundred Elaraby alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad and Lilliana mean sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sabi were many today we had the worst end of eternity he in al-madinah and Movado assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as soon as you hear this title one of the first names that pops up is the name of our mother our beloved mother who was the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the most beloved of his wives that he declared that he loves her more than anyone else her name was aisha may allah be pleased with her his her father's name was Abu Bakr al Siddiq even knew I be a co hoffa Abu Bakr his name was Abdullah and his father's name was Atman but they were known for their nicknames so everybody knows Abu Bakr the son of ABI Hoffa and her mother was amo oh man the daughter of a hammer Elkanah Nia Aisha had many names and her nick name was um abdullah abdullah abdullah though she did not have any of her own offspring but her sister asma bint ABI bakr may allah be pleased with them had a sister was married to Zubair even Allah WA and she had a son by the name of abdullah IBN az-zubair who was one of the Companions as well so she loved her nephew he loved her nephew so she was called um Abdullah because of her taking care of him and the Prophet approved that Alyce a lot of sana she was also known as a sadhika because her father was a so deep the most truthful the one that believes she was also known as um wilmot meaning and that was her title to all of the companions and all those who followed afterwards because she was the prophet's sallallaahu any other celebs wife in this life and she is his wife in paradise as well she was also known as different names that the Prophet used to call her Ali Saleh to son so whenever he was joyful and happy with her he would call her yeah ish in in Arabic this is known as a to him not saying the full word not saying the full name so he was he used to say yeah ish also he used to call her as al mover the one who's guide ly and successful she's guided to know the right answer and sometimes he would call her the daughter of Sudeep or the daughter of ABI bakr and this is to uplift her status among the others because being attributed to such a mountain as abu bakr or asada is an honor by itself also the Prophet used to Nick named her as a Yamaha and she was called a Yamaha due to the fact that she was white and had some redness in her because due to her whiteness so the Prophet used to say learn from this Altamira when was she born she was born seven years before the Hedra from Mecca to Medina so she was born in Mecca and she noticed all the suffering and the trouble the Muslims had encountered in Mecca she was born to a Muslim family so she opened her eyes to find her father mother siblings all accepting Islam and practicing it and she spent nine years of her life in her father's house and the other nine years were in the prophets house alayhi salatu was-salam when we spoke about soda we talked about what had happened to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam after the death of his beloved wife Khadijah and how Allah been to Hakeem came to the Prophet Allison proposing that he gets married and she told him that there are two candidates a virgin and a nun virgin and the virgin was aisha bint ABI bakr so the prophet alayhi salaatu sam delegated the mission to hala to go and check whether they accept his proposal or not when how they went to own a Roman the mother of Aisha she was overwhelmed with happiness because this is an honor second to none but she understood that such a decision can only be made by the father who is the guardian and abu-bakr was not in the house so she asked how Allah to wait until Abu Bakr comes when Abu Bakr came he had a problem the problem was that I was already engaged though she was 6 years of age she was already engaged to someone else Joubert been a more time with Nadi who was at the time not a Muslim so he could not go back on his word so he had to go and speak to them and Mohammad Nadi who was an idol worshiper did not like Islam so he asked Abu Bakr if my son marries your daughter would she brainwash him and call him to this religion I don't want such a marriage so Abu Bakr was happy that he broke the engagement from his side and not from Abu Bakr side and he went and accepted the proposal and the marriage contract was conducted one would argue and say how can a six year old child get married and we spoke about this so many times that nowadays this sounds very awkward and inappropriate at that time it was the norm so she was engaged before the Prophet Isis on proposed which was the norm the prophet's mother as you remember got married when she was 13 years of age that was the norm even enemies of Islam at that time among the idol worshipers the Jews the Christians you call them you name them they're there not a single one ever criticized the Prophet Allison for marrying quote/unquote a child women or girls in Arabia blossom early so yes she might may have the mentality of a child but she has the physique and the ability to be a good obedient wife and would be happy to serve the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam any couple would care for their daughter the most and it would be on the top of their list is to give her to a righteous man who would take care of her and who could take care of Ayesha better than the Prophet Allah Salih Tristana it's an investment in this life and the hereafter that nothing can compare to it and not only that was it forced upon our Asia did she resent it did she fight back or resisted the Prophet was the love of her life and she was his love and the favorite of them all she was the daughter of his best friend and no one could come close to Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him so the Prophet wanted to strengthen the bound between them and above all of this this was a revelation from Allah so it was an order from Allah for him to marry her the Prophet re salat wa sallam said - Aisha I saw you in a vision twice being carried in a cloth of silk and the man carrying you was gibreel Dark Angel and he used and he told me twice this is your wife so I would unveil your face and it was you so I said if this is from Allah it will go through and we all know that the vision the visions of the prophets are why a revelation if you read the quran ibraheem said to his man in his son oh my son i see in a dream in a vision that i am slaughtering you so tell me what should i do and his mate said o allah this is o my father this is command from allah do what you're told so this is a vision it's a revelation so his marriage to Aisha was a revelation from Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala an order a command now they got married so she'd spent three years of her life in her father's house the marriage was not consummated until she became nine years old when they migrated to Medina and the Prophet used to go to her mother and always remind her to take good care of Aisha because the Prophet loved that joyful girl she wasn't like any other woman or any other girl she was the daughter of his best friend she was born a Muslim and she had attributes and characteristics and her that were not any other woman the prophet alayhi salatu salam was wise he used to deal and treat with her with kindness he realized that she was still a child so he would never stop her from playing with her dolls or getting her mates to come in the house and play together like girls usually do though her mates used to be afraid of the Prophet Isis I'm out of respect so the Prophet used to send to them come and play with Aisha and he would leave the house he would joke with her and play with her whenever he sees her dolls he asks her what are these and she says these are my daughters and when he saw a horse with wings he said what is this she said well it's a horse with wings and he said how is that possible and she said to him didn't you know that Sulaiman peace be upon him had horses with wings that could fly so the Prophet laughed and smiled until she could see his moral teeth he would give her credit being who she was she narrates to us that the Prophet once told her ish would you like to see the Abyssinians practice and play with their spears in the Masjid so she said yes so the Prophet lowered his shoulder to her as if he's sitting on the ground and she placed her head on his shoulder his body covering her and she was watching the Abyssinians play with the spears it was the Prophet who initiated this because he knows that a young girl need to play need to have fun and this is why she said at the end of the hadith therefore whenever you see a young girl always pay attention to her age don't put so many responsibilities and this is what we usually fail in doing we place a lot of responsibilities on children and we reprimand them we scold them you shouldn't have done that you're a big man now you're a big woman you should have done this and that and not paying attention to their mental state their actual age the way they think they need to play they need to be entertained so one has to balance these things so that he would have the best of all results now Aisha had a very special place in the prophets heart at a his salat WA Salam I'm Rob Mela us may allah be pleased with him he said the Prophet once appointed me as a leader over an army and before setting off I came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and i said o prophet of allah who is the most beloved person to your heart among all people amber says I thought that he would say you because since I accepted Islam whenever I came in the Prophet used to smile in my face and let me sit beside him so I thought maybe I have some degree of love in the heart of the Prophet Allah so Salaam towards me so the Prophet said in answering his question I assure she's the most beloved person on earth to my heart so AMRO rephrased the question said no no I meant from amongst the men so he said Abu Bakr her father so I assure was the love of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam and there was no mistake in that everybody knew that to the extent that the people the companions whenever they wanted to give the Prophet as some a gift some food some clothes anything that they wanted it to be a source of getting closer to Allah so they give him something we all know that the Prophet as Salam was the poorest of them all he had nothing and whatever came to him he gave to the poor and this is his lifestyle it wasn't a period of time he never lived in mansions he never had anything extra he always had one or two pieces of garment that he wore because he was given the choice and his wives accepted his style of living because they wanted paradise and not this dunya so whatever people gave gifts they felt sorry for the Prophet us and it doesn't have food mother Aisha says we lived in difficult times we used to see the Crescent following the Crescent following the Crescent meaning three meaning two months consecutive months and fire would not be lit in all the houses of the Prophet aresome they would not cook because they had nothing to cook so the people loved the Prophet as Salam and used to send him gifts however they would only send him gifts when he was in Ash's house when it was a ishes turn so the wives of the Prophet is some complained to him and they said this is not fair you should order the people to be fair and to give you gifts whenever you are wherever you are not only when you are at a Ash's house and they complain to Fatima his his daughter so so she went to him and said Oh father your wives are complaining and asking to be fair when it comes in regard in regards excuse me getting old ham Villa and they were fasting we don't have any water or coffee or tea and Howard Hamed Allah and the Prophet Haslam spent two months without food being cooked in his house and we're complaining that we don't have tea or coffee or water what kind of Muslims are we may Allah so shall have forgiveness upon us all so in short Fatima went and said they are asking me to remind you to be fair so the Prophet said to her alehissallaam Oh Fatima oh my daughter wouldn't you love what I love immediately she said of course father so he told her I love her so love her end of story the Prophet loves Aisha he's fair he's just but the feeling that he has in his heart he cannot control and he's not blamed for that so the people knew that Aisha saw gibreel in the form of a man talking to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and she said who was that man you were talking to and the Prophet said you saw him she said yes he looked like the hill Kelby may Allah be pleased with him a companion he said to her that was gibreel and later on gabriel came and said o prophet of allah give salam to Aisha so he said Aisha gibreel is giving you Salam and she said I think alayhis salaam wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh you see what we don't see o prophet of allah she had many blessings on the ummah once she lost a necklace the prophet sent companions to look for it they were late it was a sir time they did not have water so they prayed as they we're no water nothing no Moodle and they came and told the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they did not know what to do Allah revealed the verses of TM mum dry ablution who say EE may Allah be pleased with him said may Allah reward you the family of Abu Bakr by Allah no incident that comes out from you except Allah would make a way out for the Muslims and it would be a blessing from Allah upon the Muslims the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to look up to the day of fatima - the day of our issue so that he would go to her and every day he used to ask where am i tomorrow whose turn is it tomorrow especially when he got sick when he got sick they would attend him his wives each one in her home but the following day he has to be carried to the other wife's house and she would take care of him so every time he would say whose house am I going to tomorrow and the wives understood that he was looking for the why for the night of Aisha as he felt comfortable being nursed were actually being looked after in her house when they realized this fact they all agreed with acceptance and consent that he stays all nights in her house without them claiming their right in having him in their houses and when the prophet knew that she says he felt comfortable and relaxed because now he will be spending the night all of them and being looked after by Aisha and Aisha boasts about the fact that the Prophet Allah saw - salaam died while leaning on her chest putting his head on her chest before between her can chest and he passed away while being on her chest saying matter of vehicle Allah so this is an honor next to nothing and she says that the last thing that the saliva of the Prophet Allah saw son was mixed with was my saliva when my brother came with a miswak and the prophet saw it and he was so tired to speak so I noticed that in his eye the love between them makes her understand by just the mere look on his face so she said to him would you like that miswak and he nodded his head so she took the miswak she softened it with her teeth so it was mixed with her saliva and then she gave it to the Prophet I said I'm who went and used that in his mouth so his saliva was lastly mixed with her saliva and she died on her chest may Allah be pleased with her I sure was not like any other woman she was so generous yet she was so poor she gave everything she had kept nothing be back um sir Allah says of the liveness zubayr sent to Aisha his aunt a hundred thousand Durham a lot of money so she called for a plate she poured it in and she started spreading it among the poor and the needy of Medina until it was all out and she was fasting so when it was Margaret time she said to her mate give us some food so that we can break her fast and the mate said may Allah have mercy on you my mother wouldn't you have kept one dirham or two that we could have bought some meat you can break your fast on on it and she said to her don't reprimand me if you would have reminded me I would have done that but I did not have this in mind I did not think of that and Allah says I assure was the most knowledgeable of all people and the most with thick meaning of understanding of issues and the best of opinions of all people and if you look at her life you would find that when people ask her about fit she would answer tough shear she would answer hadith she would narrate hadiths more than anyone else other than maybe a before Allah and maybe Ana's and if you look at poetry she knows all the Arabs poetry if you look at medicine she even knows medicine and when she was asked by her nephew how would you know all of these things she said I was always with the Prophet house of Salaam and whenever he got sick I can hear the nomads saying to him that this plant is good for this and that plant is good for that so she had an edge without any dispute now scholars went into who's more favorable who's more beloved who's best who's better is it hadisha or fatima or Asha and the most authentic opinion is that this is with Allah we cannot judge these things though we are a little bit inclined to hadiza because she is the mistress of the women in paradise but when it comes to knowledge without any doubt aisha is more knowledgeable than all of them when it comes to lineage without any doubt Fatima has the highest of all in lineage and when it comes to the favors that she had given in the support and assistance to Muslims and Islam and especially to the Prophet eyes of Salem no one stands close to Khadijah so Aisha gave the whole Muslim world a lot of knowledge that till date we depend on it and the reasons behind that were that she was very smart and she had a strong photographic memory she memorized the Quran she memorized the hadith of the Prophet asana and she had the understanding the intellect to analyze and get the rulings from she was an expert in poetry in Arabic language in all the different arts related to it so she had the full arsenal to understand Quran and the Sunna and what was going on she grew up in the house of the Prophet erase a lot of sin and that would be sufficient just to see him to speak to him and if you add to that that the Prophet was also keen on teaching her on talking with her and making in making her understand because he knew that she would convey all of this to his ummah and lastly she was the only wife of the Prophet Isis and that the revelation the way from gibreel came while the Prophet was with her in the bed and he said that no other woman ever I had I received the revelation while I was her bad except Aisha and the Companions themselves acknowledged her knowledge abu musa al-ashari says whenever we had a dispute among us companions of the prophet harris asana we would always ask and find that she has knowledge about it imagine this great mother of ours she's our mother she's not only the wife of the Prophet she is the mother of the believers almost 200 companions and tabi took knowledge from her those who were Muharram like Robin Zubair Al Qasimi Muhammad Ali Bakr those who were her knee nephews took knowledge directly from her those who were none muharram she would teach them and address them in a special chamber where there is a hijab between her and them and they would learn and spread the knowledge over almost 200 companions learned from her and tahini and no wonder that whenever her name is mentioned we always remember that she was the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam that she was the hemara whom the Prophet loved more than anyone else and that she is his wife in this dunya and she is his wife in Paradise and may allah azza wajal curse those who slander her who say negative things about her who resent her and hate her because those who do so hate our prophet alayhi salatu salam hate our religion and falsify the Quran where Allah has revealed her innocence in short and nor hada voilá who Adam when especially Aslam was allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad water ali he was happy he as main [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today I'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader Abu Huraira may Allah be pleased with him said the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam said no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me after which abu bakr began to weep and say and is my life and wealth for anything besides you o messenger of allah this narration shows the level of etiquette and humbleness that abu bakr may allah be pleased with him had in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam for he likened himself to a slave of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send him by saying that his wealth was only for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send them as well as his soul and self this comes as no surprise for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa settlin has more rights on the believers than themselves he may Allah be pleased with him spent his wealth in the cause of Allah and he consoled the prophet of Allah some allow any who has sent him through his own self so the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam recognized that for him and said in order to build his teacher and to remind the ummah of his virtues no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me among the benefits of this narration it is important to keep good manners and humbleness in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam thanking someone who has bestowed some favor on you as well as supplicating for them is part of having good manners reported by Albahari reported by Al Timothy and eben majeure albani ruled it authentic in his book sahih al German the explanation of a Cindy on the book of eben Majah and at a seer Bashar al JAMA a surreal ceremony kumihimo and welcome back she have says I wish to complete for an this Ramadan insha'Allah can I combine reading the Quran from the phone normally and also during my tell away prayer to achieve completion well first of all we have to point out something that most of you know but it's a reminder there is no special favour or reward for completing the Quran in Ramadan the vast majority of Muslims think that it is a must that we complete or an intaglio or that we there we we have to finish the Quran one hotma in Ramadan and there is nothing as such yes the more you read the Quran the better it is this is why we usually get questions such as share today is the first of Ramadan and I am in my seventh Jews of Quran so I am in Surat al anfal may be sorted out off so shall I continue or should I start from the very beginning from Surat al-baqarah service to you there is not no preference none whatsoever and people say okay share the hotma of the Ramadan can I divide it on the five daily prayers and the taraweeh and the hydrat there is no hotma for Ramadan so if you you self recite from the Koran like five Jews a day and then it's taraweeh time and you recite half a Doozer continuing no problem if you designate one hotma for Ramadan itself during taraweeh and other hot mess during other times no problem the sky is the limit and you are free to do whatever you want Rozier says the confirmed view in my knowledge about men's clothing is they must cover themselves from the navel till the knees but I have heard from someone that a man must cover his arms including covering the elbows which also indicates that wearing a half sleeve t-shirt or shirt invalidates the prayer I'm confused about it can you please share the details about it what you have heard is totally wrong and baseless if you pray covering from your navel to your knee your prayer is valid but it is makrooh to pray with your shoulders nothing on them so it's there's no t-shirt no cloth on covering them nobody ever said that wearing a t-shirt that exposes your elbow and your biceps is not recommended or makrooh let alone to say that it invalidates a prayer this is all baseless and nonsense so don't listen to this now having said that the hour is from the navel to the knee this is related to prayer but it is not related to seeing so you're not allowed to go out in the street topless and covering only from your navel to the knees and say this is my hour in salat no this is a for salat in any necessities but when it comes to looking your MA harms or non-muslims they shouldn't see you in that for no legit treason Allah knows best Hamza says is keeping a beard for door Sunnah in Islam if we want to talk about Sunnah and define it and fault and define it so the five legislative rulings al accommo tech lifia mandatory muster hub or recommended permissible makrooh or not recommended and haram these are the five five legislative rulings so when we come to fault and Sunnah the definition is fault or worship is the same for up and worship are the same identical the definition is what when you do them you reward it and if you do don't do them your sinful you'll be punished Sunnah is a lower degree if you do it you'll be rewarded if you neglect it you will not be sinful so when we come to these definitions and try to apply them to the beard without any doubt got all growing the beard is mandatory it is worship shaving it is totally prohibited not only in my point of view but also in the point of view of the Hanafi school the Shafi school the medical school and the humble school the four schools of thought which most likely you are definitely the follower of one of them they all agreed that shaving it is totally prohibited so it is mandatory but when we come to look at it in terms of did the Prophet do it definitely the Companions without any doubt so this makes it a Sunnah meaning that the way of the Prophet not that you have the Liberty to go and shave it no it is mandatory but is fetcher prayer for prayer the way of the Prophet yes then this is a Sunnah because the Prophet did it was hatch soon yes because the Prophet did it so everything that the Prophet had done is considered to be soon but whether you will be sinful if you don't do it or not this takes it to another level of definition which is mandatory or fourth and Allah knows best Sayid says why is there no bismillah at the start of surah at-taubah I heard from people many times that it's because Allah Azza WA JAL was angry is this authentic this is one of the interpretations that some scholar said that because it is a surah where Allah Azza WA JAL exposes the hypocrites and threatens them with severe torment in this life and in the Hereafter Allah did not begin it with the most merciful the most beneficent but this is not authentic the most authentic opinion is that Abdullah our bus the companion and the cousin of the professor asked us man the one who compiled the Quran why didn't you make them or merged them into one surah there is surah Anfal and surah at-taubah he said earth man when ever a revelation was given to the Prophet as system he used to tell us put this ayah after this particular ayah insert so-and-so and this ayah put it in the sewer of Sun so between these two ayahs so the order of the verses of the Quran was something that nobody had any control of except a prophet as awesome so when surah al-anfal and Surat at-taubah were revealed and the Prophet used to tell them where to put what where and fell was revealed in the beginning of Medina era Abraha or Toba was at the end so they were waiting for the profit I sent to tell them whether to merge them or not because the prophetís have died without telling them so they did not merge them they made them separate sewers okay this is fair enough but why didn't they put bismillahi r-rahmanir-rahim like every other surah chairman at Amin says because bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim is a separate ayah dividing between sewers and they could not introduce such an ayah without the recommendation and the command of the Prophet erase Allah - Salam because he did not tell them - tell them to put it they did not put it and they separated these two sewers from one another analyzation knows best f shan says a group of women or men in our society make ABC group I don't know what BC group is but you guys made me know that we're 12 months for 12 months each person will pay one thousand dirhams and each month randomly a name will be selected by a draw or fix a month on each person so each one gets 12,000 amount each month is this allowed well this is known as cooperative scheme of not lending but rather on saving money so 12 of us one for every month we put from month one a thousand dirham so I individually will put 11 months 1000 1000 1000 fixed on the twelve-month I will collect 11 from everyone else in addition to the thousand I'm supposed to put but I'm not gonna put it because it's mine and I take the money in this scheme each one of the 12,000 would only receive what he had put in all would be considered to have put in after the year is over because the first person who takes 11,000 plus his that's 12,000 he did not put any penny yet but from the second month till the 12th month he'll be injecting 1000 month a month like everyone else this is totally permissible and halal because there is no loan and there is no interest it is a sort of a saving scheme so that I don't waste my money but by committing to them to give them a thousand a month and there's nothing wrong in that insha allah azza wajal Zeenat says why do I get bad thoughts or negative thoughts in Ramadan even when the Shaitaan is chained during this month first of all the hadith tells us that the Masters the leaders the top strong jinn will be chained in the month of Ramadan the middle and low class jinn they'll they are still wandering around the shrine that accompanies us known as Kareem is always with us is not chained yet we can tell without a doubt that during the month of Ramadan the amount of evil is drastic drastically reduced so the hadith does not say that evil would stop rather that the Masters and the leaders of the jinn are chained so you Z not have your own demons with you that never leave you you have your own bad thoughts your evil spirit with you and these all can collaborate to cause such bad thoughts zahara says is it permissible to draw the face of a human and hide half of it or cover the eyes a bit by drawing flowers over them as an example also is it permissible to draw the figure of humans without drawing face that is face hidden in a hoodie or something else it is not permissible to draw a face of a human being because this is mimicking and imitating the creation of Allah and this is one of the most major sins in Islam covering some of it part of it with flowers does not change the ruling the face is there we can tell it's a face of a human being so this is not permissible drawing the shape of a human being without a face without any features being recognized some scholars say that this is permissible because there is no life in such a celluloid there is no life in such like for example the Puma logo sports where you can see this tiger or what a puma but you don't see a face you don't see mouth eyes etc just a shape they say that this is not her arm this is permissible and allah azza wajal knows best Nawaz says is it allowed to do thicker and supplications by closing eyes as we can concentrate better as long as you are not in salat as long as you're not praying I don't see any thing wrong with that yes it's not from the Sunnah but doing it would not make it an innovation because it's not during salat it's best not to do it but I don't think that there is anything how I'm in it a sister says my mother and I are the ones cooking if bar for the whole family during the month of Ramadan including my brothers who do not pray and sleep whole day and wake up at iftar Thai time without taking advantage of the month do we still qualify to get the reward of cooking for them the answer is yes and you would be more rewarded if you would try to give Dawa to your brothers and supplying in a very kind and diplomatic and indirect way so that may Allah so JAL open their chests and hearts to the words of truth that would add more value than cooking but without any doubt cooking for them and serving them during the month of Ramadan is highly rewarded Apple says is it permissible to say please when making duaa to Allah or does this diminish the attributes of Allah for example oh Allah please forgive me for such-and-such or is it better to omit please no of course it is mandatory for you not to say please please is done to humans when we ask Allah Azza WA JAL we ask from a position of weakness and expressing our poverty to him and this is why the Prophet said Alice awesome when you said when you make dua do not make a condition or an exception because Allah does not have anyone to force him to answer you so sometimes we say oh Allah forgive me if you wish as if you please so saying o Allah forgive me if you wish is Haram the Prophet said you should not say that because when you tell someone if you wish meaning that I'm not forcing you I don't want to compel you or to pressure you and no one can do that with Allah so saying it is totally not permissable camel says we know that 40 days of prayers would be void if a person drinks alcohol what about a person who takes drugs does the same ruling apply to him and should he not pray for 40 days because they won't be accepted anyways the answer is yes consuming intoxicants whether alcohol alcoholic drinks or drugs cocaine marijuana heroin meth whatever crack all of these fall under the same category of intoxicants and whoever consumes them his prayers of 40 days won't be accepted but if he does not pray for 40 days he would become a kafir he would leave the fold of Islam for abandoning prayer you won't be rewarded but you're compelled to pray it on time Jasmine says we know that it is we know that if someone follows us in good deeds we will get the reward same as him but is it the same vice-versa for example if someone sees you do something bad and copies that etc do you get the sin for yourself and from them as well the answer is definitely yes without any doubt if you do something Haram and people follow you you will be accredited with their sins without it being omitted from their own ivdel rally from Sudan the rowdy okay unfortunately we may have lost brother Abdul Ali sir it says can I touch and read from tafseer or translation of the holy quran without woudl where both Arabic and other languages are present answer is yes you can do that what seem says can we pay a female cat in order to prevent from giving birth to kittens the answer is yes this is permissible sister says is it permissible to take morning-after pill if wife eats this within three days after intercourse it will prevent pregnancy is it permissible and the answer again is yes our man says is it permissible to pray aloud the silent prayers like Varanasi and pray silently the loud prayers like fudge or Mallory Manisha the answer is yes but you will be losing the reward of not following the Sunnah but the prayer itself is totally legit if I prefetcher without reciting a Quran loudly my prayer is valid and finally mercy says why do people suffer in this world when Allah is the most merciful this is something we cannot answer for we know for certain that Allah is knowledgeable that Allah is merciful that Allah Azza WA JAL is wise and that Allah is powerful and he owns everything so whatever Allah chooses and does this is for a legitimate reason we may know it and we may not not but our belief and conviction makes us accept whatever Allah ordains and to make dua to uplift
