  "transcript": "he says there is a youtube channel that responds or always says things about scholars so they defame scholars they discredit them they reply and say this and this and they said that this is a trend nowadays and we have a saying in in arabic it is the love to be famous broke people's backs because of its burden now i cannot judge such channels but i know that from quite some time there are a group of people who have nothing in life but to see dirt and fall on it like houseflies so they say they see crap pieces trash they fall on it whatever i say they don't see any good in it only oh yes sheikh made a mistake in 2001 20 years ago and he said this and this and this he's deviant he's this he's that me what are you going to do about it so why have they neglected all the other 21 years the good things i've done and only targeted this one oh because he's deviant he's show me one scholar on earth that does not have mistakes one they will not be able to bring it even the greatest of all scholars of time even their their allama their praised scholars themselves would find mistakes and big time mistakes especially in judgment in uh retracting their old uh sayings etc so what makes them better than anyone else yes it's true that there are mistakes that have to be cleared so if i said something wrong and it is proven not by tom dick or harry not by crossing the t's and dotting the eyes and saying oh so-and-so said so-and-so said so-and-so so yeah this means that condemns shahasana no this is nonsense kids games we can all play the same game i'm talking about quran and sunnah scientists scholars from the past looking and researching a particular topic if i made a mistake and i was not brave enough to correct it and someone else came and said well he did so many good things but in this particular fatwa in this particular opinion of his he was wrong and nobody from the whole scholars community had ever said something like that and it has to be rectified we have to clarify it there's no problem well while being polite while being discreet while being a scholarly like but to come in a video clip on youtube designated to highlight the faults and the mistakes of people and making fun or disrespecting people or simply with a with with a pen stroke saying that they had nothing to do with islam their innovators there's this they're deviant subhanallah this is only done by simi hypocrites or people who are not related to ilm and allah azza knows best"
