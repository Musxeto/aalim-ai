  "title": "Best way to stop calling others Kafir or thinking less of them #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so um how can one stop labeling people as CER in the head since they believe they would commit kufur by not doing it by looking at the merror because if you have the audacity to label people as cfir without knowledge without proof then look at the matter and recognize that you might be a cafer for doing such a thing and others may consider you to be a cafer for many things that you are doing without you knowing it so it's a two-way game to can play this game as Muslims whenever I look at someone older than me I feel envious because he had done so many good deeds I could not reach yet and when I look at someone younger than me I pity myself because he did not make as many sins as I have done or committed so I always look little at myself you're doing the opposite you're boasting about your Deeds thinking that you're the only one who's a Muslim and everybody else everyone else is a cafir for one reason or the other this would which would probably reserve your seat in Hell Fire you have to stop thinking like this and start start to be modest and humble and express your poverty to Allah and think well of everyone else while thinking badly of your own flaws and shortcomings and Allah Asel Knows Best"
