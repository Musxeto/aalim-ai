  "title": "Burning Red Chillies to remove evil eye - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Emma says it is believed in the subcontinent that if a person is inflicted by evil eye moving and spinning peppers on his head and burning them will cure the evil eye I know it's baseless but I cannot convince the people can you please make a video on it so this practice is minimized or stopped I'm at it is not only limited to warding off evil eye and the rest of such things it is deeply rooted in people's hearts that they follow what their peers would their shaman what their soothsayers tell them rather than following the Quran and the Sunnah and Allah tells us in the Quran Ouma octoroon se Aloha Rasta be meaning and the vast majority of people will not become believers even if you are keen on making them o Muhammad if you look around in the Muslim world you will be shocked by the amount of Muslims who practice so many things other than Islam the way they pray the way they deal with one another the transactions they are doing if you look at even their arcader which Islam is based upon you'll find it corrupt and this is shameful it makes us sorry and it breaks our hearts to see Muslims doing this and what adds insult to injury is that when you come to them and you present them with the Quran with the authentic sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the majority of them would shrug their shoulders and say this is how we found our forefathers worshipping and believing and this is what we will remain to doing until the day of judgment and this is very sad but unfortunately we cannot do anything other than making dua for them and continuing to show them the proof from the Quran and from the Sunna when someone says la EDA in la la prove it you claim that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Almighty yet you are worshiping someone else then you are in deep trouble evil eye there are people who do not even believe in it so Envy evil eye jinn possession black magic all of these supernatural things that we cannot see are mentioned in the Quran and are authentic therefore when we would like to treat them we do not go to soothsayers we do not hang amulets or TVs or go to sorcerers to help in solving our problems because this would be shirk the cardinal sin as they say the most major sin on earth that Allah does not forgive if a person dies doing it what we do is we look into the Quran to the Sunnah do we have any cure do we have any treatment for solving this problem for uplifting this evil eye and the answer is yes we do the Sunnah is clear the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam visited sahib Hanif Mara may Allah be pleased with him when he fell sick so he asked around do you accuse anyone of giving him the evil eye so that he would fall sick like this and they said yes he was washing his body and a companion saw him and he was amazed by the clarity and beauty of his skin so he said giving him the evil eye unintentionally of course because evil eye does not come intentionally he said I have never seen such soft skin as if it's the skin of a virgin of course both of them are men and both of them are true natural men they don't have any inclination towards homosexuality may Allah forbid like sick people do today but he was amazed by seriously the softness of the skin and Salomon honey fell on the ground and he was sick on the spot so when they told the prophet alayhi salatu salam he was very angry and he said to that companion why does one of you attend to kill his brother by giving him evil eye wouldn't you have said allahumma barik or allahumma barik la who or barakallahu lockup which all's is stemmed from blessings of Allah then the Prophet ordered him to do something and this is the best cure for the evil eye if you know who gave it to you the Prophet ordered him to perform ablution and to wash the inside of his garment his waste wrapper his robe his shirt his trousers the inside of it that touches his body to wash it and the water all is collected in a vessel then the he ordered them to throw the water over the head of the affected person in some narrations from behind him so he stands in the bathroom someone from behind him gives him a bath or throws it on top of his head and his body the hadith goes on to say Sahel instantly stood up as if nothing had been wrong with him so this is the best form of treatment for evil eye what happens if I don't know the individual in this case one is supposed to recite the proper rukia al-fatiha ayatul kursi the last two ayahs of surat al-baqara and the last three pools Aleph las al-falaq and & nass and he can wipe all of his body by cupping his hand and reciting in it and blowing and wiping his body multiple times he can recite it over a glass or a cup of Zamzam water or normal water multiple times and drink it throughout the day and the night and inshallah within a few days he will be cured with the grace of allah azzawajal as for turning peppers or spinning peppers on his head and burning them this is a ritual that most likely is a sacrifice for the jinn the people do so many things thinking that it is ways of bringing Baraka and knowing that this might be asking the jinn to be pleased by doing it when there's a ritual in some Muslim countries when a person builds a house he would go to the foundation of the house at early stages slaughters a sheep and with the blood of the sheep splashes it on the foundations what is this some even do something else which is slaughtering the sheep on the steps of the house at the entrance when the house is finished and sheds the blood there what are you doing he said I'm slaughtering for Baraka you're sacrificing for the jinn because you want the jinn not to and no you not to inhabit the house so you give them this sacrifice because this is not for Allah Sojin and the way you're doing it is definitely not for Allah so spinning peppers and I don't know if it's chili if it's red or if it's green we know that the people in the subcontinent love chili but this is totally baseless it's not related to Islam and it may take a person out of the fold of Islam if he's doing this for the jinn because this is a form of sacrifice other than to Allah the Almighty and Allah knows best"
