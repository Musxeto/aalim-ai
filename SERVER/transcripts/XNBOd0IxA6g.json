  "transcript": "question that he has a a rare immune deficiency illness that has no cure and he is content with that may allah reward you immensely for that but as for your part that there is no cure for it this is a lie we believe that allah did not create an illness except he created a cure for it let it be those who know it or those who don't know it so everything even cancer even diabetes everything on this uh planet has a cure except death this is the only thing that has no cure so i would highly recommend that you try a traditional medication the black seed al crystal hindi honey etc and there is nothing at all wrong in going the extra mile and trying to drink a mug of camel's milk mixed with a cap of a bottle of camel's urine and this is a prophetic hadith backed up by numerous scientific researchers done here in saudi arabia in australia and also in america to my knowledge and i have a personal friend of mine who used to teach chemistry when i was a teacher back 30 40 years ago and he had intestine cancer and he got a portion of it uh cut off through a surgery and the doctors say it's hopeless you're gonna die in two to three months we can't do anything it's spreading like hey uh fire so he saw some of these researches and started applying these uh medication through camel milk and urine and within four to five months it disappeared from his body and that was about eight nine years ago and the man is fit and healthy and he is into research and giving people whatever information he has on this so you give it a try and inshaallah i'll bill you after inshallah you cured"
