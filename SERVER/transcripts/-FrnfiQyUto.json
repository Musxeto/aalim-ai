  "transcript": "Cassandra says of anxiety and depression it is very difficult for me to pray and fast is it okay if I don't pray and fast will Allah forgive me well Cassandra you are one of two people either you are mentally sane and sound so you have your own choices you know what you're doing and you know the consequences of them you don't drop you don't kill people you don't harm them because you know what will happen to you you don't want to go to jail you never cross a red light signal because you know that you're gonna be pay a lot of money in fines so you are a same person you have anxieties you have mild or severe depression but you're still sane if you don't pray you're considered to be a kafir and you'll go to hell forever those who do not pray at all or not labeled and considered as Muslims so it's very difficult you have to be careful but if you are classified by psychiatrists to be insane and you have reports to prove that you are not accountable for your actions or your decisions and choices in this case it is up to allah azza wajal to judge you because this is only allah in all and it's only in Allah as hands to determine from your email from your question you sound to me like a normal person writing perfectly good English not confused not having any problems but it seems to me that you have whispers of Shaitaan overwhelming you and trying to convince you not to pray and not to fast so that you would improve not knowing that is you that whenever you do not pray or fast you'll de Terry it faster and faster and this would cause you more harm may Allah so shall protect you"
