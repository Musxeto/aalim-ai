  "transcript": "[Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam anas may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam once visited a young man who was on his deathbed so the prophet asked him how do you find yourself how do you feel so the young man said I have hope in Allah but I also fear my sins so the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said these two things do not exist do not coexist in a person's heart in this situation except Allah would Grant him what he hopes for and protect him from what he fears the Hadith highlights forms of worship of the heart we frequently tend to believe that worship is limited to prayer fasting zakat and something that people can see yet it is far greater and wider than this it is also including what we say and above all it is also including what is in our hearts so there are forms of worship of the heart such as trust Reliance and dependence on Allah the love of Allah the fear of Allah the Hope in Allah seeking refuge in Allah supplicating invoking Allah Asel as there are sins of the heart such as Envy hatred Grudge arrogance pride and the likes in the heart fear and hope are of the highest levels of Iman and they are the most beneficial to the heart when the prophet wasam visited His companion this young man on his deathbed it explains and shows us how kind and downto Earth our Prophet wasam though he was at the top of the ladder though he was the head of the state and the messenger of Allah and the best man ever to walk the earth that would not stop him from visiting his companions to check up them and also give Dua to those who were sick when he met this boy he asked him how do you feel how do you find yourself one of the scholars Malak says how do you find your heart while you are about to exit this Dunya and go to the Hereafter are you hopeful in Allah's Mercy or are you frightened and scared of Allah's wrath so the boy said what was in his heart it's a mixed feeling mixed emotions I find myself in between I am hopeful in Allah's Mercy because Allah is the most merciful most compassionate but at the same time I'm terrified of my sins and what the consequences of these sins might be be Islam may Allah have mercy on his soul the great scholar that only is hated by the Hypocrites he says hope should only be devoted to Allah and not to any other creature you should not have hope in your own strength or in your intellect or in your own Deeds because the more you devote your hope solely to Allah this is [Music] true what is the definition of fear because so many Muslims have a problem when they think that any kind of fear is shik and this is wrong says I heard Islam may Allah have mercy upon them both say praised and positive fear is what holds you back from doing what is Haram so the fear that pushes you to do your responsibilities and your obligations in Islam and deters you and stops you from falling into sin this is the fear that Allah loves subhah natural fear is not shik we fear reptiles We Fear insects We Fear animals that can harm us we feel men who could do harm to us this is not something that is sinful this is normal natural fear the fear of the dark for example the fear that is associated with humility with submissiveness with great influence and revering the one you fear this is shik and this can only be devoted to Allah subhah waala what is the definition of hope they say that hope is to want Allah's favors blessings and mercy and it is part of thinking positively of Allah so a servant of Allah is hopeful that Allah would accept his forms of worship and that Allah would forgive his sins and this is why he strives in doing good deeds and in repenting all the time therefore true hoping and sincere hoping in what Allah has has cannot be praiseworthy unless you associate it with good deeds and this is the difference between being hopeful and Wishful says the difference between hope and wishing is that wishing usually is associated with laziness and the one who's Wishful but lazy does not go down the route of of working hard and doing his best to reach such levels of goodness so when you're Wishful you're just sitting back and pondering that I wish I had a plot of land where I could farm and I could reap the fruits of the trees but you don't do anything when you're hopeful it's like someone who does have a plot of land but he blows the land and he throws the seeds and he arates it hoping to reap the fruit of such work and that is why the consensus of Scholars is that being hopeful is never correct unless it's associated with doing something and shun Alani says the sign of a valid and sound hope is that you do good deeds now now a true Muslim has to have the balance between fear and hope what we see nowadays due to the lack of knowledge of many many Muslims and due to The Whispers of Shan that they go to extremes that they're inclined to one of the two instead of having the balance the vast majority of Muslims they are wishful and they have more hope than fear which is actually wishing Than Hope because they think that I'm entitled to Paradise to the highest level of Jenna and I this is my right okay what have you done nothing you're indulged in sins you do all heinous things and you don't pray on time you don't pray in the Masid you lie you cheat you backbite you do all things that are Haram and you're still hopeful in getting to the highest level of Jenna you're delusional and some of the Muslims they go to the far left and they say Allah will never accept our forms of worship Allah would torment Us in Hellfire for eternity because of our sins and this leads them to Despair and to think negatively of Allah and both are in deep trouble and this is why the prophet saidat these two characteristics would not be combined in the heart of a Believer except Allah would give him what he's hopeful for and protect him from what he is fearful of so what is best to have more fear or to have more hope says may Allah have mercy on his soul when doing good deeds it is best that you are inclined to being hopeful that Allah will accept your good deeds because there is an element of fear when you good do good deeds and this fear has to be there what is that that element I'm doing good deeds I'm optimistic and hopeful that Allah will accept it but there is this little amount of fear that Allah May reject it that I may not be doing it sincerely totally for Allah's sake while doing sins I have to be inclined more to the side of fear so that it would deter me from doing Haram while having little hope that it's never too late I can always quit repent and ask Allah for forgiveness and Allah would forgive me Imam Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul said says that fear and hope are the wings of a bird they have to Flap in the same strength in the same time otherwise the bird would fall and not be able to continue to fly says each one of us is his own doctor and he should usually do the check balance on daily basis to see how he's reacting how is he's behaving and whenever he sees that he's a bit safe from Allah's wrath and Punishment this is when he should increase the dosage of fear and whenever he feels negative and despair of Allah's Mercy he should increase the dosage of Hope in Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and this balance is not hard but with the environment we live in with the influence of others with The Whispers of shatan we have a big problem because Shan is frequently messing up with our heads and trying to make us inclined to one more than the other and this is when the bird would fall so we have to have this balance well checked in our hearts and ensure that our hearts are always filled with enough portions of fear and hope but when it is our dying time when we are on our dying beds we have to think always positively of Allah it was reported in IM Muslim that the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam says let none of you die unless he has good expectations from Allah never ever die thinking negatively of Allah the more you think positively of Allah the more you will find what you hoped for ready for you"
