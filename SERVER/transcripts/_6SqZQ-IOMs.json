  "title": "Is ghusl valid without removing oil from your hair even if its a lot & thick? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you said that we don't have to remove the oil and hair in who is it only for a little bit of oil or a lot of oil thick oil is okay as well in one has to thoroughly wash his hair and scalp and ensure that the water has reached the scalp while because the did this with three three scoops now if there is oil on the hair and this oil is by nature it floats over water and it's not grease and it's not something that sticks to the hair rather it is something that can mix with the water and can allow water to penetrate and in most cases it is absorbed by the hair and the scalp in in this case yes washing the hair and rubbing your scalp would be sufficient whether it's thick or um not and Allah Knows Best"
