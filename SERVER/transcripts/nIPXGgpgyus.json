  "transcript": "I have this confusion that like the time Isa in the mids now are so much earlier than what the Muslim like literally like it's almost an hour difference because it's in in the summer time basically the time for is is very weird Okay um the issue of prayer is a confus confusing issue especially in uh the Scandinavian countries and up north like in in Scotland and and the likes and the reason is we know that time begins when the redness in the Twilight disappears so when the sun sets after it sets there's a redness glow in the west which indicates that it is still time for M once the redness glow goes there's no redness then this is the time for is I haven't been to that country or these countries to verify it and see it myself and it seems that you have to ask the people of knowledge if there are any and there has to be but real people of knowledge real Scholars of Islam highly decorated students of knowledge not a from Egypt or Syria who knows few verses of the Quran and becomes a Sheikh no he doesn't qualify someone who who has studied and with the and has an understanding and knowledge and you have to refer to them personally if the redness continues till almost fer time this can't be the case and because when is when are we going to pray it doesn't make any sense so usually I say to people I think and presume that Isa would begin an hour after sunset but if this continues the redness continues you have to refer to your Scholars the easiest way out is to combine at the time of so after the sun sets you pray three then you pray four and you go to bed because it's already 11:00 and F is in three or four hours time it's not enough time for you to sleep so combining when you go to bed immediately afterwards is permissible in summertime in such areas where the night time is too short and Allah Knows Best"
