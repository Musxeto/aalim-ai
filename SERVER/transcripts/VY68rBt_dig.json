  "title": "I feel angry & irritated when Qari repeats words in the middle of an ayah, is it bad assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if AI stops and repeats a verse from Quran from the middle multiple times only to sound nice and not because he ran out of breath is there anything wrong if one feels angry about it because it seems to interrupt the flow of one verse to the other no there is nothing wrong in being angry in the sense of agitated sometimes the reciter repeats a verse two three times from the middle just to make an impact because the meaning is profound as he sees it those listening would be irritated or annoyed because yeah okay move on because we like the way you recite we would love to listen to what's coming afterwards instead of just keeping repeating and repeating it so feel feeling irritated or angry about this there's nothing wrong in it inshallah"
