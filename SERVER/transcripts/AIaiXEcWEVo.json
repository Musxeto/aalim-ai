  "title": "Imam makes a very long Dua in Witr(Qunoot) shall I pray Witr at home? - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "for car says the Imam delays during pollute and I choose to pray with her at home alone after taraweeh since it's not necessarily what I desire is which the Imam supplicates for but at home I ask what I want from Allah at a very reduced standing period am I wrong the answer is you're not wrong per se in the sense that you're sinful rather when you pray a track as with the Imam and you do a new skip Witter you will not be rewarded as if you have prayed the whole night because the Prophet said whoever prays with the Imam until he concludes his prayer Allah would reward him as if he prayed the whole night so my advice to you is to pray with your with the Imam go back home and then pray your normal tahajud and supplicate in your salute whatever you want to say do not offer whitter again and this is the win-win situation"
