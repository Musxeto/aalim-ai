  "transcript": "how do we deal with people who ex uh who force us relatives who force us to expose our good deeds uh like do we lie to them like if we have relatives who mock us or insult us like why do you want to sleep early and we obviously want to do that to pray how do we do we lie to them like how do we deal with them okay just what if our relatives force us and the word force you have to quote unquote put two uh lines under under it make it bold and flashy how would someone force you under gunpoint no sheikh they're my relatives they will bring a knife no sheikh they will threaten you to beat you up no no but they embarrass us they say no no you tell us you tell us this is not forcing force is something that you cannot evade or escape and usually it results in harm what they're doing is just insisting on you tell us why do you go to bed early i love to sleep and everybody loves to sleep you're not lying why do you read a lot of the quran why not so you don't have to answer every question as you are in an interrogation flip the table on their heads and reverse the question with a question dodge it if you want or if you can all of this is permissible but don't lie lying is not permissible and at the same time feeling inferior because of your good deeds that is illogical you should be proud of it but your pride should not make you show off so yes you don't have to tell people that i was uh that i pray night prayer or i read a lot of jews of the quran or i fast every monday and thursday this is not requested or required by itself and allah azza knows best"
