  "title": "Got rejected from school (or job) & feel low, how to pick myself up & feel motivated Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay first of all life is a series of tests and it is illogical for you when you fail in one of the aspects of this life that you personally don't know whether it is good for you or bad however a proper muslim trusts allah so if i did not make it in this school if i did not pass the exam if i was rejected from a job offer or a job interview if i did my level best in this case i have to submit my will to allah and acknowledge that everything is in the hands of allah and allah chose the best for me which i could not tell and hence i accept it if it was my own shortcomings and flaws that made me flunk in this case i have only myself to blame work harder next time make a lot of dua and try your level best but to remain in your position in this stagnant situation without improvement or progressing this is not very wise sitting back in sorrow and sadness for missing this opportunity in that school or institution would not improve your lifestyle would not increase your knowledge and surely would not admit you to any other school or institution so the only logical course of action would be is to move on leave what is in the past behind you and try to prepare for another endeavor may allah will make it easy for you but this needs conviction needs convincing needs believing and it seems that you may need a life coaching from someone who would try to uncover what needs to be uncovered from your potentials your way of looking at things and thinking because most of the people that i sit with have a problem in identifying what's right and what's wrong it's it's like there's fog in front of their eyes and they cannot recognize so when they sit with someone who motivates them and who tells them how shaytan works and gives them and shows them the light at the end of the tunnel their lives change"
