  "title": "Can I still pray Tahajjud if I already prayed Witr? #Assim #tahajjud #witr #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um question regarding the Isha prayer and the V with respect to T so I've seen many lectures but like still I just want to clarify myself so if I pray Isa and concluded the Isha prayer with the V so from what I've been taught like you know um that um once you conclude your is prayer with the with you're not supposed to pray the now provided that if I wake up or like intentionally this is not true continue I me m it um but um so yeah so if I pray with her and I wake up like around 2 a.m. let let's say I set an alarm or like you know wake up myself so can I still pray the 100% yes you can there's a confusion among the Muslims who don't seek knowledge properly and learn prop from the Quran and the Sunnah the confusion is due to the fact that the prophet said Alam there are no two wi in one night and the other Hadith make the last of your night prayer Witter so people made the math and said hm if I prayed and then prayed W then I should follow the second Hadith make the last of your night prayer Witter and this means I cannot pray afterwards and this is not true because the prophet himself as narrated by mother AA Used to offer his Witter prayer and afterwards pray two raas sitting down and praying two rakas indicates that you can pray after your Witter however it is highly recommended for those who know that they will wake up in the middle of the night at 2:00 3:00 and they're fixated on that it's best for them to delay the water to be the last thing they pray at that night but if someone is hesitant or uncertain whether he's going to wake up or not and he concludes after is by praying Witter and then goes to bed then wakes up at 2 or 3:00 a.m. he may pray as many ra as he wishes two by two but no Witter because the Witter he prayed after is makes the total of whatever he prayed that night in odd numbers and this is the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best"
