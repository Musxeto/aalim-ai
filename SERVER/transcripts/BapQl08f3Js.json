  "title": "When to fast Ashoora Calendars differ in different countries (Arafah, Ramadan, 2 eids) Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "um mirza from saudi arabia or i think i don't know says that ashura date has a lot of confusion as with arafah as with the beginning of ramadan and the two eights and the reason of this confusion is that different countries have different calendars and this is totally normal don't we in saudi arabia have different fajr timing than the people in america or in singapore of course why aren't we all muslims yes but our fajr prayer our prayer times are dependent on the rising and the setting of the sun and these countries have different timings for that likewise months have different timings according to other locations so when the moon or the crescent is cited this is the beginning of the month so if it was not cited in one country and cited in another country you'll have a difference of a day or two which means that their hashura would be different because their tenth of muharram is different than their tenth of muharram according to the sighting likewise in ramadan their ramadan started on monday because they cited the moon their ramadan started on tuesday because they did not cite the moon yesterday so with this understanding everything would be clear the tenth of ashura according to the moon sighting in saudi arabia is the day of ashura is on thursday the wednesday is the ninth now in other countries like egypt for example they did not cite the moon so they will have uh ashura to be on wednesday other countries may have it on is a friday it's all kosher it's all right and and fine in sha allah if you fast according to the country you're in you're in the clear and you'll get the forgiveness of one year bird"
