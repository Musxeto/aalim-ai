  "transcript": "uh sh my question is that my exam's finished and I do like dayah I do many Good Deeds but I don't like watch any like I don't play any video games anymore before I used to because I don't know what video games Hal or not and especially most of the games these days they are multiplayer so even if I'm playing with a person I don't know whether it is male or female but there's no way like I can close the chat so like I can play and close the chat and then I'll just be playing with people who I don't know whether they M or female but a shooting game and it's like a Lego type but it's shooting so I don't know like is it Hal or if there is nothing Haram involved and you don't know whether it's a male or a female and there is no chatting it's just simply shooting Lego figures no Bloodshed no real humans and it's a shooting game there's no problem in that inshallah"
