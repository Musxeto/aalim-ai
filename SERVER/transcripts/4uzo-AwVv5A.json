  "transcript": "haroon from the u.s says that there is a mom who'd like to distribute her wealth after her death not accordance according to islam so she wants to write a will she has a son and three daughters for example and she wants to write half of the property or everything that is residential to her son and the girls only gets the gold for example this is prevailing in in some countries this will is invalid and they may not complain let it be but after her death they tear it up and throw it in the dustbin because it was the command of the prophet isalam when he said that there is no will between brackets valid to someone who will inherit or an heir so the heirs of a person cannot be given something extra as part of the will to what allah has already divided my wife after my death gets by default one eighth and the rest goes for my children so if i write a will that i allocate this house to my wife in addition to her one eighth or maybe the house constitutes two-thirds of my wealth i have nothing except this house house and some cash in the bank so i say in my will this goes to her this is an invalid will on the spot because she has one eighth of my wealth i can't give her a penny extra to that this is the division of allah now if the mother wants to distribute her wealth while alive she can do that providing that she's equal between all of her children not giving one extra otherwise she is sinful for that and if she writes the will regardless defying allah's commands when she dies she's going to punish for that because she has gone against allah's law"
