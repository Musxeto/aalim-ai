  "title": "Don't share islamic knowledge cuz of negative response, is this concealing knowledge assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh yeah so shik whenever I've shared something Islamic with others I've generally received a negative response and sometimes things have been really ridiculous I mean I can um provide an example but I know we have limited time so only if you um ask me to uh but really I get uh reactions like I've gone crazy I've uh I've you know become a mullah and no one should listen to me so I saw a few of your videos and from now onwards I'm thinking uh that I'm just going to ignore such ignorant people and only speak to them about Islamic topics if they're genuinely interested uh because otherwise I'm just going to be wasting my time and even if they do ask me uh about something and I know the answer um I'm not going to reply because based on past experience they're perhaps you know just looking for a silly argument um and not to seek the truth so if I do the shik like not reply while fully knowing the answer would this be considered a form of concealing knowledge a major the answer is no when you know that someone is pulling your legs he's asking just to make fun or to make you answer and then make fun of religion or of your answer then yes turn the table on their heads and make fun of them and don't give them an answer and this is not concealing knowledge those who are genuine and want to learn yes you can answer them without any problem"
