  "title": "Is going from Jeddah to Makkah or vice versa considered Traveling? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is that I often go to Judah so if I go to Judah am I allowed to pray utter prayer it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that a sir is determined by not the distance but rather by what the people considered to be traveling so the people of Makkah and the people of Judah there's a about 80 kilometers apart between them yet we never consider commuting between the two cities as traveling I have so many friends who live in Mecca and they work every single day of the week in Jeddah and sometimes they commute twice or three times to attend a wedding etc and go up and down so when I travel to Mecca I never shorten the prayer and I never combined but if I travel to tie for example which is another 70 kilometres further in this case I do because now I am considered to be travelling and Allah surgeon knows best we have"
