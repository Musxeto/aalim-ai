  "title": "Reciting the Quran during sexual impurity",
  "transcript": "the sister was asking about a impurity that is caused by passing the wind or answering the call of nature not about the sexual major impurity but yes there is a difference if a person is in the state of sexual impurity then he must not recite the Quran in the form of getting closer to Allah in the form of worship because this state of impurity is not going to last for more than four or five years five hours and afterwards he is going to be obliged to have a total bath in order for him to pray therefore it's okay for us to tell him do not recite the Quran this short period with intention to get closer to Allah but if you are going to bed in the state of sexual impurity at you there are certain verses that you recite before going to bed in certain chapters of the Quran it's okay for you to recite them even if you are in the state of sexual impurity because these are not considered to be reciting the Quran these are supplications that are said before going to bed okay thank you sir"
