  "title": "I put impure finger in my oily ear, how to clean inside of my ear?!? #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Um so I got impur on my hand and I did not wash it immediately and I and I uh by unintentionally touched my inner part of my ear with impure hands. Uh and the inner part of my ear was all oily. So while I was washing my ear from impurity some of the water goes inside my ear. So how can I wash it? This is overthinking and this is thinking of nasa and impurity as if it's the plague or corona virus. It doesn't work like this. Everything is pure until proven otherwise. And certinity is not affected by doubt. These are the two golden rules. Write them down and highlight them and put them wherever you can see. If you had impur on your hands and you touch your ears, then you're assuming that the impur was transferred into into your ear. If you wash it, the amount of impur is so negligible that the water you used would overwhelm it. And even if water entered your ear, there's no problem in that. It would have removed that impurity."
