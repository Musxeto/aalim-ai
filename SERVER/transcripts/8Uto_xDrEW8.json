  "title": "Can we beat up our adult brother to discipline him cuz he's disrespecting mum #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you as well we have a situation here where we have our kid brother the last one who is an adult as well who has been extremely disrespectful to a mother and has been doing things here to the point where she will get so sick that we have to send her to the hospital at the middle of the night and to be honest with you me and my bigger brother we almost beat him up multiple times here alhamdulillah Allah has preserved us from that but we are kind of at the end of the R I would like to know in Islam what are the limits of physical discipline allowed we cannot stand there and watch him disrespect our mother do things that J does her health and we just smile to his face my big brother is at his limit and might beat him up next time please also not that we have permission to discipline him usually when a person is an adult he's a grown-up man you are not entitled to discipline him physically as an elder brother yes maybe a father can do that but you don't have the authority to do so even if your mom allows you to do so because things could go really wild he could defend himself he could attack one of you and this may lead to permanent injury or maybe fatality so this is not the right way of doing it one of the ways of doing it is kicking him out of the house your mom has to put her foot down and make him understand that such disrespect is not tolerated anymore you guys could call the police upon him so that he knows that he might get a restraining order or may face jail time if he were to continue but to physically attack him or discipline him he could go and get a machete or get a knife or get a gun and retaliate may Allah protect you all from such evil work so you guys have to think it over and you can stand to your mom and intimidate him but not necessarily beat him whenever this happens and Allah Knows Best"
