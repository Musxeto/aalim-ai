  "transcript": "foreign as a whole we find that one of the most important things in Islam is the good character I have been merely sent to Excel and perfect the good character so Islam is based on a lot that deals with good character and those who have bad character are not considered to be good Muslims the prophet salallahu told us that it is not Among Us he is not from us he who does not have mercy on our youngsters on our children and who does not respect the elderly if you look at the life of the Prophet Allah you would find that he used to love the children and have mercy over them his granddaughter may Allah be pleased with her he used to carry her when she was a child and I know that a lot of you don't know that the prophet had a granddaughter by the name of Obama her mother was zainab and her father was he used to carry her during prayer and whenever he bowed or prostrated he used to put her on the ground and when he stood up he used to carry her once again the prophet also Allah as in one Hadith once prostrated and he prolonged his prostration until the companions thought that he might have passed away so one of them raised his head and saw the prophet Allah with one of his grandsons al-hasan or Hussein mounting him and they were children so the man went back to his prayer until the prophet Islam concluded the prayer and when they spoke to him about this he said I was in the prostration uh position and my grandson mounted me as I usually play with him and that is why I did not want to bother him by not letting him continue doing what he does the prophet cared a lot for the children to the extent that once he was leading the prayer and he heard the child CR a cry so he finished his prayer in a very quick Manner and then addressed the companions by saying that I heard the child cry and I was afraid for his mother's heart I knew that she was worried for him so I had to finish the prayer in a quick and fast motion compare this to what we would do in the Masjid if a child or two start to cry while we're praying you would find a lot of those grumpy elders shouting why do you bring your children why do you do that the prophet didn't do anything like this Allah it was an incident and it's gone a child is a child if he does not cry if he doesn't shout he's not a child furthermore the prophet Allah used to love his children whenever he saw and whenever he sees al-hasan or Hussein he would kiss them and one tribe leader tribal leader was there and he saw the prophet Islam kissing his grandchild so he said o prophet of Allah you do this I have 10 of my Offspring I have ten Sons I've never kissed any one of them what was the reply of the Prophet Allah he said whoever does not have mercy Allah would not have mercy on him he used to sallallahu alaihi wasallam visit Anna Malik may Allah be pleased with him and Alice had that younger brother and the prophet would nickname this young brother by giving him a nickname and saying and this child was about four or five years old he had a small bird that he kept in a cage and the bird died so the boy was upset so the prophet used to play with him and say Abba um what did the small bird do and the prophet would joke with with this young boy in this young child so this is one of the Islamic character that we should all have that is having Mercy over children caring for them adhering to their needs and giving them love and compassion as for the second part of the Hadith which is respecting the elders and giving them their due respect this probably would take more time than what the program would allow us to"
