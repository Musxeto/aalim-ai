  "title": "Is it a Communal Obligation (Fard Kifaya) for Muslim Women to become Doctors? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a beer says can you please mention all the vodka fire for females if there are less female doctors who are specialists in a particular field of medicine will going into the field by females be considered as followed by a fire a beer is asking about a terminology in Islamic thought which is known as followed by a fire and some translate it as communal obligation what is meant by communal obligation we have what is known as forum 9 an obligation upon each and every individual example someone comes in he sneezes and he says alhamdulillah it's a an obligation upon every Muslim who heard him say alhamdulillah to reply by saying yaha mahkumaat law this is an obligation it's an individual obligation upon each and every adult male Muslim capable residing individual once he hears the Athan from the masjid to respond and pray in the masjid this is an individual obligation for behind now when it comes to communal obligation this means that if part of the community performs it the vast majority are exempted from sin and if none of the community performs it they're all sinful example a Muslim dies no one takes care of washing shrouding offering Janaza prayer and burying that Muslim individual all the most in the community we'll be held accountable on the day of judgment and Allah will punish them for that if one person of the hundred thousand in the community stood up and took care of that deceased person by washing him shrouding him then calling the people to offer funeral prayer even if he prays it on his own nobody comes and he takes him and he buries him in the Muslim cemetery alhamdulillah the ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine exempted from the sin so now coming back to our beers question what is a communal obligation it is something that can be related to religion as in the example I gave about preparing a disease for burial and it is also possible to be in fields other than religion in our community as Muslims we have to have an engineer that would suffice Muslims from going out to the non-muslims for consultation if none of us come forward and apply to be an engineer we are all sinful because now we're dependent upon the disbelievers for such work if our community does not have a dentist and we are obliged to get a kafir to do this work we are also sinful for that so even in normal things when we don't have car mechanics it becomes a communal obligation likewise and by far when it comes to the field of medicine scholars say that it is a communal obligation to have doctors males and females well if we don't have female doctors who will check upon my wife my sister my daughter and my mother when I take her to a male doctor would that be appropriate of course not therefore they say this is a communal obligation which allows a woman to go in fields that are dubious out of necessity so we will approve her doing things that in normal cases that are Haram and prohibited give an example in necessities we can allow things that are normally Haram I'm interested in marrying this sister I go and propose her father looks into my case and he approves she gives the green light we come to the moment of truth which is the initial interview I go and visit her father it is permitted through the Sunnah to look at her though generally speaking I am ordered to lower my gaze not in this case I am allowed to look because this is a necessity a doctor a male doctor who gets a female patient who's suffering and in pain and agony he has to look in order to diagnose her illness he may have to touch in order to reach a conclusion this is permissible for necessity likewise but having said that this male doctor is not allowed to if the woman is complaining of pain in her ear he's not allowed to ask her to strip naked what is this he's not even allowed to ask her to take off the veil of her face because the area where he is allowed to touch and to examine is a specific area everything else remains Hallam for him to look at to touch etc so I beer yes we do need female doctors and this means that you can go to a medicine college but we have to always raise the bar in the sense that don't go to a mixed college when there is a segregated college you try to lessen and reduce the amount of sins practiced to the best of your ability so you try to avoid mixed colleges and universities if not possible then you have to stay as far as possible from male students you have to abide by the full hijab and there's no compromise in this and sometimes they I get students saying that we have to take off our hijabs and wear this shirt like which has an open chest and short sleeves and go into the operating theatre this is not permissible sure if this is a communal obligations with all due respect there is a limit there are red lines that cannot be crossed so if a female is doctor or an intern or a student is obliged to touch male patients in order to examine them this is a necessity but for her to take off her hijab and to reduce the amount of clothes and expose her our no-one says that this is hala so again you have to fear allah azzawajal to the best of your ability when you are studying medicine now one says okay sure would you allow your daughters to go to medicine school masters no since Y says ok this is a personal preference I personally believe that if other women are able to do this and they have the gut feeling that they can go through without fitna and without being changed or altered or compromised their religion hamdulillah but this does not mean that I would allow my daughters to throw themselves in such a test until now we can bring other Muslim doctors female doctors from all over the world and we can do that without any problem bringing them to our country so I feel that for me personally that this doesn't fit if someone asks me I would say that this is ok for you if you are ok with that but people inclinations differ from one person to the other and Allah knows best"
