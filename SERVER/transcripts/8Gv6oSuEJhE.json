  "transcript": "it is a bit Way Beyond my bedtime so if I fall asleep do pardon me if you guys fall asleep I have no problem with that inshallah I've been facing this all of my life this is my life story um the topic first of all and it's a disclaimer I have nothing to do with it I've been receiving comments sheim is a fan of Clint Eastwood I am not so I was shocked that people are telling me that it's it's you she you watch movies and a whole nine yards I've been used to this so I have nothing to do with that now the topic is very important and we can go and speak until F about it and the importance of it lies in the fundamental of our religion which the vast majority of us do not know and this is a bold statement when I say that the vast if I don't look this size side because of the microphone so if I do this the sound goes bad so when I speak like this I feel more at home so not that I favor the brothers here but cvy so our problems in this world all revolve about this concept and that is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala created us for a very noble cause yeah yeah yeah she okay give us from the end we know this introduction you know it but this does not mean that it is something that you practice Allah created us for a noble purpose and cause for this Allah created the creation Allah revealed the books Allah sent the messengers Allah created heaven and hell whoa this is really serious what is this Noble reason that Allah created this for H what is it to worship him yeah yeah we know and I did not create the gin and man kind except to worship me this is what Allah says in the Quran we know this she you know but you do not implement the vast majority of Muslims and I deal with this this on daily basis because I do counseling sessions and when people come to me all of their problems are rooted down to you're not a real Muslim oh you giving me no no no I said real Muslim you may be false Muslim 5050 Muslim moderate Muslim whatever but you're not a real Muslim because Allah says I have not created the Jin and the mankind except to worship me this is the sole purpose of creating this universe why did Allah send Prophet Muhammad Alam to us to guide us to this and it is part of Allah's wisdom that he subhanahu wa ta'ala after creating his servants he does not leave them to go astray it's not a choice you have what would you like to do um I'd like to be a bird no no no no no there are commands there are Halal there are there is sh for you to follow and after Allah explained to you what is halal and what is Haram now it is time for the tests so don't think that Allah will let you live and enjoy life and enjoy everything in it without being tested the beginning of do you know what anab means spider it [Music] begins two verses what what do they interpret to do people think that they will be left alone to claim I am a believer without being tested nay we have tested those who came before them and we shall know who's saying the truth and who's Li who's lying so Allah is testing you every step of the way every step you make Every Breath You Take Allah is testing you a even Ellen Musk he's an atheist even Ellen musk he's being tested so this test comes in different forms in times of hardship in times of prosperity in times of wealth in times of poverty in times of Health in times of illness all are parts of your test Allah says in the Quran F and we test you with evil and with good as trial and to us you will be returned everyone is being tested now today in our era we find a lot of tests a lot of fitna a lot of Trials and the sole purpose which Allah created us for and that is they forgot now they fell asleep to worship Him the sole purpose Allah created us for that is to worship Him people are neglecting people are being preoccupied to look into it so Shan Satan comes and starts to beautify other things to distract you and the enemies of Islam alongside with him they try to preoccupy you from worshiping Allah from knowing what Allah wants from you and from getting closer to Allah in the past my age and more people used to complain oh we have lots of things to do we have so much spare time time we at my my era when I was a teenager we had nothing literally in Saudi Arabia we had only one Saudi channel in Arabic and that was the Super police religious police you would see it and duh and the the the best time in our life was in summer where the humidity was so high we we would put antennas with boosters to receive the reception of Egypt Kyro so when we get cairo's TV on our TV W moly what is this you know this is heaven because what what is in Egypt nothing compared to so we used to have a lot of time on our hands nowadays when I see the youngsters they complain of what lack of time we don't have time we have so many things we are uh distracted and a lot of these things that distract us today they might be Hal but when you abuse the Halal it becomes Mak and when you AB abuse the Mak it becomes Haram because you will be preoccupied with it to the extent that it will distract you from doing your obligations and your and it would make you step by stepf into straightforward Haram now in the past these distractors were few today there's so many and they're so lucrative seductive beautiful and you enjoy them and it attracts the old folks before the youngsters it attracts men and women it attracts those who are sick before the healthy it attracts everyone these distractors are many but the prominent among them is modern technology and with modern technology we tend to classify it in many ways what do you spend your time today on browsing your emails browsing social media platforms Facebook Twitter Snapchat and Instagram which is the most prominent nowadays among the youngsters Facebook nobody uses by the way this is so old and I hope one of your sponsors is not uh Facebook anyhow Facebook by the way is the users are 2.9 billion on Earth but it's dying compared to Instagram Instagram is where everybody is on at the moment and Snapchat unfortunately Twitter 850 million plus users but the amount of tweets are huge WhatsApp you're talking about approximately 30 [Music] billion messages per day not users huh 30 billion and increasing WhatsApp and who owns WhatsApp Facebook H so yeah you know the game now and people spend their time on YouTube chat programs fiber Skype WhatsApp Etc uh um Instagram what's it called chat chat platform telegram telegram telegram sorry I'm I'm I'm a dinosaur right I was born in the previous Century so you could do the math they spend their time on media outlets on their phone phones they spend their time in electronic newspapers lots of us search everything on Google this is why we have she Google everything you and we trust Google like we trust our mothers whatever Google says I've said this I've said that she so and so no no no no Google says it's Hal then we should go with it and they also spend their time following programs new technology video games and this is live streaming six hours eight hours a day let alone mobile phones smartphones and smart watches and the likes just to say what you spend your time on took me five minutes what about the actual time the people spend on it now this this new technology modern technology chopped a huge part of our Lives because it comes on the account of different things and this is the question of balance so in the past a normal person like me when he used to wake up he begins the first thing by saying first before open he thanks Allah for resurrecting him and he says his and he makes W and he prays and when he goes to bed he makes wo and he makes Hisar for bed and he sleeps when he concludes his Salat he makes Hisar until he finishes and leaves the Masjid and when the aan is given he goes to the Masjid he makes W uh before he goes of course and he makes waiting for the Sal thank you I need the coffee M forgive me but so that I wouldn't feel fall asleep inshallah so this was the norm in our times today what do we do every single individual I know the moment he wakes up he holds his mobile phone even my wife I hope this is not recorded in the middle of the night I hear a message and I have unfortunately I wake up for anything I'm a very light sleeper alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah so the message that comes to her mobile in the middle of the night in the darkness I see the screen open and she's answering something and she goes back to bed Subhan Allah Barack Obama am I married to Barack Obama you're not controlling the world what are you doing said no no no this is a message came to me about a family that needs she's involved in charity my wife has nothing to do except charity poor families here and there and she collects from there there and gives there so she just no no they they have an emergency I have to transfer money to them 200 R 100 so this is what they do they start with looking at their mobile they go to bed on their mobile in the I was in the Salat next to me the phone rings the guy takes off takes out his mobile and looks at it and then Scrolls down and then types something and then he puts it in his pocket come on give me a break in Sal so what do you expect from such individuals if they and how many times have you seen people the is called in the Masjid and he's outside the Masjid on a phone or texting and the Salat is gone the first R the second R and he's still how many of us did skip the salad because Barcelona is playing with Liverpool I don't know if this is the right name or something or or uh this or that sport uh uh match or because I'm I'm watching the news I'm watching U some I'm playing on video games how many of us have lost Salat after Salat because I just finish this video game inshallah inshallah and such people memorize the Quran they used to pray in the first row but then little by little they prayed in the third row little by little they skipped the first raak little by little they prayed in the second Jama little by little they started praying home no more Masjid little by little they combine the five daily prayers at the end of the night and pray 17 only is is accepted is not even if they pray it at the end of the night the vast majority of people don't know this a lot of the Muslims pray at the end of the day thinking that I pray five times but I delay it no because they were not prayed on time Allah will not accept it pray it 100 times pray it 500 times Allah will not accept it exactly like someone who comes for Haj and is detained by the passport authorities in the airport of jida only to be released after one week so on the 16th of the he goes to what are you doing sir I'm going for is finished on the 9th of we finished everybody has gone home said yeah but they detained me without any justification so I'm making it up no it doesn't work everything is timed your prayer is time so how many do this a lot and this does not stop it is cascaded to messing up your own responsibilities so the husband messes up with his wife's responsibilities with his children he doesn't know them mashallah what a nice kid who's this he's your son well yeah this is this is number three when did he come oh man I've missed so many things in my life this is a problem when you don't realize ask so many of us about their children which year is your your child especially those who have plenty like myself alhamdulillah I don't know they go to school yes this sixth grade Subhan Allah i al they with third grade that's good Mah time runs they don't know where their children are which school how is their progress or their delay in it the mother is also uh uh not caring for her husband she doesn't know what he needs if he eats if his his his clothes are washed and iron her children in my case or in our case where where I come from we have Maids so the mother leaves the children for the maid and the father leaves the children for the driver and everyone is sitting on their laptops on their smart phones or smart TVs and then you find that an employee is preoccupied to do his job because he's always on the stock market smartphones or or laptops on uh uh monitoring the news as if he's a decision maker and chitchatting and with with and this is also C ated to your next ofkin the vast majority preoccupied by social media specifically and in modern technology in general haven't seen their uncles haven't seen their aunts in years don't know their cousins and some of them don't even communicate with their own siblings in the same house sometimes families come to me and say she when I want to call my kids for lunch I text them because everyone is in their room sitting on their idle or on sorry on their smartphone they're working on it so instead of shouting lunch lunch just text them in the group and they come to eat most of them when they eat they eat and they play with it so the people begin their day with it surfing the internet and checking their social media platforms they go to work they go to school some of them even drive and use the mobile and so many accidents happen because of this and it has negatively impacted specifically the youth how did it impact the youth negatively of course even us uh old geers have been affected M it's black as black as my heart now I can speak freely alhamdulillah so how did it impact us negatively first of all it is the main cause and reason for people to neglect their obligations such as prayer and to delay rarely you will find someone who's preoccupied by it to be in the first row let alone offering 12 Ras of that builds you a house in Jenna really I didn't even know this nobody told me of course because you were busy 12 other than the if you pray them every single day Allah will build you a house in Jenna no permit from the government no no mortgage no and I guarantee you it's the best finishing in Paradise the best double glaze uh uh Windows the heating cool everything is there what pray 12 no I'm so busy well I don't have time why so many of us spend their time wasting it and when you ask them why are you doing this said we're killing time what is the crime what did time do to you so you kill it and they just don't know they don't figure it out again the negative impact among the people especially the youth the unper permissible snapping of photos or clicking of photos of others without their permission now everybody's with their mobiles no you have my permission it's okay I gave you my permission I don't give you my permission when I'm wearing t-shirts and jeans this is I and and I was shocked okay what are you she Dr jaal Mr hiy no when I travel I travel with jeans and t-shirts I don't travel like this you know imagine me traveling in an airplane like this oh Bin Laden I don't want to be like this I want to be like everyone else but unfortunately this makes it difficult so I you're identified no people taking pictures I don't approve people posting such pictures give me a break and what what are you trying to do so a lot of the Muslims and sisters specifically come to me crying she we went to a muslim's wedding it's all totally segregated and we found out that our pictures in our wedding uh uh in our wedding dress party dress I don't know what they call it tare it's all over the internet everybody sees them everybody exchanges them who gave you the right to do this Allah will torture you in your grave for doing this Allah will torture you on the day of judgment for it's even worse than backbiting a woman who's all the time totally covered from head to toe and you're exchanging her picture without her knowing look look my brother this is my friend in college you remember the one we you you drove with us uh two weeks ago three weeks ago and look at her mallah this isn't her bikini what is this no no he's my brother she he's okay no it's not okay we have jealousy we have fear of Allah but with the internet and a lot of the sisters now sisters going to hate me who cares soon a lot of the sisters who are Pious who are fearing Allah they find it easy to snapshots in Snapchat they said yeah after I think 24 hours or something it it disappears is it I don't W I never I've never used it wah and I don't even know it I'm a dinosaur I told you but I I ask around unfortunately I was told that there are programs that capture these pictures so she says no no no she I in a closed circuit only my friends see such photos and her brother is next to her Mah who's this no no she's a friend of mine in college oh she's uh from the Philippines no she's from Malaysia look okay done so your picture is being circulated everywhere a lot of the hij sisters come to to me and say can I have my profile picture excuse me you're black and black said yes I'm in fully nothing shows I wear gloves okay bring a sack of potatoes and put it as a profile picture why do you want to come no no no I want to show my butterfly Abaya but nothing is showing sh nothing is showing everything is black this is how it starts to months later the eyes a little bit Gap you can see the eyes five months later eyelashes fake but M like an alligator from theik little by little by little the is getting the butterfly becomes a a worm masallah very tight and you can see the body structure and figure little by little she's doing this mashallah picking something and the whole arm and she did laser good for you what are you doing little by little this is how shatan Creeps in but people don't recognize what Shan is doing among the downfall of social media that a lot of us fall into exchanging inappropriate links on my WhatsApp I'm a she I get people sending me clips of movies what is this it's very funny I thought you would like it they think I'm a standup comedian i' I'd like to watch these things oh you always crack jokes she this is good if you use this gig Fe Allah what are you doing they share inappropriate links women even news uh uh Clips where a woman presenter or or news anchor is a woman and they send it to me and I immediately send it back she this is Haram says she this news see how Islam deteriorated in their hearts that even looking at news anchors is halal to them and M video clips with music is okay now everybody is saying isn't it she this is what we exchange every single day no it's not I would never and I challenge anyone ever send or exchange something that has music in it though it has so much benefit in it but I would never gain the the the sin or a woman ever because I'm afraid what do I have on the day of judgment nothing and I bring this sin to me and lots of the the people have no problem downfall of social media you get to interact with the opposite gender and people chitchat and this is a frequently Asked question she what's uh the ruling on having friendship and accepting friends from the opposite gender on Facebook on Twitter on this on that what's the reason yeah just friends she what's the what's the ruling and I get this a lot on on communicating with my female teacher after graduating you know every time and and now and then I just send her how how are you how are you doing and a colleague that was with me in a study Circle and we are you crazy this is Haram don't be so extreme Let Let Yourself Loose you're so tight you're gonna die it's true I'm gonna die you're GNA die but I hope that my grave is first class like I travel usually because I try my level best to fill it up with good deeds so that I don't have to suffer I try and I wish and I pray to Allah that all of you have the same inshallah but with the way you're doing and looking at Shar as if it is nothing you have a big serious problem my friend one of the downfall of these social media uh uh platforms is that it is reducing our social activities with the family members we we don't see one another anymore we don't meet we don't have quality time and fathers parents like myself often ask why is it that I don't see my children I dine in home I eat lunch in home I have breakfast at home why don't I see them they're either asleep or working on an assignment or have a class on Zoom or this or that okay this is not an excuse we have to have quality time this issue of quality time has almost disappeared also the level of achievement in education has deteriorated a lot of our children are getting really behind what they're supposed to do their marks are low their achievement are is not uh impressive also um among the downfall of social media is that it's a very fertile ground for spreading rumors and lies everything you know that is a misconception comes from social media and unfortunately this media whether social or uh uh capital I don't know whether social or mainstream media is what brainwashes you in any banana country when there is a coup a military coup what is the first thing that the the Army does over overtakes the radio and the television station number one why because this is how they can control the masses through now after saying all of this one would say aren't you being a little bit too pessimistic isn't there anything good in social media come on of course not social media is not pure evil there is a lot of good in it among them the ease of reaching out to people I had a counseling session with a brother who his father migrated to the US and Chang their family name and the man felt that he's cut out of a tree as we say in Arabic he has no relatives at all only after 30 years to discover by coincidence on Facebook his family his paternal family his uncles and aunts by seeing a photo of someone he said whoa this is my father and when he searched it no it wasn't it was his uncle living in an Arab country so he reached out and it so happens that he is is his uncle so this is one of the benefits of these social media that you can reach out to people you can exchange views and cultures and know about other cultures to learn from it makes distant things close to you and the benefits that you can reap from social media commercially and economically is endless you can be Rich you can do marketing you can do so many things and the best thing for nowadays for any business is an Instagram page where you can advertise and you can communicate with customers and you can have this all the time and it does a lot of Wonders among also the benefits of such social platforms is Da and you all know the power of dawa and when you see the people that use Tik Tok or Instagram I have a page on Instagram I think 1.2 or 1.3 million followers it's not mine I have nothing to do with it I don't know who is running it but look at how much it reached my close friends and and family say call Instagram and put your hand on it so that you I can make a I can make a lot lot of money of it imagine if I just advertise or or endorse something and they pay me for it I can make money I said no it's not mine why would I take someone's effort unless they cross the line and put something that may put me in jail I'm going to stop that but this is social media it's widely spread Who would know me if I had not had social media I'm nobody why am I being attended by generously by the kinds of you because you know me through social media most likely so it has a strong and huge impact of spreading the dean but at the same time it has a huge and strong impact on spreading Innovation shik f sins without any boundaries and unfortunately those who dive in rarely come out safe and sound unfortunately so what is the remedy because our time is is how much time do you have 9 10 11 12 what what is 9 10 I'm I'm I'm not good in 30 minutes so 10 minutes past 9 okay alhamdulillah so yeah insh enough so what is the remedy first of all it is not at all feasible or logical to say avoid because this is the easiest way out cut and avoid and stop all types of social media platforms but this is not logical we need these platforms we have to channel them in a way that would work for us and keep us away from FNA so as long as we can do good with it spread da spread authentic fatwa and call people to Islam then that is a positive aspect of it however a Muslim must protect himself from falling into Haram so many venues of Haram Haram look Haram gaze this is something that I don't R I rarely find Muslims lowering the Gaze you know awax what is an awax awax is an American military plane with a big dish on top of it and it is monitoring all Communications and radar and movement and it flies 247 most of the youth and the youngsters and the Muslims when they walk in a mall they're like the awx and they're looking left no rarely you find people walking lowering their case why because this is not a priority it's not a taboo anymore the level of Haram has been so much reduced to the extent that lots of the people in Malaysia would have no problem shaking hands with the opposite gender correct or wrong rarely you'll find someone doing this meaning no I can't lots of them and when you talk to the sisters hijabis and and and the brothers with a long beard M what are you doing she Iman is here mashallah mashallah if imman is here then when I meet your sister next time I will because IM man is here look how Dean has been manipulated and changed by Shan we don't have any red lines anymore and this shows you how far we are from sh that we don't have an auditor to say this is Haram stop nobody's telling us nobody is advising us no because even our friends are not righteous and practicing they're like us and maybe worse than us so what do you expect a Haram gaze moving or transmitting false news or as he says fake news you may think negatively of Muslims put it on the social media you may even slander Muslims few years back I saw a laundering campaign against one of the diis and they're spreading like wildfire talking about Muslim and slandering him where will you go on the day of judgment what what are you expecting to to have they did it posting Haram pictures and so many things so what is the solution there are a number of steps I will not elaborate a lot but these are just guidelines number one always remember that your priority in life is what worshiping Allah and doing good deeds that would get you into Jenna this is your priority this is the objective that you were created for if you neglect and forget this objective you're lost it's game over go and look for something else because you don't have anything to drive you to Jenna what is your driver to Jenna it is knowing that Allah created me for this purpose and I'll do my level best to revolve around it worshiping Allah submitting my will to Allah regardless of what I hate and what I love I'm going to do what Allah wants me to do number two take it as a rule of thumb anything that misdirect you or distracts you anything that distracts you from worshiping Allah from Salat from then it is false Allah says in the Quran oh you have believed let not your wealth and your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah and whoever does that then those are the losers if your wealth and children they divert you from remembering Allah and you will be a loser for that then what do you think those who are diverted from the remembering Allah by their Facebook by their Snapchat by their Instagram aren't they losers by Tik Tok of course Tik Tok now is Wildfire unfortunately I don't have TiK ToK by the way I tried to download it in the beginning I downloaded it alhamdulillah successfully and it was like 4:00 and when I turned it off it was like 6 o' or 8:00 and this this this only 8 seconds 10 seconds and it's an addiction people are addicted to it and and I said nope I'm too old for thisas my days are numbered on Earth I'm I'm not it's not worth it so I deleted it with the grace of Allah you part of your your your healing process you have to thank Allah's Grace and favors upon you do you have favors and blessings of Allah upon you yes or no yes a lot or few a lot a lot we are immerged in Allah's if you misuse this and this is what I do by the way don't think of me crazy do not well think who cares sometimes I enter the toilet with the lights off and it's pitch black dark and I do my thing and I go out just to appreciate the of sight and I I'm I'm so appreciative to Allah do it you're going to make a mess I know but but believe me Allah's favors upon us are countless we don't see this now when we use this this blessing this favor in sinning then we have committed a major sin because we are using what Allah has given us instead of thanking him we are showing our in gratitude to him by that also among the points that we should pay attention to every time spent in useless things as a contrast some of obligation has been neglected so if you spend time with friends the time that you were supposed to spend with your wife and children has been neglected neglected if you spend time on the internet browsing just playing around then this comes at the time of learning or doing something beneficial and so forth this is why the happiest man on Earth is the man or woman who can balance if you balance your health if you balance your business if you're balance if you balance your social uh relationships if you balance your worship with Allah then you're the L luckiest man on Earth and there is a balance in Islam a lecture on YouTube it's free uh on my channel I think it's going to be very beneficial for you balance your time don't spend all of your time in the Masjid I wouldn't say this oh sh you don't want us to spend time in the Masjid yes I don't want you to spend the time in the Masjid because after half an hour or an hour you'll be fed up and you'll miss three four Salat I don't want it anymore balance your time go to the Masid when you're supposed to go go to the gym when you're supposed to go connect with your uncles and aunts and cousins and siblings when you're supposed to do so take your spouse if you're married to a place for quality time have uh uh good food and or go in the park or walk in the rain whatever I don't know anything crazy uh and also don't neglect your income your business you have to do work if you manage to have a balance then you are a very smart person and the prophet said this clearly in a Hadith when he said there are two blessings of Allah a lot of the people are negligent about what are they health and spare time now in my mid 60s I appreciate this when I go to do omah 40 years ago I used to do om once a year maybe twice a year at most now I like to do om once a month I live next door to Haram but when I go I can't walk she yeah I'm I'm too old I get tired and I regret the days when I was young I had all that energy in me I used to play sports and squash players and I have tournaments and I this do now I'm an old man so this is a now after these years of neglect neglecting it I am at loss don't lose it you have time youti ize it you have health utilize it and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his Lord on the day of Resurrection until he has been questioned about five things Allah will ask you one your life and how you spent it number two his Youth and how he used it number three his wealth and how he earned it your youth you're going to be questioned about did among the solutions a don't be a sponge everything that is poured upon you you suck it up no try to be selective how many websites are there on the internet billions and if you try to browse them all you're going to die before even going through 5% of them so what to do be selective in the websites that have priority for you to visit and also give time so okay 10 minutes for Instagram and it's all Hal huh no not 10 minutes and you go watch Taylor Swift no this is Haram don't do this no watch something that's beneficial but for 10 minutes because as I said it's an addiction it will continue and continue and continue and time runs before you know it and it is highly advisable every week to assess in your smartphone how much time I had spent per week seriously what's the average of us using uh um iPad and mobile phone a day seven hours yeah five hours this is Discount 20% from myself alhamdulillah I'm a generous man seriously how much time do we spend the day on the Quran does this show you where you will be on the day of judgment when you come with five hours on your internet or your mobile phone every single day and you have no five minutes for the Quran are you a Muslim if you spend 10% and I'm saying W 10% of the time you spend on your mobile and social media a day reading Quran and proper books of knowledge in six months time I'll guarantee you you'll be able to be a Sheik six months imagine it doesn't take much but the problem is within do you have the fire yes sh I love to watch Game of Thrones no you this is the long wrong fire I'm talking about about the fire that drives you to Jenna he said oh yes she but uh you know I have work I have studies I have all of this is not existing when you open your mobile and your platforms no worries about work or studies only when I tell you read the Quran my problem every time I read two lines I start yawning and I'm too tired I'm sleeping right or wrong and the people are yawning now but just doing it Subhan Allah why because Shan is controlling you when you watch a movie you're so happy you're so energized and there is car racing there is bullets everywhere and there blood and there is a little bit nudity good WR it off PG is not good and I watch this un enjoyable two hours later the movie is over how do you feel miserable bored I had a sister a little bit older an old woman she's coming to me she's she every time my son watches movies he's happy he's enjoying his time the movie is over he comes and looks at me depressed I'm bored so I said watch another movie he watches Another Movie he's having fun he's enjoying after the movie is over I am bored why my son do you see I am bored on my for why is it because this is like drugs you're using it you're having a good time you drinking whiskey you're enjoying it The Hangover is awful if you quit you're going to get hangover you're GNA get headaches what to do drink another glass now I'm feeling good take another joint do whatever you want but don't ever sober out because the moment you sober Shan occupies your head because the moment You're Sober you know that there is Jenna there is Nar you know that you're going to die and this will make you go straight to the straight path not the convention but so this is what Shan wants to distract you from among the solutions and this is very very important it's called to be in seclusion to be alone with Allah and this is something Shan if you try it today go home give it a shot give it a shot put your mobile on flight mode and put the alarm for I wouldn't say 1 hour not even 30 minutes 15 minutes put the set the alarm for 15 minutes and put it away from you and just sit in your room like this you don't have to wear this of course but sit in your room and contemplate okay how old am I how long do I think I'm going to live am I going to go to Jenna do I have sins does Allah love me what is my position with Allah what is the position of Quran in my heart and you will not withstand 3 minutes and you say number one number two you'll become frightened I'm scared whoa what have done with my life where am I going Allah will put me in Hell straight away three minutes and you'll take your mobile go back again to social media get distracted I don't want to try to get in your car no radio no music music nothing and drive for half an hour how would you feel I can't drive sheh I need something to fill up my head this is how Shan Works keep you busy 24 hours seven days a week this is why may Allah be pleased with him said take your time in seclusion this is his order be alone you know what is the best time to be alone quality time whenever everybody's asleep of course I'm not talking about Fame Seekers Fame Seekers go to Twitter now I'm going for tud pray for me what is this I'm shocked with people on their social media platforms and now I'm in Kaaba this is Caba this is Haram and this is my it feels so good I'm Feels So Close to Allah I'm so so cool after a while I'm now shaving my head look who what are you doing seriously what are you doing she I'd like to share these moments with the people no you want to be famous you want to be recognized you don't need to do this unfortunately social media is a platform for people seeking fame so whatever oh binaz has a social media so binaz says a fatwa you come I don't think this fat is Right excuse me who who's talking oh no no this is too extreme this is Subhan Allah in the old days like seven eight centuries ago in the Hajj season the Haram was fully packed there comes a nomad a bedwin with a bag of feces crap and he came close to the Kaaba and he wants to put put it on the walls of the Kaa of course immediately the H the pilgrims took hold of him and beat the heck out of him and then they took him to the judge so he stood in front of the judge and when the judge read his crime he said are you a Muslim said yes said if you're a Muslim what what were you thinking why were you doing such a heinous act tarnishing and soiling the ca with feces he said well I wanted to be known among the people even if they curse me so they would say to each other H do you remember this cursed Allah this guy who tried to do this last season so they recogniz him Fame is the name of the game all those on platforms want to be famous even that H the guy is saying time I'm going to kick you I want to be famous give me 5 minutes so this is problematic now lots lots of us want to become famous they just comment without any knowledge just in order to be famous and this is problematic always ask your intention and check your Soul why am I doing this and um it is very important for us to upbring ourself to train ourselves to always sense Allah is watching over us the vast majority of us don't have this in front of you I'm very Pious I'm very righteous sisters come and ask me a question I lower my gaze yes sister yes M no people are are watching I can't do this the the moment I go to my room I lock the door I check the tables no bugs No cameras then I'm alone I don't care I watch Haram stuff I listen to Haram stuff where is the fear of Allah I fear the people more than I fear Allah Allah says in the Quran they conceal their evil intentions and deeds from the people but they cannot conceal them from and he is with them in his knowledge when they spend the night in such as he does not accept of speech we never consider this that Allah is watching us now I have a number of eates when dealing with social media but how much time do we have seriously 2 minutes well it would take at least half an hour but I'll I'll just mention them and you do the math number one before you comment or write any post always purify your intention who you doing it for for the sake of Allah do you want recognition do you want praise do you want follow followers don't do it if you're doing it for the sake of Allah do it without looking behind you this is the most important sincerity and everything you do number two you have to avoid publishing or reposting anything you're not 100% certain of so many times nowadays with the Gaza problems may Allah grant them victory over their enemies I get posts allahar allahar look at the Victory and it's from a video game like 20 tanks and it's boom boom boom boom come on what do you think think of us any sucking our thumbs and Muslims spread this like wildfire no don't post anything unless it is what authentic and you can verify it and if you please when you drink drink with your right hand do not drink with your left all of you what's the ruling on drinking with the left Haram um also not every true piece of information is okay to publish some people come to oh in this country this evil Act is taking place and I'd like to highlight and post what's the use oh because this is evil she what is the use come again but it's true she I know it's true what is the use there's no use of it all the scholars say whenever you hear of something Haram can see seal it and make it hidden because the moment you spread Haram things people would accept it and after some time oh there's a concert of Shakira when what do you mean when this is Haram this yeah but Shakir Hips Don't Lie come on Subhan Allah when evil is there conceal it don't spread it so not everything that you know you can publish this is part of the etiquette of such uh uh posting and be careful of your friends in the beginning when I had Facebook everybody asked me to befriend I take them as a friend and all of a sudden on my timeline I see inappropriate things what is this I ask who's doing this did your friends if I don't have friends like this but I already have 5,000 friends what do I do with them so it's problematic don't befriend except those whom you wish to see on the day of judgment coming with you leading you to your destiny and never accept friendship from the opposite gender come on you're a boy why are you accepting a sister when she's coming uh to you and you're a sister why are you accepting a boy well not a boy yeah a grandfather when he comes to uh befriend you he has ill intent no unless there is a legitimate Halal reason for that among the eates organize your time also be brave be courageous if you make a mistake apologize I made a mistake few years ago I made so many mistakes but alhamdulillah I speak in English nobody understands that's a that's why I don't make lectures in Arabic right I I have so many people that would catch me in English once I said I drink beer I drink beer in Saudi the beer is zero alcohol and I said it's zero alcohol and the amount of alcohol is approximately 3% I was wrong in quoting 3% it's point three and if you drink a six-pack or 12 bottles you will never be intoxicated and the prophet Sall wasallam made the ruling whatever intoxicates in huge amount little of it is Haram so aani took this and spread it as Wildfire oh wab this sh blah blah blah blah he drinks beer and everybody started speaking against me alhamdulillah I'm G do you think when you speak against me I'm going to be offended you don't know me you surely don't know nothing gets under my skin I have skin skin like dinosaurs I am a dinosaur but the unfortunate thing are those who do not verify so when people started spreading this I came on TV and I said I said this and this and this that was wrong and I clarify and I explain to people the concept of it you come to Saudi you drink 12 bottles of Halal beer which is non-alcoholic would you be drunk no if you drink one glass of vodka would you be drunk one drop of it is Haram of vodka one drop though it's not going to intoxicate you because the rule was given so be courageous be brave you make a mistake confess and apologize and retract your statement and finally and I will conclude don't pull the guns finally do not and I repeat do not repost or like anything that you don't want to see on the day of judgment a sister posts something a photograph so many of the brothers that's like this this like this thump it will burn in hell on the day of judgment because you like something Allah abhor likewise retweeting or reposting don't ever do this because this is endorsing it you are endorsing it and saying to the people that I approve with it and this would come in your record book and those who fell asleep May wake up now"
