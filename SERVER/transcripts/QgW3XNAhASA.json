  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillahir rahmanir rahim' masala - as salam ala rasulillah kareem alhamdulillah welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we were discussing child rearing its beauties is benefits is virtues and in this particular episode we'll be talking about playing with children in a sense that as they are growing up as we are watching them grow how do we engage them in a way that is loving in a way that is merciful in a way that causes them to grow up to be balanced happy and you know love giving human beings so I'm do that to help us with this endeavor we have Shaykh awesome documented Hakim who was a teacher at exotic Adam II a teacher at KIU and he has been an imam and a teacher for over 30 years at hundred la we would like to introduce our guest I said I'm on the corner tada well Adi who Sharon what I have to lie here what a catch oh there's a call ok are coming Sheikh and we always benefit from your knowledge but a colloquy comes along here for having me and now I'm delayed there was a narration of the Prophet Adam as he was on his memoir and his grandson has a note saying we're rumbling and tumbling or rolling around Animesh did and he said Sawa could we please talk about this narration and what was the particular thing that happened here she's not my never Haim hamdulillah who salat wa salam o allah i'm doing what i solely well mustafa nabina muhammad why the early he was so happy here I'm Anita Derby Hooda I'm a bard oh this narration is authentic is in the sahi the Prophet asam was giving a hot ba on the pulpit when he saw Al Hassan or Hussein and they were tripping and as they were children of two or three years of age maybe less so he came down from the pulpit picked him up and went back and he said allah azzawajal had said the truth that wealth and your offspring are a fitness they are means of testing so i saw them i could not hold back myself from embracing them and we know that the prophet so Sam was the best of men and part of being one of the best of men is to express your feelings so many times we are under the assumption that real men do not express their feelings and this is totally wrong the best of men the best man ever to walk the earth was the prophet without any doubt Ali his salat WA Salam and if you look into his serie and this is why I highly encourage Muslims to read about their prophet Ali salat some biography to read the book of a shaman in his description how he used to live and how is to act because from that you learn the best way to live so you don't have to have a life coach to come and tell you do this or do that because we have our own model who is the Prophet is awesome did he express his feelings indeed he did either by saying or by acting so do you love your brother do you love your wife are he of course did you express that to her a lot of the Muslims would say no I didn't but she knows no this is not enough the Prophet Elias awesome when asked by strangers I'm homeless comes to him and says o prophet of Allah who's the most beloved person to your heart the Prophet said Aisha said no no no I meant men he said her father Abu Bakr there is nothing to hide by actions the Prophet Adam used to express his love whenever mother Aisha drank milk from a glass or a cup he used to drink from the same position she placed her lips on no not like what we do so okay change it please it's it's hygiene hate for hygiene purposes or wash it with DEET all or whatever no and also with children the profit it was narrated re-solder used to place awesome heavens 8 on one leg and al-hassan Benally on the other leg now just a background of Osama Osama evens 8 M no Haritha his father is Zaid M no Haritha he was the adopted son of the Prophet Allah so some when adoption was permitted so everyone knew him as Zeta mu Muhammad he was a slave given by Hakeem on Hossam to his aunt Khadijah Khadijah gave him to the prophet alayhi salatu salam as a gift the Prophet set him free and talked to the people of Mecca this is my son then Islam abolished adoption in the Western society is concept which is taking your name inheriting becoming like a real son this was abolished so he was named as they deem the Haditha the Prophet says this man I love and then he got married he got him married to UM Ayman the Abyssinian so she was black he was white and she gave birth at a very late age she was old really older and it's something like in the 50s and the 60s something just wow they didn't have Guinness Book of Records at the time but it happened and she gave birth to Osama Osama was black and his father's Aid was white so the Prophet used to love Osama so much as if he was one of his grandchildren and whenever they used to describe Osama they used to say Oh Osama the love of the Prophet Allison am the son of the love of the Prophet has up so he loved them both so when they were children he used to place this place them both while sitting down on his knees and you said oh Allah have mercy upon them for I have mercy upon them I love them I feel a compassionate to them the Prophet didn't hide such feelings he expressed it he showed everyone that we are human beings we have to show our feelings to especially to the ones who we love for an example a man was talking to the Prophet Isis sample when a third person walked by so the man said o prophet of Allah I love this brother hmm why does he love him because he's a practicing Muslim he's kind he's generous look at what the Prophet asked him he said you love him and I said yes he said did you notify him them I said no so the Prophet said go and tell him and brother Yusuf I love you for the sake of Allah and I'm telling you that so that we would be following the Sunnah when you love someone express your love our love is not the tonic as they call it it is natural a man loves a man for the sake of Allah not for any you know weird things that's happening in the West we don't have this at hamdulillah it's it's a natural love based on the Quran and the Sunnah because you're righteous because you pray because you're kind of parents bla bla bla all of this our reasons for me to love so expressing your feelings is part of our religion especially when such feelings are positive the Prophet alysus met Mourad once and he said mother in heaven he said Mahad by Allah the Prophet is swearing I love you do not leave at the end of every salat to say Allah any analytical Akashic record Sneha Mattituck the Prophet is expressing is loved even to his companions now if we were to look at other scenarios we would find that the profit erase awesome was not a general was not a man of the military you know rigid tough everybody has to wake up at oh six hundred hours do this do that it was easy going halal Haram he never played with but anything else goes so um Kyle it for example it shows you this we're talking about the head of the state we're talking about a man that Persia and and the Byzantine Empire and everyone around him are scared of because of his power and the growing powers he has he gets a piece of cloth dress so he asks the Companions who should we give this to and nobody answers well we don't know so he says call Omaha lead and um had it was a six or seven years of age girl so she's a companion but she's a child so she comes with her father sitting and he says uncle it wear this so she puts it on because she was with her parents among the migrants to Abyssinian came back so the Prophet said to her in Abyssinian Sanna Sanna which means beautiful beautiful so this is not the end of the story the Prophet is compassionate to this young girl he gives her a present so what this happens all the time she being a child of five six years of age seven years of age maybe younger started playing around the Prophet Isis a nun because she felt safe and secure he's not grumpy he's smiling and he's allowing me to play so she started jumping over the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the companions were there and her father was you know on edge what is she doing and then she went to the back of the Prophet Ali salatu salam and slid down his garment and saw the seal of the prophet hood which is in the shape of a pigeon's egg this this small and it had few hairs on it so she started playing it it's something that the Prophet had between his shoulders at the back this was something that went really overboard to her father so he started you know shouting at her scolding her stop what you're doing that's normal what's not normal was that the action of the Prophet that son by saying Deever she's a kid leave her let her do what she wants to do and this shows you that a child of that age when she grows up thinking of what she used to do with the Prophet autism and to the Prophet as Salam and the Prophet was respecting her and tolerating her how would shut such a person bring up and raise her own children definitely these are lessons that would remain with a person when he grows up to become an adult even in their my thinking about now when I was younger my father was teaching us to pray giving us a total birthday pray he would never beat us or shout at us to pray and sometimes we fooled around I said one time we played this a lot and we got a beating my god but normally he would say remember your prayers remember to really remember to do this and he would do it in a very soft and gentle way so for that reason we grew up with a love and care for prayer nobody had to force us to pray because we love each other because we thought our prayer we thought of the loving and kindness that our father shoulders but I have other friends who grew up and they hate it to pray not the prayer itself but the sort of ideas rotaries exactly the approach so that we think of prayer never i think of rigidness never just leave the Salah so this is the hikma of the Prophet SAW solemn and this brings us up to a similar point which nowadays is not appropriate at all before we used to take our children to the teacher in the Masjid to teach them Quran and so many of these children would have of these teachers would have a stick now I'm not against reprimanding children with a stick I'm against abusing them and using violence the way the hit the children is inhumane nowadays if you take your children to such teachers we've seen this a lot of the children would hate the Quran would hate the religion because of the approach of that teacher and the teacher of course is very low paid person and most likely is not educated this is why it is extremely important to select a good teacher who's compassionate rather than someone who's violent we're gonna stop here for a short break and we'll be right back to you with some more hikmah with some more beautiful stories about child rearing the beauty of having mercy and playing and growing up in a way that they grow up to be humane happy and you know careful children Shana Tejada until we come back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we were talking today about raising children and playing with them about showing mercy and this is according to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW Salaam so we mentioned a few stories and there are many more to mention not just have mentioned stories but to pull the wisdom out to apply them in our lives so that we can raise wholesome and healthy and happy children a shout-out to either and it was a mention of a heart the heart of the preface for Adam who was a nested in Ematic and one day the Prophet I said I'm sent him out to complete an errand and he completely forgot what the errand was and he began to play and the problem then found him in the middle of playing and I would like I should add some to then continue the story and explain to us what did the progress on him do and how can we reflect upon this and apply it to our own lives well there are so many stories about anis may Allah be pleased with him I mean and this blessed family of his is something out of this world his mother was known as almost relate a room I saw and she was a wise woman even Hajj are may Allah be pleased may Allah have mercy on his soul related her to the Prophet and she he said that she was one of his Muharram so she um she Lane and her sister Omaha LOM and their brother Haram Ibrahim Al Han where as stated by manager the uncles and aunts of the Prophet is awesome so they were his Muharram and when the Prophet came to Medina she was so smart and I think if she were here in the current stock markets she would have made billions on Wall Street because she did pick the best investment ever Allah she went to the prophetess and said o prophet of Allah my son Ana's he's 10 years of age he will be your servant he's a learner boy she didn't ask for money because she has wealth and he is a free boy he's not a slave so she wanted to invest so that he would attain dois from the profit knowledge from the profit Baraka and blessings from the Prophet so he became the hard him which means in English the servant of the Prophet are a sort of salami for ten years imagine he said I accompanied and served the prophet a son for ten years never ever he asked me why didn't you do so-and-so for something I didn't do or wouldn't you have done so and so for something I should have done never the Prophet would interrogate him or ask him it was an easygoing it was a relationship based on trust the story you mentioned that the Prophet said that Anna says the Prophet ordered me to do something and I wasn't very happy about it I was a bit upset so as I was go I was going to do it I saw kids play so I started playing with them and after a while like half an hour so the Prophet stood next to me I wasn't aware of that he said Anna's did you do what I told you to do so I immediately was you know shaken up and I said I'm going o prophet of Allah and the Prophet started laughing you know reprimanding no hitting no scolding that's it look at the way the Prophet is to deal with children not only that he used to empower them nowadays we have women empowerment well what do you mean taking them out of the fold of Islam and making them similar to men so now even men and women they don't want to have this they want to have a word that represents the gender so she does not say she she says they for a female or a male what is this they say this is best so that we don't segregate this is nonsense in Islam empowerment of children is there giving them confidence giving them trust so many times someone tells you say this or that to the child said no no no I'm afraid that he would leak my secrets the Prophet didn't do this I some he trusted the Companions the children and as we Malik says the Prophet told me I didn't saw some to do something and he said that this is secret but half of the manager explains he said this secret is not part of the religion this is something to do with the prophets wives so it's a personal that's why so he went did what the Prophet had asked him to do then went back home almost will aim may Allah be pleased with her said to him what kept you so long why are you late so he said the Prophet Isis am sent me on an errand so naturally she said what was it now look Ana's learnt from the Prophet that this is a secret he said I can't tell you it's a secret my wife anyone's mother would beat the heck out of him until he confesses what is that secret Oh Muslim said listen son as long as the Prophet has entrusted you with it do not tell a soul about it Ana's mathematic is reporting this hadith 40 years after the death of the Prophet as a sample and he's telling it to his companion from the table I mean rabbit al banana and he says to him smiling habit you know how much I love you by a life I told a soul I would have told you so he kept the secret till he died till his grave what does this teach us it teaches us to look up to our children and give them confidence now so many times we say things we don't pay attention to but such words have devastating impact and effect on the children a child comes in eight nine years of age wants to pour the coffee to the guest honoring his father is in my house and the father says no no you're too young to you sit sit sit give it to your elder brother you can't do this why give him give him a shot let him go for it explain it to him nicely show them at least if you okay you're afraid after five minutes when the child is there you show the guest oh this is my man this is my youngest but he's my eldest mashallah he he memorizes a Fatiha he goes with me to the Masjid build confidence in him so that he would feel like a real man rather than keep on criticizing him on every aspect of life like we do why are you sitting this straight why didn't you do your homework did you pray to her did you pray a sir did you do this did you do that did you revise your Quran panamá we keep on doing these things not realizing that we are destroying them from the inside yeah so in its phase when children are growing up you know many parents are very rigid expect them to be perfect expect everything to be done on time even don't allow them room for playing like it looked down upon what you know what are some advisor or some authentic traditions that we should allow children to pray play up until you know certain level you know how do we sort of this is really bad if you know so much a lot of us when we have children and the children sit for six or seven hours next to us not doing anything we left that child also Pownall nah there's something wrong with this child you should take him to a doctor not moving like this is not normal not natural the natural thing is the children play they jump they break things okay we reprimand them in according to their age to their understanding but not all the time so to have children act naturally this is part of Islam the Prophet used to treat them according to their age and they remember this animal Malik had a younger brother the Prophet used to joke with him he says about Omega matter felon knew he had a small bird and the bird died so the boy was three four years of age was sad and the Prophet used to ask him and call him a bad room a nick naming him not only that Mahmood Abner Robby and may allah be pleased with him for me and he was a the youngest companions of the Prophet he says I was five years of age and I recall it as if it's yesterday that the Prophet was making Woodill and while having water swirling in his mouth I was over a distance he spitted the water in my face laughing with me you know this is a way you joke and he says I remember this which makes him part of the Sahaba also I think sure name was Dana the daughter of umm Salama his wife so he she was his stepdaughter he used to whenever she comes sprinkle water while performing water in her face this kind of loving environment is gaming was part of her our religion it was reported that Omaha problems was in his home lying on his back and children jumping on his chest one of his officials you know the ruler of a region came in and he said subhanAllah you're the halifa you're the Caliph and this is being done to you so Omar took note of that and he said what do you do with your children he said well with my children when I come home no one opens his mouth whoa what did I want to do he said leave your post you are fired if you don't have mercy upon your own children how would you have mercy upon all the Muslims that you are governing so all of this shows you that it is part of our Islam but we are ignorant of our own religion and the beauty of it it's a Panama this is a perfect place to end I said I'm a Chaba I'm even thinking about a statement of the other I believe is a camera to dinner to Dan correct as you do what other so we'll be done on to you too so Charlotte Allah thank you so much for your wisdom shake everything that you share today is beneficial for our viewers we hope that you benefited much today and take away that we should have mercy we should be playful and we shall raise the children in a wholesome manner so that it can become wholesome adults and continue on the process of showing love of showing care and showing kindness to the children so we can have a community of people that are stable mentally and spiritually in Charlotte Radha thank you so much for going to look forward to having you next time assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu [Music]"
