  "transcript": "Allah the Almighty made it obligatory upon Muslims to fast the holy month of Ramadan and fasting as we know the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam before that Muslims used to fast but it was made obligatory upon them to fast the Day of Ashura and that was before Ramadan became obligatory and the Day of Ashura is the tenth day of the month of Muharram the first month of the Islamic calendar and the reason behind the Muslims fasting that was the day before him before the Sharia came to first Ramadan yes why why were we ordered to fast Asherah because the order from Allah so jealous so we're not having a choice and Cara Ibrahim LSL oh no it had to do with Moses yeah it is the same day that allah azza wajal has saved moses and the sons of israel from Pharaoh and his followers and they were drowned and Moses and his followers peace be upon him was saved from those who were following him so when the prophet salallahu alaihe salam came to Medina and he found that the Jews used to fast that day he said well I should fast that day more than you because I'm closer to Moses more than you and he instructed and ordered everyone to fast that particular day in thanking Allah for that now so we have to be change it old there is something different between the Muslims and look for all the Muslims and unbelievers well the prophets allah sallam at the very beginning he fasted only the tenth and then he said well if I make it to the next year I will fast with it the ninth so that he would not simulate the non-muslims and fasting only the tenth he would the ninth and the tenth in order to be different from them but if you fast only the tenth this is acceptable though we can see it sooner is not it's not obligatory of course because now with Ramadan it's not obligatory any more"
