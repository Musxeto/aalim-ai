  "transcript": "so if a man wants to get married and he found a good practicing woman and he wants to get married to her but his parents don't give their consent because they want him to marry a woman of their choice who might not be good for his being so in this case can he disobey his parents and marry without their consent first of all we are ordered in Islam to obey our parents and the prophet had said that the father is the Middle Gate of Jannah and he told us that a man must give his good companionship to his mother three times and one on the fourth to his father now having said this it is an obligation upon every Muslim man or woman to be dutiful this to be respectful and obedient to their parents and to be patient and tolerant to whatever abuse they may Express or show now having said that a man is obliged to choose the wife of his liking not to his parents liking because he's the one who's going to be married to them or to her not them and he's obliged to provide the woman with a separate accommodation where she is not obliged to see his parents or to serve him or his uh siblings Etc so this is the basics in Islam it is not permissible for you to marry someone whom your parents are forcing you to marry if you don't like her if you don't fancy her because I do counseling sessions I've been doing this for a while with the grace of Allah and I see the amount of problems after marriage from such choices the guy says I'm married for five years it was an arranged marriage my mom forced me to marry her I did not like her I I was interested in marrying another woman but they refused so I accepted because they forced me to do this they mentally blackmailed me now I have three children and I can't live with my wife and I I just can't look at her I can't be intimate with her so the guy is putting a scenario where he leaves no room other than divorce now what is the fault of this poor woman to be a single mom with three children oh my mom ordered me my mom forced me if you are a mummy's boy don't get married if your mom tells you what to do and what not to do and you're still suckling milk don't get married until you are grown up marriage is a responsibility you take a woman into this affair you take care of her you become her Rock she depends entirely upon you after Allah if you fail to do this you're sinful at the sight of Allah having said that for you Yusuf to get married we have to look at the circumstances if you want to marry someone who's righteous and practicing and from a good family but simply your parents or one of them is not accepting we have to look at your circumstances are you financially independent yes I am can you get married without their financial help yes I can can you provide a separate accommodation for your wife no I can't ah so you want to marry someone whom your parents don't like and bring her to their home forget about this that is a an actual nightmare for your mom and for this poor girl so don't even think about it what to do either convince them so that they willingly accept or wait until you can provide a separate accommodation for your wife or compromise and agree to marry this woman bearing in mind that you're stuck with her forever so you have to walk the talk and try your level best to please her and to make it happen and may Allah make a way out for all of you we have"
