  "title": "The process of when we can wipe over the socks when making wudu ( resident ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the Philippines please explain to me the process of wiping on the socks it's very easy you want to pray you have to perform wudu the what do you know and in the voodoo you wash your feet as a must now there is a concession a gift to make life easy that after finishing your wudu if you put and wear your socks and never take them off they're on your feet and you break your wudu when you go to make a new wudu you don't have to take your socks you can only you should only wipe on them on the top like this that's it but after wiping on your socks if you take them off you're still in the state of voodoo and you would like to replace them with new socks or wear the old socks again this is not possible for you to wipe why because the second time you put on these socks you did not put them on an original wudu which was included in washing your feet you did not wash your feet the previous Widow was wiped on so this doesn't do the job if you put your socks after an original wudu which you had washed your feet in you can wipe over the socks for 24 hours providing you don't take them off providing that you don't be in the major ritual state of impurities"
