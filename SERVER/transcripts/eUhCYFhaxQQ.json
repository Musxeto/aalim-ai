  "transcript": "sh my question is we know that Graves should not be higher than a handspan in my country when people dig a grave place the diseased inside and then refill the grave with soil the grave becomes very tall people use shovels to bring back the soil to the grave and a few people take turns doing this until all of the soil is put back so sh my question is am I allowed to be of those persons who Buri the the diseased using a showel knowing that at the end of this process the grave is going to be extremely tall this is not logical a because whatever is dug out of the Grave whether by your own bare hands or with a shovel or what whatever this amount of soil when put aside and then you bury the uh Muslim in the grave and you block okay and you put the soil back again the height it would be in relevance to the body that occupied that uh uh amount of size therefore it won't be that high it would be maybe this High which is acceptable and normal without any problem in participating in doing that inshallah"
