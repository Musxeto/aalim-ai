  "transcript": "if I can start with a question from the the internet um the brother's asking about Salah he says Where do we stand in the road now what do he means by this and I've cut the question short is when I enter the mosque and there's a Jamar going on where do I start do I if the front row is full the second row is full where do I start at the ends or how do I go about it the Sunnah is for a Muslim to stand behind the Imam when praying in congregation with others of course if he's praying on his own with another person he should stand beside him and it's a common error that a lot of or misconception that a lot of the Muslims would keep a gap between them and their Imam in the sense that he should be like 20 cm ahead of themad them yes they they should be standing uh uh shoulder Tosh shoulder but if you're praying with others and you come the Sunnah is to have the Imam in the middle and though the prophet Sall wasallam said in a in a Hadith that Allah the almighty and the angels pray over the right side of the Rose this does not mean that we should start from the right till the till behind uh the Imam and leave the left side of the road go empty Scholars say that if you come and both ends are equal then it's preferable and recommendable for you to go to the right but if it's imbalanced the row itself was imbalanced you should fill up the Gap that makes it balanced as much as possible okay leading from that the second question is how do we stand now he's got some questions here do we stand feet to feet it says shoulder to shoulder you just mentioned something about the ankle to ankle Toe to Toe how do we go about standing next to our brother and this is in J Salah the Sunnah is that you stand shoulder Tosh shoulder knee to knee foot to foot and toe to toe and heal to heal this is how the companion of the Prophet alham described how they used to stand in a row and he also elaborated by saying if you do this that on his time his he's mentioning his times if you do this nowadays people would you know scatter around you and they would not be close to you it all depends on the love they had to each other so the companions had so much love to each other to the extent that standing shoulder toh shoulder in prayer sticking their shoulder to the shoulder next to them and the same thing with the feet with with the knees with the the heels you know it was so you cannot imagine this because they were so tied together that they stood in prayer as the Angels do this is the Sunnah having said that a Muslim should always have wisdom whenever he does something and you have to be wise in choosing those who stand be next to you in the sense that if you feel that the one next to you the minute you stick your foot to his is going away from you then leave this Sunnah do not follow him it's very funny that in some masjids you find people starting in prayer spreading their feet so wide apart and when the prayer is over you find gaps like half a meter left and half a meter to the right and why is that they start prayer intentionally so that if someone who is following the Sunnah is next to them and he tries to stick his foot to his he goes and narrowing the Gap and at the end of the Salah Subhan Allah you find lots of gaps and this is completely unacceptable on your part if you are following the Sunnah and you sense and feel that the man next to you is not willing to stick his foot to yours then do leave a very small Gap don't touch him don't stick your foot to his but leave as minimal Gap as possible possible without irritating him because this is more important than the Sunnah of sticking your foot to someone that does not want to"
