  "title": "Is it possible to see Prophet ﷺ‎ in our dream? What can we do to have this privilege Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Minh he says can we actually see the prophet sallallah wasam in dreams what should we do in order to have this privilege the Hadith is authentic the prophet saidham whoever sees me in his dreams he has seen me for real and the scholars gave different interpretation one famous interpretation was that this was addressing the companions who did not migrate nor were privileged to meet the prophet Alam at his time so this was like giving him giving them a glad Tiding and saying to them listen if you see me in your dreams this means that you will migrate and meet me in the flesh in person another interpretation was that this was addressing the companions whom the prophet was with so he was with them they recognized him so he told them that if you see me in your dreams and I say something to you then this is a true reality because you recognize me you know me Shan cannot impersonate me so whatever I say to you in the dream that's legit that that sh because that that was me and both opinions are not that strong the third opinion which a lot of the salaf used to embrace was that whoever sees the prophet Alam in his dreams while succeeding in describing him as he was described in the S then he had seen the prophet am because Satan cannot impersonate him from this we understand that when someone comes to us and says oh sheh I saw the prophet Alat and he had a big afro said that wasn't the prophet or I saw the prophet he was like four five foot tall and he had Chinese or or um Asian uh facial features said that wasn't the prophet if he someone says I saw the prophet but all what I saw was light I could not see how he looked light or I saw a tall man or I saw someone wearing jeans this was not the prophet you have to describe him as he was described in the authentic Sunnah and he said finally what should we do in order to have have this privilege there isn't anything you can do nobody knows what uh to be done the more you love the prophet Alam the more you follow his Sunnah and the more you follow his Sunnah the more you are actually visualizing him you see when we pray and we put our right hand over the left on the chest because we remember the Hadith of that this is how the prophet used to pray am so we envision this we we can see it and this beats a thousand times more than seeing him in a dream because we don't have a lot of emphasis or importance over dreams in Islam so if you see him that's great does it mean that you'll never go to hell no does it mean you're a companion not at all is it a glad Tiding hopefully it depends on what you do in your day-to-day life if you see the prophet in your dreams but you're not complying with his Sunnah and you're far away from practicing Islam this doesn't add anything to you and Allah knows best finally"
