  "title": "What the right hand poseses-what does that mean?",
  "transcript": "question what does the term the right hand possesses mean this is mentioned so many times and we would like to come we would like clarification of the phrase uh uh please the right hand uh possession is what uh known in English I think as con Concan concubus whatever I don't know I always uh forget uh to memorize this word and as I don't use it what is it this is a prisoner of war in Islam slaves can only come through Wars so in Islam if there is a war and we have prisoners of Wars we don't throw them in Guantanamo for 10 or 15 years without any trial we don't execute them we take them as slaves and in Islam slavery is permissible only through Wars now if a man has a woman as his slave he has the right to have intercourse with her she's not his wife and she is bought and sold in the market of slavey one would say w this is barbaric well this was found in Christian and in Judaism go and look into your Bibles but when we say this you have to look at the holistic picture don't say that oh this is barbaric how can a man sleep with a woman just because he bought her and then he sells her after a month and isn't this prostitution no it is not it has nothing relating to prostitution it is the prisoners of Wars they are slaves and they are treated as slaves slaves but look how Islam treats slaves first of all you're not allowed to beat them the prophet saw one of his companions beating a slave and he said oh so and so remember Allah's Powers over you when you do what you're doing and the man said the man this slave is free for the sake of Allah he set him free also if you look at the Quran there you would find numerous places in the Quran where Allah makes the experation of a sin that you freay that you free a slave the first experation for example if someone kills someone by mistake he has to set a slave free if he's unable then he has to fast for two consecutive months so he I killed him by mistake I was driving and I ran over him he died the Islam tells you you have to give the blood money to his family and also you have to to free a slave if you swear by Allah I'm not going to uh go to my brother's house tomorrow and then you change your mind the first thing to do is free a slave if you say to your wife you are like my mother I'm not going to have intercourse with you punishing her and punishing yourself it's not a divorce but you're simply saying that you are Haram for me you're like my S sister you're like my daughter well Islam tells you if you want to go back to sleep with her you have to free a slave first of all if a person has intercourse with his wife during the day time of Ramadan while both of them are fasting free a slave if this if that everything you look around you you will find that the first experation you do is freeing a Slave which means that Islam encourages slaves to be freed but at the same time it gives them a chance to live in Muslim houses to see how Muslims as in the pleased with him when one saw him with his slave and they were both wearing the same clothes and they said Subhan Allah how do you clothe your slave in the same clothes that you are wearing it's the same uh uh uh money the same uh cost the same designers uh clothes things he said well this is the instruction of the Prophet to feed them from what we eat and to clothe them from what we wear now nobody in in on on on on Earth does this with not his slaves Nobody Does this with their servants so this shows you that Islam gives honor and dignity even to the slaves however if a person buys a slave woman and he sleeps with her and she becomes pregnant this is for her sake because the minute she gets pregnant she cannot be sold and she cannot be inherited and she cannot be given as a gift her pregnancy sets her free so she is now known as the mother of a child she cannot be sold or dealt with financially she's not free she still stays with her master and master owns her and he has to be kind for her but he cannot sell her and if he dies immediately she becomes free and no one can deal with her and Allah Knows Best"
