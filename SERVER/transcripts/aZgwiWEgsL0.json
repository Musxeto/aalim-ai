  "transcript": "helicato my question is in regards to the Seal of the Prophet Muhammad sallam with the ring um I um I was told that this ring I saw it online and uh it's being sold online but I heard somewhere where it should not be replicated uh would you be able to elaborate elaborate on this thank you if I understand your question we know that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was instructed by his companions when he wanted to dispatch messages to the kings of different nations around him calling them to Islam and this is what all rulers should do invite people like the prophet saws invited people to Islam his companions told him that such Kings and rulers would not accept a letter that is not sealed so we know that these letters are wrapped and placed in an envelope or in a role they had to seal it with wax or something that would ensure it is not broken or read by someone else to avoid tampering so it's a sort of sort of uh authenticating it so the prophet took a ring which is his seal that had the engravement of Muhammad rasool Allah in some websites reverse it by putting Allah rasool Muhammad because they say that we have to bring Allah's names on top the most authentic is that it was written in that order Muhammad rasulullah as it stated so whenever he wrote a letter meaning his companions wrote a letter through his dictation he would seal it with that ring replicating it is no problem it's replicated everywhere there's no um it's not sacred that one should not mimic it or duplicate it there's no problem in that none whatsoever"
