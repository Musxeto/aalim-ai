  "title": "Can I exchange old gold with new gold (jewelry) & pay making charges in cash? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I know that while exchanging gold it must be done in the same sitting and it must be of equal quantity and quality my question is that uh if I am exchanging an old jewelry to buy a new jewelry uh the new jewelry um requires uh making charges so is it permissible for me to exchange the old jewelry and buy the new jewelry of the same quantity and pay the making charge in cash no this is not permissible and you have to divide this into two separate transactions so first of all you have to give the old jewelry or the old gold cash it in now this transaction is over now if you want you can bargain and buy the new gold whether the same quantity less or more and add to that if you wish the amount of what they call or the labor charges for it some Scholars say if this is 100 grams old gold this is 100 grams new gold and it's the same 20 karat 20 karat identical so actually I'm exchanging them without any problem at the same setting but I'm adding $100 for the labor charges of the new gold some say this is okay but again to be safe no you have to have two separate transactions and it wouldn't take you one minute if you want but Shan doesn't want you to do this and it's easier for him to convince you that it's fine so that he would drag your feet into dealing in riba in the future"
