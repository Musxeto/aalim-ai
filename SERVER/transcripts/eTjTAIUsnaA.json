  "transcript": "few cases what's the wisdom behind putting execution capital punishment as a punishment for killing others for uh spreading corruption in the world and the earth for an adulterer caught red handed for someone who does the act of homosexuality this is not my call this is the law of allah and allah azzawajal the creator of the heavens and the earth is not obliged to come and justify everything to us and this is why we pray fajr 2 raka's maghrib and the rest of the prayers are 4 and nobody dare to say why 2 not 3 why 3 not 4. this is how allah legislated it so as a muslim if you do not surrender your will to allah and say we hear and obey if you do not submit your will to allah accept unconditionally whatever allah tells you you're not a muslim as easy as that so whether you understand or not this is not an issue do you believe in the quran to be the final revelation in scripture yes or no do you believe that there is only one god where they are being worshipped in this universe and he is the creator and his name is allah yes or no do you believe that the prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah yes or no if you manage to say yes yes yes then you have no problem if you have doubts or you say no to one of these questions you're a kafir"
