  "transcript": "foreign exactly I have to make up because I'm not sure when exactly I reach the age of pure beauty and whether I had intended to fast or not and I don't know which tasks were invalid due to me swallowing water and I don't know whether that was intentional or not I am also a past OCD patient and so this leaves me with a lot of a huge range of fasts that I may or may not have to make up what should I do well I cannot help you in this regard this is an issue between you and Allah azzawajal which means that you have to do your level best to reach what is approximately the correct number if I tell you are there a thousand days he said no that's too a lot too much so I say a day 10 days no this is too little what about 500 Days still a lot 20 days too little 100 days this is how you bargain with yourself until you reach a certain number of days where you think that yeah this is probably it give a five or ten days extra just to be safe and fast every Monday and Thursday or the white days or whenever it's possible for you until you finish it with the grace of Allah"
