  "transcript": "what advice would you give a person who is only religious for the Dunya that is they only do good deeds to be rewarded in the dun not the Hereafter is such a person considered to be worshiping Dunya actually I do not believe that there are such people who would do this for the sake of the D now it might be mixed intention and sometimes this is bad sometimes it is not for example if a person fasts not for the sake of Allah only but to lose weight the doctor says you have to lose 5 kilog so he starts to fast every uh uh three days of the month or every Monday and Thursday not for the sake of following the but rather to go on a diet this is bad now this would be not accepted from him because his intention is not for Allah but if a person for example connects to his next ofkin he visits his uncles he calls his aunt he checks on his brother he uh helps his cousin and when you ask him why are you doing this he said because Allah promised us by uh through the prophet that whoever does this Allah would prolong his life and increase in his provision and I'd like my provision to be increased there's nothing wrong in that because this is one of the blessings that the prophet told us that Allah will give us so if we do this this is one of the rewards that we will get in D so it appears to me that though it seems wrong but nobody would worship Allah for the sake of d those who worship Allah know that Allah has the dun and owns the dya and to have a good life they worship Allah so that they would have a good life not only in the Dunya but also in the Hereafter and Allah Knows Best"
