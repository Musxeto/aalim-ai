  "title": "Why does Allah praise Himself in Quran & tell even us to praise Him even though He has no need of it",
  "transcript": "shik I really want to ignore such questions because I know we are no one to question Allah's action but uh this is something that is going through my mind in the recent past sh my question is why does Allah praise himself so many times in the Quran and instruct his creation to praise him even though he has no need of them because he is the only worthy of being praised AEL praising Allah Asel is done by every single creation of his willingly and unwillingly only the humans and the Gin choose to do so or not to do so Allah doesn't need them Allah doesn't need you Allah doesn't subhah wa ta'ala depend on anything in this universe he is independent and he's the only one who is worthy of being praised glorified and complimented and he loves to be praised because this is part of his lordship subhanahu wa ta'ala The Giver of life and death the provider of our sustenance the sustainer of our Affairs the most perseverance aael the all hearing the old seeing so it's part of Allah asael that he is the magnet of worship and the only one worthy of being worshiped and praised and he loves to be praised because this is Allah he's the only one worthy of that so what is strange in that it is strange when I as a human being like people to praise me and demand this from them who am I nothing I'm a human being I'm full of flaws and shortcomings so even if you praise me there are always things to be criticized about me because I'm not perfect Allah is unlike anything he is the perfect being subhanahu wa'ta'ala so he is the only one worthy of being praised and entertain such thoughts and doubts unfortunately fim is an indication of lack of Iman because sometimes we do get random intrusive thoughts a true Muslim blocks them does not entertain them as when you get random filthy thoughts about your in-laws or about your siblings or about your mother what do you do do you go to a psychiatrist and and talk to him or to a therapist or you simply shut it down and block it because it's unacceptable Allah has the highest example if you knew Allah you would never ever entertain such thoughts or allow your tongue to move to ask about it may Allah Asel guide us to the straight path"
