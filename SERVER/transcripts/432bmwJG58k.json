  "title": "Daughter takes two hours to pray, what to do? - Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the uk she says that her daughter is 14 years of age and she takes two hours to pray this is not at all normal and your daughter requires counseling as i said this counseling can be with a muslim counselor and it can be with a psychiatrist who has to be a muslim shaytan looks and weighs whether you are extreme enthusiastic keen on getting closer to allah or you're lenient and loose and negligent and he banks on how you feel so if he saw that your daughter was lenient negligent and very loose he would have had her leave salat for a couple or three uh fart maybe delay all five salats at the end of the day maybe skip a day or two negligent with a hijab negligent with halal and haram food etc but when he sees that she's keen enthusiastic and afraid of hellfire and she's afraid of allah he puts pressure on her adds to her ocd so that she extends her prayer her cleanliness into two hours three hours until it's unbearable she cannot tolerate this this is when she snaps and says the hell with it i'm not praying anymore so this is how shaytaan works you have to know how he strategizes things and he knows whether you are enthusiastic or not and he banks on that and people open their opened the door for him to mess with their mind to mess up with their minds it's their fault so she needs definitely counseling or to see a muslim psychiatrist who would talk to her because there's no injection there are no pills to be taken no antidepressants or this would make her crazy or would make her yanny not a very a positive thing for her but she needs counseling she needs to open up to speak to someone who knows the religion and he can tell her okay this is where shaytan is managing to make a fool out of you is this the quran is this a sunnah is this the way of the prophet doing it salat should be a relief not a burden you're making it a burden and soon enough you will snap may allah protect her so you have to find a way"
