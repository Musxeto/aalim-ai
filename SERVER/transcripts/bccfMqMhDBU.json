  "transcript": "ald [Music] [Music] [Applause] what for [Applause] [Music] [Music] the enmity of may Allah curse him the enmity of Satan to the sons of Adam to the humans goes way back in time it is he who whispered to Adam it is he who made Adam peace be upon Him disobey Allah and eat from The Forbidden tree it is he who made our parents descend to Earth and suffer so may Allah has his curse upon the outcast Satan El has taken a pledge to Allah that he will provoke lure tempt and seduce the humans so that they stay away from worshiping Allah so that they would stay away from Allah's mercy so that they would accompany him in hell this is a pledge he took upon himself however Allah the most merciful the most forgiven has taken a pledge that whoever repents and seek his forgiveness that Allah would forgive him no matter how grave and serious and horrendous that sin is even the if he comes to Allah in Repentance Allah would forgive him and this shows you the enmity that we have with Shan with to the extent that the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam said whenever the son of Adam prostrates makes suud Shan takes a corner and starts to cry he says woe to me I was ordered to prostrate and I did not and I will end up in hell and he was ordered to prostrate and he complied and he will end up in Paradise he cries when we worship Allah the nature of el is that he spreads the seeds of Discord among the humans in general and among the Muslims in particular this is his nature this is his job description and that is why if you look back in history you will find that among the very first sins in the human race was when he provoked a brother against his brother ending up in killing him ending up in making the first murder in the history of humanity it is he who even spread the seeds of Discord among the siblings and if you look at the sons of prophet of a prophet of a prophet y peace be upon him was a prophet and he's the son of is Isaac who is the son of ibraim three generations of prophets yet the fourth generation the siblings of YF peace be upon him because of Shan's Whispering they ended up throwing him in a well leaving him for dead and that is why Allah has warned us a lot in the Quran and the prophet has warned us a lot s wasam in the Sunnah against the weapons and the equipment of shaan anything that leads to problems among the Muslims the prophet has cut the way in front of him even when it comes to normal and usual things even if I lend you money Allah tells us in the Quran that you have to write it down or to have witnesses proving that so that Shan would not come in the future and make you reject the fact that you have taken money or say that you did not take money at all Allah has blocked the means of Shan and anything that raises hatred and enmity among the Muslims Allah had made that forbidden Allah says Shan wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicant and gambling so intoxicant that waste your mind would cause you to have enmity and hatred with your brother gambling I pay one rupee hoping to get a thousand maybe I will lose and maybe I win if I win my brother would hate me if I lose I would hate my brother Allah makes this Haram and a major sin the prophet has told us in an authentic Hadith that Shan erects his throne on water and dispatches his troops all over the Earth to lure people and to make them fall into sin some of them when they come back to report one of them says I did so and so and Shan tells him this is nothing he will repent and you have done nothing another one tells him I did so and so and he said also this sin is not big enough until someone comes and tells him that I continued to whisper in the hearts of the spouses until I separated a man from his wife and he said you are the man you are the closest to me and he makes him sit next to him because the greatest one among his troops is the greatest in FNA and the greatest in spreading the seeds of Discord and this person might be a father-in-law might be a brother might be a mother whoever causes a man to separate from his wife he is committing one of the most major sins without knowing it [Music] and the prophet has told us thatan has many different ways of seducing and making people fall into sin not necessarily the biggest and major sins he's happy if you do little sins because little sins leads to bigger sins the prophet tells us thean has despaired of being worshiped in the Arabian Peninsula Shan knows that he would not be worshiped the Arabian Peninsula would be full of there would not be generally speaking there might be some patches here or there but the majority of the Arabian Peninsula is based and built on with the grace of Allah so he has lost hope hope that the Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula would worship him or worship the idols but he will s the seeds of Discord among them the thing that he is not despaired of that he would make them different they would he would make them hate one another and he would hold uh they would hold grudges against one another and this and from it we understand that the enmity of our enemy is apparent and clear all what he wants is to spread hatred and enmity among the Muslims and that is why Allah tells us in the Quran that he is an enemy so you who believe take him as an enemy do we have enmity to Shan or do we listen to his advices do we have enmity to Shan or we follow what he tells us to say if you try to analyze what comes out of your mouth during the day and the night and you cross check that with what pleases Allah and what pleases shaan unfortunately you would find that a lot of what comes of your mouth pleases Shan more than what it pleases Allah so many times through irresponsible words that come out of our mouths we build hatred and grudges we separate friends we separate spouses we become The Advocates and the assistance of Shan doing what he's telling us to do and that is why Allah told us to be extremely careful in what we say in what comes out of our mouths Allah subhanahu waala says and say to my slaves that they should only say the those words that are the best it is an order that you only say what is the best justification Allah says Shan verily SS disagreements among them surely Shan is to man a play enemy so many times we have our best friends for years and years of friendship and companionship and we are like brothers and all all of a sudden one particular day I say something to my brother with a very pure intention Shan makes that what I had said a big issue and our friendship is no longer existing why because I said the wrong thing even if my intention was good this is what Shan was waiting for for 10 years to break our friendship so we have to do as what Allah told us to to say what is best so that Shan would not utilize that to his own good I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness so ask Allah for forgiveness he is the most forgiving and the most merciful and I would like to request that you try to narrow the gaps so that if your brothers are standing outside they could come and the brothers should not jump the shoulders so if they see a gap it's okay to come at the back inah we will not take more than another 10 minutes to 15 minutes in dear brothers and sisters in Islam we have to to do whatever we can to prevent strengthening Shan we are the one who feed Shan we are the one who make shaan strong with our enmity towards our brothers and sisters we have to try to block all means of Shan to S the seeds of of Discord among us as Muslims and we have to try our level best to not oppose one another and to work in coherence and cooperation now this does not mean that we must not differ because this is human nature we must differ with one another we all have different opinions to one another however differing with our Muslim Brothers is different types and kinds there are differences that are acceptable and there are differences that are not acceptable at all and that is why for an example when the third may Allah be pleased with him and he was the when he went for Haj and had a wife in meca he thought that because I am residing inah in the season during I should pray for instead of shortening and we know that theah is during the days of Min and during the days of and the night of you should shorten the prayers so he used to continue and complete for instead of shorting it into [Music] two the servant of the prophet and the one who usually carries his shoes or sandals and the W of the prophet he took more than 70 suras directly from the mouth of the prophet and he was one of the knowledgeable companion of the prophet he opposed and told him that this is not the Sunnah and you should not do this yet when the Salah was due andman was leaving the prayer Abdullah prayed behind him so his companions came to him and said you differ with him in opinion yet you follow him he said yes two words that's it he said opposing and differing among the Muslims is evil so yes we need differ in opinion you may say that it is a must to wear something on your head when you pray I say no it's not a must we differ but does this mean that we become enemies if we do not follow the same thought or idea compare what abdah did when he prayed behind though he differs with him with those who do not give Salam to the other because he puts his hand on his chest rather than putting it below his neighbor compare this with those who stopped talking to their brothers for years because of a difference of opinion that is not a major thing in Islam and if you look at the Sunnah of our beloved Prophet Sall alai wasallam you will find the remedy for all illnesses you will find the answer for all questions if you look into his Sunnah but the problem is that the Muslims don't look at hisn they're negligent they are ignorant and this is why we tend tend to hold on to opinions and be St on them rather than looking into his his into his to learn what to do and what not to do how did the prophet deal with people who differed with what he had taught a nomad an Arab while the prophet is in the Masjid comes and starts to urinate in the Masjid what would you do now if someone comes and starts to urinate in the M you will beat him and you will give him and you will maybe chop him into small pieces what did the prophet do when the companions wanted to stand up for him he said sit down sit down let him finish and after he finished he told them to put a bucket of water on his urine to purify the area and he called the man and he told him in a very beautiful way my brother these masjids are not made for these filth they are made for praying reciting the Quran and remembering Allah full stop that is it look how the prophet not only dealt with those ignorant how he dealt with the cir how did the prophet deal with the Jews sallu Al wasallam who were blunt enemies to Islam he used to visit the ill as in the Hadith you all know when he visited the young Jew and he called him to Islam when he was sick and he accepted Islam after the approval of his father he accepted their invitation for lunch and dinner to the extent that a Jew woman invited him to a sheep which she filled with poison and the prophet attended did not ask is the money Hal or for R did not ask is it slaughtered islamically or he attended because it's the food from the people of the book not like what we do um some Muslims goes into a house of a Muslim and say is the is the meat you're giving me or he's a Muslim do you see him him coming out of a church or from a synagogue or from a temple you should eat without asking he's your brother this is how the prophet dealt with the Jews to the extent that when a funeral came in front of him over dead Jew he stood up and this was in the beginning of Islam it was recommended that when a funeral comes you stand up out of respect so the people said oh prophet of Allah it's a Jew he said isn't it a soul but then this was abrogated and standing up for for any funeral whether a Muslim or a non-muslim passing in front of you does not require you to stand up uh alhamdulillah the companions used to differ among themselves but they had never ever fought one another in the sense that you differ with me in opinion I'm going to fight with you the prophet once told them after the battle of the trench of he says none of you should pray except in so all the companions rushed but in the middle of the way the sun was almost going to set so those companions differed half of them said we have to stop and pray before it time runs out the others said no the prophet said do not pray except in we're not going to pray did did they fight one another no each one respected the opinion of the other to the extent that when they reached and they spoke to the Prophet The Prophet did not correct any one of them he did not say to those who prayed you did well he did not say to those who did not pray until after you did well because this is a difference of opinion that is respected there are a lot of examples but for example Allah in his soul unus one of one of the scholars of the time he said I have never seen anyone wiser than the sh we debated one day and it was a he a heated debate and we disagreed and we Departed the following day the shaf saw me he took my hand and he said yunas isn't it possible that we differ in opinion yet still be brothers he said I've never seen anyone wiser than the sh one of the great Scholars of Lebanon of he met Abdullah muak who was a student of his and you all know Abdullah muak abdah muak said that when the saw me he told me who is this man the innovator who came in kufa he did not meet him but he heard about him and who was that man was Abu hanifah may Allah have mercy on his soul so is asking who is this Abu hanifah the innovator Abdullah did not say anything he went back to his home for three days reading each and every book of Abu hanifah and noting down the beautiful topics that shows how smart and how committed to the Quran and Sunnah and how knowledgeable this IM is and then he took the book that he noted down these beautiful points and he said I met after 3 days and I gave him the book he said after he gave and offered the prayer and he started reading it until and then he offered thean and prayed he was the IM of the Masid and continued to read it the whole night in the F time he said by Allah this who wrote this is one of the noblest and one of the most knowledgeable people in Islam who is this and he told them this is Abu the one who said who is that innovator and he met Abu hanifah after that in mecah and he sat talking and debating with him until F time and then he went to abdah muak and said by Allah he is one of the wisest people have ever met keep studying under him and be next to him they differ but once they see the truth they go back and they er eradicate any differences between them difference will remain among the Muslims no way that you say we should unite and have no differences this is impossible this is the Sunnah of Allah that you and I must differ with one another because our understandings our comprehension of things differ they cannot be the same and that is why Allah says in the Quran but they will not sees to disagree except him on whom your lord has bestowed his mercy so disagreement is always there what is not permissible while disagreeing while disagreeing is that we hate one another and that is why in the beautiful Hadith that needs a whole separate lecture about it the prophet says which translates to do not hate and hold grudges against one another do not envy one another do not give your back to your brother when you see him because you see him coming you don't want to talk to him so you pretend that you did not see him the prophet tells you do not do this because this is one of the means of Shan to SW the seeds of Discord and and that is why each and everyone Among Us Muslims must cut the way block the means of el to say what is the best and to do his best to prevent fights and disagreement as much as possible and to unite the people to the best of their ability and by this we would fulfill with the grace of Allah the instructions and of subh and of our Prophet may Allah benefit me and you with the Quran and with the beautiful Sunnah of the Prophet I'm going to supplicate in Arabic because supplicating in English and this is something you should know and this is a question that I'm often asked what is the ruling on supplicating in our own native language in Salat or elsewhere the scholars the majority say that this is not permissible you should supplicate in Salah in Arabic the most authentic opinion is if you do not know how to supplicate in Arabic it is permissible for you to supplicate in your native language for example if I want to say oh Allah forgive me I say or you know this so you have to say it in Arabic but if you want to say oh Allah pay off my debt I have debts and I want you to pay off of my Debs and I don't know the words in Arabic then you may say it in your own native language likewise if you have a sick child or if you have a disobedient wife or as far as I know if you have a disobedient husband as well you may ask Allah in your own native language in Sal that Allah would guide them back so I will supplicate in Arabic inshallah all the supplications is for forgiveness and don't worry I will not add anything that might be harmful to you Allah oh Allah cure all our diseased people and have mercy upon those who have died from our relatives"
