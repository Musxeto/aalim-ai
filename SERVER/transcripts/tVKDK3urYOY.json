  "transcript": "a sh can you explain the Hadith which which says cursing a Muslim is wicked and killing him is kufur so does this include all small fights between Muslims moreover does this mean verbal fight or physical fights the Hadith States swearing and saying vulgar words when fighting this is sinful this is f and fighting a Muslim whether you kill him or not just the intention of fighting him and harming him this is K which is minor disbelief not the major disbelief that would take a person out of the fold of Islam this is the of backed up by the Quran if two factions of the Believers were to fight against one another then you have to try to arbitrate between them Allah described them as Believers factions of the Believers though they were fighting and Waging War against one another this did not take them out of the fold of Islam so this is how we understand the Hadith and the rest of of the verses of the Quran by combining them and trying to reconcile so yes when I fight with a brother when I have a dispute and he said oh you're stupid no you're dumb you're this you're this exchange of verbal abuse swearing and cursing and saying bad words this is F this is sinful and shameful act so I hope this answers your question"
