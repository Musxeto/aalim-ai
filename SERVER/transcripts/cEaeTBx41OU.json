  "title": "Shaking hands with Women - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is I'm having problems with shaking hands with women what to do it is easy for me in a Muslim country to say avoid women but someone who's in a non-muslim country someone who's a minority this might be a little bit difficult so there are ways of avoiding this one of them is keep your distance when does someone comes to you with a stretched hand for shaking when you are close when there's a proximity that is so close in near the moment you step three steps back putting your hands on your chest and just greeting them by hi good morning and you show that you don't want the gap to be narrowed no one will shake hands with you will they be offended who gives who cares who cares I don't care if they get offended or not I care whether Allah would throw me and help because of that or not the Prophet says Alyce Islam it is better or it is best for a person to be stabbed in his head with a needle made of iron rather than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him so always keep this in mind if you feel embarrassed if you feel shy not to shake hands remember what's what awaits you on the day of judgment inhale and the more you try to not get involved in mixed gatherings or meetings the better you will find it insha'Allah and easier for you to avoid such situations"
