  "transcript": "so my question is uh there's a woman who wants to travel to um from home country and because she wants to see her father who's gonna pass away soon probably because he's getting old but the problem is that she see the thing is the trip like for her to travel she has to go without a man for some of it like for example she's gonna go from point A to B with a hump but then from point B to C it's gonna be without him but then from point C to D it'll be with him so but the thing is is this allowed her to do even though the trip she's not gonna be like with the Mohamed and also share one thing as well like this woman if she does not go like then it might be feared for her that she might have some mental like uh problems after if her if she didn't see her dad because even right now she's going to a mental problems so like it's not working out too often but like it is fear that she might like be affected mentally but it's not like crazy in the sense that she's gonna like go like imagine on or something or like she's gonna be terribly like sick or something but like she's probably gonna be much worse than she is now so like what's the ruling on her traveling as for the first part of your question and I'm noticing that a lot of the questioners are asking multiple questions in one question and bending the rules a little bit thinking that I'm old I'm not gonna Notice come on guys I've been teaching for too long I'm I'm I know the tricks of the students so kindly ask only one specific question and then go back to the end of the line and try to join again as for the first question what do you want me to say the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a mahram a man stood up and said o prophet of Allah my name was drawn in an expedition for Jihad and the same time my wife went for Hajj the prophet said Allah go and catch up with your wife meaning leave Jihad leave everything it is not permissible for her to go on her own go and catch up with your wife I have this Hadith and it's an authentic Hadith and the vast majority of Scholars of all schools of thought confirmed that it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a maharam how could I justify this woman to travel from point B to point C without a mahram when the prophet himself prohibited it so one would ask okay is this general or are there expectations exceptions the exceptions are dependent on the necessity a woman in a cafe country all alone fearing Fitness fearing being attacked fearing many factors and there is not a single person able to accompany her to safety or to her Homeland or to make Hijra yeah this is an exception and a necessity but for this woman she has maharam to take it from point A to B they're lazy to take her another uh extra mile from B to C with some pressure exerted if they were to know that she's mentally affected by that she will fall into depression blah blah blah they would in this case how can we say that it's a necessity and what is she going to do if today Allah chooses and her father dies Paula sees that end of story we're all going to die so we can't bend the rules and Taylor make them to people according to their claims otherwise everyone is going to say oh if I don't do this Haram I think I'm going to be depressed I'm going to fall into anxiety attacks I get panic attacks I may fail in my test I may do this so you want us to put Islam rulings at the end of the priority list and to compromise all of these in exchange for worldly matters this is not something we can do in Allah knows best we"
