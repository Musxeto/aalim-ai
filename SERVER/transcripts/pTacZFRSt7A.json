  "title": "Are muslims allowed to serve in the army where it is compulsory in some countries? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in some countries uh it's compulsory for every male citizen to serve at least two years of conscription i'm guessing by conscription meaning in the army so failure to do so will result in jail time so are they muslims allowed to partake in it is there any issues with regards to um being in ever being conscripted um if if this involves only training and serving in the country which is the case in most places i see that this is permissible providing one does not do any haram things but if it means that you will fight with the army abroad no this is totally prohibited you cannot fight with the kafir army and muhammad ali may allah the great fighter the great boxer though boxing is haram but this is how he is described he refused to go to fight in vietnam and he was jailed for that so he did the right thing by not fighting uh with the kafir army so serving in the army uh being recruited for a couple of years as a duty for citizens this is something you cannot escape unfortunately therefore this miscible but you have to draw the line it's not the army that prevails it's your islam so if they tell you to do something haram if they tell you to take snakes or to free mix or to go into skinny dipping with the opposite gender and you say woo no habibi this is not a permissible you're a muslim you you must not accept to go to go to such uh venues you"
