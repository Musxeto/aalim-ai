  "transcript": "from Amano lauhala me and he says I have one question our colored contact lenses allowed for us to use are we allowed to use country colored contact lenses it's a he or a she I the name says Amano law well I presume that it's a she and yes it is permissible for women to wear colored contact lenses as it's a form of beautification now the problem is if men want to do this then this is a problem because it would be imitating women because only women in 99.9% wear these contact lenses to change the color of their eyes to go with the dresses or with the hair whatever so it is permissible for women to wear contact lenses colored contact lenses providing that no strangers would look at them so if a woman puts on these contact lenses and she goes out and strange men look at her and they enjoy the new look she is having this is haram because she is beautifying herself to other than her husband or to other than women and beautifying oneself to men is is forbidden"
