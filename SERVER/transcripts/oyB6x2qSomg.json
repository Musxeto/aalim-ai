  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah we discussed in the previous lesson the mandatory and obligatory part of Wu or Evolution there are recommended acts for wo or Evolution if you skip them you're fine but if you do them your reward is greater and higher at the sight of Allah number one we spoke about that is using the Sak had I not feared to burden my um I would have ordered them to use the Sak whenever they performed W so this is a highly recommended Sunnah number two to say or to mention the name of Allah Oh I thought that was mandatory no it's not mandatory if someone performs without saying bah his will is valid but it is highly recommended to sayah because the prophet said there is no woodo between brackets perfect for those who do not mention the name of Allah meaning saying number three one of the of w which a lot of us used to think that it is mandatory but it's not it is merely a Sunnah and that is to wash your hands in the beginning three times so this is a recommended Sunnah but if I simply just go turn the tap on and take water and rinse my mouth and nose and wash my face directly without washing my hands my w is perfect and uh uh valid number four he here it says to being thorough in taking water up onto or into your nose so inhaling or pulling the water up your nostrils thoroughly this is a recommended Sunnah if I just take the water to the tip of my nose and blow it this does the job however the Sunnah is to cleanse the inside of your nose to the best of your ability no and also included in this same uh um Sunnah doing the same for your mouth when you Ren your mouth uh number five to run your fingers through a your thick beard if you have a beard and this is done in accordance to the Hadith of anas may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet Sall wasallam whenever he performed wo he used to take a handful of water and insert it from underneath his chin and let his fingers go through his beard now bear in mind that this action would not include the whole beard so the whole beard would not be wet because of this it's more of a symbolic gesture trying to get the water inside but it's not mandatory otherwise we would have ordered to soak our beards in water to ensure that it's all wet it's simply a symbolic gesture and one of the recommended Sunnah to do to if you have a thick beard you just do this inside your beard and that would suffice that inshallah number six taking new water water to wiping your head what do you mean see I washed my forearms my hands are wet so if I do this it should suffice but it is a recommended Sunnah to take some new water and wipe over your head because of the Hadith of Abdullah and this is the most famous Hadith in addition to the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with them all or both where they describe how the prophet performed so in theith of Abdullah he says and he wiped his head with new water other than that remained in his hands after washing the forearms number six or number seven it is to rub in between the fingers and toes so when I'm washing my arms forearms the sunna is to do this to ensure that the water goes inside and that I've washed it and the same goes for my toes and this is a Sunnah because the prophet said whenever you perform Abol make sure that you insert your fingers between uh your uh fingers and your toes now why would I do such a thing because this is a Sunnah however this Sunnah becomes mandatory if water would not reach between your fingers and toes except when you insert and rub in between the fingers and the toes deliberately how is that some of us may have his toes sticking together like this so if you insert your foot in the river and take them out they're washed but not between the toes here it becomes mandatory to insert your fingers in between to ensure that the water reaches in between number eight to begin or to start with the right before the left oh this is a Sunnah yes so this means after washing my face if I start washing my left arm and then went to my right arm the W is valid because it's the same sequence face arms head feet likewise in the face if instead of starting with washing or rining my mouth rensing my nose then washing my face I decided the opposite I decided to wash my face then Ren my nose and then make this is valid but it is not in accordance to the Sunnah the Sunnah is to begin with this same fashion and to begin with the right hand then the left hand the right foot then the left foot because this is what Hadith mother states that the prophet Alam used to like to begin with the right hand in wearing his shoes in calming his hair and in all his forms of purification number nine to wash the face the arms and the feet Thrice so the minimum requirement is only once but to do it three times is the max and this is the recommend recommended form of doing it yes it is authentic that some reports state that the prophet washed his limbs once other reports that he sometimes washed his limbs twice and the majority of the reports that he used to wash his limbs three times so this is the recommended time of washing them of course the head is wiped only once but the rest are washed three times or two times or minimum once number 10 part of the eates and the sunah of wo is to do and to do after woodo is to say a number of supplications that the prophet used to say um among them is to say and the prophet gave us the Glad Tiding that whoever performs W and he does it well meaning the woodoo is done perfectly in accordance to the Sunnah and says this uh um Dua or after his W the proph Prophet says the eight Gates of paradise will be opened for him to enter through whichever of them he wishes Subhan Allah this was reported by Imam Muslim in theah saying this simple Dua would Grant you this pleasure and this favor and blessing of Allah of entering any of these eight Gates of J and so many of us are negligent of this VI they just perform business as usual and they pray without doing this great Dua [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
