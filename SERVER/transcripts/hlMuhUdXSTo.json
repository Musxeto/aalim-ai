  "transcript": "my question today is uh uh it was related to yesterday i was denied asking the second question so it will be what about uh people who have committed the sins in their past it could be major scenes like drinking alcohol gambling or whatever major scenes and they like they were they were repenting for some specific scenes but some since they forgot like for people who have like alzheimer's dementia in their you know thirties or somewhere like that so they forget those things but they are fearful that allah will tell me like all very they are in gender they are fearful allah government one of the main reasons for people having ocd and excessive fear that destroys their life is their lack of knowledge lack of knowledge of allah azzawajal they don't know know who allah is lack of knowledge of the quran of the authentic sunnah of the rulings of islam this lack of knowledge leads a lot of the people to extremism to coming up with their own opinions not only that basing on their opinions wrong things and cascading it all over their lives which leads in the end to taking them astray when you listen to such a question you feel that these people don't know allah i'm not talking about you abdul aziz don't get me wrong i want you to keep on asking questions we need customers huh what i'm referring to is that a lot of the people think of allah azzawajal as someone who is not merciful who is not compassionate who is not forgiving and they burden themselves when allah exempt exempted them from such a burden how allah azzawajal does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear so if you forgot allah says i forgive you if you made an error allah says i forgive you what more do you want yes sheikh but i may have made sins in the past major or minor i don't remember them but i'm so afraid that allah would put me in hell do you have the general feeling of remorse in your heart yes sir do you fear allah definitely sheikh then you should have no worries because allah is most forgiving most merciful he told us if you repent to him he accept your repentance did you repent yes sir but i don't remember who said that you have to remember and write down every single detail about your visit to the pub and drinking how many bottles of la of laga and and and so on nobody said this you've repented you felt remorse you're asking allah forgiveness that's more than enough so do not burden yourself beyond what it can bear"
