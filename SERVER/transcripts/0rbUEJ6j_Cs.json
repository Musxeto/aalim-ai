  "title": "Characteristics to look for in choosing a (Female) Spouse - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "in Islam we have a lot of evidences covering this and I will not go into it because it requires a lot of time I'll just give you bullet points and only signals and indicators to it initially you know it I have done the last weekend a course on a quest for love that dealt with how to choose your spouse and the required characteristics in them so first of all as a man you requested and instructed to choose a woman who has good characteristics such as she has to be pious righteous god-fearing religious and this is the most important characteristic in your future wife whether she is beautiful wealthy or coming from a good family this is beside the point the most important thing is that she is practicing and by practicing we don't mean that she's wearing the niqab and the gloves a lot of the Muslims think that this is to practice Islam in so many who wear the niqab and wear the gloves do not pray on time do not observe they're fast they are bad in character so you have to look at holistic and look at it in a holistic way as to whom is practicing and who is not she has to have her modesty and chastity because the Prophet told us are a solid asylum that among the women of hell are those who do not so if you marry someone and she shows her flesh exposes herself or she is indecent then this would not make a good family she has to be satisfied with whatever Allah gives her and the most most of the men here are saying well we got that wrong for sure because unfortunately a lot of the women have this in them they lack this feature of satisfaction and contentment and this is why in the authentic hadith when Ibrahim peace be upon him came to visit his son Ismael please be upon him and he was married and he did not see him since he was like 14 15 years old he did not find him and he found his wife so he asked her how his life and she said life is horrible food is scarce we don't have water my husband is out all the time so he told her when your husband comes gives him give him my regards and tell him your father says change your doorstep so what is Mariel came and she told him and he told her that this was my father and he's telling me to divorce you go to your family the worst wife one can have is the one who's unappreciative never satisfied never content and then when he married again and Ibrahim visited him years later the second wife did not complain on the contrary complimented everything she had and Ibrahim said give him my regards and tell him tell him to preserve and to keep his doorsteps and when he came back his Merrill and she told him he told her this was my father it is extremely important for a Muslim family to have the content not only for women but also from men but this is not our topic we're addressing the characteristics of the potential missus among the characteristics before choosing a wife the Prophet tells us that the women of Jena are those who are dude what dude meaning that she's caring and loving Jew so you have to choose someone who's caring and loving and I'm not telling you to go online chat with her and maybe go Skype so that you know her before marriage this is Halle so how would I know if she's caring and loving from her family from her friends they tell your mother they tell your sister that she is kind she is a nice she does not flare out and she does not become angry she doesn't have any rage attacks Michele okay this is nice but to marry someone and end up in fights every single morning and evening this is not advisable she has to be what dude caring and loving well dude she has to be fertile able to produce children because this is the essence of getting married sure I can't go on skype okay how would I know this she's first time we're not married yet well scholars saying look into her family so if of course her mother is fertile look at her sisters her aunt her cousins if they masha'Allah are a productive family this means that most likely she would be and do not get married to someone who does not as the first wife not it's not forbidden but it is not recommended thirdly the Prophet Elias Auto Sam says that among the characteristics is that she is obedient among the blessings of Allah upon an individual is that he's blessed with a woman who would obey Him if he orders her and who would please him if he looks at her so this is another characteristic she has to be obedient and the happiest husbands are those with obedient wives and the brothers are shaking their heads in disapproval saying we don't have this yet what are you talking about I'm talking about hurry from Jenna let's talk about humans now there are there are sisters come on don't be ungrateful you have jewels in your houses I know that and if I don't say this I would be beaten by the the sisters after I finish the talk no you have you do you do have this in your houses but you are unappreciative so the Prophet tells us that among the best women are those whom you look at them they please you and this doesn't mean that she has to be shockingly beautiful because this is not the case beauty is not an essential thing in marriage if you marry a beautiful wife a couple of days maybe a couple of weeks and then you'll get over it you'll see the real character but a nice and obedient and and righteous wife would always be pleasant to look at so when you go home you won't find your wife with her hair untidy doing the afro maybe and with her teeth yellow with food in it and with smells of onion and garlic coming out of her and with her voice coming from the depth of her throat saying how are you honey this is not the thing you want to have home righteous practicing muslimah and this I know for a fact would always try to look her best when her husband comes this is my comfort zone this is my safe haven that I always go to to relax from whatever is abroad and this is what I said to the brothers in this morning's reminder when we go in the streets we find billboards of models beautiful women smiling if I go into a shop the saleswoman is smiling if I go to the reception of the hotel the receptionist is smiling the co-worker if you are Yanni may Allah help you working with with the opposite sex they're always smiling and and mashallah giggling when once you enter the house alala all these miles are gone down the drain so Panama why is it why is it it should be the other way around so this is what you should try to look for your wife does so to be inshaallah future wife should honor your family pick someone that would honor your family you have one family you have one mother you have one father but you can marry as many wives as you wish so if she does not respect and honor them then try to make the right choice she has to take care of his children and the Prophet complimented sallalaho aleyh Selim the women of beresch being soft-hearted to the children and being caring of their husbands so this is the wife you should look for and you could tell by asking about her there are girls that are so caring and loving for children it's an apparent characteristics in them everybody knows about this and there are who are negligent and don't like kids and don't like children and you don't clean them this is not the right person for you and she has to take care of his house you remember you did hadisha oh not yet not here okay Khadija may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet Allah start with cinnamon what did you bring give her the God glad tiding he said to the Prophet as Salam Khadija is coming with food and drink give her the glad tiding and give her salam from me and tell her that allah azza wajal has made a house made of pearl empty pearl shell for her where there is no noise and there is no tiresome scholars say why is it this for Khadija because she never ever made the Prophet work her salatu salam she was his wife she did the work and not only that she would not make any noise in the house neither her nor the kids so whenever the Prophet went into his house are they cilantro Salam he did not want to leave and that is why Allah awarded her with this big pearl made of of a palace with these things in them so a good woman serves the house she takes care of the house the husband does not look at anything that is bad everything is tidy and nice and finally she you when you marry a woman try your best not to take a jealous one because the Prophet Allah salat WA Salam once was addressed by Anna's may Allah be pleased with him and said o prophet of Allah why don't you marry a woman from Al Unser from Medina he said they are extremely jealous and that's why he refrained from marrying from them and when he married home Salama when he proposed to whom Selim I may Allah be pleased with her home Selim I said o prophet of Allah I have a lot of children and at the same time I am extremely jealous what did the Prophet say is love Sarah as for your children they are mine as for you jealousy I'll supplicate to Allah and Allah will take it away so jealousy extreme jealousy is bad you don't want to marry someone when you are watching pornography god forbids or on the internet or cyber chat or let's go video or whatever she says ok good night I'm going to sleep see you tomorrow no this is not a proper wife you want someone when you do something how long she prevents you when you try to flirt with a co-worker or with neighbor or she stops you the one you do not want is someone when talking on the phone she says we're talking with put it on loudspeaker swear by Allah that you put your hand on your right eye and swear by Allah it's a man what kind of jealousy is is no this is not jealousy therefore these are some of corinne selects six you say it again five times these are some of the characteristics you have to choose in a wife"
