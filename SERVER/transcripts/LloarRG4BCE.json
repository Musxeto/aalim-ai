  "title": "Can a girl who wears the niqab go to a mixed school / university? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from india she said she says what's the ruling on going to a mixed school wearing the nikab the default is that women must be segregated from men and this is the default even if a woman is wearing the niqab and properly dressed and does not mix with men we cannot say that this is the norm because out of 10 women that go or girls that go to mixed environment even with the niqab you will find maybe six or seven falling into the traps of shaytan because being familiar with the school with the boys with the teachers maybe you'll keep your guard up for a month or two but then you let your guard down even if you're wearing the niqab this is human nature and this is how shaytan works and this is why allah said do not follow the footsteps of shaytaan the steps of shaytan he comes in steps gradually so it is best for a muslim woman who fears for her chastity for her iman to stay away from such schools khalil from you"
