  "transcript": "um check uh I wear a woman smoking that's below my uh sorry yeah below my uh you know about my knee level and it's white and I'm wearing a long skirt underneath it so um I want to ask if I if my prayer is valid when I wear this clothing and also I don't wear anything like underneath the skirt but my aura is covered and my mother told that I have to wear something inside it so can I just wear the skirt alone and leave nothing you know like wear nothing under that when you're wearing the skirt are you wearing the Abaya on top of that no this is not recommended the scholars say that in order for you to pray you have to have a jilbap which is an outer garment so if women in Bangladesh India Pakistan the subcontinent where is they would say that our Aura is covered you cannot see any flesh but still you need an outer garment so that it would not expose your bone structure your body curves Etc and would hide these clothes so to to address your question your dress which is above the knee and underneath it is a skirt this is covering your aura you can sit in front of maharams the other women without any problem being above the knee or under the knee that doesn't make any problem doesn't make any difference because you're wearing already a skirt and this skirt covers your thighs your buttocks your legs so you have no problem when it comes to prayer it is highly recommended and some say it is mandatory that you wear an outer garment over all of that and Allah Knows Best"
