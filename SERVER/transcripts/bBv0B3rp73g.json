  "title": "Did the djinns inhabit the Earth before humans?",
  "transcript": "question did the Jin inhabit the Earth before us most likely as the comment those who commented on the Quran uh say that in the interpretation of the verse when Allah told the angels in in Chapter 2 Bak that he is going to um create people to inhab the Earth the the Angels said to Allah the almighty would you create people who would shed blood and spread Chaos on Earth and Allah told them that he knows more than they know so some of the commentators on the Quran said that this is a sign that the Jin inhabited the Earth before the humans and they used to do this uh they used to spread chaos and and Corruption and and on Earth and they used to kill one another and they knew that the humans would do the same and some Scholars say no not necessarily but definitely the Angels knew that by Nature humans would do these things so they were anticipating that they would do such a thing and that is why they uh uh ask Allah why would he do such a thing when he knows that the humans would do uh uh that therefore I I believe that uh we can safely say that the Jin existed before us and whether they inhabited the Earth or elsewhere or not this is something beyond our knowledge most likely they did inhabit the Earth but there is nothing to say that they did not inhabit uh anywhere or any other planet and Allah Knows Best"
