  "title": "If someone of authority & power does bad things, can we discuss it, is it backbiting assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if someone uh some people in your community are with authority and they do bad things and everyone knows them but they only deny that they don't do anything wrong but we know they do wrong can we discuss among ourselves is this considered backbiting it depends if this discussion would lead to changing what is evil and good would replace it then this is fine providing that you have evidence that is backed up by proof that can stand in a court of law most allegations are baseless or can't be proven you have to have proof you saw it's not enough that oh my cousin heard that his friend over there saw this official do so and so and so no this is not valid if it stands in a court of law all of you would be flogged for slandering such a person an individual you have to bring Witnesses you have to see it with your own eyes and it has to be proven that it is Haram or a violation of the laws and the likes but to just simply speak out of thin air accuse people and discuss it there's no benefit or point of that and that would be Haram and Allah Knows Best"
