  "title": "Working for a dawa organization and asking for money",
  "transcript": "I work full-time for a dawa organization and I learn and I earn my income from uh the donation money they get is it better for me to get my own job and not earn from uh this source and help them on a voluntary basis with less hours Instead This depends it is always best to not need anyone especially if you're doing volunt work for Allah not to charge for that unless you are in need for that but here we have to look into the effort giving given so if I know that I can give three or four hours of my time a day for uh charity or for uh a dawa organization without charging them money but I know that because I'm not charging them money and because I'm not devoting my full time and concentration for this job my input would be maybe 10 or 20% while if I work and devote my full time to this job my input would be 100% then definitely who's benefiting most is dawa who's benefiting most is my organization so you have to measure things you have to uh uh evaluate the situation through looking into the input you're giving whether it's best to give one or two hours on voluntary basis or you would give full-time uh and at the same time working uh in this da organization and uh uh charging them for your time and Allah"
