  "title": "Is he kafir if he made mistake in narrating hadith (man or woman who gave dog water) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from Germany he says a friend narrated Hadith from the prophet Allah that a man gave water to a Thirsty Dog and we went and he went to Paradise Allah forgave him and took him to Paradise but also we know that there is a Hadith about Abu hurairah may Allah please with him where he said that it was a prostitute who gave also water to a dog from a well and that Allah forgave her sins is this friend a kafir because narrating Hadith with mistakes in it is kufur what should he do he has deep remorse and he fears that he may left Islam first of all I think he should be careful in the friends he select Abdullah with all due respect because you're definitely not a good friend why the guy did not do any kufur and you making here feel making him feel upset depressed and you're making him feel that he committed kufur because you've stated that making such a mistake in a Hadith is so Yeti tell me show me who said that making a mistake in the Hadith is kuffer no one did he make the mistake intentionally it's not a mistake then it's deliberate thirdly fourthly who's counting I don't know there are two narrations of this Hadith both are sahih and authentic and 100 correct in one narration it was a man who went to the well and brought water in the shoe and held it with his mouth until the dog the Thirsty dog drank from it and Allah thanked The Man by forgiving his sins and the same other Hadith it was a prostitute that went down and did the same for the dog now you can come and say was it the same dog come on give me a break these are two different narrations why would it have to be in the same country the same city the same era the same month the same date these are two separate incidents which illustrates to us the mercy of Allah azzawaja but both Hadith are authentic so there is no kuffa from your friend but definitely you jumping the gun is a very dangerous thing and by the way there are mistakes that are said that on the face of it is totally blasphemous yet the propheticism did not consider it to be even sinful as per the Hadith which is in the sahih where the Prophet said Allah the almighty is more joyful and happy when his servant repents to him than the happiness and joy of a man who was in the desert traveling with his food and drinks on his camel and when he took a short nap woke up to find his camel not there it disappeared he looked for it everywhere but he was in the wilderness he was in the desert so when he thought that he was dead for sure he took another nap only to wake up to find his camel next to him he grabbed the camel's harness and out of extreme joy and happiness he said oh Allah you are my servant and I am your lord the prophet says he made the mistake out of Happiness now such a mistake did it take him out of the fall of Islam definitely not did the prophet say anything about it definitely not which means that the last verse of Surat al-baqarah o our Lord do not hold us accountable if we were to forget or to make an error Allah said I shall do that Allah will not hold us accountable so I hope this answers your question"
