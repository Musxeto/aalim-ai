  "transcript": "so is that my question is I somehow felt like that starting management law and being a woman judge is a cool phone and I can wait it to my parents and they are shouted strongly and scolded me and heroes like and Hues and crowds cries and I even fearing that my dad and have a stroke from stress and as many people do nowadays from stress and I cried that okay I become a judge even if it becomes I have to serve my dad is uh is a said state statement I did cool for how do I what is it what is it that you're studying a man-made law so you're becoming a lawyer sir a woman judge a woman what judge judge okay so basically speaking it is not permissible to study and to work as a judge with man-made laws because if you look at chapter five verse 44 45 and 47 they all speak about whoever rules with other than Allah's law then he is a kafir he is a volume he is a facet so the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible at all to legislate laws that go against Islam and Sharia and legislating such laws would take a person out of the fold of Islam judging with such laws depends on the intention if he thinks that it's equivalent to Islam Sharia or better he's a kafir if he thinks that it Islam Sharia is better but he's doing it because he wants worldly gain then he's a volume and if he's doing it out of his sheer ignorance not knowing what is right and what is wrong then he's a facet so for you to work as a woman judge this is totally prohibited and if they scold you and admonish you and want you to forcefully study it go to the university and fail there's nothing big about it one two semesters and you fail they know that you're not cut for it and they will change it into something else this is all"
