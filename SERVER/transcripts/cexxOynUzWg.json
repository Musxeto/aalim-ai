  "transcript": "uh sheikh my friend said that i think when ramadan comes or during ramadan we have to say something before or during ghasol and once you say mean and i think this is most likely not authentic or fabricated but i don't know if i'm correct so i'm asking this question so that i can send it to my friend definitely definitely what your friend are saying is totally an innovation and not part of islam how do we know so i can come with a statement that before breaking your fast you have to say one two three abc where did you get this from sheikh oh this is good this is sunnah this is blah blah blah if it can't be proven from quran or from the authentic sunnah of the prophet salam then this is an innovation so whatever is not backed up by authentic evidences just throw it in the dustbin so to claim that we have to perform rasul on the first night of ramadan is bogus to claim that i have to verbalize my intention is totally bogus and you should ignore this and pay no attention to it and allah azza knows best"
