  "transcript": "Now everywhere you read in the Quran and in the Sunnah the same rhetoric the prophet is telling us Allah before that is telling us commanding us to be kind and to live with our spouse in a decent manner most men and women think that marriage is all about rights and responsibilities 1 + 1 equal 2 it is like an auditor whenever a dispute happens what did I do and what did you do and they start to check and balance and this is not correct when you have to live with your wife in kindness and in a decent fashion and honorable way it means that you love for her what you love for yourself so don't start pointing the finger and say you should have done this you should have done that rather look if your sister or daughter were to be treated in the same fashion how would you feel if if you were a wife and your husband was treating you in the same fashion how would you feel we tend never to think in this way and this is one of the treats and characteristics of a True Believer the prophet saidat IM is 60 plus branches which means that if you do not fulfill and complete these branches you'll never be classified as a full-fledged mmin rather you would be Muslim or mmin that is not that perfect so you have to fulfill these 63 Plus or 60 plus branches or 70 plus branches as in another narration one of them is to love for others what you love for yourself and we never think of this we're so selfish we so concentrated on what matters to us and the hell with everybody else whether it's in our jobs whether it's in our own homes the siblings among themselves I'm not going to do this they should do that I never think of what your country should do to you but what are you going to do for your country what Uncle Sam says this is what we should behave or how we should behave so marriage is not an equation that is fixed it's filled with many many other things that may not be tangible it is not restricted only to food I married you I'm feeding you you have a roof on your head well when she was at her father's house she had a better way of being treated she had more food than what she's having today in your house and she had a better roof and she was treated like a queen so why did you take her from her father's house to treat her like trash this is not Islam Islam tells you to fulfill her rights in addition to being compassionate caring loving showing her great deal of empathy compliment and encouragement and 99.99% like the Arab elections men do not do this they don't they fail in showing their emotions they fail in praising their wives and complimenting their beauty even if she's as a gorilla as ugly as a gorill no no problem say you have beautiful eyes gorillas have beautiful eyes say something that would make her feel good even if you you're you're lying this lying is rewardable Imagine The Prophet Alam did not permit lying except in three cases one lying to your spouse not that you're having poker night and you say listen I have some overtime do no no no this is not Halal lying this is Haram lying Halal lying is when she comes out trying a new dress in front of you and you say I don't know which one is making the other beautiful you're making the dress beautiful or the dress is making you beautiful wow this gives you a pass for six months I've done that I've been there trust me but with when you see her trying a new dress and see she says honey how do I look and you start laughing for half an hour and can't control yourself say I don't know is this your granddaughter's dress you're going to have problems so you have to compliment her praise her give her kind and nice words"
