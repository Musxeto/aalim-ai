  "title": "Is tawaf al wida (farewell tawaf) mandatory for Umrah or only Hajj? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh brother we are now in moscow and you know you have to do draft with us before you leave but we will go to jitter and stay there for two days even the condition is very hard can we do to appeal without today before leaving to jitter because i think so it won't be possible for us to come back to makkah the most authentic opinion about taha is that the waffle is only which translates to farewell tawaf farewell tawaf is to be done at the end of the hajj as for the umrah there is no authentic opinion or doing from the self that supports it and the vast majority of scholars say that this is only for hajj therefore if you finish your umrah and came to jeddah you're not obliged to go to makkah to do tawaf before leaving home and allah knows best"
