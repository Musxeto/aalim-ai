  "transcript": "I have a question what is the Sunnah of following what how do I follow the Sunnah of using Mis and what is the reward the Sunnah of using a miswak this twg is called miswak and it's very nice very uh uh useful the Sunnah is to brush your teeth with it whether sideways or upwards depending on what's more convenient to you and it is highly recommended when you enter your home so that your spouse would find a good smell before you make W before you offer prayer and after a meal for example so using it is something that is beneficial and it is highly rewarded because the prophet saidat wasam I not feared that I would burden my umah I would have ordered them to use this seak before offering prayers and Allah Knows Best"
