  "transcript": "smilla hoffman over him and hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen also leave us Alamo Alma Gutierrez Motilal Halloween nabina muhammad in wada and he was a hobby hero - today we had he Allah Almighty a mojado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh paradise is what we all seek every Muslim has his objective in this life to enter Jannah whether he's rich or poor jungle or old male or female all what we want is to reach Jenna and Jenna is a Las merchandise and it is as the Prophet described it Ali Salim expensive and unless merchandise is Jenna however Allah Azza WA JAL had given us so many ways and opportunities to enter Jannah to the extent that if you go through the things that entitled you to enter Jannah you think that definitely I'm in China because they're so easy and there's so many unfortunately this is not the case because when you come to walk the talk you find that a lot of us fail to do that our shortcomings are overwhelming us our sins are drowning us and the remorse we used to have is slowly fading away and instead of being remorseful or sad for committing a sin we find ourselves enjoying sins wanting them and calling people to join us in doing them Jenna is a las mercy as described in the hadith and Allah gives His mercy only to those whom he loves may Allah make me anew among those whom he loves Allah gives wealth and health to those whom he loves and those whom he does not love but he does not give Eman he does not give guidance and he does not give his Jannah his paradise except to those whom he loves so if we were to want to enter Jannah we need to work out like someone coming and saying Shaykh I would like to grow muscles I'd like to have a good body a healthy body so I said to him go to the gym exercise for two hours a day six days a week and come and meet me after one year so the guy comes after a couple of weeks and he said check I'm tired I worked four hours a day but nothing happened I would say don't be haste keep on working out until you reach your destination our destination is Jenna so if you look at the things that would admit you to Jenna it would take us a good four to five hours to speak about and we would not be able to accommodate all of them because time does not permit us there's so many things but if you look generally you would find that there are acts of worship that are for the individual to do and there are acts of worship that are transgressive meaning that others benefit from it not only me and there are acts if you just simply don't do them it will make you enter gender generally speaking what every Muslim fears in this life is a bad ending this is the worst thing that could happen to you to die while holding a glass of wine or whiskey or beer or smoking a joint to die while watching something that is Haram or listening to something that is Haram or being in a Haram company because whatever you die upon you'll be resurrected upon on the day of judgment the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said whoever says la ilaha illa-llah seeking Allah's pleasure seeking a las face and that would conclude his life on earth he will enter jannah and whoever fast a day for the sake of Allah and he would end his life while fasting he will enter jannah and whoever gives a charity seeking Allah's pleasure and that would be the last deed he does before dying he will enter Jannah so deeds are by their conclusion if you manage to die on something that is righteous and pleasing to Allah you will be doing well if a la among the things that would entitle you to enter gender and most of us fail in this is obeying the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the Prophet said sallallahu alaihi salam all of my ummah that includes you and me all of my ummah will enter paradise except those who disobey or except those who refuse so the companion said o prophet of allah who would refuse so the Prophet said alehissalaam whoever obeys me and tells Jenna and whoever disobeys me will enter Hellfire we are from his Ummah all what we have to do is to obey Him he says pray five times on time we pray he says women abide by the hijab they do men you have to grow your beads and wear the Islamic attire don't let it exceed your ankles we comply he says be kind to your parents be loving to your spouse and children connect your next of kin even if they are abusive and rude we do that just to enter Jannah also the prophet alayhi salaatu sam told us about a very easy to must to most of us a trivial act that would allow you to enter jannah imagine that would perform a waddle for salat which is mandatory if you say after performing wood ash hadu an la illaha illallah WA ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh that's it if you say that all eight gates of jannah will be open for you to enter from whichever you wish me no I'm not this is an authentic hadith whoever performs judo and perfects his voodoo and says at the end a shadow Allah illa allah muhammad abdul rasul that would what happen to him and the issue of Woodill of prayer is not something insignificant robbie ab niqab may Allah be pleased with him he says I used to sleep with the Prophet Alice herself to serve him so I used to bring him his Woodill water to to perform although if he had anything he wanted I would get that for him and once he said to me Rabia ask demand request whatever you want so he did not request a mansion or a piece of land or some wealth or a job ruling a country he said I asked that I accompany you on the day of judgement in paradise what a request this is Eman so the Prophet said has some anything else no Adobe and said nope that's all so the Prophet said that is awesome in this case support me to achieve your request by offering a lot of sujood meaning offering a lot of prayer because we know that there is no independent center of its own so perform prayers voluntary prayers as much as you can night prayer all of the prayers that those Muslims observe during the day and night such as a Sunnah no relative the emphatic Souness this makes you enter Jannah like the advice of the prophetess Antalya um Habiba may Allah be pleased with her said the Prophet sallallaahu Selim said whoever prays twelve broca's during the a day and the night Allah would build him a house in Jannah the 12 records are the emphatic soon-to-be forfeiture for before Lahore two after the her Madrid and Asia 12 records I will build you a mansion a house in Jenna and this is prayer what about other forms of worship Hajj if you perform Hajj and the Hajj is perfect without any shortcomings there is no reward for it except Jenna and we can go on and on these are things that I do for myself I don't care about others I pray at night prayer and this only benefits me Islam cares about deeds that are transitive that would benefit others and this is why in Mohammed when he was asked which is better or which is best to pray night prayer or to spend the time in acquiring knowledge about FC r  up Eid etc he said if one prays he prays for his own but when he seeks knowledge he seeks knowledge for the whole Ummah so seeking knowledge is better than night prayer why because of the benefit and there are so many things in Islam that encourages this so seeking knowledge is on top on the top of the list the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever seeks a path where he would learn Islamic knowledge from Allah will pave his way to Jannah all three all roads lead to Jenna but you have to take one Abu Huraira tells us that the Prophet said Ali his salat WA Salam there was a tree that was in the people's way and it used to harm the Muslims a man came and removed that harm and Allah Azza WA JAL admitted him to Jinnah Sohan Allah the guy did not offer something that we would consider to be extremely great or beneficial he just removed something from people's way how many times while we driving we see a big rock or a hurdle on the highway and we just avoid it and move on without removing it from people's way and sometimes benefiting others would be something beloved to ourselves every one of us loved their parents and the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam so many hadith and seeking their pleasure being dutiful and obedient to them a man came to the prophet requesting him so la la la Salaam to allow him to go for jihad so he asked him a specific question do you have a mother the Mossad yes so the Prophet said to him go back to her and stay next to her for Paradise is underneath her feet and the Prophet also said the father is the middle gate of Jannah all of these indicate that if you want to enter Jannah be dutiful to them be kind be respectful and not only to your parents but also to your children especially when you have girls because usually people look up to having boys who would help them who would earn money when they grow older who would support the family as the man of the house but girls people tend to believe that they are trouble you take care of them until they grow and then they get married and then you're again taking care of them fearing that they don't come back to you divorce so it's burden after burden this is what the people of pre-islamic era used to think the people of jahiliya in Islam we have a role model our role model is a prophetess of Salaam who had four daughters he had no sons he raised them he got them married and he took good care of them and he told the scientists alato Sam whoever has three daughters sheltering them providing for them having mercy over them Jenna would be his for good so some of the companions said what about if he had two daughters and the Prophet said Assam and two daughters what great reward is this from Allah granting us offspring gracias children and admitting us to Jannah because of these children and even if the children are not ours even if we take care of an orphan the Prophet said Allison he who sponsors and takes care of an orphan on the day of judgment he and I would be like this how close is the index finger and the middle finger they're so close almost identical this is how you will be with the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam and this goes on and on to all the things that not help and support the orphan but the community enlarged so the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever builds a house whoever builds a message it Allah will build him a house in Jannah so you have to provide for the community you have to share your money with the community not hoard it and keep it in banks and when you die it won't benefit you build a message it and just sit back and relax and contemplate upon the reward that you will be getting this goes on to propagating Dawa if you have an Islamic channel and they are in need of money they don't have revenues you don't have advertisements they don't have an income except what people donate if you donate to them help them to spread the word of Islam imagine how many millions would benefit from your dirham you're real you're dollar or euro that you had given them all what the people are benefiting from you're getting reward for that which paves your way to Jenna deeds that help the community are not that difficult but unfortunately we're not that fortunate to be able to do it one morning after fajar imagine praying with the Prophet as I'm in the Masjid fetcher it's still dark after the prayer was over the Prophet asked his companions ELISA lotsa who among you is fasting today Abu Bakr said I am a prophet of Allah question to who among you has fed a poor person Abu Bakr said I have Oh prophet of Allah who among you have visited a sick person it is fetcher Abu Bakr said I have a prophet of Allah who among you today has followed a funeral until it was buried Abu Bakr raised his hand for the fourth time saying I have a prophet of Allah the prophet said that is awesome these four things no man would have them done in the same day except Allah would admit him to Jenna very easy things but have we ever did it have we have we ever done it in our lives maybe yes and maybe no the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam o people spread Salam feed the food connect to your next of kin pray night prayer where people are asleep and you shall enter paradise in peace so if you were to do these things Allah would grant you Jenna and finally who they fir tells us about a hadith where a man was not so extraordinary in prayers or fasting or building message aids etc he had only one good thing what was that on the day of judgment he's asked did you ever do anything good in your life and he would say I don't know life was so short I don't know what good deeds I had performed in my life so the angel or someone else tells him look again so the man says I don't know anything good I have done in my life except I used to deal with people either by selling on credit or by lending them money whenever they asked for money so whoever has money to pay I would collect and whoever is poor or broke or unable to pay at the moment I would tell my servants to overlook him and delay him for some time until he becomes capable of paying off so this is the only thing that I used to do which I may consider to be good but nothing else allah azzawajal in different narrations says well I am more worthy of forgiveness than you admit my servant to Jenna if you even do nothing Allah hudud me to - Jenna imagine that the Prophet says Allah saw some whoever guarantees to preserve his tongue and his private part whatever is between his jaws and his thighs I guarantee him Jenna so what you have to do is nothing don't speak ill of people don't back bite don't fornicate don't masturbate don't do her on things protect your Allah from people's eyes and this would guarantee you Jenna women are also given something that would make them martyrs on the day of judgement where the Prophet highlights the importance and the suffering of a woman who is pregnant when he said that if a woman dies while in labor she's a martyr and she will enter Jannah and there are so many hadiths that encourage us to work out for Jenna all what it needs is you to believe and to start working because your clock and mine is ticking and our time on this earth is limited I pray to Allah Azza WA JAL that he makes me and you and all those who are watching this among the people of the highest level of Jannah among the people of paradise have Allahu Alem when is Patil me alayhi assalam was all allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why the early he was happy he remain you"
