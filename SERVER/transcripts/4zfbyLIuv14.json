  "transcript": "that says is it allowed to pray on a mat which has one inch foam in it or even a mattress why is bilal asking this question some of the prayer mats there are this thick they put a sponge in it so that when you for people who have problems with their knees so it is like a cushion so what's the ruling on that or on praying on a mattress on the bed scholars say that the Prophet Allison ordered us to enforce and make sure that our forehead touches the ground so if you reach the ground when you prostrate over this mat or this mattress then you're okay but if it is so foaming and it is so soft to the extent that no matter how much pressure you apply you still can go down further and further and further this means that you are prostrating on air now this is not permissible you have to feel that you've reached the ground and a solid place in order for your prostration to be valid"
