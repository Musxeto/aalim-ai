  "transcript": "and the second question for karima if a man conditions to establish marriage to his fiancee is to have a certain job in a certain country or else no marriage can we consider this as a condition conditional marriage is it permissible in islam this is not uh a condition because as stated before here or somewhere else i don't know a man does not stipulate conditions because he has the authority to divorce whenever he doesn't like something it's the other way around it's the woman who stipulates conditions before the marriage contract saying that i stipulate the condition that you'd never stop me from working or you never prevent me from pursuing my degree and she has the right to ask for that and he has the right to refuse and if he refuses there's no marriage if he accepts then he has to abide by this condition because if he does not fulfill it in three four years time she has the right to call for a divorce it does not give him anything and she leaves him she dumps him but for the man to make it as a condition that his wife works in a certain country this again he's not a real man he falls under the same category of the youth we spoke about earlier and allah knows better"
