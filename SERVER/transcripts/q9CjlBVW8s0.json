  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible to buy cars that have logos with animals or fish just like ferrari or lamborghini um having logos of animals on your car is permissible if it is 2d so usually the logo of a ferrari is not a statue like the logo of rolls-royce for example so the logo of rolls-royce is of a woman with wings i don't know what they call it some of it pops off from the hood some of it is always there this is a statue but a lamborghini's logo what is it a bull a ferrari a horse that doesn't have facial features um p joe i don't know if anybody buys specials anymore but it has a lion these 2d pictures that don't have facial features there's no problem in having them in sha allah if they have facial features then you have to cover the face as in the case for example of um la coste where you have a gator or or crocodile i don't know what the difference is i'm not from miami and they have eyes and a face etc this is something that has to be covered"
