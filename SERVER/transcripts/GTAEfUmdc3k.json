  "transcript": "she says that i did a mistake my father once was bad mouthing my mother in front of me and not only i kept silence silent i agreed so he said my your mother is so and so-and-so and i said yes so my mother now when she heard about this she started scalding me and saying how you did this and not defend me how this and that so now she's doubtful is she sinful in both cases because her mother was also about mouthing her father the answer is yes she's sinful for in both cases and in her father's case she's more sinful because she approved something that is not true so not only she heard back biting she approved of it and said it was true though it was not true usually in fights and problems and issues between the parents the son or the daughter is caught between a rock and a hard place and imam ahmed the great imam of jamaa was asked once by a man and he asked him he said oh imam my father tells me to do something and my mother forbids me to do it what should i do so imam said obey your father and don't disobey your mother how is this he said this is the only answer i have he cannot say obey your father and neglect your mother and he cannot say to him obey your mother and neglect your father's instruction this is something you have to walk yourself out of it's a very thin line and yes it's hanging by a thread because pleasing one on the account of the other is sinful so how is it going to be done but in your case if your father started to bad mouth your mother you should have either politely defended her or sought permission and you should have seek permission and leave the room and not participate in such back biting or slandering allah as zojan knows best"
