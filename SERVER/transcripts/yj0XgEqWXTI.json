  "title": "Eating Halal Food at a Restaurant that serves Pork or Alcohol - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "say John says can we eat halal food and drink water or other liquids at a restaurant which serves alcohol or pork well such places we have to look at the prohibition first of all the Prophet said Alice a lot of it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and the day of judgement to sit on a table where intoxicant is being served so even if I don't drink being with a group of people drinking it's a business meeting it's a gathering it's a reunion whatever it is totally Haram for me to be with them because anyone looking from abroad from outside would say Oh ma'sha'allah 20 men drinking booze not knowing that number 20 is not and this gives momentum for such parties or events or gatherings let alone that me inside I'm being bit-by-bit invaded by the thought of having a beer or just drinking some glasses of champagne just to be with with everybody else to just run with the flow as for pork the prophet alaihi wasallam when asked about eating in the utensils of the disbelievers though the food being served in it is halal the prophet sallallaahu salam ordered us to wash it thoroughly first because they eat Haram meat they eat pork and they do not care about the impurities in it this means that if I go into a restaurant that serves intoxicants that has a bar in it in the same place and that sells Haram food as well that being there I'm giving them credibility because they would say Oh Muslim eat there so this means it is holid secondly I'm not sure whether the 10 cells are pure or not I'm not sure inside the kitchen are they using the same knife to cut the halal chicken with the Haram pork chops or not so it's the impurity would be transferred from here to there and therefore it is not at all recommended for a Muslim to eat there now if there is no other place I am in a hotel and there are no Islamic outlets other than that I can't get room service in my room I have to eat in the restaurant in this case you try your level best to stay as far as possible from those who drink and try to tip the waiter and ask him to ask a chef to make sure that they do not use or he does not use the same utensils in cooking your food which was used with Haram food and Allah knows best"
