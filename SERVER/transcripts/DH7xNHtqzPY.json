  "transcript": "brother Muhammad fromia alaykum hello alaykum yes brother what can I do for you actually my question is in India some of the col say that Friday should be in Arabic okay you know in India we have different languages and should be in the language okay I clarification for okay I will answer your question inshallah okay thanks brother Muhammad is asking about an issue that Scholars have differed over and that is can theba of Friday can the sermon of Friday be in other languages than Arabic or it has to be in Arabic it's a long discussion and it the the the topic they differed a lot and there are so many details regarding this issue the most authentic opinion is that as long as you've praised Allah and you prayed on the prophet Alat wasam and you've recited one verse and one Hadith in Arabic this suffices because the essence of Friday sermon is to convey Islam to convey their religion to those who are listening to you I remember going in uh Delhi in in India one year and it so happened that I had to go to Friday with those who were with me so they took me to a Masjid and I looked and mashallah the Masjid was fully packed and this was about half an hour or or 45 minutes before the so we waited we recited the Quran and when the Imam came he was in his 70s maybe in 80s allaham and masallah nicely dressed said sat down gave thean after that he started and praised Allah prayed on the prophet Alat and he started two cbas reading it from a book or a booklet and it was supposed to be in Arabic so he concluded theba he prayed the Salat and everybody went home not coming back until the the next or the following Friday I looked around me everyone in the Masjid was narab so they definitely did not understand what he was saying to me as an Arab I could not understand a single word except when he said Allah or AOL sallallahu alaihi wasallam because his Arabic was so bad I couldn't understand it so at the end of the day only one one who got the benefit hopefully was the IM who read theba providing that he understood what he read as well therefore the scholars say the essence of the is that the people understand and learn their religion from it and if it's in Arabic and they don't know Arabic then there is no point of them listening to it because the the the the highest percentage is on their comprehension understanding now having said that if I go to a country that the people are native English they speak only English their mother tongue is English I will give the full sermon the twas in English yet I'll start with in Arabic which includes three verses from the Quran and includes the Hadith of the Prophet Alam uh about innovation and this is the requirement that is required for theba to be correct as the majority of the scholars say so in short I highly recommend that in non-arab countries that the would be in a language that the majority of those attending would be able to understand if you are in an Arab country it has to be in Arabic if you are in a country that the majority who attend in the Masjid know know Arabic it has to be in Arabic and Allah Asel Knows Best"
