  "transcript": "so me and my friends have been thinking about joining uh Judo classes because Judo is a sport me and my friends have been thinking about joining a judo classes Judo Judo okay but because Judo is a sport that originates out of Japan it's apparently a very big part of the sport and the culture for people to to bow to their opponents and their coaches and the referees Etc everybody involved knows it's out of respect in like cultural tradition but is it still har yes of course it's har there's no doubt in Bowing in such a fashion like it done in karate or in Judo or like some of these Asian countries do out of respect there's no doubt it's Haram the doubt is is it shik or not so people who do it as of imitating the disbelievers or out of you said respect this is considered to be minor shik not major shik that takes people out of the fold of Islam because I'm not bowing and praising and glorifying the one I'm bowing to I'm just imitating the disbelievers which is it's sinful and it's not permissible so you may join such a sport uh but you have to demand that you do not bow because it goes against your religion and if they don't respect your religion why would I respect their customs and respect whatever they think is respectful the hell with anyone else that does not respect my religion My Religion we don't bow to a king or to a president or to any human being let alone another play player who's going to whip your back site"
