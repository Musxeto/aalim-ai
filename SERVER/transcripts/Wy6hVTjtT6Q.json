  "transcript": "yusef from the uk he says that if we have an impurity on an electronic device a mobile a pda a computer how to remove this impurity yusuf if you see the impurity visible and it's not only doubts no i think something came i may have done this or that may or i think or perhaps take it and throw it in the dustbin you don't need doubts to change the certainty the certainty is that the pen is pure actually it's not my pen i came into the studio and i found the pen with a pad on my table so there is a possibility that the sheikh before me who was using this pen had impurity on his hand and now it transformed or transferred into mine and then i touched my scarf and then i touched my keys of of the house and entered the house and the whole house is so i have to burn it down to the ground these are whispers of shaytan and i get counseling sessions like crazy and questions on my email like crazy and i'm talking about the hundreds of emails i get a week on this topic knowledge erases all doubts and whispers of shaytaan so this is my mobile does it have an impurity on it yes sheikh are you sure are you certain definitely i can see the impurity in this case the mobile phone is slick and soft it's not like a harsh wood or pieces of bricks that cannot be wiped see the surfaces are two types surfaces that are so smooth like the blade of a sword so if there's an adjacent in the blade of a sword or a knife i just wipe it well i can see that there's nothing on it glass metal it's the same thing but it has a rough surface like wood that is not uh i don't know how used uh sandpaper on it it's still rough wiping this does not do the job you have to wash it so with your mobile phone with your electronic electronic devices all what you have to do is just get some a little bit damp um paper or cloth and wash it and wipe it and this is it but if you're not certain then to begin with you should not do anything because doubts do not impact certainty"
