  "transcript": "foreign wants to make repentance uh assuming that they want to meet you sincere sentence but they're lacking remorse their like hard for them to feel most so what can they do in that okay this is problematic salahin because if someone wants to repent sincerely if the element of remorse does not exist his repentance is not valid the prophet said in an authentic Hadith repentance is remorse or remorse is repentance which means that it's the major pillar of repentance without remorse your repentance is invalid you can quit a sin you can try your level best to pledge not to do it again you can ask Allah for forgiveness and do good deeds but deep down if your heart is not burning because of what you had done in the past you don't have this remorse nothing is going to stop you from doing and doing it again and therefore you have to even fake it and convince yourself that you're remorseful or your repentance is not valid"
