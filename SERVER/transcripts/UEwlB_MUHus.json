  "title": "Jummah Mubarak - permissible to say? How to respond if someone says it to us? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "somebody said uh mubarak to us yesterday and then i said you shouldn't say that and then at the end of the football he was like wait why should i say this and this is that so i explained to him you know i said that uh i said that jummah was blessed at the time of the promised land he never said it but they were like so we shouldn't or is this and then i showed them one of your videos on youtube that uh say you explained to them uh the prophet saw some didn't do it and then do it and it was like a 53 second clip but then they're still confused they're saying what is an innovation and so if the problem saw something into something we can't do it then and so it was a i don't know how to make it more clearer than what i had done i don't remember what i said in the previous videos and this is problematic lots of the people ask questions on my website and they say you said so and so in a previous video and then you said something else in a previous video first of all i don't open links so i'm not gonna understand what you're talking about second of all i don't remember what i had for lunch yesterday seriously so if i try maybe i will find out so i don't i don't remember and recall what i said and therefore i can't revisit what i had said because i'm not a scholar if i'm gonna revisit something i'm gonna get get it from the scholars so what do the scholars say the scholars say that stating jumaa mubaraka every single week is not from the sunnah simply because the prophet islam did not do it the companions had never ever done it and neither the tabernae nor the taberet tabulin it's the books are in front of us we can see it so if they did not congratulate one another by saying this and the need was there to be cordial to be courteous to be kind so they wanted to do something to feel friendly and and brotherly yet they did not do it so it is suitable to say that it's not appropriate it's not from the sunnah and if you go a little bit further you can say it's an innovation because it's related to a day of the week it's a form of ibadah it's related to a friday and the prayer and unfortunately a lot of the people and maybe some students of knowledge and dies find it easy and i get messages from them every single week stating or offering the salutation upon the prophet every friday in a a a way or sending a nasheed with the salutation upon the prophet so i advise them but they don't comply so i leave them alone so the middle path in my opinion is you never initiate it you never call a cousin or a friend or an uh someone your name says never but if people do that to you and they say mubarak simply says that's it don't reply and it is mubaraka to you as well and to your family as if they had greeted you and allah knows best"
