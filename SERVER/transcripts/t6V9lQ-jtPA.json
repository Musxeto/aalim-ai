  "transcript": "from the uk he says i heard a scholar saying that it is permissible to keep a dog as a pet and the hadith refers only to the prophet this is not a scholar this is an ignorant imbecile and you should not take your religion from any tom dick or harry this is religion when you have stomach ache you don't go to a mechanic you don't go to a dentist you go to a proper doctor physician who knows and still have studied what you're talking about when a person rejects the hadith of the prophet by quoting that imam malik permitted taking dogs as pets keeping them outside the house this means that this guy doesn't understand what islam is who is malik who is abu hanifa who is ahmed compared to the prophet they're nothing they're no one yes to us they're great imams but our greatest of them all is the prophet salaam whom we are ordered to follow what he taught us"
