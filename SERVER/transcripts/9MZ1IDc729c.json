  "transcript": "i'd like to ask which is worse not memorizing the quran at all for the fear of uh forgetting it or memorizing it and forgetting it no the answer is the first it is far worse not to memorize the quran than memorizing it and forgetting it because forgetfulness isn't a natural thing it's a human thing so allah azzawajal would not hold you accountable if you forget and that is why at the end of surat al-baqarah chapter 2 allah says do not burden us o lord if we forget or make a mistake so if you forget this is human nature you try your level best but even if you memorize the quran you forget or is not applying the quran in your life so even if you memorize the verse or don't memorize the verse if you deal in interest you're cursed by the quran so regardless whether you memorize it or not you are cursed but if you apply all what is in the quran in your life and implement it even if you don't memorize one single ayah or you memorize the quran and forgot"
