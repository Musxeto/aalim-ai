  "title": "What to do if imam makes sujood as sahu according to hanafi Madhab? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ibrahim says how to perform sujood a so who should we recite that asha hood twice and when to do these frustrations before salaam or afterwards sue judas ah who is an issue of dispute among schools of thought the vast majority of them they don't have a dispute because they rely on the hadith of of the live in mustard abu sa'id aha Jerry vu Herrera and I'm the la have no behind me Allah be pleased with them for companions may allah peace with them that reported different ways of performing to you the cell and the majority say that should you the cell which means or translates to forgetfulness prostrations these are two frustrations we offer when we make a mistake or when we forget something in prayer or when we add something to prayer that is not part of it so it can be at the end of the prayer before concluding it with salam to the right into the left and it can be after offering salam to the right in the left you offer two frustrations of death of forgetfulness and then you offer another salam and we talked about this so many times but what ibraheem is referring to if i if my understanding is correct is how the Hanafi school of thought performed this prostration so there is there are so many different opinions in the Hanafi school of thought and none of it is according to the quran or to the sunnah but due to the fact that it is one of the four schools of thought that all muslims accept we tend to tell people to follow it meaning that if I'm praying behind an imam in India or in Pakistan who happens to follow the Hanafi school of thought in the last sitting he offers the Shah hood he doesn't offer salutation he just said a shadow la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh and he offers once a time to the right as Salam o aleikum wa rahmatullah in other narrations or opinions of same Hanafy school of thought they don't look to the right they just say as salam aleikum wa rahmatullah once without looking to the right then they offer to prostrations for forgetfulness then they sit and offer to Shah hood again and offer salutation upon the prophet alayhi salatu salam then they offered salam to the right hand to the left this is not found in the Sunnah at all where did they get it from beats me why do they offer one salam because they believe that one salam concludes your prayer but because your prayer is not over yet you conclude it to the right because if you said salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah to your left they said that you cannot offer prostration of forgetfulness because you spoke unnecessarily when you give salam to the left now all of this is part of their school of thought part of their teaching we agree it's not backed up by Quran or Sunnah authentic sooner that is yet we cannot simply just cross it out and say leave the prayer leave the Imam this guy doesn't know what he's doing go somewhere else this is not logical so the vast majority of scholars of Islam of different schools of thought say that due to the fact that this is one of the four authorized schools of thought in Islam then you follow what the Imam has done exactly like we do when we pray behind the hanafi imam who is praying whitter three Rakas like mother the majority of scholars say that this is not permissible because the prophet alayhi salatu salam prohibited us to pray which are in the same format as mother so the majority would pray the first rakha normally after the second prostration they stand to the second raka recite Fatiha surah normally then they do two prostrations and they stand for the third raka so it's not like mothering Hanafi school of thought no in the second record they sit for the Shahada then they stand up for the third raka and they sit for the final two Shahada and offer Salam so if I am following the Sunnah but it so happened that this night of Ramadan I'm praying taraweeh in a Hanafi Masjid and the Imam prays which are in this format what should I do nothing pray with him but he's going against the Sunnah no problem he's going against the sinner because he believes that this is the right thing to do not because he wants to go against the Sunnah anyone that wants to go against the Sunnah deliberately and hates the sooner you should not pray behind him so pray behind him and your prayer is valid with the grace of Allah insha Allah who as watcher"
