  "transcript": "and exclusively for buddha tv i greet you from the plains of arafat it is almost 11 o'clock and everybody is geared up they're all waiting to listen to the football in arafat and then pray shortening and combining the prayers and then devote the rest of the time for dua alhamdulillah the weather is modifying it's cloudy as you can see behind me this is the masjid in arafat and everyone is as stated earlier are geared up for dua everybody has their own bucket list or a wish list which they present to allah asking him to accept from them the difference is that they come to allah azzawajal not demanding not asking rather they are begging they are expressing their humility they're expressing their poverty they all come to allah azzawajal wearing the same dress code none of them has titles to boast by they have all dropped their pride got rid of their arrogance kings presidents wealthy people dignitaries they're all the same they're all here standing in front of the almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth the one that has everything in his hands the one that nothing happens without his will they come not to demand they come begging for forgiveness they come begging for acceptance they ask in humility they express their poverty they show their humbleness and they get they get rid of everything that they have ever found pride in simply to get accepted by allah there is no day in the whole year that allah azza sets people free from hellfire than the day of arafat they come to supplicate to invoke allah azzawajal to ask allah to grant them forgiveness and to rectify their affairs confessing of their own shortcomings of their own flaws they come in repentance this is a day which they have been waited which they have been waiting for all of their lives and this is a day to be anticipated we here in arafat will devote the entire day to invoking allah azzawajal and unfortunately due to the fact that we are not used to doing that for long periods of time most likely shaytan would come to us and make us feel bored so we will alternate between prayer reading the quran making dua reading and the best of dua as the prophet had said allah on the day of arafah is saying and so many people of us ask where is the torah and also the dua of prophet jonah prophet yunus the one who was swallowed by the whale his door is she asking for and this is a critical point that most of us don't realize that dua is dividing the two types of praising allah azzawajal and complementing him such as this is all considered to be dua and then there is the second type of dua which is asking and requesting such as oh allah forgive me o allah pardon me oh allah have mercy on me oh allah grant me money pay off my debts guide my family etc and both types are dua so the best of dua on the day of arafat is the dua of the height this is where everything fall into p into its place because with the your affairs in this dunya would be rectified and your sins on the day of judgment would be erased so as they say sincerely and truly wish you we're here and may allah azzawajal grant you the chance to feel what i'm feeling in the coming years when you come here for hajj is muhammad"
