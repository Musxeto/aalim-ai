  "transcript": "the Magnificent night journey that took place known as El Mirage where the Prophet s-salam was taking this to the seventh heaven did this take place physically or spiritually did it take place with his body and soul or was it only with his soul he the most authentic opinion is that this particular journey the night journey which Allah Dajjal mentioned in chapter 17 Surat Annisa and allah azza wa bihamdihi leyland min al-masjid al-haram e ll Masjid al-aqsa all praise and glory be to Allah Azza WA JAL who has taken his servant from Mecca Masjid al-haram to al-masjid al-aqsa in Jerusalem in a puts this took place physically and spiritually by the body and by soul and the Prophet went there and he led all the prophets and messengers of Allah in prayer in al-masjid al-aqsa whether this took place before the ascension to the heavens or after there is a difference of opinion among scholars in ever even katheer stated that the prayer leading the prophets took place after he came down from the heavens and not before and this is why he says that whenever he went with Jibril in the seven heavens every time he meets an angel or he meets a prophet and he says who's this he says this is mohammed and they give salam to me exchange salam if he had led them in prayer earlier in jerusalem they would have recognized him so even kathy says that this is an indication that leading the prayer took place after he came down from the heavens and this is a an issue of not of great importance but it took place by the soul and the body the prophet Aslam was this was ascended with his body and came back because if it were a vision if it were a dream we all have dreams there's no great emphasis or a miracle to be considered so this incident took place once in his life body and soul but later on the Prophet told this awesome about many visits that took place only with his soul where he visited different places where he have seen different things and he reported that to us whatever he saw in Jena whatever he saw in Hell fire in the torment of the graves etc all of this took place with his vision not with his soul and Allah surgeon knows best"
