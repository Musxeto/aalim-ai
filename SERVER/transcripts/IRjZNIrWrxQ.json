  "title": "Masjid gives Friday Khutbah one minute before the prayer, can I pray there? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh she there's two Masjids near my home where I live alhamdulillah and I go to pray and I go pray what's it called every Friday there but the thing is uh the Friday most of the time it's usually was and only the last and only the last minute before the prayer they give like the actual khutbah so my question was is it permissible for me to pray with them as long as the pillars of the jummah are executed then there's no problem in that but a logical and intelligent Muslim would go to the Masjid that he benefits from so if going to the second Masjid which is a bit further is more beneficial gets you more knowledge gets you closer to Allah you should go there but either way as long as the pillars of the are fulfilled then it's fine"
