  "title": "Allah doesn't accept zakat from someone whose relatives are in need & give 2 others? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "somewhere and it is translated in English as uh the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said oh um by the one who sent me with truth Allah does not accept the satka of a person whose relatives are in need yet he gives it to others and by the one who is in charge of my soul Allah would not look at such a person with Mercy on the day of judgment if this is sahihadis is a person sinful for not giving the needy relatives and does he need to repay if zakat is invalid to my knowledge there is no such authentic Hadith we know if you give your zakat money or your charity to your next of kin who are in need you'll be getting double the reward but there is nothing in Sharia that says that if I decide to give it to a stranger who's in need while depriving my own kinship or relative that it would not be accepted and I will be tormented for that there is nothing in as such in the Sharia to my knowledge and Allah Knows Best"
