  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to a new episode of with the Prophet Amelie Coleman a beer host as we continue part two of the poor looking at how the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him interacted with the needy and poor around him we are continuing of course with sheikh osman al Hakim from Saudi Arabia Salaam alaikum welcome why didn't come salam what i him to lie here what a catch thank you for continuing to be with us part two of the poor you know it might be easy for us to tell people who are not able to meet their needs to be patient life in the hereafter would be good for you there are rewards for you in the hereafter try to be a good Muslim and be patient here it's a hard message you know for someone witnessing their family struggling to take the heart is this what the Prophet peace be upon him taught or encouraged the poor too about the rewards in the Hereafter he was happy he woman am i bad the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam taught us to deal with death different segments of society so he dealt with the poor as he dealt with the rich he dealt with the disbelievers as he dealt with the Muslims and if you remember at the beginning of the time of the Medina era those who came to Medina from the immigrants of the companions who migrated to Medina these migrants we're poor they left their wealth their property their families and fled with their religion and therefore there were a lot of them in Medina and there were categories so there were those who were totally impoverished totally and these we're single men who lived in the Masjid they had nothing but the garment they wear on the bodies and that is it no tools no cars no rides no food nothing and they were known as el sofá and there were those who were a little bit better off maybe have a house or a room to live in but nothing else so when you look at this and you find that there are many of them definitely there has to be a sort of compensation from the Prophet Allah so Salaam so that they can endure the suffering they're going through one of the means of doing so is giving them the glad tidings so the prophet Isaiah used to tell them and give them the glad tidings that the first to enter Jannah to enter paradise are those who are poor while the rich are deprived from entering it until they settle their accounts in some narrations it says 40 years and some narrations 500 years so the 40 years as some scholars say is for the rich companions who were righteous but rich mm-hmm and the 500 years is for those who are not as righteous and not as PI's you know the prophet of course was very sympathetic merciful towards the poor and the needy in his actions and his words in his encouragement what about elevating recognizing them socially elevating them giving them status appreciating them in front of the general public he was careful not to ignore not to neglect he would is it true he would visit the poor and attend to their needs he talked about that part the prophet alayhi salatu salam was a balanced man and this is a sign of perfection when you can balance your time and your needs this means that you have got it made the profit that is awesome used to visit all segments of the society but it stands out how he used to check on even the poor in sahih al-bukhari it was reported that there was a black woman cleaning the masjid now we don't have her name we don't know who her parents were we have no information none whatsoever about her except this hadith and of course being in a Bihari means it's the highest level of authenticity so what does the hadith say it says that there was this black woman who used to clean the Masjid and once she did not come the Prophet checked on her and they told him that she was sick so the prophet has some knew that she was dying and he was checking on her every now and then to the extent that she died at night while the Prophet was asleep so the Companions did the needful and buried her when the Prophet woke up they told him that the woman the black woman the poor woman died and we buried her he was angry and he said why didn't you wake me up and he took his companions went to the cemetery to the graveyard and asked them to show him where her grave was here and he stood there with them behind him and he offered the funeral prayer to go out of your way to go out of your comfort zone yeah to the cemetery at night to offer funeral prayer on who Abu Bakr on Oh Martin on someone who to you and I might be considered as a nobody yet not the Prophet RA salatu salam he gave them their due right yeah and being appreciated not because of their wealth but because of their humanity yeah a beautiful story unfortunately we have a negative perception of the needy and the poor and it's reflected even in our sometimes in the form of our giving all of us are not guilty of this but we're aware that there are things around the house that we that become unusable or undesirable somehow maybe they've fallen into ill repair they're in poor condition let's just give it to the poor instead of throwing it away let's give it to the poor can you talk about that I mean am I are we am i right is it that we are diminishing the status of these people that they aren't deserving of things that are in good condition and the things that we would use and their new condition or is it just that we don't think about them in that in the way that what's that all about it depends see if I have bought new clothes and I have old clothes what should I do with them if you're telling me that because they're old it's not nice it's unfair that I give it to the poor this is wrong instead of throwing it at the trash can mm-hmm I give it to someone who may benefit of it but in case of wanting to give charity and instead of giving charity from something that is worthy something that is good I tend to choose the worst of the worst just in order to get rid of this is different story allah azza wajal tells us in the Quran oh you have believed spent from the good things which you have earned and from that which we have produced for you from the earth and do not aim towards the defective therefrom spending from that while you would not take it yourself except with closed eyes what does that mean it means that when you want to give in charity you give something from the middle of what you have or from the top because Allah stated in the Koran lintel I will bill you will not reach the level of piety of righteousness until you spend from what you love this beautiful hadith shows us or ayah it shows us that yes when it comes to giving charity don't be a miser don't be low but when you have something that is access to what you need mm-hmm though you don't want it as long as it is good and people can utilize it then there's nothing wrong in giving it away okay thank you for that answer on the subject of of giving charitable giving another question about those of us who are struggling maybe our conditions you know there's a whole class of people who are considered middle class we call them working poor they have jobs they have an income but it's really tough to make ends meet I'd like to ask you after our break Shaykh about these people who want to give but find it very difficult to do so would take the sheiks answer after Arbor Salam alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet the question that I pose to you before the break I'm working I want to give it's difficult for me what should I do how should I think about this this is part of a Las testing for you so not all of us have money mm-hmm yet charity is not limited to money okay you can do a lot of good things even if you poor really bad even xate may Allah be pleased with him was one of the few men who went to the Prophet as I'm seeking financial assistance to go and fight with him like a Ryan a sword etc and the Prophet rejected them and said I don't have anything to give you so they started to cry to weep and this was mentioned in surah at-taubah chapter 9 their story this companion went back home and said oh Allah you know that you made me poor and you know how much I want to fight in the cause of you but I don't have the financial means therefore I make you my witness that any Muslim who took something unlawfully for me from me or slandered me or backbit me I make you my witness that I forgive him for the sake of Allah as a charity for prayer the Prophet Isum leads a prayer and then says who is it who gave charity last night three times and then no one stood up or Alba said I did or prophet of Allah he said to him I give you the glad tidings Allah has accepted your charity mm-hmm so the guy didn't physically give anything right he just forgave likewise the poor immigrants came to the Prophet Isis am complaining this is the prophet of Allah help us we pray our brother of the answered pray we fast and they fast but they have money to give in charity and we don't have that money so we were envious we would like to do good deeds like them so the Prophet told them to say Ali his solo twosome and the end of every prayer subhanAllah alhamdulillah Allah Akbar 33 times and to conclude with once la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah etc and he said this would be equivalent to what they spend with their wealth so again doing vicar is means of charity whatever you are unable to give this is a test from Allah but it doesn't stop here you can do something about it so you're great so there's an expanded view for those of us who want to be responsive to the needs to the needy around us it's not restricted to money there are many forms that can be translated both in the material plane as well as the spiritual plane of our existence kind of the Prophet peace be upon him he encouraged the the poor to work together to cooperate to help each other this is a beautiful and important cinema because you know those who are we meant may not always be sensitive so what did he say exactly peace be upon him about this there is this concept of cooperative or collaboration form when in a calamity hree and they are a tribe of abu musa al-ashari and there for him from yemen originally they have a tendency that whenever they are in battle or in travel and they are short of food the Prophet praised is awesome their action he said that whenever they are in need what they do is they gather everything they have and they put it in one place and then they divide it equally so this is not communism but it is a form of cooperating with the others you may have nothing and I may have something we'll share it the concept of sharing was one of the principles in Islam when the migrants came to Medina at the beginning when the migrants came from Mecca they were stone broke so the people of Medina had their farms the businesses it's their hometown and they have everything well established what did the Prophet do is awesome he made a bond between each one of them so he assigned a person to be a brother of the other person a sponsor or host sort of so for example and the most famous story of all is the story of Abdul Rahman even house after a minor banal fee is one of the ten heaven-bound was made the brother of sad even Revere who was a wealthy man of medina from the Ansar the story goes as following now this is sharing sadness Rabia said at the Rahman my brother the people of Medina know that I'm the wealthiest of all so here is half of my wealth he didn't give him a portion a check of a thousand or ten thousand that would have been more than sufficient he said take half of whatever I own not only that I have two wives Allah blessed me with and I will divorce one of them so that after she is divorced you can marry her so total sharing now imagine if the Muslims we're to have these sentiments and feelings nowadays would we have their hinges would we have the plight in Syria would we have the plight in Palestine would we have it in Libya in Yemen there's so many understand in Iraq in the sky's the limit but the Muslims do not have this do not feel the sympathy towards their brothers and sisters who were not privileged as they are and to be fair to us I mean maybe it's the modern political setup itself it's doesn't allow us to operate the me the way they perhaps did you know over a thousand years ago this is this is probable mmm but whenever whatever there's a will there's a way mmm see it's a good justification and an excuse for me not to look around so I can't do anything politics but if I had well to do something there are means and ways but again may allah azzawajal rectify our affairs and an important part of that is is our national identity as long as I'm thinking I'm Egyptian or Saudi or American or whatever it's an artificial boundary between us you know so there are many levels of the modern system that stand in the way by the way I wanted to ask you the currency that the hard currency that was used in this time that the poor would have been collecting that was all the dinar D&R was made of gold dirham was made of silver I say but this was a I need something of a luxury not everybody had this in cash in their purse so usually it would be exchanging things I see so I give you my my sheep you give me something in return but yes this was the prevalent currency around okay we are this is going to be our last discussion about the poor and one last question I'd like to get to or anything else of course that you would like to address is about the prophet's attitude is it true I've heard that the Prophet sometimes would even favor and was more sympathetic towards more giving of his time his money to the poor than to his own family is that true this is definitely true see the Prophet Isis and though he was a father and a husband but before that he's a messenger and a ruler and he gave us so many instructions that when a ruler crosses the line in favors himself and his family over his citizens then he is bound to help so it essentially is the opposite of what we have now which is nepotism everybody's favoring their nephew or their son or whatever this beautiful story which is well known to all Muslims that Fatima his beloved and only daughter surviving her hands were torn and becoming harsh because doing and draining the wheat so highly her husband said why don't you go to your father and ask him to give you a slave to work and relieve you from this yeah so she did she went to her father and asked him for a servant to help her the Prophet didn't give her hmm and he directed her to some vicar which we recite before we go to bed all Muslims do Subhan Allah and Allah Allah Akbar 33 33 and 34 and when I did complained to him and said o prophet of Allah this is your daughter this is my wife just give us a certain he said by Allah I will not favour you with servant while the poor are suffering from hunger hmm so the Prophet justified this by saying is it's not fair though you my daughter though you are one of the four perfect women of paradise though I love you but I cannot favor you while there are people who are starving and people who are hungry where is that today we need it so desperately well Eli if we try to abide by Quran and Sunnah at least we will get close someday well that will conclude our discussion thank you very much for being with us barakallahu faecal we have reached the end of the episode for today in our discussion on the poor and we will continue with the prophet inshallah in our next episode until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh"
