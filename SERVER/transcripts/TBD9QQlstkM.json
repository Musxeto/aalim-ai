  "title": "Does saying Astaghfirullah al lazi la ilaha illa huwa... forgive major sins? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "but I wasn't able to answer uh so my question is we know that uh it is mentioned in Hadith that it can forgive you even if you like flee from the battlefield which is a major sin so does this tale that this Dua gives major sins for individual even though we know like only forgives minor sins this Dua does not mean it erases or forgives major sins without repentance but with repentance it may and the ma the vast majority of Allah they all agree that that major sense require repentance and when they come to this Dua they find it problematic because whoever says this Dua Is Forgiven even if he flees so to combine it would be that it requires repentance with the Dua and this is to combine all the contradicting evidences because as you've stated prayer to prayer Ramadan to Ramadan would expiate what between them as long as a person does not commit major sins so Hajj by all means is greater than this Dua nobody doubts this praying five times a day is greater than this Dua without any doubt so this is the only way to understand it and Allah Knows Best"
