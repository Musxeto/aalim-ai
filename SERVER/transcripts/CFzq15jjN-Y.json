  "transcript": "abdah um she one of my classmates is a Christian and me and him got an argument about the prophet Sall alaih wasallam marriage from AIA and I responded to his shha but still he insulted our prophet and said the word that I can't use him here so my question is and the next day sorry the next day I told everyone and he apologized about what he said so my question is do we forgive him and what should our relationship be with him after this if he's a cafir and you live in a cafir country and the laws are different than the laws in Muslim countries and you sense and feel that he's remorseful and his apology is sincere and real I would see no harm in forgiving him while being careful and not getting too close and still giving him dawa and proving to him that Islam is is the religion of Allah and the Quran is the final revelation of Allah and Allah knows best unus from Germany"
