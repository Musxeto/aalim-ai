  "transcript": "what's the ruling on visiting the prophet's grave as this may look like grave worshiping no it's not grave worshipping at all men men are allowed to go and visit the grave of the Prophet Alam as they are allowed to go and visit any graveyard and this was the Sunnah among the companions only if they come away from travel I om may Allah be pleased with him man with his father he was living in Medina he never he would never go to the Grave and let us rephrase it he would never go to the house of AA because the prophet was not buried in the Masjid in the beginning he was buried in his house the house of AA and so was Abu Bakr and so was Omar later on after 90 100 years the expansion of the Haram one of the uh CS included the house and it became into the Masjid so the house of AA except if he traveled and whenever he comes from travel he would go to the Chamber of AA to the uh House of AA may Allah be pleased with and never return back to it so if you come and visit the Masjid of course your travel is to visit the Masjid not to visit the grave the grave comes as uh um something that follows not an original cause so if you travel for the Masjid and praying in it and you enter it it is permissible to say assalam from because even if you are in Spain as one of the great grandchildren of the Prophet Alam saw a man putting his head near the window and offering Salam and he said my friend you and the one in andelo in Spain are the Same by greeting the prophet by offering salutation Allah has appointed an Angel and the angel would report whoever gives Salam to the prophet and he said in China in Spain in USA it and or next to the chamber to the Grave it's the same"
