  "transcript": "um I have gone through your uh lecture for the last chapter uh it's very good explanation and I understood it very well uh my request is that can you please uh upload more subsea lecture on Surah baqarah or or the whole kuramins important Surah or possible the whole Quran please okay it is one of the most if not the most noblest thing a person can devote his time for unfortunately as we get older we get lazier and unfortunately we have so many things to do and we fail big time in prioritizing our priority list I've been contemplating on making lessons of tafsir little by little but subhanallah shaytan is always there not being focused not finding the right drive to do it but I oh what I can say inshallah I'll do my best I'll try my best to maybe jump start something to do tafsir because it is by far one of the most noblest of all uh sciences that a person could leave as a legacy part of his legacy when he dies and of course all of us we're about to we're so close to dying so inshaallah make Dua that Allah gives us the enthusiasm and the drive to do some such a thing"
