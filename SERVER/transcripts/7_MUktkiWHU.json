  "transcript": "smelly rahmanir rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad and Lamine nabina muhammad in why allah alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in bardot assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh mashallah at least you are awake unlike me so as the emcee has just stated I deliberately made my lecture to be 25 to 30 minutes so that I would not be shocked so I was supposed to talk about truth being truthful and about being trustworthy so these two topics are interlinked but at the same time they are extremely important to be isolated each in a lecture of its own and when I was going through the research and I decided to talk about trust I found out that it is way too big for one lecture so instead of wasting time on an introduction we will go straight to the topic our topic our theme is I am a Muslim which means that I'd like to identify each and every one of us to be a Muslim but it is not what I wear that defines me as a Muslim it is not what I say that defines me as a Muslim Allah Azza WA JAL stated in the surah by the title of almanach upon the hypocrites in the first ayah Allah says when the hypocrites come to you and say we believe that you are the prophet of Allah and Allah acknowledges that you are the prophet of Allah but Allah acknowledges that the hypocrites are liars so it is not what you claim or advertise it is what you are that defines you so your true identity is displayed by your actions if you look at our role model sallallahu alayhi wa al he was a Lim since he was young he was known to be the truthful asada and Amin the trustworthy and he was not given the rosanna the message the Quran he was not a prophet or a messenger yet yet the people of perish the idol worshipers acknowledged this well-known fact he never lied a single lie what a track record 63 years not a single line we can't even pass 63 seconds without putting a lie either by joking or by seriously speaking father father take me with you when you're going out no no I'm going to the hospital Technik take an injection this is the easiest thing we say to our children to get them off our back the people of Quraysh used to entrust the Prophet SAW to Salaam with their wealth with the deposits with their money with their important documents even at the highest at the highest level of enmity between the idol worshippers and the prophet alaihi wa sallam they used to acknowledge that he is trustworthy Caesar of Byzantium before Abu Sufian even had accepted Islam before the conquest of Makkah Caesar called Abu Sufyan when he was in Syria in Palestine in Jordan in sham area and he asked him a clear question he said to him does he betray and Cesar said no and and Abu Sufyan said no he does not betray so she said and this is the characteristics care aesthetics character external editor added this director please cut and paste so we go back again because this is on video so this is the characteristic of all prophets and messengers of Allah social to be what to be trustworthy and never to betray subhanAllah this is a model this is a trend a believer like us tries his level best not to be among the hypocrites and the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us about the treats the characteristics of hypocrites listen to this hadith this is authentic without any doubter there are four characteristics whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite I would obey Him in a shaitana regime for things if you have them in you you are full-fledged hypocrite full-time the Prophet says alayhi salatu salam and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy until he gives it up what are these one when he's entrusted with something he betrays that trust so this is our topic too when he speaks he lies and this was supposed to be the second topic maybe next year three when he makes a covenant he breaks it and number four when he disputes he resorts to obscene speech so the first characteristics of hypocrites are betrayal of trust and lying and part of our identity is more important than how we look though how we look is essential so sometimes people go to extremes and they say this is not Islam it's true but shaving it also is not Islam it's sinful we have to strike the balance yet this is not the most important thing the most important thing is how you deal how you believe what goes into your heart how people perceive you this is important so as part of our identity we must focus on trust are we trust worthy do we betray allah azza wajal praised the believers may Allah make me and you among them when Allah says and those who are to their trusts and promises a tentative so this is what stands out in the crowd this Muslim is a believer how do you know he never betrays he always keeps his promise he always fulfilled what he was entrusted with and trust and honesty or being truthful are always connected the Prophet said allahís alot was salam there are four characteristics if you have them in you nothing of this dunya nothing in this world you miss would affect you what are these four things one safekeeping trust to trust again number two the number one safekeeping trust or a deposit number two truthfulness when you speak number three good moral conduct and manners and number four halal pure provisions and food you don't eat anything that is not challah you don't gain or make money from haram means so when we come to trust can you define what Trust is because trust here may be different elsewhere to the Muslims it's different to the non-muslims to the righteous it's different to the sinners etc so what is trust Trust has two meanings the first meaning is a wide spectrum a wide general meaning that includes everything in the Sharia everything in our religion is included in such trust and this is the consensus of all scholars that whatever Allah orders us to do whatever allah azzawajal prohibits us to do this falls under the category of a manner of trust Allah says in the Quran in the last or before the last ayah of surah al-ahzab chapter 33 allah azza wajal says indeed we offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains and they declined to bear it and feared it but man undertook to bear it indeed he was unjust and ignorant this ayah we all know her you are you all know it is Allah inaudible Aminata Alyce Emirati well Rd well Japan veña veña wash phenomena Hamada Hal insert in now kana world woman ja hula this ayah talks about a mana now the selection the choice was given to the heavens the earth and the mountains and they declined they feared it what is the choice you take it you take whatever I give to you and if you fulfill it by your choice you enter Jenna and be rewarded and if not you will be punished in hell and they did not choose it they declined while man and here man refers to Adam some people think that before we were created allah azza wajal gave us the choice and we chose and all these disbelievers come and say hey listen nobody gave me the choice I wasn't asked and the Muslims think think also I wasn't asked either so this is wrong this was not given to man kind but rather one interpretation says that it was given to Adam and Adam chose and the other interpretation says that it was instructed to Adam not given the choice so the mountains the heavens and the earth were given the choice and they declined Adam was given it without any choice and we have no choice you do well you end up in paradise you do bad stuff bananas you are in deep trouble you go to hell you'll be punished in your grave and don't ask so this is the most authentic opinion of the general wide spectrum meaning of a manna everything that Allah Azza WA JAL has told us to do falls under the category of a manna nowadays if you look at us Muslims you find that we have failed miserably in fulfilling this type of a manner big time we don't pray on time we miss out Subhan Allah prayers was given to us how many in the beginning 50 and Musa may Allah peace and blessings be upon him was giving the advice go back to your Lord ask him for reduction Allah reduces five after five after five until it's settled - what - five imagine if you were ordered to pray fifty times a day yeah every half an hour as I speak excuse me I have to pray and come back before I conclude I have to pray and come back Allah made it five only yet people insist no no no this is for you I have 20% discount fajar is not mandatory upon me and some say I have loyalty club I have 40% other is even not mandatory on Allah this is the Amanah that we have lost and I will not go into details about the cat because if Muslims paid there's the cat according to the Sharia we will not have a poor Muslim on earth but we're selective people come to me share I have a lot of money for zakat and my brother is needy can I give him from my zakat and I said define needy does he find food so yes he has three buildings renting them and he lives in a mansion but Sheikh he that he doesn't have enough expenses see the family goes to Barcelona every year for a couple of months and he cannot go except with about deeps the poor thing he should give me zakat what are you talking about so people do not pay zakat on time and if they do they do not give it to the needy they give it to their localities to the friends and so on and this this is why we're not fulfilling this a manner but I will not go into this because this is still introduction so this is the general wide spectrum meaning of a manner let's go a little bit to the more specific meaning of a manner what is actually a manner usually when we talk about a manner we refer this to one of a number of things the thing that comes into mind is saving and preserving people's documents wealth deposits whatever they give you physically so this allah refers to in the koran by saying in Namur oakum and to a dual Ammannati allah alia indeed allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due to so this is something a lot of instructs you to do it's not out of your generosity and kindness you have no choice either do it or become a hypocrite as mentioned earlier and a lot of us are manipulated by Shaitaan Shaitaan is a professional is he not if someone asks me for my CV I'll give you probably three or four pages and six or seven pages of the courses I had done in my long life and hamdulillah but if you ask Shaitaan for his CV he has experienced since Adam that one we know of we don't know before so you can imagine how many people he managed to pull their legs into hell he knows exactly how you think he knows exactly how I think and that is why a lot of us are messed around by Shaitaan so whenever someone interesting trusts me with an Amana I can find a number of different ways to betray this and still go to bed and sleep with a good conscience so panel how is that a lot of us when I deal with you in business so you're my partner whenever I find it appropriate and I get the chance I will cheat you I will betray you because you are my partner why if someone asked me I said couple years ago he did the same from the funds of the company he took a business class ticket to a destination not for business so now it's my chance and my turn to get even subhanAllah the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said amana eliminate demonic give or do your trust to who entrusted you you have to pay it back and do not betray whoever betrays you this is the Muslims identity so I give you a loan of ten thousand reals you don't repay it and you say I didn't take anything from you and then I can take this much or more from an indirect way the vast majority say that this is Haram because you are betraying your trust so he will be questioned on the day of judgment and Allah will punish him and Allah will compensate you but what will you do for betraying him you will have to be punished for that as well and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did that practically the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam managed to give us the role models' example of how to deal even when the idol worshippers of Quraysh were plotting to kill him to assassinate him they still kept their money with him in his house he was entrusted with the deposit so on the night where he had to migrate secretly to Medina anyone of us what would what would you have done I would have taken all the money and became a businessman in Medina and and I would have given to myself many excuses such as I will utilize the money of the kafir to build a Muslim state in Medina I will feed the orphans I will help the immigrants I will do this but this is not what the Prophet did erase autosum what did he do he left his cousin Ali behind so that he would give the people their trusts their deposits their money until everything was settled until the account of the Prophet isin was zero then he can migrate to Medina now some would claim to say that okay such trust is found with the disbelievers some may go a little bit further when he says that some disbelievers are more trustworthy than the Muslims and this can be but it is not the general trend the disbelievers can have honesty in them can be truthful can be entrusted but not the majority the things we see is due to the fact that they understood the market and they found out and figured out that the more trustworthy you are the better it is for business so you go and deal with this this believer and give him money and trust him you don't have any papers or documents because he will pay it back to you and he will fulfill his terms and conditions of contract he knows this is good for business for example the disbelievers in America you buy something and they give you a month trial period money back guaranteed do muslims do this if muslims do this they will be bankrupt the second week why we will take everything use it for 29 days and send it back give us our money back and then buy another thing and on and on and on what this is not all Muslims don't get me wrong but unfortunately when we are not abiding by the Quran in the Sunnah this is how we deal the kafirs don't do this they buy it they like it they keep it so they know it's good for business once you give them a pterence that in 30 days if you don't like it money-back guarantee it people trust you unfortunately the Muslims who should be more trusted and not doing this on the contrary they are betraying so don't get the wrong idea not all disbelievers are trustworthy Allah says this in the quran allah azza wajal says and among the people of the scripture jews and christians is he who if you entrust him with a great amount of wealth he will return it to you so even if you give him millions he will give it back allah says this shift subhanAllah Allah Azza WA JAL is not bias Allah is fair and just not like us all kaffir are criminals and cheaters and like who said so Allah as usual is telling us that among the disbelievers are people of fairness our people of being of trustworthy if you entrust them with a great fortune they will return it back to you and among them is he who if you entrust him with a dinner coin he will not return it to you unless you are consistently standing over him demanding it so be fair Allah is teaching us the early Muslims spread Islam to countries like here like Europe like America like Indonesia like Malaysia Indonesia about hundred and fifty million two hundred fifty million I lost count not a single soldier went there who went there merchants from Yemen from Hub remote went there to buy and sell but through their trustworthiness their honesty they never cheat they fulfill their promises people liked this religion and embraced it and became Muslims so this is one aspect of the private or the specific meaning of a manna unlike the big wide spectrum meaning to safe keep deposits and return it among the other meanings is keeping people's secrets so you come to me you say forgive me Father for I have sinned you're in the wrong place that you want the church you come to me sachet I made sins I have problems I have this you sit and speak to me you know I will not leak what you have said to me not even to the closest friend or wife of mine because this is an Amana the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whenever a Muslim speaks and then looks around what does that mean so if someone is speaking to you one to one and he says Sheikh do you know this means it is an Amana you should be entrusted with as long as he looked right and left as the Prophet said Allah so Salaam this is a secret you cannot disclose this look at our gatherings today when we gather in the messages committee or when we gathers in the office with the other Muslims all what we do is chit-chatting and we speak as if there is no tariff on speaking not knowing that whatever we otter is being written and we will be held accountable on the day of judgment some of us even go a bit further when trying to East drop on people's secrets so many times we are talking privately and another third person comes and sits with a big smile what are you doing just benefiting invited you to begin with just none of this knowledge shake we'd like yeah I get the heck out of here leave this is not permissible the Prophet said alehissalaam for those who is drop whoever listens to folks talking while they dislike him listening to them on the day of judgment melted liquid lead will be poured into his ear imagine what is the melting point in centigrades or Ferren forever and you know you know what I mean I didn't stay studied science is a lot so Fahrenheit how hot it is for you to listen to someone who doesn't want you to listen to what he's saying so this kind of secrets are imported it's part of my identity to sit in a gathering and brag i sat will share so-and-so and he said that the government is corrupt what will the government do to the Sheikh what she is already behind bars oh sorry yeah my bad too late you go and speak to someone's wife your husband said so-and-so and so-and-so and they get divorced and this is very common nowadays among the Muslims that chitchat concealing secrets is part of being trustworthy imagine when half saw the daughter of Omar when her husband died now Rama is someone of great trust Allah entrusted him with this daughter he doesn't leave her unattended he looks for a good husband so he goes to earth man an earth man's wife just recently died so he said as man you're my friend what do you think of marrying Hafsah so he took couple of days and came back said I'm still depressed I don't feel like getting married now so he moved on and he approached me puh huh Abu Bakr he went to Abu Bakr and said abu bakr you're my best friend what about marrying hamsa what do you think Abu Bakr did not even respond to him he did not say yes or no Omar said well why I felt so bad more bad than worse than I felt when Earthman rejected it at least he rejected this one he did not even speak few days or weeks later the Prophet erase thoughts and proposed to have Sun and then Abu Bakr came Sandra Marcum I hope you didn't feel bad when I did not reply to you Ramar said well no I felt bad seriously I felt very bad he said by Allah I heard the Prophet erase awesome mentioning have some meaning that he's interested in marrying her had he not married her wallahi I would have married her so look at this best friend concealing the secret of his best friend Muhammad sallallaahu Selim in order though it would have eased and comforted his other best friend Omar because he was trustworthy may Allah be pleased with him an assembly Malik who was about 10 to 12 years of age was approached by the Prophet SM because he was his servant so the Prophet instructed him and sent him on an errand and waited in the shade for him to come back it so happened that this was the time that anis usually goes to his mother and does what she asks him to do sit with her chitchat it's a quality time designated for his mom but he missed it so when he came later to the - to his mother she said where were you why didn't you come on time he said I was sent on an errand by the Prophet is salaam so the natural question would be what was it now this youngster if he was not following the Muslim identity he would have spelled it all out part of gaining praise was his mom Oh masha'Allah you did something for the Prophet showing his importance flexing his muscles this youngster who was raised by the prophet alayhi salatu salam halted and said to his mom mother this is a secret what did the mother do spanked him on the face prohibited ice cream after dinner no she said son if it's a secret never disclose it to a living soul this is terbium this is how we bring our children up not by asking them to spy on their brothers and sisters and to leak secrets and to do this and to do that this is wrong strategy Ana's says to his student as he is narrating the hadith he said Babbitt by Allah he's in his 80s now if I had told the sold a soul I would have told you but I did not since 60 or 70 or 80 years not a soul was told about this secret so part of this sort of a specific amana is responsibilities it falls under your amana specifically the government posts and the public positions so the ruler the king the president the Prime Minister the governor they are all entrusted with a great amana the legislators the justices that the judges the CEO in a company the general manager the supervisor the director all of these responsibilities are class fine as a manner and it is serious the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam was sitting once with his companions a man come a man comes and says o prophet of Allah when is the hour when is the day of judgement so the prophet said that is salat wa salam replied whenever Trust is lost then anticipate and wait for the hour so the man wanted more elaboration instead o prophet of Allah how is a manner lost so the Prophet said that a salat wa salam whenever positions are appointed to those who are not worthy of it anticipate the hour let us look at the Muslim world in general all those in power worthy of being in power definitely not definitely not why because we can see that our Muslim Ummah is deteriorating the responsibility falls upon us but we are only the flock our Shepherds are responsible and they will be held questionable on the day of judgment the vast majority of us if given the choice we will step forward to assume a public position is it not correct if someone comes and says whoever wants to be the governor of Nairobi raise your hands the vast majority would praise those who do not raise are looking for being president unfortunately yet this is an Amana you should dodge it whenever it comes to you you should not pursue it you should not go after it why Subhan Allah do you know a Buddha Allah fiery everyone says yes what do you know about him is a great companion of as I said may Allah be pleased with them abuzer Allah fiery is one of five maybe 10 first to accept Islam maybe less maybe a little bit more and he accepted Islam at the very early stages of Islam which means that he has a lot of credit to him he's among the very big first to embrace Islam he comes to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and it is o prophet of allah employ me meaning appoint me as one of your governors to rule a region to go and collect zakat to be a government official where i can you know show the badge he said the prophet struck me on my shoulder either his salat wa salam and said abu dharr you are weak and this meaning the government post no no this is not true 15 seriously I don't read English as usually and my main notes are in Arabic so I'm doing it from an Arabic notes dealer so Abu Dharr he said this is your week you can't handle the position and this position is a manor is something to be entrusted with however on the day of judgment it's a disgrace and means of being regretful because you will be accounted for everything you do except to those who take it lawfully and fulfill their duties in it seriously if you go to graveyards do you have graveyards here close by if you just visit wallahi you will see hundreds maybe thousands of politicians of governors of rulers or of government officials all buried where is their wealth and power where is what they were entrusted with and betrayed all gone and nothing remains except their graves basically speaking in order to be entrusted with a public post or a managerial position you have to have two things in you you have to be professional knowledgeable capable and you have to be trustworthy the woman who saw Musa water the Sheep which spoke about this yesterday one of them went to her father and said Oh father oh my father hire him indeed the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy so whenever you want to appoint someone to run your business he has to be strong not physically meaning that he's capable of running the business he's professional he knows the ins and outs of the business but he must as well he trustworthy someone with righteousness he fears Allah he would not cheat etc so in the remaining moments we have to follow hey this is problematic people say yes every time you say they said you don't have anything written but by part of the specific meaning of Amana is when you trade when you sell and when you buy the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam about those two dealing in commerce buying and selling if they say the truth and if they clarify if there are defects in what they're selling Allah will bless their deal and if they lie and they conceal Allah will take the blessing of their commerce nowadays the best trader is the one who cheats who lies who conceals the defects in what he's selling anything that he's smart the Prophet Elias awesome once passed by a pile of food wheat grain and it looks nice so he liked it but he inserted his hand into this pile and then found wetness and you know that wetness spoils the grain so the Prophet said owner of the shop what is this he said Oh prophet of Allah last night it rained so when it rained what was on top got wet so I turned it over and the dry part was above the prophesied subhanAllah why didn't you keep the wet part on top so that people could see what was wrong with it whoever cheats us is not from among us whoever cheats the Muslims is not from them and how many of us cheat big-time by the way this was not the trend at the time of the Prophet Alice a lot Sturm and those who were before him they used to you with Amana and there is an example but then this would take time part of the interpretation of this specific type of amana is excelling and perfecting your walk your work your duties how many of the Muslims come to their workplace late and leave early how many of the Muslims sign their names at 7 o'clock a.m. well actually they came at 9 or 10 o'clock and leave at 4 when they leave after Lahore how many of the Muslims when it's wartime instead of taking 10 minutes they take an hour and a half what are you doing bring Zuma said no no I have to make the van and then clean the message it and pray the Sunnah for raka then the fort for rock are then too soon then 2 afterwards and then turn off the fans and wait until ever why are you the Masjid keeper no but it's boring in the mess in the office this is a manner you are entrusted with and you are betraying it the Prophet said at least I'm not going to talk about what we do in our working hours so our working hours is 8 hours we spend the first couple of hours having breakfast then reading the newspapers and checking the emails and the Facebook and the Twitter for the other two hours and then we do some work for half an hour in Salah and then we come back and we get the kids from the from the school and just half an hour before the end of the day we prepare ourselves for lunch what kind of work is this the Prophet says alayhi salatu salam Allah loves it when some of you performs or does his job to perfect it why is it that the products of the Muslims are always at the bottom of the line when you buy is a German good is it European excellent secondly is it Japanese Mumtaz then is it Indonesia and Thai then is it Chinese then is it Muslim they don't even say the country they just say the religion Muslims keep it away we have a problem and this is a bigger topic which is quality versus quantity we believe in the masses the more we have masha'Allah Islam is strong when we say assalamu alaikom you say masha'Allah I want the whole to shake them much they raise their voices and they will shake then what this is not what Islam focuses on Islam focuses on quality not quantity the Prophet said that is awesome if you pray to raka without thinking of worldly matters Allah will forgive all of your previous sins while he told us about the how our age nicest and the likes he told us that they pray until you feel ashamed of your own prayer but their prayer is in vain so two rakahs quantity better than thousands of Records in quality but this is a different topic where are we babe it is a great responsibility upon each and every one of us that we will be held accountable on the day of judgment when it comes to our spouses when it comes to our children how they how we raise them up and the Prophet array salat WA Salam emphasized this unfortunately if you look at us as Muslims if you tell or if you analyze any one of us as Muslims you will find that many of us claim to be Muslims claim to carry the identity of a Muslim but we lie we cheat we stop people in the back we break promises we use obscene language and we transgress when we fight and we betray trust the vast majority of us and if someone comes to me and say you are a hypocrite I feel outraged and I'm filled with rage and anger but why I am a full-fledged hypocrite by this definition this is not normal the way we treat our spouses and children is a responsibility is a trust that allah azzawajal would asks us about how many of us give their daughters to someone from our own tribe from our own sect from our own race though they don't pray though they are not good Muslims were practicing Muslim but they are rich they have a good job the Prophet says Ali Saleh to Sam there is no person to whom Allah has given people to take care of and he fails to take care of them properly but he will not smell the fragrance of paradise or who do billahi min ash-shaytani r-rajim if I don't take care of my children of my spouse whom allah azzawajal has entrusted me with i will not find the smell and the fragrance of paradise the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam in conclusion before the guy comes and hits me he's writing them times out if you don't come out we will pull you out racist anyhow the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam the first thing you lose from your religion there is Islam is trust authentic hadith the first thing you lose from your religion from your Islam is trust the first and he says then in the second statement and the first thing to uplift it to be uplifted from this world is trust Amana and the last thing that remains from your religion is a solid and people are not doing this which means that we've lost trust it was uplifted and people are not performing salat as it's supposed to be and the Prophet said Alistair and so many though of those who pray have no share have no benefit of it on the day of judgment may allah azzawajal protect us and preservers finally got you see finally the issue of trust is not a trivial issue it's not a commodity an accessory something that I think I will try this trust for couple of weeks it looks nice it's trendy no this is part of your identity without it you're not a Muslim a proper Muslim you will not find a proper Muslim cheating you will not find a proper Muslim lying you will not find a proper Muslim betraying the trust that he is given this is why if we benefit from this blessed conference that we go back to our children and we trust them and we ask them to be trusted and to fulfill the duty given to them if we succeed in making our homes a place where trust is mutual I don't have to go and spy on my boys mobile or internet I don't have to go and check the history of my spouse on the browser of the Internet to see if there is something wrong or not because there is mutual trust our home is built and based on Islamic teachings truly if we succeed in doing this insha'Allah insha'Allah we will be among those who dwell in jannat in name Heather wahoo Harlem when it's virtual real me alayhi assalam was all allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in i am blessed seriously the MC tells me that there's a sister who wants to embrace Islam I'm lucky I have to admit I was in Malaysia yes yes last week last weekend what's today Sunday on Thursday I gave a lecture in the university of madeira international a blessed University and there was this Italian brother who came all the way from Italy to ask questions he could not find answers to and he said if you managed inshallah I have no hesitation he asked six or seven questions and allah azzawajal blessed me to answer them easy questions all of you could have answered it but he had problems of trust and he accepted Islam and masha'Allah Tabarrok Allah the second day he came to visit me in the hotel and the transformation was strange the guy changed over 24 hours you can see that he's at peace of mind I'm gonna take much time because this is over time he was so relaxed relieved because this is what Islam is all about it is not something that you take up just for the heck of it it's a way of life your parents would notice the difference in how you treat them well much better than before your neighbors your spouse your children your colleagues when you sit and remember Allah and acknowledge the benefits and the favours and blessings he bestowed upon you you are the happiest person to walk the earth just to see all those favors and blessings upon you so the sister I believe that she has a mic insha'Allah nobody has forced you to accept Islam this is a disclaimer and so that they won't hold me up sister and Shana nobody has forced you to accept Islam she said no al hamdulillah so repeat behind me in sha allah what i'm going to teach you in arabic is known as the Shahada and it is a declaration of faith where you say and believe i bear witness that there is no god worthy of being worshipped except allah and that muhammad sallallahu wasallam is his servant and messenger this is the translation of what you will be repeating in arabic do you want me to repeat it in english or you understand it repeat okay the translation is I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger and servant now you will repeat behind me in Arabic what I say and you will be a Muslim after you finish it insha'Allah so you say a shadow allah allah wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhu what a solo Allah you have become a Muslim welcome sister to a great nation of 1.7 billion plus 1 so alhamdulillah Allah may Allah subhana WA Ta'ala bless you and bless the sisters who have guided you and I urge the sisters to take care of her to call her to give her assistance wherever she needs and to teach her how to pray was allah llahu salam ala nabina muhammad thank you [Music] [Music]"
