  "transcript": "chance my question is sheikh if i miss any rokon in a salah uh if my whole salah invalid or that particular raqqa or indian in in case of congregation after completing masala with the congregation as i have mr rukon and i have to fill the rook on do i have to again do the sahu okay so we are talking about a follower mum who's praying in jama in congregation and he missed one of the pillars of salat now he's following an imam so let's assume it's prayer he did not recite the fatih in the first rakah and he realized this afterwards after the second raqqa third raka or whatever after the imam concludes the prayer with salam this particular individual's first rakah was invalid which makes his second third and fourth raka with the imam to be actually his first second and third therefore after the imam concludes the prayer he stands up and prays his fourth rakah and before concluding the prayer or afterwards he has to offer to sujud of asahu preferably after the salaam because he added something that was not supposed to be added which is the correction of his missed invalid first rakah which is actually the fifth raka and allah knows best"
