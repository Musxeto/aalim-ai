  "transcript": "from Saudi Arabia says that the issue of Islamic Banking and he has a bank account it's a saving bank account in an Islamic Bank and every month they deposit some interest and he says that this is like riba and the answer is no this is not like RBA if the bank is Islamic it has a Shar board and it has a committee that overlooks and audits all the work of the bank to check and spot check whether it's Islamic or not then whatever they give you in your saving account is insh halal because they take the money that people have deposited and they build buildings and they buy Commodities and they sell and they have transactions and whatever profit they have they share it with those who have saving account and this is Allah providing that they are an Islamic Bank"
