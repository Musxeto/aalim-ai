  "title": "Very fast imam, says sami Allah huliman..when he stands up, Prayer behind him valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in the I pray the IM um he's very fast when it comes to going for a pool and rising up and when you know when he rises up after he reaches the position of then he says and then he goes down and we are still Rising is our Sal behind is valid the Salat is valid because saying when he's erect is wrong but this does not impact the validity of the Salat it's still valid inshallah now his speed is questionable if his speed does not allow you to say subh or subh once in or in in this case the prayer behind him is not valid and you should look for someone else to pray behind or if there is no one else then you should pray in your home and collect as many of your uh woman folk or even men to pray with you in congregation but you have to ask those around you whether what you are assuming is correct or maybe it's only your own uh uh whims and desires maybe the guy is prayer is normal so I hope this answers your question"
