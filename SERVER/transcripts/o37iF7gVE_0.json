  "transcript": "that I want to ask if a woman took a soul Thursday night without intention of Jummah so the next day can she go to the mosque and perform Juma prayer bent Farouk's question has a number of issues the first issue is eight obligatory upon a woman to attend the Friday sermon the Friday prayer salat on June 1 and the answer to that is no it's not mandatory is it recommended the answer is no it's not recommended the Prophet Ison exempted a number of people from attending Friday khutba and among them was the women so it is best for them to pray at home but if she has this urge to go and listen to the hotbar and attend the prayer this is totally permissible no problem the second issue is regarding the rustle of Juma which is the total bath a person takes before drama and it's an issue of dispute among scholars for men they differ some say it's mandatory some say it is recommended and some say it is mandatory in cases and recommended in the rest and Allah knows best this is the most authentic opinion that it is recommended in most cases but it becomes mandatory and obligatory when a person has an odor as in the hadith of Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the people of Medina were people of farming of cultivating the land and they were laborers so they had only one garment and usually it was made of wool and they had the whole garment for of a full week so when it was time for salat l-jamaa they used to go to the masjid and they had an odor to it and it smelled badly so each one of them was not at ease with the smell of his brother let alone with the smell of himself so the Prophet obliged upon them that it is mandatory and it's a right upon each one of you to touch his body with water once a week but then when things got better handler and the reason which is the odor has gone then the ruling differed and it is recommended to perform muscle but it's not mandatory and the third and last issue is when is it to be performed the majority of scholars say that it should be performed after the failure of Juma doing it Friday night to those who say it's an obligation they say it was not done on the day of Friday and alhamdulillah as we have stated earlier that it is highly recommended and not mandatory in this case if you do it Thursday night in this case inshallah this would do the job"
