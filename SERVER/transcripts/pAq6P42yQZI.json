  "title": "Government grant given to school owner, can she take it for personal use? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "for example my mother she had school she established a school maybe like 10 years ago and uh now she receives uh grants from the government here in the us she receives it in islamic school she receives grants from the government for uh for this basically the grant is for learning purposes so she can buy anything that's for learning purposes for the school so any learning equipment so for example she tries to buy a grill and it won't work because that's obviously enough for uh learning uh purposes um so she's the school is hers basically is insane family business but the grants for the school for learning purposes so if she buys for example a pair of headphones and the the grant is accepted for basically they they allow the grant to be used for a pair of headphones if the pair can she give me the pair of headphones or should i buy it from the school so the question is when the government gives you this grant because you are the owner of a particular school does the government restrict you from using this money for any purposes other than the school or they just give you the grant and they tell you it's yours you can do with it whatever you wish no no no no they they basically the way even you order is basically you have to tell them you have to give them a list of items and then they have to approve that list of items okay in this case in this case it is a surely and certainly conditional grant so the grant is only restricted to be used for the school and hence your mother cannot use the money to buy personal things when she buys headsets or headphones and she gives it to you this is for personal use if she buys a black stone grill to do barbecue in her back backyard this is not for the school but she's using the money to do this this is again haram and it's not permissible for her to do that and i hope this answers your question"
