  "transcript": "what is the purpose of the permission sought from the husband when a wife wants to fast a voluntary day why would why must she seek the permission the answer is very simple because the Prophet said early Soloff sir it is not permissible for a woman to fast while her husband is present without his permission . now this is what the Prophet ordered us Ali salatu salam he did not say the reason mother aisha explained something similar to that she says i used to delay making up my missed days of ramadan till the following Shaban that is ten or eleven months later why because of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam status of me meaning that he may come one day and call her for intimacy during the daytime and if she was making up a missed day of Ramadan we all know that it is not permissible for her to break it so she used to delay it until it was the last moment and there's no other way for her to delay it any further so she used to do that which caused some scholars to say that seeking the permission of the husband too fast voluntary days is for that reason what reason is that it is to give the husband leverage that whenever he wants to have intimacy with his wife his wife would be ready for him and this is something that is highly praised in Islam even if the wife was cooking or engaging in shores of the home and the husband calls her to intimacy it is a must for her to leave everything and respond to her husband and if she fails to do that if she does not do that the Prophet told us a little Assam that if her husband calls her and she refuses the Angels was would curse her all night long until such time so this is not something to be taken lightly a woman must be really careful in taking care of her husband's needs of her and this is why the Prophet as Sam and Allah knows best ordered a woman to seek his permission if he is travelling there's no need to do that because this can't be held against her so if he's travelling in another city she can fast without informing him without any problem because the Prophet said while he is present and if he's not present then there's no problem in that"
