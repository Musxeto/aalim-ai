  "transcript": "sheikh i have a question uh for me as a 16 year old i'm still dependent on my my mom living with her she has a store and she sells haram things she buys her things for it so if i for example if she tells me to do something and i don't say no mom this is like she already knows this haram and everything if i don't say like if i say no then she might be angry she might tell my stepdad to do something or you know it might be hard for me because you live with this person every day you can't just go away or something so can i obey her while hitting it in my heart if the switch exists first of all your mom's income in this store whether she sells alcohol or haram items in islam the sin is upon her the income is haram for her when she takes the income and she buys food or she pays for your tuition or she buys you clothes or she pays a rent or she gives you pocket money all of this is halal for you there's no problem in that the second part of the question is if she orders you to help her in selling these haram things like loading and offloading a the merchandise carrying boxes of beer or of of of whiskey um serving haram food doing the calculation and the accounting part of the income assisting her in running that shop this is haram and it's not permissible she may get angry let it be it's best to get your mom and your stepdad angry rather than getting allah to be angry from you because you don't want to participate in their sin and allah knows best"
