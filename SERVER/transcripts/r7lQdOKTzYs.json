  "title": "Is it wise to send my son to study in a Non Muslim Country? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says my son holds a Canadian passport or my sons they hold Canadian passports they have many advantages if they study there rather than in the Middle East like better jobs better education etc as a mother I'm afraid to send them as their Dean their religion their religious commitment is not firm enough yet but they really want to go and my husband wants them to go as well kindly guard I personally would not advise you to send them unattended life for those who were brought up in the Middle East when they're exposed to fitna temptation everything is free everything you can do whatever you want in these non-muslim countries it is dangerous you cannot ask someone who is in his teens who's full of energy to sit and lower his gaze 24/7 he may manage to do that for the first couple of weeks but then everything in class at the campus at the dormitory everything around him calls him for fitna and the more conservative you are the greater the fitna is every single week um we have a party Friday night we have a party Saturday night we have doing this we're going out with and temptation is there being alone is even more dangerous so I I hear you and I feel what you are talking about I would not advise you to do this but unfortunately it's not always paved with roses so they have to go and study somewhere and where they when you are where you are residing most likely they will not get a seat or a chance so a win-win situation would be get them married and let them go with their wives or if you can go with them live with them monitor them as you do here and inshallah Allah would save them and protect him"
