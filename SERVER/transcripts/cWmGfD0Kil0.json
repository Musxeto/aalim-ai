  "title": "Is rakah valid (even without reciting fatiha) if you catch ruku with the imam #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is when uh somebody is uh like we know the Hadith where the prophet he say that there is no prayer without the F but if a brother enters the Mas how do we explain to him that if you catch the with the IM you caught theat maybe he's going to say I did not recite I didn't recite the how I catch but he did when he did the the prophet as per the Hadith of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him he said do not recite behind the IM anything except the fa and Abu Hur said and after some time the people were denied from that meaning that even the fa do not recite it behind the Imam and the recitation of the fa in silent Ras is a pillar so you have to recite it in silent raak whether you a im or a follower or someone praying alone silent ra you have to pray it or or off recite it if you don't your prayer is invalid because it's a pillar in loud raas like the first two of and and the two of f it is an issue of dispute and some Scholars like Imam bukari say that it is a pillar and you must say it and if you don't say it your prayer is invalid others like Imam Abu hanifah say no you must not recite it at all and IB T may Allah have mercy on his soul took the opinion of Imam malic which states that if the Imam recites it in loud prayers that is sufficient for the follower but if he's praying alone or he's an Imam it's a pillar for him but not a pillar for the follower when the the raak is loud when the recitation of the fat is loud so if the follower comes in a silent raak and the Imam goes for R before he joins the Salat there is a Hadith where a man came in to the Masjid where the Prophet was in so the man did not catch up the first ra so from the doors he said allahar Allah abbar he did R and walked in the ru position until he stood up in the Raw After the prayer was over the prophet said who did this the man said I the prophet said may Allah increase you in being steadfast and careful careful but don't do that again meaning don't do r at the gate and walk in a r position doesn't look good and it's not part of the Sunnah and the prophet did not say to him repeat your from this Hadith Scholars understood that if a person finds the Imam in the ru position or is unable to complete the faat because the moment he joined the Salat when the Imam was standing up the Imam actually has finished everything he recited so he said Allah and the man immediately goes forb I don't have time to recite the fat so now I'm risking lose the r or lose the faat the scholars say lose the faat because you have a concession you have permission from the Shar to join the IM and you're Exempted from reciting the fa and I hope this answers your question"
