  "title": "Can we borrow money or take gift from someone who works in bank or has haram income? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is is it permissible to borrow money from a person who works in a bank so borrowing money is permissible regardless of the source of this money you see if I have a $10 bank note this $10 bank note is not NIS it's not impure it's not by itself something that has to be cleansed it depends where how it was earned so if I work in selling drugs may Allah forbid or in dealing with riba and I get this bank note and I give it to someone I'm sinful for earning it from Haram sources but when I give it to someone in halal means which is giving lending buying things of him to that individual it is halal so if you borrow from someone who deals in riba such as people who work in Banks what you borrow is halal for you and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam before he died borrow from a Jew and he pawned his own Shield or uh um his own armor in exchange for this amount of barley he borrowed from the Jew when we know that the Jews depend entirely on extortion embezzlement and RBA yet when we borrow from them this is halal for us and Haram for them and Allah Knows Best"
