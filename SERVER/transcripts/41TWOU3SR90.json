  "transcript": "Oh what you know the brothers and sisters divided on the sooner he gay he be screaming after no more Amish well Senor to play assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh to welcome to another episode of contemporary islamic issues and concepts anjada TV i'm your host arkham machine in this episode we will discuss the importance of seeking knowledge in islam is it compulsory upon everybody and what does that mean in our society today so let's start off by welcoming and introducing our wonderful guest chef awesome at hacking my cinematic when welcome to the show while you canceled on what I have to like it what occurred was a cool effect well here I come chef it's always wonderful having these short conversations with you so today's topic inshallah is the importance of seeking knowledge in Islam many times you hear the hottie or many Muslim scholars various scholars from different backgrounds different areas different countries they all agree that in Islam Muslims have to seek knowledge so why is this aspect important in Islam why is it that a las ratas emphasized seeking knowledge for us sooner of mana Wahine al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen was all along was a limo barkhad Abdi who are also leaving I mean nabina muhammad in water al ajillo sorry Audrina and my bad knowledge is the essence of everything you do and without going into the definition of knowledge that is praised by the Quran and the Sunnah without knowledge you are unable to act and do what you want to do properly and you can relate to this this easily by buying something and working on it or using it without referring to the manual the user's manual usually this would lead to maybe you can't do something here or there but eventually you're going to bust the whole thing because you did not properly gain the knowledge on how to use it so knowledge is important and no one in his saying mind would tell you that no I can behave and act without knowledge so a doctor without knowledge is not a doctor an engineer without knowledge is not an engineer a Muslim without proper knowledge is not a real practicing Muslim so knowledge is highly emphasized upon in Islam and if you recall what is the first instruction what is the first revelation what is the first word that Allah has revealed to his messenger salah salem it aura which means beside or read so there is great emphasis in Islam on acquiring knowledge very interesting and who this emphasis on is it every single Muslim is it a certain group like the LMI the scholars who is this for see again if we we go a bit back what kind of knowledge are we talking about and you said that it is mandatory upon every Muslim and muslimah to seek knowledge as the hadith states what knowledge are we talking about so you have to define which type centuries so let's start with let's start with religious knowledge and then we'll get into secular education secular knowledge so religious knowledge who is it compulsory for is it for everybody or just altima ok such mandatory knowledge is divided in two types there is mandatory obligatory knowledge upon each and every individual and there is knowledge that is a communal obligation as they say so what is mandatory upon you and me if it's mandatory upon you and me to understand the meaning of Lila hi Lala so if someone says like I had a la without conviction what do we call him a hypocrite alonzo gel mentioned in surah munaf a keen yo J Ackerman hace una pero un asado in naked ro son una hola Alamo en una carrera solo habla hoy asado en el munis o tiene la que deben a prophet of Allah when the hypocrites come to you and say we testified that you are the messenger of allah and allah knows that you are his messenger but Allah testifies that they are liars which means that saying it without conviction does not do the job therefore there is an obligation upon every Muslim to know the meaning of la la la la the meaning of muhammad is the messenger of allah azzawajal there's an obligation upon every Muslim to know the things that his Islam would not be valid without so if someone is a Muslim but does not know how to pray we do not tell him take your time sit back relax untie your shoes feel free no this is an obligation you immediately have to learn how to pray new reverts learn how to pray but say we don't know how to say the fatty huh we can't memorize it this is an obligation upon you work as hard as possible to learn it because this is not something that is ok do your best no you have to someone who has wealth and money and he has to pay the cat so it's mandatory upon him to learn how to give the cat and when and what is the threshold it is not sufficient for him to say I know it's obligatory but I don't know the rulings on you you must learn it tomorrow is Ramadan so you are instructed to know how to fast what breaks your fast the things you do and the things you must not do so this is an obligation upon every individual on the other side there are certain types of information and Sciences of Islam that are not obligated upon you and I for example someone who is stone broke is not mandatory for him to go and learn the rulings of zakat or the rulings on transactions he never goes to the market he never does any kind of transactions so why should he learn however there has to be a specific group or set of people who know this science inside out okay so let's actually divide this into two parts and let's speak about religious education and non religious education or secular education so should refer you to start us off with the religious education aspect ok now the scholars say that the religious education is also divided into two types obligatory type and what is known as help cafea or communal obligation so what is the mandatory obligatory type it is defined as the type that no Muslim would practice Islam without knowing it so at the very basics when someone says la illaha in the law we have to know whether he knows the implication of la illaha or not because without the proper knowledge his testimony would be in vain like the hypocrites who say la la la la but intense something totally opposed opposing it and with their hearts imagine someone saying lagta hai la la and going to the graveyard slaughtering for the deceased and/or there earlier or peers worshipping them frustrating to them asking them for benefits and to protect him from harm this is major shirt so his lack of knowledge of la la la la led him to this so it is obligatory upon him to know in this specific area likewise and you revert he doesn't know how to pray if you don't take your time and Charlotte you learn next year maybe in the year after it is an obligation upon you to learn it now how to recite the fatty huh now we don't tell you memorize the whole Quran that'll be a good thing but it is not to be attained immediately what you have to learn immediately is the fatty huh you have to learn how to say subhanAllah be allowed in record subhan allah by allah institute these aren't the type of things that you're a bad your worship to Allah would not be accepted without so it's mandatory upon you and so is the rest of knowledge pertaining to Sharia to to Islam which is required for your forms of worship to be accepted by Allah on the other hand there is information that is not required now but might be required later may not be required for you but may be required for others for example a poor person he's Muslim and we know that Zika is a pillar of Islam for him to gain knowledge about Zika is not important it's not mandatory because the guy does not have the money the wealth or the threshold to pay zakah so why bother at the moment go get him and yeah but if he learns it then this is a plus but he's not obliged to do it likewise someone who does not trade who does not buy and sell so we tell him it's not manager for you to learn sciences such as the signs of alpha il the inheritance and how to divide the wealth of the deceased is not managing upon you and me to know what's the percentage this gets 16 or one-third half of quarter 18 etc it's not mandatory for him to learn this so who is it mandatory upon it is mandatory upon a portion of the Muslims because it's a faulty fire it is a communal obligation if one of the Muslims learn it then they're all exempted from punishment but if none of the Muslims learn it then they are all punished for failing to fulfill this okay so that that in terms of the Islamic aspect just a recap basically you said that even this is divided into two portions aspects of Education that are required for every single Muslim to learn and aspects that are communal meaning at least a group of Muslims from the Muslim should learn these this sort of education in this sort of knowledge now how about in terms of non religious education you know who has to learn this is this all does this also fall under the obligation in the hadith of the Prophet allah salam or is this exempted from this honey the vast majority of scholars say that the evidences in the quran and in the Sunnah praising knowledge refers to islamic knowledge so when Allah says Allah Allahu latina a maloom income well Idina o2l daljit a lot so jeal elevates and raises the status of those who believed among you and those whom have been given knowledge so what is this is so a PhD holder and physics is considered to be part of this ayah scholars say no the knowledge is praised is the knowledge of islamic sciences that gets you closer to a logical and we will get to explain or elaborate upon this issue a little bit further down the line allah says in Nemea shala hominid body hanauma verily only the scholars among other servants fear him truly but again the fear is associated with knowledge what kind of knowledge Islamic knowledge so even if we have a Muslim scholar who does not have the fear in Lazo not a scholar he has knowledge also you have the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam of praising the students of knowledge and those who strive to seek knowledge in how allah azzawajal elevates their status and the whales in the sea the angels in the heavens all seek a lot forgiveness for that seeker of knowledge this is all relating to Islamic knowledge now when we come to none islamic knowledge we do not say that this is bad or this is worthless we say that this is good depending on your intention and depending on the benefits you provide for the muslim ummah and why do we say the benefits because non-islamic knowledge or if you may say the secular knowledge or maybe i better terminology would be the worldly knowledge because when you say secular means that it's against islam in the western a way of thinking so physics chemistry biology geology these Sciences are not seculars in the sense that they oppose Islam they are worldly sciences the majority of it goes side by side with Islam because Islam does not oppose such Sciences as was the case with the early church going against science and this is what caused the drift till today between science and religion their church said everything you say is considered to be covered and such disbelief is intolerable and they used to execute scientists who spoke about the world being ground or about gravity or about any of the things that they the priests thought that went against the Bible now so basically what I understand is that worldly knowledge as you turned it is not against Islam and you're going to explain about whether or not it would depend completely on your intention but before you actually answer that we're going to go for a short break controller so dear viewer stay tuned soon as we come back from this short break sahasam will explain to us what he means when he said that worldly knowledge will depend on your intention so stay tuned if you commercials welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were discussing the importance of seeking knowledge and the Sheikh had categorized it for us very accidentally ship now we were speaking about the different types of worldly knowledge as you put it and we already covered Islamic knowledge and we said there's two types just to recap for the viewers there's a type that is compulsory for every single Muslim to seek and to learn about and there's the type that is communal some Muslims should learn about it and it will benefit the whole community however if nobody learns about it then the whole community is responsible for not seeking knowledge in that case now we moved on to worldly education or non religious education and you are going to explain to us depending on a person's intentions as you can clarify that for us okay before we go into this topic it just crossed my mind that part of the magnitude of ligature knowledge is to know what you have to do and what you must not do and we did not speak about that meaning that if someone says I didn't know that wine is haram to consume this is not excusable in the sense that this is part of the default of Islam this is the part of the essence of Islam to learn what is Haram and what is not how long so to know that it is not permissible for you to marry your sister this is elementary so no one is excused not to have this type of knowledge now when we go to worldly knowledge or worldly sciences it is also divided into two types one type which is permissible for you to learn and it may become recommended and it may be mandatory and we will speak about that and there is type of the worldly knowledge that it is prohibited for a Muslim to learn so if we would like to take examples if someone applies for a BA in arts Bart bachelor degree in arts what are you doing so I'm going to the University for five years masha'Allah I'm studying from nine to five every single day Wow when I'm having quizzes exams and grades and hamden I'm an honor student masha'Allah Tabata can look good for you knowledge is good what are you studying this is acting or dancing or music okay this is all Haram what are you doing this what you look he says this is knowledge he's Islam against knowledge said no it's not against knowledge but this is not halal knowledge if someone goes to university and he does catering for example or a hotel management and part of the courses he takes deal with how to make wine how to test wine how to know what the wine is and how to serve it definitely such a courses totally prohibited the Prophet at asos I'm used to ask a lot in his dorm by saying allahu dhu becoming l/min lagiyan far I seek refuge in you from knowledge that is not beneficial and definitely this is not beneficial another person goes into studying astrology Sarah it is prohibited to study astrology now if you're studying astronomy and the positions of the stars and the environment and etc and the weather there's no problem in that this is science ashalla but when you deal with astrology and the relation between the position of the stars and your future or and I'm shocked by those who follow and read the zodiacs and these things and he says yeah I'm a Scorpio and yeah it says today I'm gonna have a bad day so I'm not going to work this is good for this is shirk if you read it just for the fun of it see in Arabia we have those who drink the Turkish coffee after finishing it they turn the glass upside down so the remains of the coffee would make tracks and marks so they look into it and say are you just drank this this is a sign that you're going to get married soon so yeah but I'm already married said yeah yeah but maybe you're going to marry again and if you are maybe it relates that you're going to get divorced you got to get sick all of us are going to get sick someday you an old friend would call you every single day we have old friends calling me if you do it for the fun of it like the one who just reads the zodiacs for the fun of it Allah would not accept the prayers of 40 days so even if you pray you'll not be rewarded and if someone says ok if all is going to not accept 40 days of prayer I'm not going to pray at all what should I pray if you don't pray you become a kafir so you must pray no you're not rewarded for it for 40 days but if you believe in it so you read it and you go and you have an accident and you say this is exactly what they told me was going to happen this is shirk this nullifies a person's Islam so this kind of knowledge is totally prohibited no one in his sound mind would say that this is halal because you're teaching something that goes against the religion of Allah now the permissible type of knowledge is completely different someone who studies medicine helps to cure illnesses treats sick people someone who studies engineering helps make cities and towns and buildings and roads and bridges etc or factories and contribute to the benefit of the OMA someone who learns how to fly or to how to administer a government entity or a company or whatever all of these Sciences are worthy sciences and they're permissible but if you have the intention to help Islam and the Muslims so a doctor who goes in studies medicine and he graduates and he pursue his career okay why are you doing this said man there's a lot of money in it I love it for the money I can buy me a fancy car I can get married easily my social status is excellent people say he's a doctor ok this is permissible are you doing something I don't know but you're not rewarded for it but if someone learns it with the intention of helping the Muslims ok why are you studying medicine said well I like to cure illnesses and help Muslims and I feel wonderful when they say jazaka allahu khayran Oh may Allah reward you i feel good when i gived hour before examining a patient say bismillah and Masha Allah and in sha allah i use this these Islamic terminologies but I feel good about it in this case it becomes highly recommended to learn it and you reward it every single step of the way it becomes mandatory if there is no one in the Muslim Ummah doing it so if all the Muslims were to go to Islamic schools and Islamic universities and not having a medical doctor not having an engineer not having a pilot not having someone a policeman there will be all sinful so it falls under that communal type of foreign correct and this is why the scholars interpret unless verse what I do l'homme master Pato mincha wat een Allah is in ordering us instructing us to prepare whatever is possible for us of force so under the category of force this refers to military force it refers to a scientific force economical force and this is a communal obligation among them upon the Muslims okay so what I can extract from from the beginning of the show till now what I understand is that and correct me if I'm wrong at any point in trouble is that knowledge can be categorized into three just as a general whether it's worldly knowledge or Islamic into three one which is a compulsory for every single person every single Muslim to seek and this is the things that deal with his religion things that deal with the aspects of his religion that he needs to fulfill and then the second category would be communal whether this is things part that are part of his religion that don't deal with him directly such as dividing the inheritance so somebody in the community has to understand and study this and also things such as medicine engineering this would also fall under communal and the third type is that knowledge which is haram under Islam to seek not because of knowledge itself but because of what it is what the science is such as music or whatever that science maybe if it's prohibited in islam is that correct no and so just the last question now inshallah to give the viewers an idea of how they can start seeking knowledge so now somebody decides okay this is my first time you know watching our knowledge I didn't know it was compulsory for me to seek knowledge in in zakah and I have money I didn't know it was compulsory for me to learn the prayers I thought maybe I could do a step by step I didn't have to do it right away now how should this person start seeking knowledge where should he start and who should he take from how does he know which scholars to choose housing how is he going to figure this out well to answer this we need maybe not even a more extensive answer but try to put it in a nutshell who to learn from this is the question that we always hear repeatedly being asked by Muslims who should we follow who should we learn from who should we ask whom should we seek fatwa from the answer to this would be that you have to look and do your level best because Allah would only question you according to your ability not according to the results so if you did your level best and in trying to identify the most suitable incorrect scholar available and you followed him then allah azzawajal would not hold you accountable until you discover otherwise so what is the criteria well first of all he has to be knowledgeable and knowledgeable is not something that you look into with your own knowledge assay wow this guy is knowledgeable because a person in first grade would look to a pupil in the sixth grade as being knowledgeable see the difference though the pupil in sixth grade is still a kid but he's way knowledgeable to the one in first person to the first grade so it is not for you to decide so a real scholar is the one who is acknowledged by other scholars to be a scholar even tamien may allah have mercy on his soul said I did not give fatwa until 70 scholars of my contemporary time gave me permission to do so so he was known to other scholars nowadays you have so many people coming in the media like us and people point at them and say these are scholars actually how do you know just because they are on TV you get so many deviant people on TV that are following bidar that they have corrupt a leader but just because the appear on TV does not make them scholars on and there are other aspects that we can add to this but I don't know at the time unfortunately were for this episode inshallah if we want we can come back and do another episode dealing with the qualities that you should look for in a scholar in a preacher and somebody that you want to follow inshallah but Chekov really want to end this episode off by thanking you for that wonderful understanding of seeking knowledge in Islam very categorized very you know simple for the people to understand thank you very much chef Jacqueline dear viewers I hope you benefited from today's program and until next time may Allah subhana Allah bless us all assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh if Mohamed Salah male you were selling was here today watching other brothers and sisters about it on the so many gay he be screaming after no MORONI's well Senor to play return to the guy
