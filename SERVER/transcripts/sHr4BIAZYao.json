  "transcript": "bangladesh she says if we cook onions and garlics can we go and pray after eating it and the message the answer is yes cooking onion and garlic most likely takes out the offensive odor so by going to the masjid no one would be offended by the smell of your mouth unlike when you eat raw garlic and or onions so there's no problem in that insha allah what counts is the presence of the offensive odor"
