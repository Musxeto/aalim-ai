  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] - yes so suddenly what is proper age of a person to get married what he should do into his bride means if someone looking for and getting four five six four five six things as he wants nobody's perfect email has a second one second policy say it's a Mendez marry after his death his first wife and [Music] property is the child [Music] [Music] [Music] you're right Randy go straight bar eats and drinks gives and takes with his left so you have to be aware you think about the access in the front row the control because intend to do that but sometimes we forget so when you forget you need any money so all this habit your left hand never goes to you're not in a little talent and always use the right hand in making it I said this why would not the question if you want to say because the question that the brother has posted requires election and I did this workshop in Chennai India and was called half in HD high definition let's have tea and expected based on my image is about 60 hours workshop on the spouse husband wife why and it is not not happening why are they difficult what are the conditions were required to sustain life to avoid and it's interesting since I enjoyed it about Nina but as marriage requires unaware conditions for a boy or girl to be managed scholars have different some required taking the age of puberty and subset no even - at midnight but nowadays is not practical meaning in the past it was accepted especially when there was a potential that one was so afraid that it will go away so I want this boy or this girl to be for my boy of my girl and I'm afraid that if I don't make an early decision with not materialise but people change and ambitions change and the consent of both boy and girl is someone whose money old is a la semana her consent is for Easter recently deception is a long topic this is not the right time to discuss it but a boy when he is old enough for me has reached the age of puberty and he can a super responsibility then he may get married and he differs from one person to the other sometimes a person who is a boy who is 40 years of age is irresponsible and Republican and sometimes he can be at 7:15 and lead a happy and successful manage so it differs from one person to the other question the other question if a man is distance you have to expand a little bit one the Prophet says in the characteristics of a potential boy whoever comes to you and you are accepting his religious commitment and this one that you should give you management and for the girl the profits analysis and a woman is married for her lineage for her wealth for her beauty so get married to the one with religious commitment otherwise your hands will be nested and there are something other practice but this is the main thing that comes to mind if a man gets married [Music] he's meant to two eyes and his company is well respected and then the second childhood is check on me second my yeah does he get watershed this is not what if a man has children from one to three or four wives they are all his children so they get the property but maybe the question was a woman from a second woman so they are his stepchildren not his real children they are the children of his second wife is human in distance do these stepchildren inhale but if their mother dies and she had a shake husband's property they will get her affection not the man you say so I hope this makes sense to you it's easy but [Music] [Applause] [Music] what is best to wait to see there are things nice there are things that are permissible for them to take their own choices they don't want to impede vegetables sometime another chakra that got them through they don't want to wear certain clothes be comfortable and they would like different choices of course they don't want to go with us to places their own choices but there is a red line that we cannot protect so we cannot as well tolerate them doing harm watching on listening to how speaking harm being disrespectful using that words associated with bad company that is we all doubt that they are bad influence to them we have to toe the line but we must not put them in confinement and a prison everything that hurts people to me Simon Says you have to eat your heart Simon Says [Music] if you want to be obeyed as for what can be if a child is why he won't be able to do the now CCP but at the same time an open the door the kendama box for my child and then expect medicals and he becomes I have a righteous person yeah you don't respect our children we spoil them will be give them these stupid devices because that's what function it has nothing to do with who's smart it is return it is something that takes that state to help children even if they go to high school they must not have these devices there is nothing more effective than hockey go and hang on that's it but when you get them you tube when you get them please help on Facebook we give them Twitter and they spend their time like I think worshipers Oh working working like this even in normal cases their legs are like this I would suspect it 10 years 9 even the newborn will be evolved like the tower feel it would be this this is not will you get in my pants we have free access to Internet they will watch imagine you know what they want you so you have to live and it's not with life if you in your home have OC osm and you watch always if you watch difficult centimeter there we have the Saturday goes back it will be simple my employees pre-mixing Mouse it's with brothers and uncles and are not related her father will sit with strange women and she chats with coworkers and have this if you want to try that mistake you don't have a choice either you go 100% Islamic or expect the unexpected it cannot be in between this is why grace wholeheartedly don't be selective I like this because they keep referencing them because I have become empowered but I go select to be good with my wife over my children so energy you have to live the real Islamic life meghanadha give example by you being a role model and Chava things will happen the question what is the moving of cartoons and Royal City stuff especially when we see that it involves background music can we send our children to play groups the first one is viewing cartoons and points with background music Tokiko acts with anything with bad news is how so if you watch a cartoon that has good content good messages Islamic messages music something that has good content even if it was animated so on says finding so turn the music off and but if it's as bad content mixing between boys and girls love affairs and the music you cannot not be any have to oh this is how power works is same thing boys have peace with itself it depends on the Linux if it's good that's good if it's bad that's bad music is totally prohibited in the background in the front round in the backyard it's totally prohibited even if it is accompanied by piranha cities people recycle it some hoo-wee what is this disco making fun of ours pathetic this is our business it's third question what can we send our children to play with [Music] [Music] so we have to look at the whole situation and see I have a question on the concept of passive income passive income is the the work that you apply to whatever you are doing is small in proportion to the money that you are give you an example you have an apartment for rent you recover your original investment and then anything you get after that is your profit so that's one example of passive income another one would be a franchise so you get royalty from the business by people using your name a third one which is a little bit more controversial as far as I'm concerned is where you have something like a pyramid scheme so you have a business that pays you Commission or a referral commission based on the products and services that another company is offering so this commission is being earned from you as an individual and to somebody else so at the end of the day the man on top but the person sitting on top of the organization gets a share of a commission where is not working but the people below him are working so that's another example of passive income so I just if you can just shut some light on the concept of passive income [Music] [Music] look at each case by guess until the verdict renting there's a big chapter of the court a job whether it's physical personal reading meaning mind breaking myself to do set the soil or renting property vehicles itself so this is nothing masochist you ready vomiting second was example franchise and this is a recent issue given to the community and soulless looking it brands have a back and this is why the most valuable and expensive brandy the world is so we know that who has a brand name even if they do not sell that property their merchandise we just sell the brand itself it cost billions so great to have a value you have the right to not be violated through people taking you right up and without your permission you have the right to franchise this is also falling under the category of renting now whether that ski is a different issue altogether because the facets of the business of multi-layer marketing or pyramid schemes Ponzi schemes is and the smaller subset that is how one they say this is not on selling and buying it is on getting Commission so the bottom layer of the pyramid we have a disability and they were all interested so that they can have another day underneath them giving them money and those who went to the close at the top and the top at the top at the top all pyramid scheme companies such as gold where's this business they're considered names they continue citizen we have a product and this product actual value in the market is what we are hundreds this and we will sell it to you for for quasi dinars but when you buy it you're entitled to market it and if you market in to do we will give you a percentage of course you will market due to who will buy it for for Cadiz and will market whether to to so the cupcake has in essence making money haha it's a Ponzi scheme I got the person completely me to explain and convince me that it is Helen and he's wasted so much of my time and I try to be polite [Music] [Music] but we found regarding Islamic mentally funny you're putting in the bank deposit and we are getting a return on your taking a loan against a whole divided person is when I go home you know amount of Pakistan 20 years I should have take a Sarah [Laughter] this is a very mass topic however you must understand that there is a difference between Islamic banking and conventional banking the brother said during his question that 'what's the ruling on taking loans from an Islamic bank a fact it's nothing personal because you have to understand this you know the difference between is not mention what is Islamic banking it's not banking is a form of transactions that allow you to get money through what is known as our robot which is actually buying products and the self is the bank itself and he will sell you the product that the market value is 1 KT he will say that you in installments in for 1.15 this is the speaker no see if I have a cat ba ma very expensive management it's all so our conversation selfie okay I said okay I'll tell you for 3030 Katie and one of the boys come it says she shall be the pennant Sydney successfully for one Katie does he have the right to say why are you selling before we offer to be for safety and setting for him for one why not be equal he was my friend it shall I repeat so in the business you want to buy I will not buy passes likewise in installments he said this is my 13th Katie he says what I have money they said okay I'll tell you over the duration of my years 450 Katie you bail on us they decide contract stated that I want from him move it technically no matter what happens he devoted his the day his late I cannot ask for more than 50 K DT possesses agreement mishap now Islamic banking is a elastic technology so now anything you want it to sell you attach to it Islamic so we have Islamic food Islamic banking now we have discovered that's a very handsome who's that we have the bikini what's a bikini is a football last bikini this is in advance so the universe's supposed to die now we have we are is because of demons not come back to coronation Islamic banking has to follow the Islamic sharia what has happened in nowadays is an Islamic me I can sell you my device and you buy it you go sell it somewhere else a problem hello I said it with the price take home in I possess it it's like my friend I said you in any question you will be happy what's happening at the moment is that Pakistani man was mana he comes to he says I need a thousand dinars I say ok I will send you something I was a new technicians I will sell you copper in my name I will sell you giraffes in Nairobi Kenya this ok we can I say it's not happy but here's a contract sign that you will buy for 12,000 things and you will be over the side of his vocation and then I go either to a financing company where I meet what would I do that hundred ten conditions air conditioners so what you do nowadays what they do is as follows he wants money inside the contract that you bought from me hundred air conditioners consign okay signed another contract that you authorized me to send them with a lower price it will be with you in five minutes I put in his account than when he wanted he did not see the product he did not possess it and it is not Senate so it so this is not the same unfortunately 90% of the facts suppose I make the assumption of course there are this is personal loans now when it comes to corporate loans Oh talking of meanings so we're talking about shares in companies for mainly oil fields in oil tanks and etc in this tankers is much bigger fish to fry and the percentage is higher involvement is much much bigger so unfortunately a lot of the Islamic bank needs are not actually static how do I verify a know by looking into the Sharia code are the installers or not or they just heard and at any point that he is a doctor but this is not even a medical know and secondly which most more importantly that this shaking world has departed pockets so many factors are dating and then manage requests from the Sharia Court but the banking transactions is not implemented so we will you can imagine you suspect of ships also arrives on so good okay who's supervising eww and you will find a lot of these transactions and services assets are called asking a question an extract either has migrated and is not coming back to live so wherever Pakistan I need Lahore and I go to Canada and I get the citizenship I have a house my children are living their ethnicity if I go for a month to visit my family made of much and I go back to Canada we have you decided Canada are you ever going to go and live in the hole again never this is my home candolyn in this position but if an expired is here for 60 years in Quetta and his final call is called Dyne his home company's houses there he is residing away he completes his residing in Islamabad he completes it the way of all the way we showed the sacrament but once he reaches even cities is a settler can a person happy top of his child with a dead shoe girls have seven huge scholars with it it is mandated or highly recommended and the most attentive opinion is that it is high recommended it is a pseudonym happy so if is left with a boy or a girl child the pseudonym is to slaughtered two rounds sushi do got a corset and hidden of this selection for a boy or a for around for a goat for the girl it is recommended if he doesn't they associate on him however he will not get the chance of intercession of the child rejected because Athena is the child the right Missy for this particular good I'm a one-woman be happy as for the shaping of the head the profit settling swallows a mean boom remove the car or the gift from his head so the majority of scholars say that shaping is moving for the boy I personally shave the heads of my girls as well because the head or the heart is useful for boys it hurts it's not long before that you weren't going because the same material substances on the skull of a girl is the same with the point so by shaking it you free the skull of such substances and would help the hair to grow naturally and not affect the child but as I said the majority say that this is for the boys if the father of a girl that someone to do it is not simple for that be shocked because the certain is the way the air it's silver and even each other so I'm going to take the hair to the jeweler's shop and maybe comes only 1/2 grams I'm gonna give what would make it in a subtle and it's much much much less and is it okay supply so now in order to say yes or no my right or wrong so if someone says is it suited to raise the hands after the obligatory pray we said hold on cause and then we look into the books of shouldn't I [Music] [Music] and so it's not permissible okay she was doing it on my own our congregation we see that's I can't eat the book so did you find anywhere [Music] you know but at the middle of the night the end of four crates so this is a reason to be to become after countries and everything is from it so when I see the front of the spotter and the back of this bottle it is something of the bottle itself and we know that there is a critique from the person who told us that after you finish offering salutation to the progress of what you want do you choose select whatever you want because so the time equally why I mean even after the prayer what is the objective you want you make a girl not something on next one they said now they stick to our apartment I want you to forgive me I want you to pay off my debt [Music] [Music] you also asked about whether you want so before I saw your hand should be on [Music] because this is this within within dance a lot introdu the part before Salam who are playing within the salon that is introduced before Salam that is can be done in any language [Applause] it's an issue of dispute so if you find something totally prohibited to do it help it help but this is not the most pathetic opinion the most of the ethnic ability this is really giving other scholars is that Allah is the Lord okay Roxanna hours so if I don't know [Music] so I say Institute with the fault or not if you want to make dua if you know how to eat Arabic you must so for example I got forgive me I always say then this is conference but if you want to say o Allah guide my wife and me soldier accepts it in your greatest weapon in fact of course is virtually personal with women oh Allah make my husband trim his big belly [Music] [Music] [Music] announcer most alas a forum is made easy for those this language to understand how these races [Music] de mahogany wood decking Allah has made it easy for those who want to get a reminder out of it and to get preaching of the reproductive so so it is easy for us Alex we needed to understand is when they need the translation is not something like mathematics or riddles it's because of magic translation history so there is no contradiction it is not multi-language in the sense that anyone that encode for and which in German origin Romania is not possible it is not an inclusive building and it is sufficient to the heart but also those who do not speak the language I have been a facility for them the translation of the meaning not the translation of the Quran the translation of the meaning because also translate meaning not the actual plant cannot because it is so profound and deep that translated into exact meaning of it but cannot be hundred percent you can okay I have one question here in Saigon babies I think zakopane cold from the gift of the way and she regularly okay and she doesn't have maybe explain come so what is the system or what is the if she cross the whole world what an ISA so what is the system of living as an Apache she doesn't have any thank you [Music] [Music] do I place a hat over this 1 million Katie or not he's not reached the age of puberty in a different situation I have someone who's insane I have a brother a relative inherited or who was a businessman he has real estate companies that still generating $1,000,000 dollars per week he's worth three million but he got insane he lost so he doesn't know who he is urination himself Izanagi is insane do I give second for it or not the answer is the second is obligatory among the wealth not an individual so the work is of course one having said that we come to the tool the tools the truly that a woman has do we a second heart or not first of all there is no second truly the second is involve itself with a person whether to the me that is stored and kept safe evening opportunity that she wears or truly that she gives to others or a man who has gold and silver he's got oxen and kilograms of gold muscle in his house and then Madison Duty does he makes a cut for that yes because is mentioned in surah taubah 9 that those who hoard and keep good position and do not spend in the cause of Allah it will be under fire Hellfire and there will be burnt with it in there by accident or heads in the sights and this includes anyone who possesses gold silver or currency that was Anthony dollars do la announced the country house it has same coming back to your question do the scholars say gold and silver women are second or not it's an issue of dispute modernization with other companions said of the a second so it's an issue of dispute and that is a must gives attack on gold or silver possessed by women and course the question is a woman who is a housewife regardless this Torah was given to her by her father or by her father or by her husband as it as something bought it doesn't matter she possesses poop and she does not have an income and after one year the money now is a tractable she has to give second so she looks in her pockets is not money how does she pay zakat she can go to her husband and try to adorn yourself they said why did you be busy I miss you and he he is not liking her food she doesn't look that attractive you named after so many years of management what does she do we say you said a small portion of people and pay for the second because the Islamic economy revolves on this goal and the food are you need for income so each one post a lot of gold and or a little it does not give zakat that economy is handled and some of the system I was a sister called me and she said I think was a live TV because it not make such jokes privately when I was just a cause it's this Dead Sea's because this is with others like me flo-jo Peru there so she said that source of income and I can't make basically this doesn't happen so I asked how much hope you have she said five kilograms know yourself because this is almost right this is the blessing now with a woman fix positively assessed about 10-15 years time I'll be losing a lot of zakat and gold will be finished yes so what you will invest it do with the duplicity in your sake invested put it in something that you can add it grows you get richer by Obama rather than be passive become acid with [Music]"
