  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our beer host we're continuing to look at the interactions that the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him had with the people around him during his lifetime we have now reached the subject of part two of the sinners our guest from Saudi Arabia check awesome Ella Hakim Salaam alaikum welcome why'd you come sit down with Allah he oh boy look at and it is an honor for me to be here with you it's my honor as well and look forward to a great conversation as always so this is part two of our discussion about the sinners a very insightful discussion we had earlier we'd like to continue with a question about making an important distinction in our conversation we were wanting to make a distinction between different types of sinners and the different responses that the Prophet peace be upon him had with these with these people him and him attended al-amin nabina muhammad in while early he was sahbihi ajma'in it goes without saying that people differ in their knowledge in their intellect in their upbringing and you cannot simply treat them all as one and that is why Allah created people according to their levels you have bosses you have subordinates you have leaders and you have followers and from this point if you look at it from this angle and you search and study the way the prophet alayhi salaatu said I'm used to deal with sinners you would find that there is a big difference between him dealing with people with knowledge who would make mistakes and those who did not have knowledge okay for example those who were and the Prophet Isis on would deal with them in a very nice manner kind educating hmm like a father the ignorance could come by many ways maybe their youthful maybe there are foreigners maybe they have a different faith so on and so forth correct for example the story that we've mentioned before about the Bedouin who came and urinated in the Masjid yes the Prophet SM did not reprimand him he simply said my nephew these messages were not built for such filth they were built for prayer vicar and reciting the Quran end of story another man speaks during the prayer when someone sneezes and says in hamdulillah while in congregational prayer the guy says your haiku mullah and when the people look at him in a way just to make him stop he shouts again me and him why so kumea he says me my mother loses me me my mother lose me why are you looking at me during the prayer in the message hmm so they started clapping their thighs so he understood that they want him to stop and then after the prayer simple the Prophet brought him and I said my nephew the prayer is not made for people to talk in worldly matters right and end of story however when you move and shift in your study you will find that in some incidents the Prophet Elisha was intentionally harsh because the person who'd made the mistake was knowledgeable though he was not like any Tom Dick or Harry for example abuzer Aleph re one of the old people to embrace Islam one of the few early Muslims he had a feud with Bilal so in a moment of anger he said Bilal you are the center of a black woman Bella's mother was black so he wasn't lying but it wasn't sad in a sense of honoring him but rather wanting to humilate him bilal did not reply he went to the prophet Isaiah he complained and the Prophet summoned a Buddha and he said you are a man of ignorance hmm so a Buddha who was old he said the prophet of Allah after this age I'm a man of honor yes saying this your brother and so and so and so in another incident I'm the law have been amaryllis may Allah be pleased with him and with his father a great companion who was learned and close to the Prophet SM comes to him once with clothes dyed with saffron but special dye that only the disbelievers wear okay and the Prophet prohibited it allas allas on the Prophet when he saw this he didn't say to him Abdullah you're not allowed to wear this or you know the ruling What did he say he said to him I'm the law did your mother order you to wear this mm-hmm immediately understood the question that was rhetorical but he it was meant to sort of open his eyes yeah so immediately Abdullah repented and said o prophet of Allah shall I wash them to restore their previous color the Prophet said no burn them so this is a financial punishment for the mistake that he had done and the thing can go on and on and all different types of his beloved wife Aisha the Prophet is an expedition he comes back home tired eager to meet his wife she's eager to meet him she says I covered a door in the home like a closet with a piece of cloth but it it had drawings on them and we know that drawings of living creatures in Islam's Hara mmm like animals like human beings the Prophet entered the house and would not move from the door way and she said and he was angry she said Oh prophet of Allah I seek Allah's forgiveness what have I done he said don't you know that the owners and those who drew this or these images are being punished and tormented on the day of judgment so immediately she took it down cut it into pillows and stuffed it and the images were gone okay you can go on and on and on and this shows you that whenever there is someone who is ignorant or someone who has a misunderstanding mm-hmm a man a young man comes to the Prophet I saw sir and he says o prophet of Allah while the companions are all surrounding him allow me to fornicate now what would you expect the reaction of the companions I'm sure they were flabbergasted they were overboard yeah what are you doing and the Prophet said let him say what he wants okay he's addressing me not you and this shows you the etiquette of dealing with people now if a youngster comes in and said shake an eye a smoke pot oh you kaffir you this you you displace for your family the guy is asking so he has to be taught and he's not an arrogant person or an intellectual educated person he doesn't know what does the Prophet say our Islam come my son so the book comes in come closer it comes closer to the Prophet or a sorcerer then the Prophet deals with him with the way that he deals with a son someone he loves and cares for so he says do you allow this to your mother said may Allah forgive you a prophet of Allah of course not do you allow fornication for your mother so don't so the Prophet said likewise people have mothers and though they don't this to happen to them would you allow this for your sister would you allow this for your aunt for your daughter for so-and-so so the Prophet started listing to him the relatives and the close ones to him and the man says may Allah forgive you a prophet of Allah no and then he said likewise people would not accept this for their own so it takes two to tango it's not only what you desire what others may suffer from and then the Prophet as a sinner in a loving way places his hand on the boys chest and he says o Allah cleanse his heart preserve his private part and give him the needed chastity or like the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam so hustling for Jahoda help Alba the Prophet is giving him this beautiful door the Companions say after that incident the boy did not look at any woman in a Haram way so how do we treat sinners nowadays how do we treat people who sing who act who may do things that are sinful but we don't know their background don't we look down at them don't we despise them and feel that they are scum yeah why is this yes this is because Allah has blessed us for so long in being practicing knowledgable being around righteous people to the extent that we think that we are the elite enhance when we see someone going against our ways Shaitaan intervenes Satan comes in his presence and says look at this guy he's doing this he's doing that makes us take things that we would regret in an ahead in an authentic hadith two brothers one was righteous one was a drunk art so this righteous person every single time would say come on my brother quit drinking this is bad for you this is sinful and the brother says it's none of your business this is between me and Allah and one day this righteous practicing brother said to his brother by Allah Allah will never forgive you Allah this is the hadith authentic hadith occur the Prophet says I son Allah said who is he to swear that I would never forgive that sinful person I have forgiven that sinful person and I have notified all of your boudoir this means that we should learn from the Prophet erase a lot o son not to prejudge people not to make assumptions and definitely not to deal with them in a harsh way unless it is justified and for a legitimate reason Sheikh we're ready as a good breaking pluck point for our break we will come back to continue our discussion about the sinners Salam alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we are continuing with with Sheikh awesome on our discussion about the sinners and how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with them among other people's around him during his lifetime excellent I you touched a number of points before the break that I wanted to get to we do have a problem of looking down looking negatively upon people who are sinners but the Prophet peace be upon him forbade us from insulting them but little in them assuming this arrogance or this assumption of superiority somehow looking down on people the word that we use self righteousness perhaps but whether it was during or after let's say someone was caught and punished maybe it was a public case would you like to talk about that because after someone has paid the price for their wrongdoing you know there's no reason for continuing the punishment and that the Prophet peace be upon him spoke about that well first of all in the legal system in the US and elsewhere they have something called double jeopardy yeah so if someone was tried and there's a mistrial usually they would not try him again mm-hmm because that would cause double jeopardy in the sense in Islam the concept is better and that is if a person sins and he is punished for his sin that is it on the day of judgment Allah is more generous to combine two to two punishments on him so let us you okay a person steals and all the conditions of stealing is fulfilled for us to amputate his hand according to the prescribed punishment there are a number of conditions difficult to be combined but if someone does them all then the Muslim judge has to issue the prescribed punishment now after being his hand amputated then what on the day of judgement he would come clean there would not be any sin upon him for stealing and this is hearing two birds with one stone the Prophet erase a lot o sanam when he dealt with those who make mistakes while they possess the knowledge a woman from the tribe of makhzoom used to steal she was caught red-handed the prophet has ordered at her hand to be amputated the her tribe sent Osama evens eight the beloved companion who the Prophet Isis Salam loved him and his father his father was Satan Haditha the so called adopted son of Mohammed halasana so he went to talk to prophet Ali Salim about the punishment and if it can be reduced the pun the Prophet as some was outraged hmm and he said Osama you are talking and interceding with me about one of the prescribed punishments of allah by allah if my daughter fatima were to steal I would have chopped her hand off okay okay so the hand of this woman was amputated and the Companions described her as becoming afterwards righteous practicing and the Prophet made dua for her so it is not Islamic to keep on rubbing it and reminding people of their previous sense there was a man by the name of a new man and he used to joke with the Prophet as Salam and make him laugh in some narrations say that his name was Abdullah and they used to nickname him as the monkey why is that because this man was a compulsive drinker so he drank so many times and after each time he would be brought in front of the profit area so Sam and the Prophet would ordered them to flog him forty lashes mm-hmm so he came so many times repeatedly till one day one of the Companions said to the Prophet I said to his friend while the Prophet was listening may Allah curse him how many times he's brought you in front of the prophets yeah mm-hmm why didn't he learn his lesson yeah but what did the Prophet says he said do not aid Satan upon your brother for by Allah it is my testimony that he loves Allah and His Messenger now compare apples to apple this is a drunkard this guy drinks it's a major sin and he drinks until he's wasted and he was brought up like tens of times to be flogged publicly yet this did not prevent the prophet alayhi salatu salam from testifying that there is love in the heart of this individual towards Allah and towards myself it almost sounds like exactly what we hear therapists say about people facing addiction a completely sympathetic understanding of the plight of people who are addicted yes but but we have to be careful sometimes a therapist and shrinks would go overboard to justify sins so they would say oh yeah he's told because he was not conscience or he had a trauma like 20 years ago that made him rape or kill but this is unjustifiable he's a human being he's saying but at the same time we have to weigh the pros and cons if he committed a sin and was punished for it that is it and this is how we should deal with sinner not to make an overkill you do not kill a mosquito with a cannon someone who does a mistake someone who does something that is sinful you don't simply come and make this a catastrophe or the end of the world this is particularly sensitive issue for the african-americans in my country because you know a part of there's a lot of unfairness injustice disproportionate numbers of african-americans are systematically dealt with targeted and dealt with and the justice system and once you get saddled with criminal charges they will ride they can really destroy your life they'll stay with you forever even after you've paid your debt to society you've gone you've been convicted you go to prison a lot of times in most US states you can't participate in the democratic process you lose the right to vote you can't get the job it's difficult to get a job it forces you back into you know the same lifestyle and so you're paying for the rest of your life for something that you may have done when you were a foolish kid so this is a very refreshing perspective that we're getting from you on this all of us regarding children I'd like to ask a question about children the question is about how to write League I chew an away from becoming sinners in the first place it goes without saying that parents want to inculcate to encourage righteousness in their children the question is about the best way to achieve this is it through a loving relationship with the child and then everything just kind of falls naturally into place or does a parent need to be more active proactive looking being attentive for and rightly responding when the mistakes are being made by kids we have to as stated before weigh the pros and cons when it comes to kids we have to give them unconditional love compassion but at the same time we have to draw lines that they may not cross seeing the prophet alayhi salaatu son was reported that whenever he heard or sensed a lie from one of his relatives one of his household he would abandon and ignore that person until he repents to Allah so here we are talking about the concept of a ledger or abandon abandoning and by cutting an individual the Prophet used to do this a little too sir because it paid off likewise we have to in order to be obeyed we have to give something so you cannot just simply say Simon Says and you expect the kids to comply you have to convince them you have to give them quality time you have to substitute them with good things in the place of the things that they were banned from having without this it would be very difficult we can ban our children from using smart smartphone though I consider them to be stupid fun because they teach people how to become stupid but we can ban them because there's YouTube there's face hell or Facebook as they call it and there are the social media stuff but banning them is not helpful because they can find other means to go around it so convincing them trying to make them understand talking to them in a sense that they feel that they are intellectual people when we give them responsibility when we give them trust then we win their hearts but when we always suspicious of what they're doing give me your phone yeah let me look you know at your browser what did you do no I don't believe that you were studying and we keep on accusing them unjustly and unfairly this calls them to actually cheat this is this is like my becoming the police or whatever we're almost out of time just a couple minutes left maybe we could ask about a very simple question what's the potential harm danger for embarrassing people once they their their sins have become public publicly known the question is about avoiding embarrassment how did the Prophet handle this peace be upon him and what are the potential harms or dangerous this is depending on the situation sometimes you have no other choice or alternative than to change it and stop this sin publicly yeah because it's taking place publicly but if it was concealed that it is a must conceal it for example during Hajj the prophet alaihi salatu salam was on his camel behind him was alphab even al abbas the cousin of a beloved novice so a woman comes and speaks to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam asking a question and an alpha ball was a handsome man so he kept on staring at her and the Prophet would turn his face and he goes back and stare and the Prophet keeps on turning his face not to look at her so his uncle said why are you doing this to your cousin and then the Prophet said Ali histah lot was salam i saw a young man and a young woman and I was afraid that Shaitaan would make a connection so the Prophet did this while all the other companions were looking now one would say oh you've embarrassed him yeah but he brought this upon himself and this was done publicly I cannot simply say okay I'll talk to him a couple of days later and allow him to continue in the sin this is unlike when someone does something privately and I come to know of it and then I talk to him privately as well without exposing him mm-hmm thank you so much Rick for your answers your time for all these questions barakallahu he come and thank you for being with us we hope that Allah accepts our time together and it was beneficial for you as well we would in this episode now and continue with with the Prophet and in the future until then I Salaam alaikum WA Rahmatullah hope it again"
