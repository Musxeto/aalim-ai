  "transcript": "a brother says alhamdulillah Allah has guided and guided me and I started to pray five times a day I started feeling proud of myself that I'm becoming a good person and started to prepare for my Acula and left the worldly amusement my question is that I am that am I wrong in feeling proud of myself can it lead to arrogance like feeling I'm better than the other person because he doesn't pray or he gets involved in sins and I do not the answer is yes the final phrase that you've mentioned definitely would lead you to arrogance and maybe worse as Muslims we see things in black and white that person is sinful that person is doing good good deeds but at the same time when we come to compare ourselves with others we always put down of ourselves we never look high to whatever we do so if I see someone who is older than me I would envy him and said Masha Allah he has more prayers in his bag than me he had fasted so many months of Ramadan and me he has so many good deeds in his records than me I'm envious and when I look at someone who is younger than me I'm also envious Subhan Allah he's young he did not make all the sins that I had done he did not commit all the wrong things that I have committed in my life this putting yourself down adds more value to you this is why scholars say that perhaps a good deed would take you to hell and perhaps a sin would lead you to paradise how is that possible well a good deed that you do may take you to hell if you bank on it so imagine I go and make rum bra whoa that's a good deed Allah raises my previous sins so while driving back home I listen to music what are you doing I'm listening to some music it's some minor sin and I have done a lot of good sins and my sins were erased because of my Ummah and I go home and I watched a couple of movies and then pfizer time I skip it and I keep on doing sins depending on that good deed which I had done not knowing that it would lead me to hellfire while that person who committed a sin is so remorseful is so regretful every time he remembers that single sin he praised night prayer he fasts Mondays and Thursdays he gives money in charity every time he attempts to do another sin he backs off and says nope I don't want anything to tarnish my reputation more than what I had done I don't know if I was gonna forgive me or not and he keeps on working positively to overcome the burdens of that particular sin until he dies and goes straight to paradise so you must my friend avoid any feelings and block them that tells you uh-huh I'm a better person than X Y Zed o that sinner person I'm better than him oh that innovator I'm better than him those actors and singers and pop stars I'm better than them I'm the Cher I'm soprano how how you do how would you know that how would you classify yourself to be such a person you cannot and you must not yet I would never go to one of them and say well I hear you're better than me know what's right is right we know what is halal what's Haram what they're doing is wrong and what I'm doing is hopeful right what Allah evaluates is something to allah subhanahu wata'ala and hence i should not praise them but at the same time I should not feel inside of me that I'm better than them by no means and Allah social knows best"
