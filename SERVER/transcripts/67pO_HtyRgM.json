  "title": "Should we treat people as kafir if they use taweez & do other acts of kufr? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I know of someone who puts a paper which has three last surahs the three equals written on it and he puts it inside a Tavis and give it to others for protection and he has some ideas like he says the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was a human he is dead but he comes to receive our Salam even though he admits the fact that this matter is beyond our understanding is a matter of the Unseen so if this types of Acts are kufur and if he is committing these things out of ignorance as a Layman by blindly following uh their Scholars and he thinks that he is on the right track so should we treat him as kafir first of all try not to fall into the Trap of labeling people it is not our duty to go around and give a crash uh course and a test and a quiz afterwards to people and say okay answer these questions please so I can determine whether you're a Muslim or not I mean he he goes and says and I said apologies I can't reply until you answer these questionnaires okay let's go and pray Asia in this Masjid I don't know the imam's apida so I can't pray behind him this is the treats and characteristics of everyone who claims to be a Muslim is a Muslim by default until proven otherwise even the Shia they're Muslims if I made a Shia and he says salaam alaikum I said what do you say of Aisha I have a few questions please can you answer this is wrong foreign something that is covered and we know that the conditions are fulfilled he's knowledgeable he's not forced he's not misunderstanding anything or misinterpreting anything and there are no obstacles preventing the labeling of comfort to fall upon Him such as ignorance such as being forced Etc in this case that's a different story so this person you mentioned two things one of them is that he writes the three pulls on a piece of paper and he gives it as a tawis for protection to people now this is an issue of dispute some Scholars even some companions said that doing this with children is permissible like mother Aisha and and a number of companions and even Omar he used to hang a board with with these three surahs Etc and the majority say no this is not permissible would we say it's shirk no we would not it can it can underline bold it can lead to shirk but it's not shirk the second thing is you said that he acknowledges that the prophet is dead Allah yet he also acknowledges that the our Salam reaches him and you say are these things of course not this is proven by the authentic Sunnah Allah has appointed an angel so that whenever a Muslim offers salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he conveys his salaam to the prophet Allah where's the kufur and the Sheikh so again this shows you that so many misconceptions in your head are hampering and impairing your judgment to the extent that you are ready to classify and label this person as a mushrik and Allah knows best so Maya"
