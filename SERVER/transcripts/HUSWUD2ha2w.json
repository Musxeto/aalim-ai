  "transcript": "foreign videos YouTube videos for clients and it's about uh financing and business topics so most of the clients are required music background to be added for the videos so my question is if I like if if the clients um himself add the video after add the music to the video after I've done it and I just edited the video without the music so I don't deal with it and then the clients either he does it himself or so he hires someone else to um add the music to uh to the video but my payment for editing the video um still be Haram if the content of the video is halal so if it is dealing with halal stuff there is no River there is nothing endorsing Haram or promoting Haram and all what you do is just edit it or put subtitles to it or thumbnails or the likes and you give the product back to the owner without collaborating with him or showing him or telling him that this is where you should put the music but I'm not going to put anything because it's Haram if you're not collaborating with him on anything that is Haram what he does with the end product that you've given him which is halal this is his business and your income is halal insha Allah"
