  "title": "Ask Allah sincerely & He will guide you! (What is the purpose of our life?) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "people because sometimes when you ask someone i've had experience asking you know the person who's in his uh late 70s 80s have you ever thought about the purpose of life have you ever asked the creator of life for guidance so i've interviewed so many people over the years and when they did this simple yet profound thing of asking the creator for guidance alone because the devil shaitan makes things confusing oh so many religions they're all the same just that and the other and so it makes it so complicated but then you know how powerful is this to leave morgan freeman or just the average layman to now ask ask for the guidance from the one who created you asks allah azzawajal wholeheartedly allah will guide him i guarantee you this so i don't ask people to come to islam i just ask them to ask allah almighty to guide their heart to the straight path if they are sincere in that they will be guided imagine what was the dua the supplication that our prophet allah used to open his night prayer and night prayer is something that people offer as a voluntary act it's not part of the five pillars of islam it's something that is a bit higher it's a bonus so people wake up at three a.m an hour or two before the break of dawn when everybody's asleep nobody's awake so the prophet used to wake up and his supplication would be oh lord of jibril archangel gabriel israel and mikhail the three greatest angels you praise allah with all of these beautiful praises you ask so you say guide me to what righteousness and truth people have disagreed upon what does that show you it shows you that even the prophet of allah is begging allah all the almighty every single night to guide him to whatever truth people have differed upon because if allah doesn't guide you you're lost you're astray and the moment you think of yourself that oh i'm strong i'm king i'm the uh the champion i'm the owner of everything look at all the celebrities the poor things 50 years ago who were the first page uh um articles all the time always on the first page their pictures their events they're they were so beautiful so handsome so strong where is all of that down the drain 50 years later another one bites the dust then what is going on don't you think that there is a life after death shouldn't you at least know what's the means of transportation the accommodation what's awaiting me is it a suite a royal suite or is it a room in a dungeon i have to figure it out now the problem the biggest problem is that such people not only celebrities the vast majority of the population they are enslaved to their desires so when you come to one and say okay come to islam i cannot jeopardize my red wine of 1982 that was a good year with a big piece of uh pork chops i i can't i can't play with that and your religion prohibits it is this all what life is about you're willing but if your cardiologist say you have high level of cholesterol you have to stop this or you're going to die next week you got to stop it then you're on it yeah you have a problem okay think about what awaits you and look for the right way out whether it's islam or any other religion i'm fine with that but i i bet you halal betting [Music] that if you ask allah for guidance you will be guided and this is what the creator is saying all my slaves are misguided unless i guide them so ask me of my guidance is not the creator this is hadith very authentic"
