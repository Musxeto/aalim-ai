  "title": "Bowing in front of other people",
  "transcript": "Brother Ibraim, I think from Nigeria, was asking about a custom in Nigeria where when you enter a gathering or a room and there are elders, you bow to them as a means of respect. So is this permissible? And the answer is no. It is not even permissible to bow when you're fighting or when you're practicing taekwondo or karate or whatever. Bowing can only be for the sake of allahel. You cannot bow to anyone. No king, no president, nothing. Therefore, you can try to show your respect through other means such as kissing the forehead of uh an elder. This is what we do in Saudi Arabia so many times. When there is an elder, we kiss their foreheads. There is nothing wrong in that. But bowing, no. It is completely unacceptable."
