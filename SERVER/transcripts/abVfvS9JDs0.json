  "transcript": "he is in a haram relationship now he wants to repent but he told me that there is some article in india that if a boy leaves a girl then if girl committed suicide because of him then the case will be on him so he wants to know he wants to know what he should do this article if it exists can be challenged in many different ways in a court of law so first of all he must not break up with this girl leaving any traces behind so no sms no phone calls and no emails he just simply blocks her ignores her so that nothing can be held against him in a court of law and at the end of the day he should fear allah azzawajal if this is a consequence of a haram relationship that he had fell in he has to pay the price he has one of two choices either either to break up leaving no traces behind to incriminate him or to continue in his relationship with this girl and end up in hell fire of course the latter is not an option so he has to do his due diligence he has to improvise do whatever he needs to break up with this haram relationship without leaving any traces to show that may incriminate him in a court of law you"
