  "transcript": "send one of my friend asked me about the difference between the prayer of women and men I told him that there is no difference as far as I have known and there is no sahi hadees about the differentiate of women and men prayer because he send me one video of Pakistani Mufti he told that if there is no evidence in Hadith so there is so just I'm asking is there any ispehat we can apply or we can only follow what rasula salazam said that there is no there is no difference of the uh Prophet the man and woman prayer okay uh I got your question first of all we have to have the etiquette of not agreeing if I differ with you we have to have this etiquette of accepting what you have to say though I disagree with you it's not my way or the highway it's not if you're not with me you're against me it doesn't work this way especially in issues of ishti had I'm not talking about issues of Akida we don't have any ishti had in it we don't have I understand where you're coming from and I accept your difference of opinion no issues of Akida is finalized it's something by the set by the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations so I will not accept what you say full stop these These are issues of Akita issues of ishtihad whether to put your hands on your chest or under your belly whether you don't put your hands at all when praying standing for prayer I can understand and relate to this why because at the end of the day is the prayer valid or not so if someone says I differ with you during Salat I believe that it's okay for me to chit chat with those next to me and to call my mom and says mom I'll finish in five minutes prepare the food please this does not invalidate my prayer things like this said okay with all due respect we don't have anything to discuss because what you're saying is totally wrong it goes against the Quran the sunnahan the majority if not all the Muslims but when it comes to issues of dispute is the prayer valid or not so if this hanafi brother if a woman prays Like a Man without any difference so that when she prostrates she distens her elbows from her body when she sits for the shahud she sits like a man erecting her right foot sitting on her left foot in iftarash or sitting on her left if it's three or four rakas Etc so what's the ruling on that is her prayer valid or not if he says it's valid but she's not doing the right thing I would say if she doesn't pray like the prophet Isa salaam and she conceals herself in rukur and she doesn't sit like the prophet in Salah her prayer is valid touche but if he says no if she prays like the prophet Allah then he prayed his invalid I would say here I beg to differ what you're saying is totally bogus it's not related to Islam you want to have your stihad be my guest I have my evidence the prophet said Allah is this for women or for men or for all pray as if you see me prayed he never told women though there were a lot of them don't pray like this conceal yourself don't spread your arms away from your body when doing sujood or record don't do this don't do he never said that so are you accusing the prophet Allah of concealing knowledge and information and then you come with ishtihad why would I take Irish Jihad when I have the evidence from the prophet Hadith at the end of the day we should not make a big issue out of it if they are so blind in following their Scholars and their school of thought that's their problem as a Muslim I followed the Quran the Sunnah you guys want to have your stihad that goes against the way of the prophet sallam that's your problem you can't shove that down my throat definitely you cannot expect me to water it down and say to people yeah it's okay no I would not say that I would say what I'm convinced of according to the Hadith of the Prophet that is so I I don't see a big issue unless they want to go against the way of the Prophet salaam and blind follow their um imams or or whatever Adil from India"
