  "transcript": "lyric says how can we apply this hadith I assure may Allah be pleased with her said when a man complained of pain the prophetess of Sam said to him pointing pointing his saliva and mixing it with dust this is the dust of our earth mixed with saliva of us so that our sick is we remedied with the permission of our Lord the hadeeth lyric is pointing to is an authentic hadith it is narrated and reported by Bukhari and Muslim in the side so it is her it has the highest levels of authenticity and never we said that this is usually done with pimples or wounds when the Prophet used to do this with his finger wets it with his saliva then puts it at the soil of the earth and then says bismillahir rahmanir Torah bachi Aldina be riccati Bovina Shifa is a female the ignorable and he used to put it where the area needed healing weathers wound it's a pimple it is a place that is aching so even if you have something that hurts internally but you cannot see it you may also do this process to it some say that this is only specific to the soil of Medina and the saliva of the Prophet as a setup but this is not authentic because this was a general incident and had it been something special for the Prophet that is a Salam he would not have done it without notifying us telling us and scholars would have stated this that this was only for the prophet alayhi salat wa sir"
