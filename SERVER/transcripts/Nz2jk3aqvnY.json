  "transcript": "okay we've got a question here from Brother Kad galani he asks about the permissibility to read the Quran during mination for his wife now what's we spoke about it before he want some guidelines he says it seems to be slightly unclear to him he's going to read the Quran for her or she's going I don't know but he's asking on her behalf well the the in short the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that um a woman in her monthly period is allowed to recite the Quran whether from memory or whether by looking at it but she's not allowed to touch the Holy Quran the Arabic version MH having said that she can recite the Quran and read it from a computer from a PDA from a book a commentary for example that has Arabic and English or an English translation of the meaning of of the Holy Quran this is all permissible and acceptable"
