  "transcript": "Rashad from tiia what's the ruling on following weak Hadith it's an issue of dispute some Scholars say that it is permissible to follow weak Hadith providing it does not have to do anything with and it does not state things that are Halal Oram and it talks about the Virtues Of voluntary Deeds such as six after between and such as four after equivalent to blah blah blah other Scholars say Allah pledged upon himself to protect the vi which is the Quran and the Sunnah and having weak hadiths goes against this so as long as it's not authentic this is not part of the dean and I'm inclined to follow this opinion that Allah has preserved the hadiths that are authentic so there is no need to come up with weak hadiths and say that okay we can add this part of the Vick part of the prayers part of the voluntary Deeds because there is no need for that and Allah Knows Best"
