  "title": "Is paying the Late Fee or Penalty, same as Interest (Riba)? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now the first question was regarding the penal penalty for late payment and he says that he knows that interest interest based loans are Haram so does this fall under the same category and the answer is yes see when you get a service you are obliged to pay for it usually people pay for it in advance so I'd like to get a phone I would get a prepaid phone or a post-paid phone a prepaid is something you give the money in in advance once you consume the service even before the time is over they cut the service because this is service per the amount of money you paid a postpaid account or service is the same but instead of paying in advance you tell them whatever my bill is I'm going to pay it at the end so they give you a grace period so you have to pay on the 30th of the month and we give you 10 days if you don't pay then we will put a penalty now this penalty is because of your delay in payment which is now a debt to the company that you bought this service or this product from and hence this is totally prohibited and it is RBA and Allah knows best he says that if people go for a vacation for a holiday for couple of weeks how long are they allowed to shorten the prayer if you know if you've uh um watched the beginning of the show we said that as long as you're a traveler whether it's two weeks 3 weeks four weeks five weeks then you may shorten the whole period and shortening is different than combining shortening is an advisable Sunnah you're highly recommended to do this even if you say excuse me even if you say that I don't need to shorten I don't have any need we say this is the Sunnah you should do that combining is something that is given to you when needed whether you're traveling or residing so it is best for you to pray on time if you don't have any reason to combine but shortening you may shorten the whole period and Allah knows"
