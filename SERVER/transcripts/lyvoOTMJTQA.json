  "title": "The moon sighting for the Day of Arafah",
  "transcript": "the day of Arafat is misleading because al-assad is a mountain a small mountain holy shrines and the day of Arafah is called after the place where people meet and gather supplicating to a large door gel on the ninth of the pager and that is the origin of the confusion that a lot of the Muslims have they say ok we sight the moon to know the beginning of the lunar year so that we know actual are when is actual line when is that's why I set cetera and we psyche the moon wherever we are are to know where when Ramadan starts and when it ends so that we know when to fast and when to celebrate the Edith footer now when it comes to out of fat it is only one occasion what not one location which is a lava where people stand everywhere so if this is the case then then you have a problem because if I type the mood in Canada and they tell me that an attack is they and the Muslims in Saudi Arabia are standing in artifact on artifact on Monday so how could that be well the answer would be is that Allah Azza WA JAL gave us the illness of two years based on fasting the ninth of the hedger which is the day of Arafah weather the ninth of hedger corresponds with the ninth of pigeon saudi arabia or it doesn't it all depends on the sighting of the moon in your country and to make it a bit easier imagine in the situation a hundred when they did not have satellites when they did not have fat communication tools that enable people to know the exact date in a distant fart country so by this you would understand that the people in North America 100 years ago if you had any Muslims at the time they would fat in accordance to the site fitting of the moon they would not have an idea don't use Day or Monday in Saudi Arabia maybe they would know three or four weeks later but it would be too late but that is why Islam is suitable for every face time and country hence by citing the moon by fasting the night of the ledger in accordance to your citing this insha Allah would suffice and would give you the reward"
