  "title": "Is fast valid if I accidentally swallowed water while sniffing it up my nose in wudu assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "while fasting so I inhaled water very slowly and carefully in Urdu but I mistakenly swallowed it now I am not sure if water went inside my throat or not but I am inclined that it may have got inside so should I add this fasting after eat considering the fact that I have OCD and was to us in almost all Islamic practices but alhamdulillah better now the answer is no your fast is valid the Restriction not to exaggerate while inhaling the water up your nostrils and blowing it out as for the Hadith please with him this is to not fall in such a mistake but if you have done such a thing and you swallowed water this was unintentional so no one says that your fasting is invalid because it is unintentional therefore continue your fasting without a problem but try to be more careful next time"
