  "title": "Umm Sulaim (Women Around The Prophet ﷺ‎) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "wow so and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet we need in today's times to have role models especially for women because all what we see and hear brainwashing us day and night are these weird calls coming through the social media the general normal media of homosexuals feminists liberals people who want to change not only our nature as human beings but also are religion which is the most precious thing we have and therefore it is important to have role models for women to look up to and try to imitate one of the women who was around the prophet islam and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam praised her for so many things in her was um her name was malayka bint melhan and she is nicknamed as arumaisa and some say al-rumaisa she is well known by um musulem and we don't know of any of her offspring by the name of suleim before islam she was married to malik and when islam first reached medina way before the hijrah the migration of the prophet alaihistalatus she did not hesitate to accept it and revert to islam when her husband came back and found that she abandoned his religion and his forefathers idol worshipping practices he did not like that he was angry she didn't give that much thought she could not care because she found what she was looking for the religion of her nature the religion of allah so he fled medina went to syria and was killed there and died as a kafir the prophet allah is had a habit not to visit women other than his own wives except for um sulaim and her sister um haram they were two sisters and he used to go there and have his siesta and sleep before the horror after for a short nap to rest and then move on so the companions asked him why is it o prophet of allah that you choose her house and not ours so the prophet said alaihis al-assam her brother was killed with me under my command so i have mercy over them her brother was haram ibn milhan and he was one of the companions of the prophet sallam who among 70 of his companions went to give dawa answering the invitation of one of the tribe's leaders only to be ambushed while giving the dawah to that tribe leader a man came from behind him and stabbed him with his spear that went from his back out from his chest what did haram do he said in a joyful voice i have won by the lord of the kaaba i have won the assassin who was a kafir said i did not know what that meant the man is dying i've just killed him and he said i won what did he win and when he asked around and found out that he was referring to paradise for being martyred in the cause of allah the assassin accepted islam the prophet alaihis salat wasallam said in an authentic hadith reported in the sahih that i saw in a vision that i've entered paradise the prophet says and i was met by arumaisla the wife of abu talha referring to um so this is a glad tiding that she is from the people of jannah subhanallah isn't that sufficient for us to inquire what is so special about um suleim to be given such glad tidings that she is in jannah this privilege this honor was given only to few selected companions of the prophet so what was it that qualified her for this honor i bet and betting in islam is haram but this is a metaphorical i bet you if you ask all the women you know in your family who um is that maybe one to five percent would answer our history has been hidden has been taken away from us on all what we see are singers actresses celebrities the scum of the society when it turns in terms of islam and how people are evaluated in it they can be good people but religiously they're the worst of people nudity drug addicts illicit relationships profanity you name it they have it all for an indecent and indecent book but ask people about um suleim no idea never heard this name before so what was special um sulaim is known to have done what no other woman did and subhanallah she is so smart and intelligent if you were to call her an entrepreneur that wouldn't have been an exaggeration she had a vision that far exceeds what we see when the prophet came ali to medina she said o prophet of allah not a single man or woman among the ansar the people of medina there is no single person among them except that he had given you a gift and i don't have anything to give you can't afford anything to give you as they had done except my son he's an eight-year-old he's a learned boy he's smart he's intelligent other narrations stated that he knew how to write read and write at that early age and in that era among the arabs that was something out of this world so she said take him and he shall serve you as long as you wish so she gave her own flesh and blood to the prophet sallallahu alaihi at this early age eight years of age when we are most attached to our own children she gave him a way to serve a total stranger no he's not a total stranger he's the messenger of allah whom she has unconditional belief in to serve for an exchange of how much nothing just to be with you o prophet of allah and serve you anna says i served the prophet alaihissalam for 10 years never ever he had hit me cursed me swore at me nor he had ever frowned in my face she gave her own son to the prophet as a gift to serve him he's a free man yet by doing so she gave us the muslims this great gift anas serving the prophet salam and narrating to us thousands of hadiths about his worship about the way he dealt with people about his private matters and every time we hear anas we say may allah be pleased with him and make dua for him and um takes credit for that may allah be pleased with her among those top five or six who narrated hadith anas comes in the third position subhanallah after abdullah and before abu says and before ishmael be pleased with them all and her marriage is a different story we know that malik another has fled the country died she became a widow she vowed not to get married again until her son anas becomes old enough to speak among men a man of honor came to propose to um so many proposal proposals came to her she rejected them but when abu talha came she said by allah you are a man of honor and any woman would accept to marry you but the dilemma is i'm a muslim and you're not so if you accept islam i will accept you as a husband and not only that i'll make my dowry your islam so give me time to think he went gave it a thought came back and said islam is the right and ultimate religion i bear witness there is no god worthy of being worshiped except allah and that prophet muhammad ali is his messenger and she married him fabital bhunani says we've never heard of a dowry more honorable and generous than her dowry that is islam the prophet alaihissalatu salam always mentioned their household of good things we know the hadith when a man came and asked for food he was a guest of the prophet islam the prophet sent to all of his nine homes do you have anything to eat and they all replied negatively so he asked the companions who would host my guest took the prophet's guest to his own home told his wife um do you have any food for the guest she said i have nothing except little food for the children dinner he said okay give them whatever you can just put them to sleep but don't give them the food and prepare the food and when the guest comes to eat turn off the lights so that he would not see and pretend that you're eating and so they did that giving the impression to the guest that they're all sharing the food while he actually was the only one eating after fajr prayer the prophet salallahu salaam said allah the almighty and in the description the description is astonished of what you had done last night and this shows how great this family was um suleim had real wise decisions and she acted subhanallah with great vision she had a son from abu talaha but that son was like three four years of age and was always sick and every time abu talha goes to work and comes back asks about his son and she says he's okay he's better he's a little bit worse he's this one day that child died so she put him on his bed in the side of the room she prepared herself took a bath applied body lotion fixed herself well when abu talha came he said how is the boy she said he had never been caught more calm than now and she didn't lie because he's not moving he's dead so he had his supper then looking at her he had intimacy with her and after everything was over she said if our neighbors took and borrowed something from other neighbors and now they're refusing to give it back is this okay he said subhanallah how can that be okay it is a borrowed thing and they must return it back to the lawful owner then she broke the news to him and she said in this case your son who was borrowed with us allah azza has retrieved what he had given us so he went to the prophet alaihissalat and he told the prophet about her doing because this was not normal women usually pull their hair shout scream cry do horrible things but not that wise woman so he went to the prophet isam and the prophet asked him did you have any intimacy afterwards and allah said yes the prophet said may allah bless your night which means that she has conceived and allah would bless the pregnancy and nine months later she gave birth to a boy and they called him abdullah in sahih al-bukhari sufian says the man narrating and reporting this hadith said abdullah the son of abu talahan um i saw nine sons of his all memorizing the quran subhanallah all memorizing quran this is the barakah the blessing of the prophet's dua she was a wise woman unlike other other mothers anas tells us about this in an incident where the prophet al-hisam told him and sent him on an errand and told him not to tell anyone so when he came back home he was a bit late his mother asked him why are you late he said i was on an errand to the prophet alison and she said what was that ana said i can't tell it's a secret any other woman would have beaten him to the ground until he confesses um she said if it's a secret of the prophet don't you ever dare tell a soul about it subhanallah look at the amount of courage and bravery she's putting in her son instead of asking him to break the secret of the prophet islam and she was truly smart she knew how to make advantage of different situations once the prophet islam came to their house anus narrates and i was with my mom and my aunt um haram so the prophet alaihis wasalam was there they offered him food he said i was fasting so that was not the end of it she seized the moment she said oh prophet of allah your young servant anas what do you want she said make dua for him she didn't ask for a plot or a farm or a position of authority in the government she said make dua this lasts and this is better so the prophet alison made so many duas for me and at the end he said and this is in the supply his wealth and his offspring and bless it not only multiply but also bless it anas says that i have seen this dua come to reality anas lived until he was 103 years of age among the last of the companions to die he says my farms produced twice a year while every other other farm produces once and i'm among the richest of the companions i have buried more than a hundred soul of my own offspring children and grandchildren and great grandchildren in another narration the prophet isam said and forgive his sins so he said my life has been prolonged my wealth has been multiplied my offspring are so many and i wish and hope that allah would also answer the last dua which is forgiveness um was not your normal woman who goes to the salon take care of her hair and fingernails and does nothing except that she was an active woman she would go out with the prophet susan in some of the expeditions and battles to help with the wounded carry water bags to give for those who are dying and help one battle in the battle of hunain she was walking alongside her husband and the prophet and she was carrying a big knife around her waist so allah said o prophet of allah look at him sulaim she's carrying a knife so the prophet said what is this knife um she said oh prophet of allah this is for self-protection if one of the idol worshipers attacked me i will open him up and if any of the muslims flee battle the battlefield and turn their backs from you i will also kill them and the prophet said to her is better for us than all of this yeah and he don't kill the muslims who are fleeing because this is not how we do deal with those who flee battlefield but for the protection there's nothing wrong for a muslim to carry something to defend himself it's horrific to see muslims being killed and tortured without being able to defend and protect themselves no one says that this is not legal it's best to allow others and perpetrators to kill you to torture you to rape your family and not to defend yourself this is how she thought may allah be pleased with her and she was among the known companions may allah be pleased with them all to love collecting anything related physically to the prophet seeking barakah seeking the blessing because we know that the prophet islam is the barakah on earth so everything related to the prophet as a son physically is a barakah that we can seek allah's blessings through it and this is not an issue of dispute at all among muslims so when once he drank from a skin water bag or container and he drank directly from it after he finished the pro she went to it and cut the uh uh the place where the prophet put his lips on and kept it aside seeking barakah from it the prophet came once islam and had his siesta as usual it was hot so he started sweating she brought a small bottle and started to collect the sweat coming from his forehead and whatever fell on the leather bed so the prophet woke up startled what are you doing she said oh prophet of allah i'm putting this to mix it with my own perfume and to get healing from it and the prophet alaihi salatu did not comment on that on the hajj the farewell hajj when it was time for the prophet to shave his head he asked the barber to shave half of his head and to distribute it among the muslims giving each companion one or two pieces of his hair as for the left part of his head he gave it all to abu talha the husband of um because they know that they appreciate this and that would be more precious to them than the wealth of the whole world she was a generous woman and so many incidents in the sahih in the hadith of authentic hadith where she fed the prophet allah and she fed the entire muslim ummah with the barakah with the blessing of the prophet assassin over a small piece of food that would suffice 80 100 a thousand men subhanallah and these are some of the miracles that she participated the miracles of the prophet this wise noble honorable woman was with the prophet al-islam throughout his life in medina she gave her son to help the prophet ali throughout his life in madina and she died on the 40th approximately 40th year of hijrah when muawiyah was the ruler of the muslim ummah may allah azzawajal be pleased with um and may allah azzawajal make us all among those who enter paradise to see these role models who were around the prophet [Music] muhammed foreign"
