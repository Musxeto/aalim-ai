  "transcript": "either says can we keep dog as a pet or for security reasons as a pet it is totally prohibited the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam that angels do not enter a house where there's a portrait a statue or a dog and he said that whoever keeps a dog other than a dog of a eppard dog or a dog for hunting or guarding then each day out of his own good deeds Allah will erase and deduct the weight of mount a hood of good deeds of hasanat a friend of mine a relative actually who has a chihuahua in his house and so many times we tried our relatives tried to give him advice and he said no it's cute it's lovely it's this it's that so I said to him listen do you have enough good deeds every single day that would equal amount or hurt in hazarat is that not even 1/10 of that I said to him then in this case you're in debt because every day this is being erased and deducted from your good deeds and this my friend means that you're in real deep trouble so this is not permissible now for security reasons this is permissible providing that these reasons are legitimate so again keeping a chihuahua in your house is not for security reasons it can be eaten by cat so if you have a German Shepherd a Doberman something that is really vicious and there is a need for it that you are in a really disturbed environment or a neighborhood that you fear for your life and without that they will not be deterred from breaking into your house this seems to be permissible providing that you keep the dog outside the house and not allowing it to enter the house and Allah knows best"
