  "title": "Imam scolded, called me Wahabi for praying with hands on chest Can I pray behind him assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so um I'm in a bit of a dilemma I'm in Kashmir at the moment and I'm gonna be here for a while and one day I was praying in the Masjid and uh I pray with my hands up high on my chest and the Imam approached me and said what are you doing are you a wahhabi are you this and that you're gonna crack the you're going to corrupt our children and my question is should I pray behind him or not yes you are you can pray behind him because this ignorant imbecile does not own the Masjid the Masjid is the house of Allah he has no Authority on forcing people to pray as he wish as he wishes whether you're a wahhabi or you're a hanafi or you're a shafiri or your Maliki this is none of his excuse my French business so yes pray in the Masjid whenever he comes and approaches you just give him a smile like a stupid smile and don't reply to him don't argue with him don't speak to him except by nodding your head and let him be because he's like with all due respect yeah a fly you're not gonna fight with a fly you just do this and ignore it and it will go away so these people whether you're in Kashmir or in Pakistan or in Bangladesh there are ignorant imbeciles and I say it with a loud voice because they have no Authority on Muslims to practice whatever they want if I want to put my hands on my side or put them beneath my navel or put them on my chest it's none of you but your business so who cares what they think or what they say just ignore them don't pay attention don't pick up a fight because it's not worth it just smile to them and let them go away do what"
