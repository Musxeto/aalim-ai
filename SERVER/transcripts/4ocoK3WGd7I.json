  "transcript": "so I study in the U.S I'm a high school student so if I want to play the Zoho am I allowed like to pray it when I know that many mass shootings are happening here not in the school but in the country itself many white might allowed must show things mass shootings so you're afraid of being shot yes come on just in case I'm not afraid but just from my security you know okay okay I will address this issue now those living in the U.S there are about like what seven million 10 million Muslims living in the US alhamdulillah and it is not a jungle yes I haven't been to the U.S in 40 years I can't tell but I do watch the news and it's not a jungle where you walk the streets and you're afraid that someone will uh uh put a cap whatever how they say it yeah someone will shoot you so this is not true a lot of women walk and work and go shopping alhamdulillah safe and sound a lot of the brothers they pray in parks on the street in in places that are notorious and known for gangs and and looting and killing it nobody cares so if you are in a high school and you're a Muslim and you are implementing Sharia in your own heart and in your own life people will respect you yeah they will you'll find someone trying to bully you or make fun of you but what's new this is exactly how the prophet Allah lived his life in Mecca being bullied for 13 years and his companions this did not deter them from practicing their religion so actually raise your head up high be proud of being a Muslim and inshallah nothing will come your way if you live if you live in the dark if you're intimidated by every whisper and every move of the Wind you will never progress you'll never have a life you pray your your prayer on time four or five minutes and it's over people would probably walk to you and say what were you doing tell me about your religion maybe some of them would accept Islam because of such a prayer don't be afraid and let shaytan whisper injuries about these things"
