  "transcript": "and finally the prophet salallahu hated to delay and postpone Good Deeds one day he was praying leading the prayer in In Asar prayer and all of a sudden after he finished the prayer he immediately stood up and went to one of his homes and the companions were frightened by the speed of the Prophet salaam after concluding the prayer not saying that God immediately standing up there must have been something wrong so when he came back they told him o Prophet Allah we were frightened by the speed that you stood up we thought that there's something wrong happening what was it the prophet said I remembered some raw gold that was given to me before Salat for sadaqa for charity and I did not like the idea the notion that it was in my possession this long so immediately after I just went and ordered it to be given in means of Charity and this shows you that one must not delay Good Deeds when are you going to take Umbra next month maybe the month before why not now when are you going to memorize the Quran maybe after Hajj when are you going to wear the hijab or sister she said inshallah when I reached 40 this is not what the prophet assalam used to do he used to hasten to doing good things and never delay or postpone them"
