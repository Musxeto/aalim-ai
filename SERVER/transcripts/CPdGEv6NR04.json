  "transcript": "um so my question is uh when I lift my head from suud I start saying allahar until I am in the standing um position is this correct usually it wouldn't take you that long because Allah abbar is a second and a half and standing up from the sujud to the uh standing position would take you probably three uh seconds so you will not say Allah ahbar this is not the way to say it the moment you raise your head you say Allah abbar so even if you're not still Midway this is sufficient inshallah the wrong is to say allahar while your head is on the ground or to stand up erect and then say Allah abbar that's what's wrong you set it in between this does the job inshallah"
