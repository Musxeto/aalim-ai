  "title": "Is it permissible to provide services to people who would use it for halal & haram assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is in regards to the concept of assisting people in Haram so sometimes I come into a situation where before providing a specific service I am 100% sure that this certain person will uh will use it for a mix of Haram and Halal however I am inclined to say that they will use it for Halal Halal purposes more due to my previous interactions with them so like for example in a similar video someone asked that if they give their brother their headphones but they know for a fact that he will use it for uh to listen to music but he will probably use it more for his classes and other Halal purposes so you mentioned that we should let them know beforehand that they shouldn't use it for Haram but in some cases such as when providing a service to a business or client this may not be feasible and in fact we may even be certain that despite Our advice they will go ahead and use it for the push p portion of Haram so to sum up if we know a certain person will use our service for a mix of Halal andam but there is more Halal involved in it is it Halal to provide the service to such a p the answer is yes you are not his mother and you're not obliged to give him such an advice as long as he's buying a bottle of water which he can drink when he's thirsty and which he can turn into ice cubes and drink with his Scotch you're not obliged to say okay this is a bottle of water don't do anything I wouldn't do don't use it to uh um make ice cubes for your scotch no it's Halal item that you're s selling it's a Halal service that you're providing whatever they use it for this is their problem and not yours"
