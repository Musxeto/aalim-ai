  "transcript": "uh sh I just want to quickly start off by saying thank you so much for your videos I've learned a lot from it um alhamdulillah my my question is regarding uh so I'm basically I'm trying to increase my uh uh daily but I noticed one thing which makes me concerned about the validity like for example I may have done something in the past uh something Wordly wrong like maybe I got angry at my brother you know and sometimes till today if I think about that like I cry and it it really troubles me but I don't get that feeling um regarding my uh you know the sins that I've done uh in in Islam or you know so it makes me question the validity and uh uh I don't know how to go about this I know I'm yeah that's my question okay first of all these concerns s are usually generated by Shan and the prerogative the the intention of Shan is to mess up with your head and mission accomplished this is what he has caused you so Overworld matters I shouted at my boss at my siblings i u cursed someone I did some mistake someone wanted my help and I turned them down I promised someone to give them a helping hand and I uh uh did not show up these are worldly matters not necessarily related to Dean and you feel that hurting people still had scars in your conscience unlike a fer that I've missed six years ago or someone that I've taken his money unlawfully and you know the sins that we commit such imbalance is natural because Shan manip Ates our feelings to his advantage and his Advantage is that you don't feel remorseful over things that took place decades ago though you repented and you felt sincere and deep remorse but by time and by asking Allah for forgiveness in addition to thinking positively of Allah this feeling of remorse may be reduced to a bare minimum while these things the worldly things that I've done in the past May resonate and make me regret them due to the influence of shatan trying to magnify them so that I could have this confusion my advice to you is to totally ignore it think positively of Allah Asel and move on in asking Allah for forgiveness thinking that he is the most forgiven the forgiving and the most merciful subhah"
