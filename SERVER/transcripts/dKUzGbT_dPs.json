  "transcript": "is it true that a woman who wears perfume and goes out while non-mahram smell her has to take russell which is the major ritual uh bath does she have to uh take russell as if she has committed zina to wash off her sins this is an issue of dispute based on a hadith that was authenticated by sheikh al-bani may allah have mercy on his soul and it goes as follows whoever witnesses the prayer in a masjid or wants to witness a prayer in the masjid and she wears perfume she must not pray until she takes the major ritual russell to uplift the major ritual impurity of janaba and this was reported by or narrated by abu huraira allah be pleased with him who have so happened to meet a woman wearing perfume going to the masjid and he asked her where are you going she said to the masjid and he said to her go and perform russell as if you have a major ritual in purity because this is what the prophet said is and the scholars differed according to this hadith whether it's authentic or not and as i stated earlier it was authenticated by sheikh al-bani may allah have mercy on his soul so it's authentic yet they differed whether the instruction to perform russell was mandatory or recommended the vast majority of scholars say that it is a recommendation not mandatory why they said that this is a form of punishment because she defied the order or let us rephrase that she defied the prohibition of the prophet sallallahu salaam from wearing perfume and going out where men can find her scent and find the perfume she's wearing the prophet said allah whoever does this is like a fornicator a woman who committed fornication an adulteress why because she is tempting men with the perfume she's wearing and i've stated this so many times that men's feelings towards women are far greater than women's feelings towards men so a man can be lured can be tempted can be seduced by the voice of a woman by the scent and perfume of a woman by the way a woman walks while a woman may not pay any attention of such things when a man does that this is why islam protects the society and the community from such forms of seduction by preventing and prohibiting it from happening"
