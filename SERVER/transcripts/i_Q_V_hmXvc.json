  "transcript": "ishaq from india says he wants to get married he's young he doesn't know how to speak to his parents well you are one of millions of young men muslim men who are interested in getting married but can't do that the prophet alaihis salat wasallam was realistic when he addressed the youth and he said o youth or young people whoever among you is capable of getting married physically and financially then he should do so now if you are physically and i hope you are capable of getting married are you financially capable of getting married answers no you don't have a job you're still at college maybe at high school so who will provide for you if your father is not convinced that you are a real man and you're capable of assuming the responsibility was uh responsibilities of a husband he will not help you financially in this case you have to follow the realistic uh um advice of the prophet when he continued to say and whoever is unable to get married he must fast so in your case if you cannot financially support yourself in getting married you can fast every alternate day this would curb your sexual desires until you start to earn either after graduation or if you get into business or you get a job but you need to earn so that you can open a house for your wife if your father is rich and he is a logical person and has high levels of intellect he would appreciate that my 18 years old son has to get married because there is so much fitna outside and i ask any father if you were in your son's shoes what would you do if you were to give to be given the choices of fasting getting married or having a girlfriend and fornicating what would you choose rarely you would find people fasting because they're not brought up to be practicing muslims and if even if they were to fast every alternate day the moms and the fathers would probably be on his case what is this this is extreme you're going to kill yourself guys what do you want me to do masturbate go and fornicate so many girlfriends i can party with and do haram things and fall into zina this is why the whole environment the whole society is unfortunately corrupt they call you to do haram they facilitate haram for you but when it comes to get getting married no so if i have a wife i'd like to get married again the whole community is against me okay if i want to go and travel to some other country and get a girlfriend there it's okay a couple of weeks and come back a year there's no problem no strings attached and this is a very wrong misconception about what life is as muslims we have hell and fire waiting for us so what we do in this world reflect on our uh fate on on on where we will end up at the end of the day so ahi all what i can do is best of luck but you have to and he tried to convince your father if not then there is no way other than fasting alternate day"
