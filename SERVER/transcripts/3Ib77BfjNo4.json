  "transcript": "actually my question was can we say may Allah reward you greatly to the disbelievers when they do a good work what's the problem in that what yes what is the problem and it saying to someone who helped me carry a big box no she cannot say to the disbelievers to say to the disbelievers may Allah reward you yes no most likely because this is if you intended that Allah would reward them in this life yeah this isn't this is permissible but leave it like this generally without having this intention no we cannot pray for the disbelievers in terms of Mercy or forgiveness or anything good in the Hereafter because we know that they're destined to Hell Fire due to their disbelief but we can pray for their goodness in this world may you get healthy may you get wealthy may Allah Grant you good things in this life there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
