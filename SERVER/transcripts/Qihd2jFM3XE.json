  "transcript": "from Saudi Arabia says that they borrowed money from a relative her husband lost the job and now they cannot pay back and they can see in the face of their relative that he is annoyed he's upset he has all the right to be so because he wants his money back so she's saying can I borrow money with interest and the answer is definitely no it is totally prohibited for you to pay interest to a bank because this is riba and it is one of the major sins in Islam what to do be tolerant give this relative of yours good words saying for waiting you know our condition we will try to pay off your money let's say like uh over a period of 20 months we will pay it to you in installments and you have to try to reschedule it but you have to return it as it is and he is obliged in Islam to wait because this is what Allah ordered him in Surah Al Bak at the very end if he is a person in need he has to uh appoint time and wait until you find money to pay him off"
