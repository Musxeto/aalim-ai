  "title": "Sheikh, your website crashes whenever we try asking you a question! #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all as for the website unfortunately I have nothing to do with the website the website is run by my volunteers my admins and they have full control over it and it's their responsibility I have nothing to do with it and yes in the past 3 4 weeks we've been having so many complaints and we spoke to the brother who made this website and he promised to solve it to my knowledge a couple of days ago two days it was solved and now it's not crashing anymore but the problem is that the box where you put and paste your question only appears at 6 o' p.m. meca time and I can only answer 50 questions a day but people are waiting in the thousands to flush their questions in a limited amount of or number of seconds literally seconds because 50 then and it's closed so unfortunately this is what's happening but inshallah it won't crash anymore my admin is listening and it's their responsibility uh in front of Allah not in front of me I have nothing to do with the website and with the uh the other um things uh that is attributed to my name unfortunately or fortunately I don't have time to run these things"
