  "title": "Scared, anxious to give dawah, enjoin good, forbid evil. Don't be a religious police Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sometimes i feel like nervous and anxious many times when it comes to enjoying good and forbidding evil like i feel that people will think i'm weird or like i just i just get an anxious feeling that they will look at me weird and i feel like a little bit strange my dear friend on earth we are here for the sole purpose of worshiping allah azzawajal who says i have not created the jinn and the humans except to worship me and part of the worshipping process is to be tested so everything you face on earth is a test from allah wealth you're a lucky man it's a test poverty the poor thing it's a test health is a test illness is a test safety is a test insecurity is a test so everything you face on earth is a test part of the tests that we face and encounter is fulfilling our obligations and responsibilities to islam and to others so part of my test is to be kind and good to my wife and children part of my test is to enforce virtue to enjoin virtue and to forbid and prevent evil and vice now during our tests there is an enemy of ours lurking and waiting for the right moment to strike the prophet told us alison that he runs in our veins like blood does and he would definitely not want us to execute whatever we command it to do so when you want to pray you get this inner feeling that oh i'm lazy it's too cold it's too hot it's too early i feel sleepy when you want to recite the quran you just close it because i can't concentrate when you want to give in charity he tells you your money would be less and you won't be able to buy this or to secure this and we are in difficult times who's doing this shaytan it's your enemy satan the devil now when it comes to enjoining virtue he always intimidates you so you see something that is haram you want to tell people that this is haram if they're muslims maybe their relatives maybe their loved ones maybe they're total strangers he tells you that they will not like it they will resent it they will think of you as an extremist they would label you as a terrorist maybe they'll call the cops against you maybe they will lie about it so he intimidates you so you back down and you don't or you back off you don't do anything and this is from shaytan always estimate and weigh the pros and cons you're not the religious police so always put in mind that after you hear this motivational speak speech you don't go to the masjid and you meet 200 brothers and said your beard is shaven your trousers are below your ankles uh you look you smell like you're smoking i saw your wife the other day she wasn't wearing the hijab you invest in haram stalks what is this you keep on talking to people like this they'll kick you out of the masjid no you have to be knowledgeable wise diplomatic you know when to select the right time to address a particular issue not every single issue in the whole world otherwise this would help shaytaan stop you from practicing and giving dawah so how to do all of this this requires the lecture but in a nutshell learn your religion the more knowledge you have the more knowledge of the way of the prophet allah giving dawa the more knowledge you have how the companions used to behave the tabian and and the salaf the more diplomatic you become the more tolerant you become and you would succeed in conveying the message in a very beautiful and articulate way that everybody accepts don't be intimidated this is shaytan but don't jump the gun to just don't go and and give darwin forbid evil and do this and do that and hit right left and center and end up losing the whole battle in the whole war no be diplomatic think of the consequences of your action is it the right time or should i delay a couple of weeks and then speak about it should i put it all on the table or should i select the priorities and know what to address and what to ignore temporarily for now and then address it later should it be directly face to face in front of others or one to one or should i write a message or an email all of these come with knowledge insha'allah knows best"
