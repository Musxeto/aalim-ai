  "title": "Signs of the Last Day (Day Of Judgement) Part 4 - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "never Haman hamdu lillah wa salatu salam on our soul in the UI Oh Sofia meted every death I'm not bad I'd like to welcome you back to the last session insha'Allah in our workshop which I prayed to Allah that would benefit us from it insha allah azza wajal so we're still discussing the second sign of the major science of the hour which is the dead Jan what is our responsibility when we hear of him coming up should we take our APA 47 and go to fight him or swords or or what the Prophet said aramis salat wa salam and this is the order whoever hears of the Dajjal he must stay as far as possible from him because a man would come to see him thinking that he's a believer and he will follow him because of the many doubtful things that he presents to them and this hadith is extremely important not only in the day job in everything that is dubious in everything that may test your Eman I see so many people face doubts and trials and put themselves in places of fitna head-on and when you tell them ah he you're a famous Danny you're a good student of knowledge why do you do this said I have strong a man I can debate I can argue I can research and unfortunately some of them end up flipping losing track we heard of some of the brothers who were students of knowledge did a lot of research and work and translated books ended up in supporting the Darwin theory after being so Salafi is so strong and a man ended up supporting Darwin's theory of evolution what more could is dead so always put this at the back of your mind do not test your email brothers say I have strongly mad and righteous and practicing I know I can give that what women so they give classes to women the women are not fully covered they chit chat they dude Shaitaan is putting his leg I know of a sister who is half of the Quran fully and she used to do tower on the internet on blogs etc and in forums I think they have and she used to say I give dower reminders to people and she used to be warned by students of knowledge that this is inappropriate restrict your Dawa to your gender don't mix and she says no no no I am doing this a few months later she fell in love with someone who is not even practicing and he's happy because he says she guided me to quitting smoking and now I don't even play music he's a musician but I want to do this and I want to do that and she is a practicing woman and they want to get married and her father refused he talked to me I met the man the man is a total waste a drug that addict used to be still have his friends from that community but look what happened to that girl why because she said I can withstand fitna no one can withstand fitna this is why you have to keep your distance if you hear of that dead jack don't say I'm a strong believer of Allah of the Quran of the Sunna nothing can harm me no the Prophet tells you stay as far as possible even if you have to run to the mountains and hide in the caves the Prophet tells you and of course if you were put in a position to meet him then recite at him the beginning of surat al-kahf the first set is of shorter calf inshallah this would protect you how would the circle on fire on how would that that gel die a question came before the Salah is that a giant alive now we said that that in the hadith of Tommy Madadi the Prophet told us that he is chained and in an island so all these years is still alive how is this possible is he Jen is he devil he is human how can a human live for 15 centuries who gives life and takes it Allah Allah virgin is the giver of life and I did not want to go into details but there is so much to it because there is a confusion among scholars whether the Dajjal has appeared at the time of the Prophet as Salam and the Prophet interviewed him and spoke to him or he is still the one on that island change the score the scholars and even the companions were split in illumiroom the Habad used swear by Allah that that the job is alive and that the Prophet met him and his name is even sayad who was a Jew but then accepted Islam and if we go into details it's going to take a little bit more time but in the beginning the Prophet Tyson did not have revelation so he thought that even sayad was the dead jack and the Prophet used to hide to hear anything that he says so that he can judge him and he met him and he interviewed him and there were so many things but again we don't want to go into details because this diverges from and the time is limited so that the gel is alive and then the gel is a human being though he claims that he is God and though he has so many miracles why would Allah give miracles to a prophet we know so that the people would believe the Prophet but if he claims to be a prophet and then he claims to be Allah and Allah gives him these miracles then why this is part of the testing Allah told you that he is a liar and he never claimed to be a prophet he claims to be a God which is far greater so there is no problem in such tests how is he killed we know that for certain he is killed by yeast of pneumonia the Prophet tells us that it is fuzzier time when reset descends the Imam is unlucky when he sees Easter coming descending with two angels what would you do tell him is the word that you really will go back this is reason but Risha peace be upon him says it was a palmer for you and you lead and the prophet told us that this is the honour of this religion that from our religion someone leads prayer with Lisa praying behind him and then he goes to meet did a job accompanied by 70 thousands of the Jews and they all have swords with them the moment the confrontation takes place and the jail sets eyes on Lisa he begins to dissolve to melt to become like salt the Prophet says as if Lisa would have left him he would have disappeared and dissolved but then the fitna would be bigger because people would say he is God he cannot be seen so Lisa runs towards him with his spear he stabs him killing him showing the people his blood on his spear as further and this happens in Palestine babban loot and the 70,000 josh what will happen to them they will start to run and the muslims would start to follow them to kill them they hide behind rocks and allah makes the rock speaks o muslim come behind me there is a jew a tree would speak except the trees of allah under this kind or type of trees are specifically associated with the jews and this is why in palestine they say they grow enormous amounts of it because it would not be any blow the whistle on the jews telling the muslims come to kill them the third sign is the death back allah says as they were in a walker how will you running him off regina l'homme de but a middle of they took a limo home and nasa can be tiene la hoopla moon this is the IR mentioning the devil in the Quran so it is in the Quran is the journey in the Quran is he ever mentioned in the Quran hinted in the Quran not at all does one come and have the audacity to say it's not in the Quran so we reject it this is the trend nowadays can you attack the Quran no I'm a hypocrite or the Willa I'd like to undermine Islam what to do if I attack the Quran you will kill me you will say he's a hippie he's a heretic this is blasphemous what you do to do attack the Sunnah but if I add that the Sunnah in general also you will kill me so what to do I say listen the Sunnis village hadith sahih there is life but if it is not in the Quran then we do not accept it it has to be in the polarization and this is how you dismantle Islam bit by bit so you end up people saying the child is not in the Quran I don't believe in it some people would say we will come to this recent memory of dissention descent to earth is not there I don't believe in it to hint at EDA is not in the Quran I don't believe in it but where are you going to the prophecy that is salatu salam I have been given the Quran and the Sunna similar to it I would not want to see one of you leaning on his couch saying what we find in the Quran we accept what's not in the Quran we reject no I was given the Quran and something similar which is the pseudonym so be careful of anyone claiming to be a scholar and rejecting things from the Sun on the grounds that is not in the Quran so many things are not in the Quran the Quran is a general book not details in the Quran we have fragile toric our mother every rakah answer for econo in the for i do we have zakat is 2.5 percent sometimes 5 percent sometimes 10% some subtle sometimes 20% different types categories of 2nd mentioned in Estonian attend the Quran and the sky is the limit Allah says and with the word of torment is fulfilled against them we shall bring out for them or we shall bring out from the earth a beast to them which will speak so the data will what we'll talk it's an animal there's no need for dr. Dolittle it's an animal that or a beast is not even an animal is something out of the kind is not a mammoth is it a dinosaur is it a lion we don't know anything but it is a beast with special powers it speaks to the people it warns the people it advises the people it gives preaching to the people Allah says a dish which will speak to them because mankind believe not with certainty in our ayat so it will preach them telling them listen this what you doing now we know that it is a great huge creation of a Maharajah that comes out when the people are corrupt in bad times speaks to them preaches them it hears it speaks and it brands you know what you have a cattle and you brand it this brand this piece does it to the humans and especially on their noses so that people would distinguish a believer from an unbeliever the Prophet cetera salatu salam when the dabeh when the Beast comes out it will brand people on their noses and those branded will live for so long new generations come and that people that you generations would say I bought a camel I bought a ride a horse so what says who did you buy it from he said I bought it from one of the branded men so this is all what we have about the Beast it will come at the time of corruption it will speak it will advise people believers would it be increased in Eman this is what the Prophet said this believers would say this is a freak this is possessed by jinn this is something out of this world we still don't believe this is the norm number four the coming or the rising of the Sun from the West every single day the Sun rises from the east except at the end of time when the Sun rises from the West we have posts on what's up saying that NASA has discovered that the rotation of the Sun is due which means that the Sun will we are free this is nonsense we believe that this is nonsense don't believe in what ever nASA says to you because we have the foreign the Sun they might be righted they might be wrong but why do I postpone and delay my Eman until NASA believes in it until I get the reports from America any for example [Music] this is coffee the Prophet said Alice saw not a sermon the holidays in sahih bukhari when a fly falls into your drink do not throw it away dip the fly in your drink again because under one wing there is illness and under the other wing there is cruel people 5060 years ago scholars of Islam I don't want to live names said what kind of I did is this this is nonsense Islam is a religion of cleanliness this is dirty I will do not believe in this hadith and the Prophet cannot say such a hadith which in Buhari the demonization behind I don't believe in it 15-20 years ago there was a study I think it's in Michigan or in Harvard School of of science proving this through the scientific fashion and means bringing test tubes and measuring the amount of bacteria etc and they've discovered that once you do this it eliminates the illness and the disease the same scholar said ok if it's proven I want to be lucky why is that because there is a u.s. Seal of Approval Muslims don't do this Muslims abide and believe because it came from the Quran and it came from dition likewise Allah told us that the Sun will come from the West at the end of the time we believe in that Allah says in the Quran do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them or that your Lord should come or that some of the signs of your Lord should come the day that some of the signs of your Lord do come no good will it do to a person to believe them if he believed not before nor earned good through his faith say wait you we too are waiting chapter 6 verse 158 the prophets told us a result that this is a sign and it's mentioned in the Quran referring to the rising of the Sun from the West we believe that this will happen once it happens your repentance cannot be accepted Halas it's over so once you see it coming from the West you say I repent I ask Allah for forgiveness Allah would not accept this from you because this is the last limit the deadline for repentance number 5 of the science is the coming of receptor Maryam peace be upon him the coming of Jesus Christ allah azza wajal told us in the Quran and this is why the Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified and that he was not killed rather Allah ascended him lifted him up to the heavens while he was alive anyone doubts this no there's any quote-unquote scholar say otherwise I don't know of that Allah says in black and white in Quran but they killed him not nor crucified Him but the resemblance of Rize was put over another man and they killed that man and those who differ therein are full of doubts they have no certain knowledge they follow nothing but conjecture for surely they killed him not but Allah raised him so if he's not crucified he's not killed and Allah raised him doing what this is what we will know insha'Allah okay an AMA says and there is none of the people of the Scriptures but must believe in him the son of Maryam before his death now before his death the death of risa or the death of the people of the scriptures so the most authentic is before the death of ISA meaning that when he comes down all those of people the Scriptures will believe in him before he dies before ISA dies and allah says in the quran and he could encode risa son of maryam shall be a known sign for the coming of the hour so these verses mentioned the coming of reason now one of the brothers brothers is telling me that there is a coat uncooked scholar saying that there is nothing to prove risa is coming down at the end of time the ayahs in the Quran we may say it's debatable it's not clear that he is coming what will we do with the Sunnah now this is where people come and undermine the son if I managed to tell you that this is not from the Sunnah effective Hadees Bukhari Muslim no no no I don't accept it then you open the door for me to say ymateb three raka I don't accept it make it four even number even number what even number even number why make it even as well why - for three are you confusing me and we come to Hajj we come to fasting we come to zakat we can manipulate and change the whole religion because it's not in the Quran and that is debatable so we what we want change and make it life not acceptable very very dangerous this is why we are known as evolution well Jamar we abide by the sooner we understand the Koran we understand the sooner through the understanding of the favorite three generations the generations of the Companions of the tambourine of the tablet ability we don't understand the Koran with our own whims and desires and yeah this is clear no what did have in our past same what did why do I need him in our past because he was the cousin of the professor he was a knowledgeable scholar he knew Arabic better than you and me and he was close to the Prophet he would ask him so he has more knowledge than you and I in understanding and by following the mainstream you are in safe grounds when will Reiser dissent we spoke about that Roger prayer when people are there after beating and our victorious over the Christians so now the resting they want to pray they hear about the Dajjal they are looking forward to fighting him when razor comes peace be upon him now a lot of the Muslims are confused yesterday sheriff you said that there is no prophet after the Prophet Isis Salam right he is the seal of the prophet hood so how come that Issa is coming back now if there is no prophet after Muhammad Ali Salaam what is one wait what is racer coming is he coming as a normal human being no you cannot strip prophethood from a prophet you cannot say okay he was a messenger for five but then he quit the job this is for life you're a prophet or a messenger so what would what do we do with within reason the Prophet is our son told us that if Musa were alive he would not do anything but follow me the Prophet was angered when he saw a piece of the Torah with Roman so she said well either someone is it's a piece of Torah of the Old Testament I'm just you know curious I want to learn and he was outraged took it from him and said if Musa was alive he would not do anything but follow me don't play analyst religion so ISA is the same thing or an is the last revelation of Allah social there is no law after the Quran no revelation after the Quran and Islam is the dominating religion until the day of judgment but Lisa would come the Prophet says by who my sword is in his hand and by Allah Issa will soon come down and he will be a fair and just ruler he will one break the cross so anywhere you find a cross he will break it he will kill the swine the pig okay sure can we kill pigs now no it's an animal it's how long for you to eat but you're not allowed to kill it when Lisa comes he will do that job for us and he will cancel the jizya the jizya we spoke about it yesterday it's the money taxation taken from the non-muslims our share wait a minute cancelling the taxation isn't it cancelling part of the religion yes but he said one who did it or the Prophet told us that it will be done it's a prophet then it is part of the religion that at this time it will be canceled and the Prophet said that money would be so much available that people are giving charity and no one would accept it to the extent that one prostration of an individual would be for him better than the whole world come here we'll give you a position I will give you land I will give you money I'm praying he diffuses because he sees that the end is near and nothing helps except being righteous how would people live in the era of research peace be upon him the Prophet told us RA salatu salam magnificent things cobras scorpions insects and animals with venom it will be taken out from them to the extent that the infant child will put her hand or its hand in the mouth of a snake and nothing happens there's no poison in these animals and a child is thrown in front of a lion and the lion doesn't do anything to it that's an infant and the wolf would be with the sheep as a shepherd and wolf is taking care of the sheep so things will be so prosperous so safe so peaceful so secure that it is so strong the strange the Prophet said al-islam the people would not form they will just address the earth grow and all of a sudden the earth grows so much Baraka and the Prophet says alayhi salatu wassalam that the pama grant would suffice a group of people won and the head of the papa grant you know the one that has like the crown if you cut it the prophets say that is Salado Sam they can stay and it is shade and it is so huge in size one fruit and the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam is telling us about the milking of the cows and of the camels and of the ship that one milking of a camel or a cow could suffice a full tribe so honey it is beyond imagination the way of blessing people will get how long will razor rain and stay on earth 40 years the jar was 40 days so this time is a time of prosperity peace no fighting no the Prophet says the hatred and enmity would be extracted from the chests of people so imagine there is no hatred no cords no fights no swearing for 40 years pieces no United Nation Hashanah so this is that of course it's this time of peace if you look what came before it you would say well I keep this piece for you I don't want to see the trouble that came before that because I don't know if I'm gonna pass this exam or not number six yet to to manage gog and magog they are mentioned in the quran yes they are mentioned in the quran in there in a couple of places one of them is surah the calf which we read and what the dhul-qarnain did with them and building this barrier this dam made of copper and iron we believe that they are in this confinement of theirs in the jail or whatever you can call it since very very long time are you talking about 300 400 years it is stated in the old ancient books that zul qarnain was a just and fair ruler he is not Alexander the Macedonian no he's not he was a contemporary of Ibrahim peace be upon him so he goes really really way back at time as historians say but we don't have any authentic information about this so we know that this barrier is built and we know that there will come a time when they will come out now how many are there their number is beyond count the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that they are at the east of us we're in East people say China Chinese are coming in and out you have no problem they have to be what underground because we I will explain this later on as for their numbers the prophet Aristotle tells us that allah azza wajal tells Adam and he says Adam and Adam says that Baker was a date this is a phrase stating that your wish is my command say whatever you want so Allah tells him get from your offspring a division for Hellfire so as it says what is the number what is the percentage I don't know and Allah says from every 1999 in help the Prophet said on a solid slab at that moment the infant's hair goes gray how to feel and all so the Companions said o prophet of Allah which one of us can be the one in exchange of 999 the prophet said is salatu salam have no fear one from you 999 from gog and magog which means that their numbers are beyond imagination and there are a number of interpretations to this hadith and another hadith which stated from every 199 1000 199 and 999 and from 199 this is a big percentage why I will not go into details one of the opinions sated that the number is not significant meaning when I say 9999 this can also be included in from every 1099 but there is a big gap other opinions stated that 99 to one is only gog and magog with the Muslims 999 to one is Gog and Magog along with the disbelievers of all other humans to the Muslims and there are different interpretations don't any bother yourself a lot with it because at the end of the day in sha allah will saved because of their number when will they be admitted out the Prophet tells us since they were jailed every morning they wake up they dig and and until they have this small opening and they see the sunlight but it is already the end of the day they want to rest so they say tomorrow we will come out and they don't say in sha Allah and when they go to sleep and wake up in the following day it is all back as it was so they start digging and digging and and this is repeated every single day until Allah allows them at the end of time to come out so when they reach this small hole they would say tomorrow we will dig it out insha Allah and when they come in the morning it's still there so they start to dig and they come out and the Prophet told us Anna salat WA Salam that when they come out there their amount their number is so huge that they pass by the lake of popery and it's called Galilee Lake in Palestine so huge topic but their amount is so great in number that when they pass by this lake when the rear of the army comes to the lake it finds no drops in it and they tell one another we heard that there was water in here imagine how many of them be able to consume all the water in this big lake Allah tests them they are so arrogant they are so powerful they're so strong that they hold their bows and arrows and they shoot the heavens and the arrows come back dipped in blood so they said okay we kill the humans we kill the earthlings and now we've killed those inhabiting the heavens fitna for them and they spread corruption in the entire earth now risa managed to kill what they did job and the Muslims now are safe from the Christians they are safe from the Durga but they can't fight those so Riza and the Muslims and the and the believers they run to the mountains fleeing them and then Riza peace be upon him asks allah azza wajal to save humanity from them so Allah sends a warm that goes into their necks and that would kill them it's a special sort of epidemic that kills cattle usually but this goes straight to them and they die in their billions it kills them all now when they killed and that [Music] they stink like anything that and the whole world is filled with their dead corpses and risa asks allah azza wajal again to save the world from this so Allah sends special types of birds with necks like camels that takes them and snatches them and throws them in valleys and places far away from the population the Prophet tells us salah salem that the muslims use the bows and arrows and Spears of gog and magog as wood for fire for seven years now you do the math what amount of wood they had left behind and after that allah azzawajal orders the heavens to rain and the rain clan is the earth until it is like a mirror clean pure and shining and this is when a new era begins of peace prosperity and the lights we come to science seven eight and nine landslides we do not know we don't have information except what the Prophet told us there will be a day of salatu salam a landslide in the east a landslide in the west and a landslide in the arabian peninsula now we can think but we don't have any information what would I think at the end of time where is America trump is dead mother where is America where is Europe where is Scandinavians where is China we all see that the focus is in Syria the Armageddon or the great battle the dissension of Asia the jab everything is happening in this area but what about the rest of ma knows best one might say maybe the landslide in the east takes care of all the non-muslims in the east and the landslides of the west takes care of those in the West and without a fossil fuel they will have no means of survival and they will become extinct maybe atomic bombs nuclear warfare a chemical warfare that takes care of them all the focus would be only in this area that we live in so we cannot elaborate more Allah knows best the final is the fire that resurrects people this is the Arabic word - show and this is not the resurrection after dying resurrection after death is definite this is simply driving people from their homes to a sham some of them would be riding in comfort because they love Allah their believers some of them would be swapping turns on one camel up to ten people and some of them will be consumed by this fire until they reach Beit al-maqdis where there will be the end of all insha'Allah how they familiar man may Allah have mercy on him said Islam will be worn out like cloth with has which has drawings or employments and it would be worn out bit by bit until it disappears until people do not know what fasting is what Salah is what hatch is what charity is and overnight the Quran will be uplifted from Earth nothing would remain from the Quran on earth not even a single ayah and even the elders among the people would remember and say oh I remember that our forefathers used to say la ilaha the law this is the only thing that remains from Islam no salat no Koran no they kill no if they say I remember long ago are people who say la ilaha illallah and thus this is why we say it and this shows you how Islam would at the end of time demolish until the day of judgement is called upon the worst of the worst no Muslims among them and associated with this would be this wind coming from Yemen which is softer than silk that does not leave anyone with an autumn weight of or an ant weight of a man in his heart except taking its own so no believer with an ant weight of a man in his heart would live this beautiful soft wind coming from Yemen would extract their souls and even if they were hiding in a cave in a mountain it will come and take their souls the Prophet says as so that only the worst of the worst would remain who do not know anything about right and wrong and the Shaitaan would call them to worship idols and they respond to his call and they will worship idols and they will be so prosperous in wealth and health as a test from allah azzawajal so that they think that they are doing all of that in thinking being deceived being tested by Allah that Allah would not give us money would not give myself if we were doing something wrong then worshipping these idols is good and this is when the day of judgement would take place on these people now with this we come to the conclusion to and of our workshop as I've stated this is a concise way but inshallah this is the most authentic of hadith there in the Sunnah that we managed to compile I pray to Allah Azza WA JAL that he makes me and you steadfast on Islam I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those knowledgable so that when we see the signs we are increased in an email in our belief and in staying committed and steadfast on Islam hada Baba who are l'm when especially me lady Aslam sallallahu wasallam Obama karate or Selena be romantic"
