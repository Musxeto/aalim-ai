  "transcript": "says sometimes and this is a problem that we all face i'm a big tipper by nature especially when i go to poor countries i'd like to have some change and just tip everybody that says it's peanuts for me for them it's something but if i find out that the tipping that i'm doing is giving me and getting me extra service then this is this becomes haram this becomes a sort of a bribe in the hadith of ibm allah be pleased with him he worked for the prophet isam the prophet used to dispatch his representatives to collect zakat so once he sent him off he came back he said okay this is your zakat a big herd of camels cows and sheep and this portion was given to me this is mine so the prophet was at islam angered by that he was outraged so i went to the pulpit and he said why do people we send them off on an errand and they come and say this was given to us and this was given to you as zakat who are you to say that this was given to us wouldn't they sat in their fathers and mother's homes and then notice and watch whether people give them anything or not those who gave you this portion gave it to you not because of the color of your eyes or how smart you are they gave it to you because of your position of this chair because i'm an administrator i can sign i can award projects likewise the waiter in a fancy restaurant when i give the waiter twenty dollars as a tip up front so that he would book me an excellent table all the tables are booked but there is something special and he would give me extra service so likewise when the company says ten dollars to wash your car and you tip the employee or the guy doing the car wash two dollars so that he would clean it thoroughly this is a bribe when would it be okay if you're gonna do it a one-timer so i wash my car he does the job i'm about to leave i give him two dollars and never come back again to him i dine in a restaurant and i put extra on the bill as a tip knowing that i'm not going to come back to him this is okay other than that it would be considered to be a bribe"
