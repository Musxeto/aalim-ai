  "title": "If I make mistake in sunnah or mandatory act in prayer, must I repeat prayer? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes if I made any mistake in Salah and after I recognized what should I do should I repeat Salah thank you are you with the congregation are you praying with the congregation or alone no alone so what is the mistake that you have done uh I am doubtful that uh uh if if hello yes I'm listening to you if I if I'm praying and I did only one and I did two if my should I repeat Salah again yes of course there is a difference between making a mistake in a Sunnah action for example raising the hands this is Sunnah if I raise one hand if I don't raise hands there's no if I raise three hands if you had three hands there's no problem because this is a Sunnah action and there are actions that are mandatory so so if you made a mistake in and said subh and then said whoops I did not say subh so you missed such a mandatory act out of ignorance out of forgetfulness we compensate this by at the end of the Salat but if you dropped something that is a pillar instead of praying four Ras of You Prayed three raas offer salutation offer and went home and then you remembered somebody called you and he said You Prayed three ra you've dropped a pillar which is a whole ra comp composed of and two and all then your prayer is invalid if you remember during the Salat before you conclude it no you make it up and you continue your Salat and Allah Knows Best"
