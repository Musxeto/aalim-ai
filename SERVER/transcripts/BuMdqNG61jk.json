  "transcript": "foreign like there's no mosque near us but the tripler app they show different um they show different ways to Mecca so we don't really know which app we should trust um what should we do in this case first of all there are conditions that must be fulfilled before a prayer if these conditions are not fulfilled without a legitimate reason then the prayer is invalid such as purity someone prays without performing wudu out of forgetfulness then he remembers afterwards his prayer is invalid someone who prays without covering his aura his prayer is invalid someone who prays before the time of the prayer so one minute Before Sunset he starts to pray his prayer is invalid and likewise someone who prays to other than the direction of the Qibla his prayer is invalid unless he was told by a Muslim who is trustworthy that the Qibla is this way and he prayed this way then he discovered that it's this way his prayer is valid because he did the best in his ability and he asked a Muslim who misinformed him or if a person is in the desert and he tried his level best to navigate and decide where the Qibla is and to the best of the ability he thought that the was here and the Qibla was there his prayer is valid because he doesn't have the means now if you are outside there is no Masjid and you have your app that says that the Qibla is this way but another app says it's this way and a third app says it's this way this slight diversion is permissible and acceptable the Qibla for the people of Medina was to the South of Medina however the prophet Allah asked about the slight diversion he said what's between the East and the West is Qibla so all of this is considered to be when there is a a slight Divergent and inability to determine so alhamdulillah you have the way to pray to the best of your ability in this case because no app would say it's this way and another one would say 180 degrees the opposite it's a slight diversion by a few degrees here and there"
