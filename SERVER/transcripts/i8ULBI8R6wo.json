  "title": "How to give dawah on social media when you don't have much knowledge about Islam Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the philippines he says what are the rules of da'wah in social media and for someone who does not have knowledge this is a no-brainer if you do not possess the necessary knowledge it is prohibited for you to make dawah because you'll cause more harm than benefit so your first step is to learn your religion to know more about islam to study the quran to say this so when you speak you speak with knowledge it's not a gut feeling that you are arguing with others over no it has to be with concrete evidences from the quran and the sunnah and from the scholars who are trusted before you open your mouth once you possess the necessary obligatory knowledge of islam then we go to the etiquettes of giving dawah to prioritize the pros and the khans to measure and outweigh the consequences of what you're going to say and this requires any more elaboration silk"
