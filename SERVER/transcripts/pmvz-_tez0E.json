  "transcript": "yes um I'm very sorry like recently um when he told me to when he told me to be talking to my father and I've been talking to him so unfortunately for me I I was unable to tell him I don't have money to he so he has been shouting he wants money he wants money he wants money I was because I was scared um of the of so many things I was scared that I I I get attack to insult him again so I decided to give him what he wants and he was very pleased with me he prayed for me and everything so now I I don't have any money to E I only have maybe like let me say 55 in my account to to hit because 10 I will pay insurance um insurance for my for where I'm living okay uh Hala is your father wealthy um he's an handicap and I don't know if he's wealthy I don't know what he into I know that he's into C sometimes already I him where he sell car do your do your do your siblings have money um my brother he's here but he does not have any paper but he has money at least like you or more exactly but he has so many he has some brothers that are very very rich and he has um he has so many wives and so many children honestly sir okay first of all this is a common mistakes unfortunately that parents tend to not fear Allah and blackmail their children especially those who are most vulnerable and in need and they exort them from for money and they keep on insisting and threatening that they'll make Dua and they will be angry and Allah will be angry with them first of all Allah says in the Quran Allah does not burden a soul Beyond what it can bear which means that as a son I'm responsible to give my parents money providing number one that they are in need so if my parents are well off or they have their essential things and Necessities they're not in need yet they demand money they demand I give them monthly uh salary I'm not obliged to obey them even if they're angry because they have enough why would I give them just because Simon says no giving them is related to their need not to their demand especially when they are well off condition number two that I have what is sufficient for me and my immediate family wife and children and that would be an excess but if my father wants money he doesn't have money and I have what is sufficient for me to pay the rent or to put food on the table should I give him and be kicked out of my house or apartment or room or should I give him and starve to death answer is no I have to first fulfill my own needs what is extra I may give it to him if he's in need number three if he's in need and I have extra money but the extra money he wants of me he wants to give to my siblings or to his wives in this case I do not have to give him a penny because that would be unfair to me why would I work hard and earn money and I give it to you so you could give it to my siblings they're not my responsibility they're yours so I will not give you anything why would I give you money when you're spending it to my stepmothers I'm not responsible for them I have to care for my needs for my future for my business for my children so I don't give him anything finally why would I be the only one giving you when you have other children you can ask from and especially if he's asking from a girl and leaving the boys who are earning and capable of working that is unacceptable and you have to draw the line how you do this this is something you have to improvise but at the end of the day do not send him anything when it's harming you personally even if he becomes mad at you"
