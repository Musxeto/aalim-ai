  "title": "Can I propose to a girl in muslim country if I live in the West (non muslim country) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign country um despite this I've still got I've got insurance I've got here I've got attention to make hija but obviously a large part of that I don't know is if or when that will happen so my question is is it uh permissible um for what a lot of people do is they marry from someone in a in a Muslim country and then they bring them to the UK so I'm asking if this is permissible and would the ruling change if I've got the Mia to make it first of all the Hijra is mandatory when you're unable to maintain your practice of Islam and the UK to my knowledge is the best country among the kafir countries where Muslims could freely practice their religion with lots of honor and dignity alhamdulillah unlike neighboring countries without giving names the downfall is soon and everybody knows who I'm talking to every country in Africa is hating their guts and trying to express their animosity to them due to what they had done but you wanting to get married you send the proposal to Pakistan or to Bangladesh to get a girl to live with you and marry her this is permissible as long especially when you have the intention to migrate and even if you did not have the intention to migrate there's no nothing wrong in that but is it the best thing to do personally and after doing so many counseling sessions I beg to differ lots of the girls and the spouses when they get married and come over to a cafe country they flip they change especially when they get the passport and they become independent they feel that I don't need this man anymore I can live the dream and be free so they don't know the culture they don't know the language and you'll have problems with the spouse visa to get her over and if she has to work if you have to work and then there's the exams and the Pledge of Allegiance and the whole nine yards if you take a local from your own ethnicity who's practicing born and bred in the UK that would be much better and your life would be much easier and there's a lot of Chemistry Between you unlike when you bring someone who's bored because she has no family she has no one to talk to in this strange country to her lots of problems take place and Allah Knows Best"
