  "transcript": "David from India says that he's responsible for an app that decides who is at fault when car accidents take place and what the compensation should be from the one who's wrong to the one who is the victim I don't see any Haram in that because this is not mandated this is not something enforced this is something usually either the government forces it and implements it and you can not do anything about it or it is something that they both agree upon that such an app would be the arbitrator between them and to set this so inshallah there's no problem in that"
