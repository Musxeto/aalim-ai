  "title": "I switched from Hanafi to Sunnah, people say this is wrong & I must follow a sect or madhab assim",
  "transcript": "all I want to say sh it's a privilege to be here it's an honor um I wanted to ask like I'm originally from Pakistan but I grew up in Saudi Arabia and uh so my parents used to follow Hani so we are Sunni Hani but when I grew up I found out that there are lots of B that we do we do Quan We Do you know 40 days after death we do another har p and when we buy a new house we do Har p and things like that so I slowly St away away from Han so now I follow alhamdulillah I found your videos which I find really beneficial and I try to follow sunah Quran from what did but lots of people tell me that this is wrong you must follow a set what you're doing is not right so I want to ask is it m to follow a SE the prophet sallallah alai is the one who we ordered to follow Allah says in the Quran on the day of judgment Allah will call them and say what did you respond to the messengers so Allah will not ask you on the day of judgment what did you respond to IM Ahmed or IM Muhammed or to IM Malik or to IM abif he will ask you what did you respond what did you do with this verse of Quran that came to you or with this authentic Hadith that was reported to you this is what Allah would ask you upon however we most likely are not qualified to know what is a Quran verse or what is a Hadith the vast majority of Muslims especially non-arabs if you say to them tell me which Surah and raise your hands if you know you might get a price you might I'm I don't know the organizers mallah they have a lot of money they invited me in so they can afford it so raise your hand if you know which Surah this is okay which chapter it's a Hadith it's not an Ayah majority almost I thought it was in no it's not it's not so this is a problem lots of the Muslims don't know the difference between a verse of the Quran and Hadith then they say oh should we follow an IM of course you should follow an Imam you don't have what it takes what is this SK is there full come on guys you you're really making me scared all of these are for questions this going to be a long night y so we don't have the ability the tools needed to segregate or to differentiate which which is right and which is wrong because we're Layman I'm a layman in mechanics so when my car breaks I'm not going to open the hood and say hm let me think no I'm not going to think I'm going to call AAA I'm going to call a mechanic I'm going to call a friend that knows how to deal with it the same thing in Islam you don't have what it takes to come and think I'm going to follow this no the Hani school is wrong what do you know what's right and what's wrong you don't have the knowledge to discredit an opinion from Hani school or sha school or whatever school just because you read an article here or there doesn't make you a student of knowledge if you're a highly decorated student of knowledge knows Arabic knows the Quran knows the Hadith and can cross reference and examine different opinions of schools of thought yes you can do that otherwise you have to follow not a sect not a maab you have to follow an IM a trusted individual that you know his religious commitment that he does not have any weird views that he's always been consistent that his knowledge is acceptable he doesn't have weird opinions that go against the mainstream of Islam and you should follow him in whatever he tells you most likely this individual would be a follower of one of the four main schools of thought so you follow baz you're in good hands you follow you're in excellent hands with the grace of Allah and the more these are prone to fall into temptation and fitna the better they are they're dead so they're definitely not going to go for something uh uh that suits the highest bidder the living ones you never know if I'm a family man if you push me too far I just might so you never know no follow those who you can trust and you can believe in and on the day of judgment you're saved and Allah knows rest"
