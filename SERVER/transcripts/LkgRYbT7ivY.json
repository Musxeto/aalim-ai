  "transcript": "you I chose with the grace of Allah should speak to you about a hadith a prophetic saying over an incident that took place 15 centuries ago most Muslims know it by heart but the lessons that we should learn from such a hadith are many and the impact over our lives is enormous this hadith was reported by Imam Ahmed in the muslin and by Abu Dawood and an SAE in the student the hadith it was narrated by Murad II who jebel and remembered his name more as a blue job le he said the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam once took my hand and said to me / hath by Allah I love you by Allah I love you he repeated it twice so more and reciprocated and said and I love you as well a prophet of Allah then the Prophet Elias thought was sallam said tomorrow at Omaha I advise issue do not forget at the end of every prayer to say Allah whom I knew an addict Rica was shocked Rica was nearing attic oh allah help me to remember you give thanks to you and worship you in the best way . end of the hadith that's nice but as they say a big loaf of bread but where's the beef so that your eyes great the supplication the vacation is great the relationship between the prophet or sermon is companion is great so what's the big deal well this is what we will attempt insha Allah in the coming minutes to try and take a glimpse of how beautiful this hadith is now who is this individual whom the Prophet at his salat WA Salam takes his hand and swears not only once but twice that he loves him who is this man never heard of him either Shiva don't know him so who is this person well a spoiler alert why didn't a German he was one of the head of his tribes when the people of Medina went to Mecca on hatch on what is known as a lockable Athenian to give the plant their pledge of allegiance to the Prophet and it's awesome and invite him to migrated to Medina so they sent their invoice to represent all the different tribes of Medina Muhammad Japan was one of them imagine that he was only 16 years of age yet he was the representative of his tribe he came and gave the Pledge of Allegiance historians describe him as being a tall handsome man with a sound intellect and he was obeyed among his people being 16 and having all these attributes in you me is that you one heck of a guy now not only he was obeyed by his people imagine that Mahad imageable was the very one of the very few allowed to give fatwa at the lifetime of the Prophet Ali Sabbah - Salam which means that this person is not something to take lightly there were many companions and scholars among the companions yet at the time of the Prophet Elisha lucidum he was the reference you had the problem you go ask him but to delegate this to morph means that this person was one among the elite when it came to proper knowledge about Islam for an end sooner and this is why the prophet alayhi salat wa salam singled for people of his companions that we should learn the quran from and when he said learn the quran from for who are they one abdullah even mr. hood to obey him no cab free want image even for salim the freed slave of abu hanifa so Morath is not your average Oh more antimony Java was a real piece of work his salat wa salam said something about him that he never said that about any other companion he said that on the day of judgment Mahad will precede all the scholars by a stone or throw meaning that he would come ahead of them all due to his knowledge laughs this kiddo yep this kiddo is not something to just simply look into without paying a lot of respect to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam sent Mahad to Yemen as a judge as a Mufti as a teacher and as a ruler as well Omar may Allah be pleased with him the second caliph used to say whoever wants to learn he must come to my live new job Ellen so now you have you may have a glimpse of why would the Prophet al-assad sonim take hold of this man's hand and swear twice to him that he loves him now the prophets war twice but I Allah which means that it is permissible to swear this is not taking a less name in vain so if there is something that you would like to reiterate you swear so you I swear to say the truth nothing but the truth so help me Allah no problem you can swear because when you are in a court the judge says to you swear so that I can tell that you're telling the truth when someone is not believing in what you say you say well why I said the truth so there's nothing wrong in swearing when there is a need for it what is not permissible is to swear on every tiny menu thing this is disrespectful to Allah so someone asks you did you do excuse me boo as an avalanche iPad fell on my surface pro we had a problem at home do la Houston we're safe so someone asked me did you do this or do that something trivial and so what law I didn't do it and I keep on swearing on every single thing that I do or don't do this is not permissible because this is taking Allah's name without any benefit without any real need for that Allah says in the Quran and protect your oaths but follow ie Manickam so we cannot use or say or swear like this without any justification ok what did the Prophet Isis on swear over he said wallah he in me ok book what I love you now it is worth noting that the Arabs used the word love to me in real love not physical love like it's used in English now if you go to someone is ill oh man hey bro I love you too excuse me I'm straight man don't don't talk to me like this they're thinking of love is to do with something that is not natural in the Arab world the Arabs use the word to love meaning that to like to adore not physically but as a human being so this is common between the same gender without any bad intention intended and this is part of our religion to love one another and not only that it is part of our religion too they to that person that we love him the Prophet said nada he saw it wasn't in an authentic hadith if one of you loves his brother he must notify him he must tell him and there is another hadith where the prophet has a son was sitting with his companions once and one of his companions said to him o prophet of Allah do you see that man by Allah I love him so the Prophet asked him my son did you tell him did you notify him no I said no so the Prophet said that is awesome go and tell him so the man went to that brother and said by Allah I love you for the sake of Allah and the man said to him may allah azza wajal love you as you love me for his sake this is an etiquette that the vast majority of us have abandoned love can only be for the sake of Allah can only be in Allah Almighty and people nowadays have twisted things they love and hate for the sake of this life this dunya not for the sake of Allah Allah so I love you for what you have in your bank account for the authority that you can bring me you have what we call wasa fun you can pull some strings here and there and help me get a job have a reservation - on an airline nobody's flying but keep on hoping and wishing and you can do a lot of things for me so I love you not for the sake of Allah for the sake of this world and this is not part of our religion our religion is based on allegiance to Allah Azza WA JAL and those who are with him and to love Allah and those who love Him the Prophet Ali saw - Salam described and gave us the example of this religion of being like not when you have a knot and another knot tied to it so he said faiths not the faith of MA the Eman and the knots of it are the the most strongest of all knots is to have the allegiance for the sake of Allah and the enmity for the sake of Allah and to love for the sake of Allah and to hate for the sake of Allah so share do we have hatred in our religion do we have in Mitte in our religion yeah excuse me definitely we do we're not monks we're not robots we're human beings and these emotions are part of our nature however Islam tells you to muscle such negative feelings and channel them within the parameters of Islam so that Allah Azza WA JAL would approve of what you do when we have allegiance to our brothers who are Muslims and practicing Islam properly this is part of our religion when we have enmity and hatred to those who oppress --tz-- the Muslims step on their necks kill them expel them from their homes and then you wait for me to give or turn the other cheek after you have been hit right left and center we are out of cheeks so yes it is part of their religion we don't have enmity or hatred against others we have no beef with them it's not because their eyes are blue or green and they're fair in color out below I have many great Muslims who are blond and blue eyes our beef with these people is that they disbelieve in Allah they go against the law of Allah and not only that they attack and oppress Muslims this is where a Muslim should stand up for his beliefs Islam is the religion of peace without weakness Islam is the religion of pride without arrogance Islam is a religion of strength without violence but Muslims don't know that and the people don't want you to know that they want you to bow down keep your head low and whatever people do to you just be the weakest link and swallow your pride this is not what true Islam is you have to have the balance the honor and the dignity of Islam so going back to our beautiful hadith was more hath the only one whom the Prophet Isis unloved definitely not the prophet sallallaahu re sallam used to love many of his companions he used to love the people of al ansar and he declared that I love the people of Medina and they are the most beloved to my heart he used to love Abu Bakr and no one and I mean no one came to the level of Abu Bakr in the heart of the prophet alayhi salaatu stem he said he was asked by I'm Ruben and asked may Allah be pleased with him and he's no prophet of Allah whom is it that you love most so the Prophet said nyesha his beloved wife I'm gonna said no no I meant from among the men so the Prophet said her father his father is Abu Bakr the first caliph and the best man in Islam after the prophet alayhi salat wa salam also there are many Hadees stating that the Prophet used to love his grandchildren and has an an adverse Ain and he used to love his previously adopted son Zaidan - and his son who salmon is 8 and many others so going straight to the hadith the Prophet said are in salat wa salam to Murad do not leave after every salat to say to supplicate to invoke to make du'a to Allah Sojin say what our prophet of allah we will dissect what the Prophet Allah system advised and the time would not be sufficient for us to elaborate and people say come on this is an exaggeration there are only a handful of words what do you mean that the time this is not sufficient to elaborate because we tend to read and count with our eyes and not with our hearts so let's go on a journey of Eman and belief and the first instruction was the Prophet said say o Allah help me to remember you oh Allah help me help you what do you mean by help you see I was help to us unless assistance to us is not something exhilarating that we can do without our existence is dependent on a laws help to us and you cannot live prosperous progress move on with your life if you cannot do that if you do not seek Allah's guidance assistance and help and this is why if you want to gather the treasures of paradise on the day of judgment when you enter paradise for eternity and you see your home and you see that you have lots of treasures and you ask where did I get this from well the Prophet says alayhi salatu salam la hawla wala quwata illa billah is one of the treasures of paradise when you say and this is not brainwashing this is heart cleansing when you say there is no power and no strength except with Allah subhanAllah if you say this phrase over and over again depending only on Allah trusting only Allah believing only in Allah nothing can happen in this universe without a Las permission so when you want something to happen do not depend on your own intellect don't depend on your own strength and muscles don't depend on your qualifications your bank account all of this can turn into vapor in no time all of this can go and this covered 19 has proved to the whole world but we are weak and without Allah the Almighty we are helpless we have no hope and this is why so many people turned back to Allah so JAL acknowledging their arrogance and ignorance and confessing that there is no strength or might there's no power except with Allah Almighty so Allah helped me to remember you seeking Allah's help is what the Prophet used to erase awesome always advise his companions he used to say to been our best either as deaf as a Leela when you ever you ask ask Allah whenever you seek help and assistance seek it only from Allah and asking allah azzawajal is worshipping him and that's why every single salat every single prayer when we stand in front of allah minimum five times a day we recite in every unit in every rakah and we say 'ya can I put what ya canister een which means you alone or Allah we worship and you alone o Allah we ask for help so you are poor unless Allah makes you rich you're sick unless Allah makes you healthy you're helpless unless allah azza wajal comes to at your assistance and this is why part of the profits Dora was oh Allah assist me Allah helped me and don't help others over me or against me so help me to remember you and by Allah this is one of the most beautiful things that you can ask Allah Allah we by nature are negligent we tend to forget we can forget our own kids the missus tells me by this when you go shopping and I come back and I said well I I forgot and seriously I forgot I forget things and this is human nature but unfortunately the most thing that I forget is Allah so my priority list is long Allah is not on my top choices so there's always my entertainment my business my cash my kids my wife my relatives my friends my hobbies things that I wanna do and then at the end of the list is Allah and this is totally wrong because we are dependent on Allah Azza WA JAL whomever whomever Allah helps and assists you will find his tongue remembering Allah 24/7 so he will always be reciting the what reading the Quran his earth car his protection the invocations that he says in the morning and in the evening before going to bed and after the five mandatory obligatory prayers before leaving home before eating before entering the toilet after exiting the toilet there are a set of applications and invocations that we say those whom Allah helped would succeed in saying it and observing it and then it would rarely be possible for this person to be afflicted with an evil eye with envy with jinn possession or with black magic because like you have antiviruses in your pc's this guy is protected those who Allah does not assist in help you would rarely find him reading a daily portion of his or an he always complains of lack of time of being lazy and he didn't he does not know the poor guy that Allah did not intend good for him and Allah did not intend good for him not because Allah doesn't love him because that person that particular individual he chose not to care for allah azza wajal and not to remember him Allah says in surah at-taubah chapter 9 about the hypocrites who did not March with the Prophet SM on the ninth year of hijra to Tabuk and they lag behind Allah says and if they had intended to march out certainly they would have made some preparations for it but Allah was averse to their being sent forth so he made them lag behind and it was said to them sit you among those who sit at home Allah Allah Allah owns this universe Allah created it Allah provides for it Allah is most powerful we have no other choice but to express our humility our poverty to him in submission and asking him 24/7 to help us and assist us to remember him to do thicker to engage in being conscience being conscious that he's watching us that he wants us to do the right thing that he wants us to be good to humanity to everything and this is our religion this is phrase 1 oh Allah help me to remember you then what to give thanks to you so all praise is due to allah azza wajal and whoever whomever allah assists and helps you will find him always expressing his gratitude with his heart with his rhetoric and with his actions Allah says in the Quran work you or family of the root or family of David work with thanks but few of my slaves are grateful those whom Allah leaves alone unassisted those whom Allah does not help you would always find them whining and complaining of the lack of provisions of the amount of worries and trouble they're going through they never seem to express their gratitude to Allah's many favors and blessings upon them so their eyes and ears are not protected from watching and lit and listening to haram their tongues are not prevented from profanity and obscene words their hands are not extended to help the poor the orphans and the needy and their limbs do not or are not utilized in worshipping Allah so through prayer and fasting you need a less help to be able to express your gratitude because if you don't express your gratitude then Allah so JAL would punish you not necessarily today or tomorrow because we have the day of reckoning the day of judgment so many people think that it's me I know everything it's what I do it's my knowledge Subhan Allah Allah Azza WA JAL got you out of your mother's womb to this world unable to see unable to speak and unable to think Allah gave all of that to you and made you who you are and now this is pay pay time you say no I'm the one who went to college I'm the one who managed to pull different strings here and there and get a good job I'm the one who's successful in investing my money in different portfolios now I'm a rich man all of this can go but so many times Allah keeps it on coming to you so that you still live in this big lie only to be shocked when death comes and the shock of Oh is even greater in your grave and what awaits you on the day of judgement is horrific may allah azzawajal protect us all so oh allah help me to remember you to give thanks to you and finally and worship you in the best way why did the Prophet says Sam in the best way he would have I could have said and worship you because every Tom Dick and Harry on earth claimed to worship Allah as ocean so we all agree there's only one God so you go to the Christians you go to the Jews you go to the Buddhists you go to whomever you want to go regardless of the number of gods they claim to have they all come to the conclusion that all of these are referring to one so even the Christians when they say that Jesus is the Son of God they come to confess and say yeah before Mary got pregnant with Jesus he didn't exist there was only the father so hamd Allah this is what we are hinting to there's only one God that exists in the beginning there was God there was a lot and there was nothing and I mean nothing with him he created everything we see he's the first without a beginning and he's the last without an end he's unlike anything that could cross your mind and any person when he reflects on his own he believes and acknowledges that there's only one God one Allah one creator of the heavens and the earth so we have no problem in that but the Prophet says and assist me to worship you in the best way because all these religions claim that they are right and not possible to have all of them saying left right front back and then all be being right they can only be one religion and the acid-proof is the Quran that we have open it look into it and you will find that it is crystal clear you don't have to be rocket science to understand the Koran this revelation came 1,500 years ago it is for all mankind for those who are laymen for farmers for new surgeons for people in Alaska for people in Siberia for people in the jungles of Africa it is for all of them and it is had stood the test of time it's the only scripture on earth that was revealed 14 or 15 centuries ago and still intact we do not have virgins of the Koran the Revised Standard Version Kings James Version do a virgin and different copies of it it's one Quran and it's in the same language it was revealed in so we don't have a translation of translation of translation of a translation and this language is used by not less than 400 million 500 million Muslims on earth they speak it they know it they understand it if we were to gather all copies of the Koran and burn them to the ground we have no problem because tomorrow we have more than 30 million Muslims who memorized the Quran by heart they will scribe it from scratch not a single letter added or deleted so the religion of Islam is the religion accepted by the sight of allah azza wajal and anyone who's objective would understand that this is the ultimate religion and the final revelation and the perfect way of life and it is standing that's test of time it is the only religion that people embrace in great numbers no matter how bad you tarnish its reputation through the medium and the media is doing a great job in tarnishing the reputation of Islam I know this I'm a man of the media and I've seen what they can do they can bring you a script they already have something in their mind they write a script of what we got to do and what is the conclusion and then they start shooting footage of 30 40 hours and then cut and paste and edit and make it come to life as they want it from the beginning so they're not objective they don't want the truth they want to convey to you what they believe Islam is standing firm and people are coming into Islam without any effort from our side I'm not doing anything it is Allah who's guiding these people so when you ask allah azza wajal to assist you in worshiping him in the best of way that is to worship him according to islam and not only that to purify your Islam from innovations from things that are not related to it because the perfection of Islam depends and relies on you following the real Islam the pure form of Islam that came to us through the Quran and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet sallallaahu Selim with the understanding of the three favorite generations the generations of the companions the generations of the terrain and the generation of tobira cabanne they're the best and cream of the humanity they know and understand or an and the sooner as it was revealed and given if you manage to worship Allah and Allah shall assist you to worship Him subhana wa ta'ala in the best of way then you are on the right track so we have like six minutes to go vanish"
