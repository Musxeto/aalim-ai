  "transcript": "al hein from canada says the hadith of abu sayyad whoever sees an evil act he must forbid it or change it with his hand if not possible with his tongue with his rhetoric if not possible with his heart so what is the meaning of this hadith this hadith categorizes the ability of the individual to change an evil so changing an evil with your hand is only possible in certain places upon those whom you have the right to change using force such as your wife such as your children or if the muslim ruler sees evil among his subjects he has the authority to change it with his hand the muslim judge the police officer they can enforce the sharia forcefully with their hands because this is the authority given to them by allah i cannot change it by hand upon people whom i don't have authority over so my colleague at work comes and he places his cigarettes back on the desk i see it and i know it's evil so i go to it and i open it and i break all the cigarettes and i throw it he says what are you doing he says this is an evil and i can change it with my hand no wrong answer this is an evil correct you have no authority over it i have no authority in breaking into my neighbor's house because he's raising the volume of the music and it's coming to me in my house i have no right to do this so we have to understand that the authority is given by allah to those who are allowed to change it with their hands if i can't change it with my hand i must change it with my rhetoric with my tongue not go and lick it changing it with your tongue it's you speaking so i go to my friend say you don't don't you know that smoking is haram this is evil you're wasting the other day i was talking to people and saying that buying a pack of cigarette is a waste of money you pay two years for this and people started laughing he said check today's was like 30 years ago now it's something like 25 or something like that that's whoa what how and still people smoke so i can talk i can go to my neighbor and remind him of allah i can see someone not praying a total stranger so i can do this everybody can do that if you are unable to do that either because you are afraid so someone is on his table with a bottle of scotch half empty his eyes are glowing red and he has a 45 magnum in his hand playing with it so i know that if i go and say fear allah drinking intoxicant this haram is going to shoot me right between the eyes should i do this huh no definitely not what to do i cannot change it with my hand i cannot change it with my rhetoric then i have to resent it with my heart and acknowledge that this is an evil act on allah azza knows best yesterday"
