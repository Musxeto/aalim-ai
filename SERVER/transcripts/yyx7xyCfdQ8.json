  "title": "Is young widow sinful if she rejects proposals cuz she wants to be with her husband in jannah #assim",
  "transcript": "the first question is from Kieran and it says a young woman's husband died she received good proposals after her husband's death but she rejected them because she wanted to be with her husband in Jannah people said she's sinful for rejecting what Allah sent her is this true this is an issue related to a person's preference is it true that a woman if Allah wills and she enters Jannah that she would be with her husband the answer is if they're both sentenced and graced by Allah to be in Jannah the woman the wife would be with her last husband so if she only married one she will be with this one but if she married three the most authentic opinion is that she would be with the last one of them therefore if a woman is widowed and thinks that due to her love to her husband that she doesn't want to get married and there is no fitna upon her she doesn't have the fear of falling into sin because of not having a man if in this case this is permissible this is her right no one can say she's sinful or no one can blame her for this especially if she has children and she is devoting herself to raising her children but if there is fitna or if she fears that she may need to get married later on five ten years but then she would be not wanted due to her age in this case she must accept whatever proposals good proposals that come her way and this is part of what Allah has decreed upon her and she would be happy to fulfill such a decree having said that it is not true that it is recommended that she stays unmarried so that she would be with her husband all the hadiths in some of the companions uh taking a promise from their spouse not to marry afterwards is not authentic they're all weak and having said that again it's up to a woman's preference so many of the companions of the Prophet salaam female companions ended up marrying a second and a third person after their husbands for example may Allah be pleased with her she was married to jafarib when he died she married Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him and when he died she married her former the brother of jaffar so this shows us that this is something that was normal and it is only according to human nature Allah Knows Best"
