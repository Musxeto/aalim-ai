  "transcript": "says my question is sometimes we say Allah Azza WA JAL is kind or He loves us oh he gets angry if so-and-so sin is performed so isn't this emotions and feelings and does Allah Azza WA JAL have feelings may Allah subhana Allah okay bless all of us first of all Allah Azza WA JAL to believe in him we have to negate and we have to make things affirmative so when we negate we say Allah Allah there is no God and we affirm that worthy of being worshipped except Allah so there is no God worthy of being worshipped we negate and we make an exception and we affirm it by saying in la la likewise when it comes to the beautiful names and attributes of Allah as mat la raza Fatiha when we come to a smell I was referred to who are Zia gel the rule of thumb as stated in so many books of al-qaeda for Alison o Jamar and the easiest and the best among them is a lot a diversity of Cheryl Islam in tamiya in the very beginning of immediately after the introduction that we believe in allah azza wajal and part of our belief in allah is that we do not describe Allah Almighty except with what Allah has described himself or his messenger sallallahu wasallam described his Lord by does it sound logical to me and you definitely yes this is the natural thing that we only believe we only describe Allah Azza WA JAL by what he described himself by or by what his messenger sallallaahu Shalem who no one in this universe knows him more than him salah salem among the humans described him by so if a scholar comes or a companion of the prophet s term comes and says allah is so-and-so we ignore this and neglected why because allah azza wajal described himself and his messenger described him to us so we don't accept any description other than that basic basics common sense common sense part of the Islamic appeal then Creed definitely yes by these guidelines when we come to what Allah has described himself as brother Hamid said Allah is pleased Allah loves Allah is angered by so all of these are part of Allah's attributes mentioned in the Quran mentioned in the Sunnah Allah loves this is so many times repeated in the Quran Allah hates or abhors Allah Allah's anger and wrath this is also found in the Parana nation so who knows better than Allah Asian nobody so we say that allah azza wajal as he described himself we attribute to him his attributes he described himself to us so we except this one says does this mean that Allah has feelings does this mean that Allah is sad or Allah is wait wait wait don't go overboard whatever Allah describes himself that's good whatever Allah does not describe himself nor his messenger other sort of Salam you refrain and abstain you cannot say there's a lot dude this or that where it's not found in the coronor in the authentic Sunnah so your question does Allah have feelings the word feelings is inappropriate because it is never mentioned neither than the Parana listener if you ask me there's a lot of I said yes because he told us he loves anyone he didn't who denies this is a committing an act of he is close to committing an act of apostasy because he's saying Allah says in allahu yuhibbu machine Allah loves those who are kind he says no no Allah doesn't love you were falsifying the Quran so no no Allah did not want this you are telling us what Allah did not want though Allah I told us so this is a very serious issue that a lot of the Muslims out of ignorance has had fallen in we only attribute to Allah and describe Allah but what he had described himself or his messenger sallallaahu salam so to answer a question we cannot say that Allah has feelings and we cannot say that Allah does not have feelings because neither one came to us in the Quran and the Sunnah but we approve what Allah described himself by Allah knows best"
