  "transcript": "I mean dad Joseph says what the Prophet alehsalaam did in his life is this considered to be swindler whatever the Prophet did is I mean his life is this considered to be sooner the answer is Sunnah is defined by three or four things the first thing is that whatever the Prophet Allah salatu salam had said this is his verbal sunnah so when the Prophet says alisov Salam do this or do that when you enter the Masjid enter it with your right foot and say bismillah Aloha Mahalo salam ala muhammad alarm of the hey Baba romantic so this is a Sunnah the Prophet told us to do this then you have the actions so when you hear or read the hadith where the Prophet has Sam like in the hadith or Omar may Allah be pleased with him in sahih bukhari that the Prophet used to raise his hands a little awesome in salat when he offers the first stock beer Allahu Akbar and then when he offers Recor Allahu Akbar and then he raises his head Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah so these are three tight places in prayer that the Prophet used to raise his hands this is part of the Sunnah because the companion described the prophet of Allah saw some the Prophet did not order it but he did it so verbal action and approval and this is when the Prophet Adam did not say it and he did not do it but he did not comment on it so this is also Sunnah the Prophet once prayed alpha s Allah Allah and after prayer he saw a man praying two Rakas to a near a pillar so he went and stood by him and he said his father for is fragile four so the man could concluded his prayer quickly and said o prophet of Allah I left home I did not pray the two records of Sunnah of Roger and when I reached a message you've started the congregation prayer so I joined you and now I'm making up for these two mr. kise so the Prophet hasn't left he did not say no that's wrong but he didn't even say oh you did well the scholar said because he did not comment this is an approval which means that this is Sunnah so these are the three types of Sunnah there is a fourth type which is the physical description of the Prophet Isum how he looked how big his eyes were how black his hair was the color and the tone of his skin etc now tell sieves question is what the Prophet is awesome had done in his life is it Olson and answers no answering the call of nature is not a Sunnah the way that he went from one place to the other whether riding a camel or a mule is not as soon these are normal things that people do wearing the turban and covering the head this is not a Sunnah this is the customs wearing an along guy and wearing a certain dress this is not a certain that this is what the Arabs used to wear at the time so if I come and say no I'm gonna follow the Sunnah and do what the Prophet used to do as some in such a fashion like going to my office tomorrow morning on a mule that would be ridiculous it's not a Sunnah the Prophet did not order us to ride the mule to work and he did not recommend that so this is something that the Prophet used to do due to customs duty traditions it has nothing to do with the religion so not everything that the Prophet had done at Islam is part of the Sunnah unless it is related to the religion or he recommended that and Lazo gel knows best the last last question in tonight's episode abdullah says as wondering many muslims where the thobe the the juba and the CUFI hat and call it sooner but it is but is there any proof that they are Sunnah would it be lawful to call the coffee and the Juba again this is similar to the previous question these are not part of the Sunnah because the Prophet did not order the side asam to wear a cofee which is the head cap or to wear a Juba like this or to wear a soap like the white one I'm wearing this is not part of sunan this is part of customs so it is not something that you would be rewarded for because the Prophet did not order us to do it I saw some and he did not wear it himself like we do and sometimes this would not be even recommended so if you're in the States or in Europe and you decide to wear the Arab soap while preaching the people and everybody is in their three-piece suit this is what the norm they do this is what they wear so you would stand out in the crowd and people may not listen to your teaching because they think that you're teaching a culture related to Arabs not the religion of Allah Azza WA JAL and therefore it is permissible to wear this when you travel if it is part of your customs if it's part of your country's costume no problem but if it's not and you are from a country that do not wear such clothes maybe that would be an attire of Fame though Bashara that people would look at you and you would feel proud of yourself and hence you'll be sinful the Prophet hasn't forbade us from wearing something that would make us proud and stand out in a crowd like a person wearing a pink suit for example Wow everybody's looking at him but yes this is not something recommended in Islam and it depends on the pros and the cons depends on the advantages and disadvantages to those who you are giving Dawa and calling them and Allah so Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila ceremony come warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
