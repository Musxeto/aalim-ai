  "transcript": "if someone is making wudhu and we know that making wudu minimum is once and maximum is thrice so washing the face one two three washing the arms to the elbows one to three wiping the head and the ears once only washing the feet to the ankles one to three you choose one or two or three times so what happens if someone exceeds three he's sinful because he went against the instruction of the prophet sunnah but does this impact the validity of his wudu or revolution the answer is no if he goes to wash his arms five times this is sinful but his wudu is still valid and intact it does not impact it at all"
