  "title": "The three Fundamental Principles (Thalaathat-ul-usool) Part 7 - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm alive man about him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik alaa rahmatan lil al-amin the BNI muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa softly woman instead be happy hey worse than Nevison natty he led a man I do assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and we resumed talking about Salathe too soon for Imam Mohamed Naguib and the last time we covered the rest of talking about Islam and as you recall when we want to define and talk about the religion of Allah because the three fundamentals the three principle of fundamental of these principles are first to know Allah secondly to know your religion thirdly to know your messenger and these are the questions you will be asked about in your grave so the two angels hunka work here will come to you and ask you who is your Lord what is religion and what did this man or who is this man who came to you what did this man do and you have to answer these questions in order to be saved in your grief the account the ability the questioning the reckoning on the day of judgment is a different story so this is why we are studying it so that we can each other prepare for these questions not only by knowledge but by action because knowing it would not help you they leave you won't be able to answer just by simply memorizing it your way of life is what will enable you to answer or will tell you to answer not protect us all so we spoke about Islam and the pillars of Islam we said that there are six pillars of Eman the first one is to believe in Allah and we spoke about that and today we will speak about the second pillar which is the angels and this came in - in the hadith of Jibril which we also talked about when he came in the shape of a man that nobody knew and he asked the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a number of questions among them where was what is Islam what a man stood rafasa LP man is to believe in Allah and we talked about that then he said and took me Nabila he were mad Ekati and to believe in his angels now has anyone of us seen the answer is no then why is it an article of Eman to believe in them because Allah complimented the Muslims for believing in the unseen we have not seen a la serda we have not seen heaven and hell we have not seen the Devils we have not seen the torment of the grave we have not seen the beginning of the creation of this universe yet we believe in it as if we had seen it not conviction in it is unconditional unquestionable why because this is what Islam is all about to believe and have the conviction of whatever Allah tells us or his messenger sallallaahu are the you are he was hello and angels are a creation allah azza wajal if you read the Quran and the Sunnah you will find a lot of information about them for example what were they created off the angels were created of light the origin of their creation is light while the origin of our creation as human beings is clay so you and the origin of the creation of the devil's Satan and his offspring is fire so these are three different sources of creation when were they created this is something we have no knowledge of Allah did not disclose that to us but we certainly know that they were created before the humans because in Chapter two allah azza wajal tells us about the conversation that took place between him and the angels when he said to them that i would be creating a human to succeed one another on earth and the angel said why would you create something that would cause corruption and bloodshed and Allah said I know and you do not know so we know that became before the creation of mankind how big are they well we know that they are powerful creatures of allah allah azzawajal says o you who believe protect yourselves from a fire that in fuel our people and rocks and supervising such a fire are angels who are tough and rough they do not disobey Allah social and they do exactly what they're commanded to do the greatest of all angels is gibreel peace be upon him the Prophet said that is the last time I saw him once in his original form sitting on his throne blocking what I can see between the heavens and the earth so he's blocking the whole horizon and he had 600 wings falling from them diamonds and rubies and emeralds and precious stones this was gibreel among the great huge angels are the carriers of the throne and we know that there are eight angels carrying the throne on their shoulders back the Prophet said erase thoughts and I was permitted to speak about one of those who carry the throne between his earlobe and his shoulder the distance of 700 years for a traveler to cross 700 years to travel the street from the distance of his earlobe to his shoulder they have a wings of as I've just stated about you breathe and Allah so as I mentioned in surah father that they have wings in twos threes or fours so how to imagine that it's beyond imagination so we just believe in and whenever the name angel crosses your mind is synonymous with beauty if you read short useless when use of peace be upon him was given half of the human Beauty when he entered upon the women as the wife of that he's plotted so that they would not blame her for falling in love with him when they saw him they accidentally cut their hands with the knives instead of cutting the fruit they were so mesmerized and they said no this is not a human being this is an honorable angel so our nature states that angels are beautiful Devils are a living and they are not in one category or one level they differ in their sizes in the physical appearance in their status as angels and the Prophet said at his salat WA Salam when asked why did you feel she bleed ask what do you think what do you consider the people of the Battle of better and the Prophet said Alastair and those are among the best of us and Jibreel said also we angels believe that the angels who attended the Battle of better are among the best of the Angels they do not drink they do not eat as mentioned in the Quran and they continue to Prophet Ibrahim and they refrain from eating they are never bored or tired from worshiping allah azza wajal they they glorify allah in the day and night how many of them either well this is something that only Allah Allah knows and Allah says in the Quran wanna animals you know allahu and no one knows soldiers of her Lord except him but the Prophet told us alehissalaam say that there is a structure on the seventh heaven and it's called a little moon and this was mentioned in the Quran Allah swore by and this structure some say is parallel to the Kaabah and it is to the angels similar to the Kaaba to the humans the Prophet told us that is awesome that every day 70,000 angels enter that structure and when they leave they never returned back to it again so you do the count every day 70,000 of angels enter so in like a week that's half a million in a month that's two million and a large Delta knows how many months had passed since angels have been entering that structure at rate and mam or do you clean up their names we should we know G will we know Myka ill we know it's our field and these three are the top three angels and they're responsible for giving life gibreel gives the spiritual life because he's responsible for revelation and way he's the one who conveys the Quran that divides their hearts to the Rafah terrain so much wisdom it's revealed is the one who is responsible for blowing the trumpet so that the people would be resurrected and they will be reborn again for the Day of Judgment mikheil is the one responsible for rainfall so he's the one who gives life to earth through growing the crops that animals and humans need as for Malik he's the one in charge of Hellfire and we know that he has 19 or they're 19 angels only taking care of Hellfire those in it so you can imagine how powerful these angels are there is monkara when Akhil and they are the two angels that come in a very horrible appearance to the people when they are in their graves to give them the questions that would determine whether they will wait in a garden of paradise in the graves or it would be a pit of hellfire there is helped and marut and they were mentioned in surah al bala who descend to earth and to test the people asking them not to follow them and not to learn from them that magic and sorcery because if they do they will be committing shit-canned kufur so those who refused to listen and insist on learning they have it's it the majors in of leaving snap and being doomed to help they have abilities of taking forms such as the form of human beings many companions so jibreel in the form of another crying known as the here patty but it wasn't it was duplicating his form and they came in the 'quran too many messengers and prophets of allah in the form of human beings they're fast they have different jobs and occupations some of them is given the responsibilities of Revelation such as G breed brain such as me ke blowing in the trumpet such as this or field taking people's lives such as the Angel of Death and his aides and a lot of the Muslims call the angels of the Angel of Death as Israel but this is not authentic and there is no automatic reference to his name as such as Allah described him in the Quran and in so many different places as medical note the Angel of Death so we should just keep it as it is and there is angels who are responsible for protecting us as humans whether we travel or reside we're moving out or stay at their homes there are angels ordered by Allah to protect us until our destiny comes there are angels who are tribes they write it good or bad deeds that we do and there are the guardians of all the custodians of paradise and there are the custodians of Hellfire among the duties of angels that their angels who were responsible to blow or breathe the life in an embryo that is in the womb of its mother and to dictate what it is male or female would it be riches or otherwise and about their provisions and about their lifespan all of this with a lost knowledge and a loss authorization among them are those who carry the tralala those who roam the earth searching for gatherings of knowledge like ours at the moment they come and they make duaa for all of us learning the religion of Allah among them is angel of the mountains responsible for collapsing eight earthquakes volcanoes etc and there are angels that we keep on worshipping allah azza wajal frustrating bowing making bigger so this was a brief it's not an introduction but carry something to remind you of what the angels are and how beautiful these creatures are so it is an article of lament to believe in them but believing them includes that you believe in the existence believing in those whom allah told us about the names such as really Mikhail believing in the description which is mind-blowing to know that feel is so huge is so big we know that he uplifted the village Cox's dome we used to be doing the act of homosexuality with the tip of one of his wings to the skies and then dropped the whole village upside down so they are so huge and powerful they have the ability to transform their shapes and we also have to believe with their work and different tasks that Allah had set for them when you believe in the Angels this makes you believe in the greatness of the one who created them so if this is how great and powered for the arm this just gives you a glimpse of the infinite power and greatness of Allah the Almighty also when you believe in the Angels you become thankful and grateful for Allah for appointing such magnificent creatures to help us to protect this to guide us times and this also helps us to love the angels for whom they are we know that they love us as we love them in my heart I've overlaid on the allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet honey is a lot to sunset when allah azza wajal loves a servant of his and may allah azza will make me and all those watching us among those whom Allah tops well lie it's one of the it is the greatest honor one can achieve if Allah loves you who cares about anyone else if Allah as the origin loves you the whole world loves you regardless to how rich or poor you are regardless whether you wait or back when Allah loves you everything loves you imagine the prophets there are lotsa when Allah loves a servant of his he calls on 2gp would you be I love my servant so-and-so so love him this is an order aunt Irene loves that servant then G bill goes to the people of the heavens all the angels in the heavens and he's to them Allah the Almighty loves his servant so so so love him and they all love him then Allah places acceptance for his for his servant on earth sometimes you wonder okay why do people love so on so and they don't love me why do they love this person who doesn't have a PhD who's not an official parts of Kerala everybody whatever they hear the name of the song stop they just say nice words about him why is that because this is the love of Allah given to him to be given to the angels of the heavens and then the acceptance is face for him on earth so when Allah loves you this is the greatest honor and you must be the happiest man or woman on earth so the first article of faith in Allah then to believe in his angels then to believe in the scriptures and what could will be he and by scriptures we believe that not revealed many scriptures before which include the animal which we all believe in but there are scriptures that we know of and there are scriptures that we don't know so among the scriptures we know of that there was there's a boar given to prophet David there was the Torah given to prophet Musa there was the injeel given to prophet isa they were the sort of given to ibraheem who says well so we have to believe that Oh that we know and we not know are from Allah we believe in what we know by mean we believe that what is percentage so we believe whatever is authenticated so we believe that the Quran is the only one which is 100% authentic so we believe in it entirely and we act upon the rulings in it as long as it was not abrogated and it shows you to believe in the books what why do we have to emphasize because it shows that our belief as Muslims is one of series of previous religions what does that mean it means that if I don't believe in the Torah that was revealed to prophet Musa I'm not Muslim yes I do believe in it but at the same time I believe that Torah the Jews have in their hands was altered and changed and corrupted there is a lot in it that is part of the original Torah but not all of it so many things were inserted in it whether is the novel Testament or what they called in New Testament which is not the injeel it's a history book not revelation given to prophet isa because that's different the in the New Testament is not a injeel it is something that was written by the Apostles and about historic artifact historians that are not related to the energy and if you read the Bible the Old Testament that what they call the Torah and you will find that it cannot be from Allah because it has been changed by humans when they accuse prophet nor of this and that in the Prophet Ibrahim office in that and prophethood of us in that accusing them of some of them are having illicit relationships with their daughters-in-law some of them being records some of them fighting Allah I will diminish upon a virtue but I had Allah who I'm a hula volume when I were him such heinous and blasphemous things can't be from Allah but we believe in the Orlan and we believe in the original scripture that was given to Moosa to be from Allah so this is part of articles of faith of Eman why because this is what we usually use when we speak with atheists so many times I have different dialogues with atheists and with people who think they know and they want to apply logic and they say why is this that in Islam why do you allow women to marry one man and a man can marry for women and I say this is not the right approach of him do you want to talk about religion first of all less established the existence of Allah soldier if he acknowledges and we logic it through and he believes in the existence of Allah and in the beautiful names and attributes of Allah then it would be only logical that Allah would send us a messenger and would reveal for us a book a manual that we can read and follow his instructions without the book there is nothing else for us to abide by and to believe in and this is why when you ask someone who's in profit no and he says my messenger is no I said okay what was his miracle he would say the flood so so show me I don't have any evidences but it did take place in the past okay pass what I was who's a messenger said Ibrahim he's be honest okay what I what was his medical well there's so many among them he was thrown into the raging fire and nothing happened to him said show me that I don't have any thing touchable ok the Jews put your messenger Moses what is this miracle well he had the staff that could turn into a big Python and he entered his hand and it came white and shining without any harm in it and he also crushed the sea and I opened it to him and and it's a beautiful beautiful nice show me said sorry we don't have any proof so Hannah okay Risa oh Jesus followers show me what did he do oh he gave life to the dead he cured the leopard he did this and gave sight to the blind very nice things can you show me and say no this was his time okay I can't believe in this so say okay well do so la la well he got water springing from his finger fingers and filling up a well he whenever he walked the stones used to greet him my see me Salam alaikum he traveled the seventh heaven and came back in one hour or two hours he did this he did that and he was given the miracle of all miracles there is the hand the word of allah azza wajal the one that allah has challenged the whole of human and the jinn to make a duplicate if not of tension if not then of one chapter and none could ever produce something as miraculous and magnificent as is this okay show me okay here's my book he is my and now this is the miracle that is here to stay until the day of judgment if you can't prove the miracles of your own messengers we had as Muslim so this is one of the beauty of believing in the books of larger descriptions because in worldly measurements you cannot expect a phone manufacturer to produce state of the art we lumped show you how to operate it imagine a computer company or x-box or playstation 10 and they produce this beautiful device black and black but you don't know what it is so people say wow what a beautiful device what is it it's the computer no no no this is a microwave the third one says no this is a satellite receiver and no one knows what it is they ask is there manual does it no there is no manual the first thing that comes to mind is what a stupid manufacturer creating this marvelous miraculous device and not telling the people what it is or how to use it allah azza wajal is exalted from all of this Allah created this universe and made us the inhabitants of this earth not only to just eat and drink and dine he gave us the manual and he sent as a guide to explain the manual to us and how it works and this is why we believe in the last scriptures and books shares now so could we continue or stop here now I'm said I think we should continue for the next five days and then we stop and take questions okay so to believe in Allah to believe in the angels to believe in the books the divine books scriptures and to believe in the messengers and Allah Azza WA JAL could have just simply thrown to us or descended to us his books but this was not sufficient there had to be someone to explain to convey to complete the Quran with his teachings that are also a revelation from allah azza wajal so Allah's messengers they are the cream of variation that the top of humanity the first of all these messengers was Prophet Noah peace be upon him allah says in the quran in alayka tomorrow Hannah Illinois we've revealed to you O Muhammad and we had revealed to knew her so this is an indication that he was the first messenger and in the hadith that Anna's not even raised and so he had party the long leave of intercession this is a very long hadith everybody knows it that on the day of judgement when things get hot and difficult and a large Dajjal is angry and accountability has not taken place yet so all the creations or the humans are gathered in one place nude barefooted uncircumcised they go to Adam so that he would intercede at the Stig of Alliance they say unlucky you with his hands Allah gave life to you a lot this and that to you don't you see what's happening to us ask Allah so that we would be relieved of the suffering we are having at the moment and he would say go to know peace be upon him he is the first messenger Allah had sent to humanity so this is an indication that the first one is more and the last one is our prophet muhammad sallallahu wasallam whom allah described in the Quran as the seal of prophethood and he himself said I am the last messenger and prophet and there is no prophet after me this is why when we see like mirza ghulam ID or the heii's or the paddy Anees or all these deviants Axew be muslims and they claim that their messenger is the messenger and a prophet of allah the prophet has said these are apostates these the cooked farmer just for believing that there can be a messenger after Muhammad Ali it was Ram and these messages of allah azza wajal we believe that the greatest of them all is our prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam yet they are all humans they do not carry any of the historic characteristics of lordship or worship they don't hold any benefit for their own selves and they cannot protect themselves from any harm Allah and the Weddell tells us in the Quran that o Muhammad say to them I do not hold any good for myself and I cannot protect myself from any heart except what Allah wishes had I known unseen I would have asked for more of goodness but I don't know the rape I don't know what's coming so Allah described his messengers and prophets as being added slaves servants and this is the highest praise for them in the end and to believe as an article of faith to believe in the messengers this requires or means a number of things what to believe that they are all messages of Allah which means as Muslims to disbelieve in oneness teacher is this believing in all of them so if someone says ok I don't believe Jesus was a messenger with all due respect mr. cannot be a Muslim he is a kafir he's an apostate he said but I pray I fast I go to hatch if you don't believe in all the messengers of Allah unconditionally you are an apostate and a kafir and secondly that we have to believe whatever things that they bring to us so whatever is the CENTAC and not changed we have to believe in it and the quran tells us what is anything what is not and we have to be big in those from the Quran gave us their names so Hamid Ibrahim is a Muslim for the wood so they man a new soul food etc all of these are messages and prophets who believe in them but there are a lot more that we still believe in but don't know their names so we believe that they are messengers and prophets of Allah that we do not know their names and I think that this brings us to the end of these five minutes to me stop at believing in the day of judgment in sha allah w'allahu Arnim when is between Malaysia a shallot radical a jocular Ferran said what's the questions now insha'Allah the first question is la Malik whom is it permissible to use permeable halal nail polish you know and then they say oh yeah that is the first question what are you sir lamorak not Allah he water catchment there had been many circulations stating that there is what they are what they call breathable nail polish and they have diagrams and they say when you put the nail polish on your fingernail and the water comes it goes in and it touches your nails that I don't believe in this even physics don't believe in this because if this nail polish has a mass and this mass is attached to your nail through blue or any other adhesive this means that water can't reach the fear nail so they can claim it's readable they can claim it is it allows the penetration of water as a Muslim you must not use this and perform moodle audits because you would would be valid be to the fact that the water does not reach the nail and largest now I'm sure your next question is if I lend someone money even money to my friend and I put it back within a week cause he has to pay the cut on that to one one week see this is part of the basics that Muslims are ignorant I have invited you to join me in the fifth class on Mondays Thursdays for free and it gives you a chance to learn Islam from Hz and those who missed it it's found on YouTube under the name of Azul us double o el and we've reached forty three segments forty three hours now the basics of the cat is one it has to has to reach a threshold you have below this threshold you don't have a strategy the second condition is that a full lunar year passes with this amount in your possession so this brother who bored money for a week the borrower returned it within a week which means that it did not stay with him for a whole lunar year so there is not a cat on it and the person who gave the money as alone initially he did not lose track of his cash because it's still his money and it left his possession for a week and came back so the cycle remains on it and if it continued a full lunar year the purpose of the week it went was a month for the six-month he came back he has to give the cat on that and Allah knows best and I'm sure this return is here in Nigeria we asked some people to recite the Quran for us at the knees of prayer and then we paid them money is this allowed this is not permissible because in generally most cases when I ask him all Anna to come to my home and decide for an usually I would gather some other people and I would consider his recitation of in my home as a means of blessing so giving him money for this purpose which is originally an evasion you can read the Koran in your home alone you can play the recorder you do not need someone who has a big turban or is known as a calling to come and respect man and charge money for that you don't need this this is an innovation but if someone genuinely wants to listen to the Quran so I'm a rich man I listen to the Quran I hate the Quran but every day after I saw my family members maybe some neighbors we like to sit and just listen to the Quran so we called Paul Anna who has a beautiful voice and we say to him he come and read for us one juzo so he comes and read one juzu and we are listening ladies beautiful and as he's going I live giving him something because the guy is a moulana he doesn't have an income or a job or something like that there's not no problem in that the problem is when I bring him for Barca for blessing for protection for this and that this is not permissible and Allah knows best and I'm sure the next question is I discovered few years ago bags the cash should be given on jewelry but haven't gotten around to some I have had for over 40 years how does one go about calculating how much is to be given considering the different types eg 24 25 and 18 carat and here is white gold rose gold and yellow gold and what of those that have stones on them or watches please advise you have to pay me I'm a mullah and I will come to you and explain that you're asking me to give you a summary of the chapter of the card in a question and answer yeah and the moderator should have been a bit smarter than this Nasir by selecting a question that is specific but when you say this question had has like six seven embedded questions one is there's a cat on jewelry too if I didn't pay zakat for the previous year's do I have to pay it now or not free if I didn't know that it was mandatory should I pay or not for is the cat on gold white gold mandatory or not five six seven so this would take us ages but in a nutshell the issue of the cat over jewelry that is gold and silver that women wear as jewels it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it is man the J to give the cat on gold and silver whether a woman wears it or stores it this is the most authentic opinion however due to the long period of time that you did not know about it and you did not pay it due to denial or not wanting you simply did not know the ruling I would inshallah say that you don't have to pay any of the back pay of your zakat because there is an issue of dispute whether it's manager or not and hence giving you the benefit of the doubt and that you did not know the ruling we say start from the Seri Shalala white-gold if there are two types of white gold there is what they call Petain iam I think and this is a different mineral than the white that the yellow gold so it's a different core or metal this is not like a table and this is halal for men to wear what is Haram is the yellow gold is chemically treated to look white so they coat it with a white coating and then they call it white gold this is still Haram for men men cannot wear this because in essence it is yellow and there is a cut on this as well and Allah knows best now shake the next question is a slap monochrome if one follows a particular might have is it permissible for him to listen to all the lectures on faith from other scholars from different mess up the matter have itself is not an issue the issue is in cherry-picking so I don't follow a particular matter per se but I cannot jump from Hanafy to Schaffer II from chef Renita Maliki and so on according to what appeals to me more most I am a student of knowledge I know Arabic I have the fundamentals of Quran hadith or solo fare FC according to the schools of thought so when I look into an issue I apply these fundamentals in my head and come up with the conclusion that this is the most authentic opinion according to the Quran and the Sunnah so I follow that but this is not the same when one of you guys who does not know Arabic who has never read the Quran and who has never gone through the Sunnah or learnt one school of thought totally the one school of thought from A to Z yet he comes and sits on his couch and says hmm I think that this opinion is stronger than that one how do you know it's a gut feeling what kind of gut feeling are you not a neurosurgeon so if I come to you and say hey there is pain in my neck would you say I have a gut feeling that I think we should amputate your leg how do we look what are you doing said well I'm just picking and choosing luck if you don't have the proper knowledge you should not hop between different schools of thought and listen to different speakers and follow this one because masha'Allah his beard is white very black I don't like she has on his beard is white move Dominque is good why he's younger he's more handsome her hair but this is not how it works whether you follow me follow Mufti follow Sharon Hammad's alive follow XYZ it has to be structured according to the Quran and Sunnah and if you don't have the proper knowledge you should follow one whom you trust in his religion in his knowledge his ethics and moral moral conduct not go and pick and choose between everything analyzes your knows best Michelle I shake this question is thermally from I am adopted by my aunt and raised by her in a different country officially registered as fasten and he have each other I know my religion does not allow such thing she so would like me to have a commodities if she passed away is there anything is there anything in some Amit in this case or I am NOT a lot of anything given from her first of all this is a personal topic that I think the brother should call me or send me an email so that I would have more information first of all she is your aunt paternal or maternal if she's from your father's side this another twist to it from your mother's side you cannot inherit her at all because she can be only inherited by her next of kin and you're not one of them second of all you have to change your name so if you know if you know who your father's name is definitely you cannot be called after her you have to be called after the real father and your real grandfather and your real tribe or family third of all once she dies if you are not her Islamically legitimate heir then you cannot inherit her because her parents must inherit her if she doesn't have any children then her husband if she doesn't have a husband then her siblings and they're all defined and we know how much they are to get finally if your aunt wants to allocate something to you now as a gift and hands it to you officially this is permissible whatever she writes as a will and says when I die then my adopted son so-and-so would get this and this and this and this this is not valid except in less than one third of her wealth so if she had $300 all her property cash gold whatever she had as a wealth if it was $300,000 and she said after I die I give all of my wealth to my adopted nephew when she dies you only get a hundred thousand which is one-third and the rest has to be allocated to her heirs and Allah knows best I'm shakin this will be the last question is Allah my father things that is okay to socialize and joke with women and he thinks is okay to have to not have beard how can I advise him when his standard respond is that he is my father and he has been here his whole life well this is something you have to advise him through diplomacy with knowledge being diplomatic and respectful remember that you can always lead a horse to water but you can't force the horse to drink so all what you can do is show him from Islam Q&A dot info website the ruling on mixing and chit chatting with women porn and Maha and how would he feel if his wife were to do something like that most most people don't have any problem let her speak out of allah out of allah and you can also show him video clips of mine on my website if you wish about these topics because I have so many video clips on them and if he doesn't want to listen after that you've done your due diligence you've done your duty and the sin is on him so don't nag him don't push it down his throat and suffocate him with it try your level best to every now and then remind him of Allah and how Allah is so kind and generous to us and giving us so many things and how ungrateful we are due to our sins etc maybe Allah would open his heart and you have to remember always and forever to make dua for him Institute and at the times where Allah answers the door and inshallah he will change"
