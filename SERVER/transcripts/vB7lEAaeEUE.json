  "transcript": "Adie says I live in utter and my grandmother lives in Indonesia she has stopped praying because she says that it is too much of a burden she has Alzheimer and has to be given treatment regularly my father is struggling to advise her to pray again what can and what should I do well first of all Ally we have to look at your grandmother not physically but look at her case when you say that she has as himer Alzheimer is not the same level so if it's if she's in her early stages where she can think she is labeled and classified as sane she knows the times of the day and night she knows those whom she talked to and her decision-making process is not hindered in this case it is mandatory upon her to pray claiming that it is burden as it is a burden to her and it is difficult is not a legitimate excuse we have to advise her we have to remind her of Allah Azza WA JAL if it is difficult for her to stand up a hamdulillah hadith romp around even a sign the Prophet tells us Allison if you are unable to stand up then spray sitting down if she's unable to sit down hamdulillah she may pray lying down on her sight whatever it is she has to pray on time if she's unable to go to the toilet and perform mudal her children her grandchildren can bring her her a pot of water where she can perform water on the bed if she has urinary incontinence in this case we have to try to in her for prayer every time by changing her diapers if she's wearing diapers if it's too difficult she can combine the whole to us her and mother of tarisha etc but she cannot leave salat because this is the most important thing for a Muslim to maintain and observe however if she's in stages of Alzheimer's that are too advanced in the sense that she doesn't remember people see she sees her son and say who's he she doesn't know day from night she doesn't know what to eat and what not to eat she's unable to make the right choice and decision in this case scholars say that when allah azza wajal uplifts and takes back what he has granted there is the blessing and Neema of intellect and understanding then elijah also uplifts the commands and obligations such as salat and fasting etc the Prophet said arise o son said in an authentic hadith the pen is uplifted meaning that the Angels would not hold people accountable and register their sins in three cases one the pen is uplifted from a child until it reaches the age of puberty the sleeping person until he wakes up and the insane until he regains consciousness and sanity therefore if your mother grandmother has reached that level then hamdulillah Allah does not oblige her to pray and you can leave her alone"
