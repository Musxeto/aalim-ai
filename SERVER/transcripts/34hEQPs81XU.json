  "transcript": "so Sheikh my uh my engaged sister is often going out with her fiance alone and their wedding is two weeks time inshallah but they don't have Nika yet although I told her multiple times that it's not permissible um to be alone with Mama Ram she's not listening to me and in one occasion um one of my sister's friends asked her to look after their two-year-old child and my sister said to me she can only look after the child till after time because she was planning to eat out with her fiancee again in a and in response to her I said you can go out I'll be looking after the child soon after I realized that I directed my sister to something which is Haram and I didn't withhold from her from going there rather I said you can go does this thing take me out of Islam okay the issue of taking you out of Islam Isha is a very serious thing so why would it take you out of the fold of Islam are you with me Aisha okay I think she was disconnected so the issue of does this sin take me out of the fold of Islam indicates a great deficiency in people's knowledge about their religion and I get calls like this like crazy I was sitting with someone and he said something inappropriate and I smiled so Aisha how do you enter Islam Aisha by saying shahada okay what invalidates the shahada now when you said to me that I said to her it's okay I'll take care of the child you go you think that this approval of yours takes you out of the fold of Islam correct I I thought so okay what about your sister's sin which is going out with Anan mahram and being alone with him does this take her out of the fold of Islam as well no how could your saying go takes you out while her actual going an actual sins does not doesn't make any sense no then you should learn your religion and this knowledge is your firewall which shaytan cannot penetrate nor go over you must learn your religion the things that nullify your Islam are numbered and before you reach them you have to know that in order to leave the fold of Islam you have to do these things knowingly willingly without any misunderstanding or misinterpretation and you will find the things that nullify your Islam on my videos on YouTube there is a playlist by the name of the Islamic faith f-a-i-t-h the Islamic faith if you go to episode 8 9 10 and 11. for episode in a row I talk about the things that nullify Islam this might help you insha Allah so to summon up my uh to sum it up my answer is no you are sinful by giving her the green light to go with her fiance which is Haram but this does not take you out of the fall of Islam"
