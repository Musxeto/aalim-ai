  "transcript": "person is if I'm living in a non-muslim country and my Iman is normal like my Muslim country I'm starting to My Religion like Islam country he doesn't want to stay there I didn't I didn't get your question you are living in a non-muslim country is your Iman dropping or Rising my mind is rising My Religion normal is that not to stay there okay first of all it is not permissible for Muslims to live among the non-muslims without any legitimate reason and among the legitimate reasons would be studying working going there for a medical care having business or living there for Darwa and of course fleeing your own country because of prosecution and harassment that unfortunately many Muslims are suffering from so if there is a legitimate reason then you may go and live among the disbelievers providing a very important condition and that is that you are capable of practicing your own religion freely so your women can wear the nihab and hijab you can pray in the Masjid you can eat halal food you can pray on time without any harassment and there's nothing going against your religion in this case with these legitimate reasons you're okay insha'allahu azzawajal"
