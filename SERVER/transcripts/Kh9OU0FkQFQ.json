  "transcript": "so brother Sauber lives in Sweden and then sack Scandinavian countries may Allah make it easy among all upon all these Muslims living in the in these areas they fast for 20 hours we here in Arabia don't realize the blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL when we fast 15 hours and we're complaining and shouting and whining about the long hours while they fast 20 hours which means that they have like four hours to break their fast eat supper pray taraweeh pray to hi dude it's a and maybe if they have any hanky-panky they can do in the spare time Wow it's even more than six items in four hours so this is hard but Sabah you are a Muslim and you open the Quran and you see that Allah is instructing us in the Quran in chapter 2 in Surat al-baqarah that we must refrain from eating and drinking from the break of dawn until sunset the break of dawn is the white thread from the black thread so now if you have daytime and nighttime that are totally separate and segregated regardless of the length in this case you are as a Muslim ordered to fast now there are some fatwas but these fad ways are not from people of knowledge the Muslim Council of Europe the Muslim Council of Zimbabwe or these are not the Scot the real scholars who have the knowledge to give fatwa in Islam I saw a program on the BBC I think of some way a Muslim from the counsel of this European country and a Muslim from the counsel of this European country and they're all speaking out of authority not only that they say that the scholars who live in Arabia don't have knowledge of what's happening and they should not be asked now he what kind of knowledge are you possessing is it from Cambridge or Harvard is it from the Quran and Allah tells you forget what I say forget what they say Allah says in the Quran that you have to refrain from eating and drinking and intercourse from the break of dawn till sunset do you have break of dawn in Sweden says yes do you have sunset in Sweden the same day he said yes after 20 hours so what will you meet Allah Azza WA JAL and saying yeah sure but this fatwa came from France this fatwa came from Austria this fatwa came who cares where it came from it goes against Islam it goes against the Quran not only that they say you have to fast with Saudi Arabia okay what about Marie Prayer if they say that Maghrib says the Sun sets at seven o'clock in Saudi Arabia which is corresponding to five o'clock in the afternoon in Stockholm we still have five more hours till sunset but because we are fasting with Saudi Arabia so we break her fast and we pare Maghrib as well what does matter with me Margaret means sunset the Sun did not set yet said well we have a fatwa okay this is a new religion this is not Islam so definitely a Sabah what these guys are saying is wrong and totally bogus no foundation none whatsoever no real scholar would say this the only fatwa is when you have six months or less of total darkness total night I don't have day and night or the opposite total daytime I don't have day night in the case yes you look at the closest country to your country that has distinction between day and night and you follow their timings but not to jump all the way to Saudi Arabia and break your fast in the middle of the day and consider yourself fasting this is child's game and not fasting may Allah make it easier for you I know it's difficult I'm speaking from here where I fast 58 hours a day and to tell you the truth and hamdulillah it's not hard I know a lot of my relatives who's fast 15 hours a day and they go play tennis they go to the gym while fasting and they have no problems so this surely means that you can manage 20 hours or even more without any problem because it is Allah who obligated it upon you and not Allah so gel would not make a ruling where people are unable to do it and Allah knows best"
