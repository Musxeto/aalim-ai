  "transcript": "oh 73 when breaking fast in someone's home so someone invites me i'm fasting it's ramadan i break my fast what should i say hadith number 184 you should say this dua after eating at their place and generally speaking you should also say this dua when you eat a normal meal even if you're not fasting but the prophet used to say this when he was fasting he used to say moon was that is break their fast in your home and the host will say hey hey hey whoa why would i bring people fasting to break their fast in my home whoever breaks your his fast with your food you get his reward so this is a great dua because the more people break their fast in your home you will get their reward of fasting the whole day just by feeding them so may the fasting people break their fast in your home and may the dutiful and pious eat your food and this is also a good dua because the prophet said allah do not associate yourself except with believers and do not let people eat your food except the righteous one and finally and may the angels send prayers upon you wow it's just a meal but when i know that i'm getting this dua i'd be more encouraged to invite people and to show my generosity hoping that allah would answer their duas and chapter 74 supplication said by one fasting when presented with food and does not break his fast and this happens a lot in hadith 185. [Music] so if you are invited to a meal then answer if you happen to be fasting then supplicate for those present and if you are not fasting then eat what does this mean every monday and thursday you're used to fasting now you go and someone invites you you attend he presents you with the food if you're not fasting bismillah eat but if you're fasting lots of the people say should i break my fast and eat and the answer is no the prophet tells you to continue to fast but make dua for those present for your host so that you would make them feel good though you did not eat their food at least you compensated them by beautiful words and a nice dua chapter 75 when insulted while fasting what does that mean it means that we are ordered to restrain ourselves more when we're fasting yes normal conditions someone insults me someone wants to pick a fight i should refrain but i have to do this more if i'm fasting and the prophet isaiah told us that when someone insults you or wants to pick a fight with you you should say to them iniso i'm fasting i'm fasting and scholars differ do i say this to him verbally so that he knows that if i were not fasting i would have retaliated or should i say this to myself it can be both ways but it indicates that you have to refrain and not carry on with your emotions or retaliate the following chapter deals with a different story and topic and that is supplication set upon seeing the early or premature fruit and this is for farmers what do farmers do you know farmers invest a lot of their time and effort in preparing their land anticipating three months maybe five maybe six months for the fruit to grow and then they can harvest it and sell it and make money out of that this is their life so the prophet told us what to do and taught us what to say whenever we see the beginning of the harvest coming the premature fruit is showing which means that inshallah there is uh um hope in a good harvest the prophet used to teach us and used to say our fruit because it's premature so we want allah's blessing so it blossoms and becomes full and complete oh allah bless our fruit for us bless our town for us and the translation of town is probable but i would presume that a better translation would be our medina the city of the prophet islam known as medina because this is not our town rather this medina similar to mecca and this is why in other hadith the prophet used to make dua for allah to bless mecca to bless medina and to bless hashem and to bless yemen so these are indications for the blessings to be specific for these areas so bless our medina for us bless our sarah for us and bless our mud for us what is saah and what is mud is a measurement of size and mud is also a measurement of side sar is equivalent to four mud so what is a mud a mud is what gathers in your the palms of your hand so if you take a scoop with both hands this is called mud and if you fill it up by the way it's approximately 700 milliliters if it was if it were a liquid because this is what the prophet ali histology used to perform moodle with and with four scoops of that there is a assad the prophet isam used to perform a total bath so the prophet is asking allah for baraka for blessing when he sees this premature fruit so that allah would bless the way they weigh their fruits their grains their dates with the mud and with the saw and when the blessings is there then everything is fine this is all the time we have until we meet next time i live allah muhammad [Music] love"
