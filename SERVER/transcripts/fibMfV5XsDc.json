  "transcript": "foreign so many times we sit and not every gathering we sit is up to what we want sometimes we have to accept invitations sometimes we have to socialize with people and sometimes they say things that are inappropriate not that i endorse it but this is how things are so chapter 85 supplication for the expiation of sins said at the conclusion of sitting or a gathering etc the prophet alaihis salat wasallam taught us what to say so just before we conclude the meeting or the gathering we the prophet used to say it whenever he concludes a gathering he used to say it after praying he used to say it after finishing reciting the quran and lots of the muslims don't know this so what is this dua it translates to subhanallah glory be to you and i praise you or how perfect you are o allah and i praise you i bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except you i seek your forgiveness and turn to you in repentance this is known as kefaratul medullus memorize it and use it as much as you can but in arabic of course the following chapter returning a supplication of forgiveness what does that mean if someone says to you may allah forgive you as in the hadith where a companion said to the prophet may allah forgive you o messenger of allah what should we reply we should reply as the prophet did allah and that is may allah forgive you you say and you and this is also the same when someone says as in the following chapter supplication said to the one who does you a favor when someone does you a favor what do you say may allah reward you with goodness and when you say this what should he reply to you wajazak the same thing you don't have to say the whole long virgin rather you take part of it you say walak or jazak or yak this is sufficient in reply to any dua a person makes for you and by the way we have to reciprocate when someone says just you don't just say sure no problem no you reciprocate meaning may allah reward you as well and you also say this because this is the highest form of praising as the prophet said as salaam when someone does you a favor and you say jazakallah you have rewarded him with the highest form of praising the following chapter protection from the dajjal the antichrist and if you remember at the conclusion of the salat before the salaam we were taught to ask or seek refuge in allah from four things and among them is the trial of the judge however in hadith 199 whoever memorizes the first 10 verses of surat al-kaf will be protected from the dajjal and one should also seek refuge with allah from the tribulation of the jujal as we've indicated and stated earlier in supplications number 55 and 56 at the conclusion of your prayer and the following chapter deals with supplication said to the one who pronounces his love for you for allah's sake so so many times we i get this so often people say to me i love you for the sake of allah what should i say good for you no this is not the sunnah the sunnah is to reciprocate so when someone says i love you for the sake of allah and mind you that he should be of the same gender and this is problematic because some females may come up to a die or a scholar and she says oh sheikh i love you for the sake of allah this is totally haram he's of the opposite gender he's an mahram what are you doing praising people like this is totally unacceptable in islam if a man comes to me and says i love you for the sake of allah reciprocating would be to say as in hadith 200. may he that is allah for whom you have loved me love you so you love me for the sake of allah i pray to allah that he loves you as well for the love you have for me and this is the way to reciprocate and to express your gratitude for someone who expressed his love for you this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you foreign foreign [Music] the"
