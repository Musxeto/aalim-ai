  "title": "Joined imam in ruku(silent prayer) without reciting fateha, is it valid rakah when fateha is a must?",
  "transcript": "Emmett says when we joined the Imam in rock or in Vellore a sir or in ruku of any silent raka and said that vicar at least once then that raka is valid for us but how is it possible because we haven't recited the Fatiha while reciting fatiha in silent prayers and in the raka is a pillar for the follower as well without which our prayer is invalid who told you that without the fatiha your raka is invalid I think a man will say the Prophet said la salata lamella me o'clock bo milk al-kitab there is no prayer valid for those who do not recite the fatiha said ok is a cool affair and who told us that when the imam is in true core and we join him without reciting reciting the fatiha this is a valid raka Muhammad says I don't know that's why I'm asking you well there is a hadith sahih al-bukhari where the companion came entered the message it and found the companions with the professor in the record position so from the back of the message from the door he said allahu akbar and made your core and walked while in the rock or position until he was within the row so the prophet says i'm a lot even happened and he continued the prayer with him afterwards the prayer concluded the the Prophet Isis Arum concluded the prayer and said who did that so the companion said I did it Oh prophet of Allah so the Prophet said to him is that the Calla who Harrison well at out may allah azzawajal increase you in being careful and steadfast but do not do that again in another way of reading it well a torrid which translates to do not repeat the prayer because your prayer is valid so the companion may Allah be pleased with him did not recite the fatiha yet the prophet ala system approved his raka to be valid what the Prophet did not approve was him walking in the state of bowing in set of record until he joined the row he should have walked normally and then if the Imam was still in record he should make takbir and make record without reciting the fight either way so aji it is among all major scholars that if you attain the Imam in the record position you say Allahu Akbar this is your inaugural takbir which suffice is for Allahu Akbar the second full record but if you say them twice no problem and whether to say subhanAllah be a ravine with the Imam or not the safer opinion is that you should say it once even if you could not manage to say it once as long as you and him we're in the record position this is sufficient and there is no need to recite the fatiha because the Companions action which was approved by the prophet Isaiah suffices and Allah so John knows best"
