  "transcript": "yes so I'm repeating my question of yesterday because I think you did not understand it properly so my question is divided into two parts so I made some research about uh Insurance in case of renting and an item so I saw that scholar say like if you if if there's a rental agreement at least so it is for the lesser the one who ow owns the property to make an insurance on it if he wants and it has to be halal and Cooperative I look at some photos and they say like uh if you rent from uh some uh company and you do not deal with insurance so the company have has Insurance on all their cars for example and they and they red to you their cars for a rental C and you do not deal with any insurance and they tell you that if you do some damage on the car they wave some payment from you they say that it's okay something like this so the second part of the question is I myself did not rent anything my father rented a car so he's not here now and it's the end of the month so they are asking for payment uh and it seems that they do the same thing they have insurance on all their cars and that we did not take anything additional for that so but they said they say to you that if there's something on the car you'll pay up to 2% of the car's value and they write something like Insurance uh like like this on rental agreement with insurance written on it but there's nothing as I know add to get this so it's just the rental I think they have this kind of things so is it per for me to go and pay this amount my father who's not there or what should I do in this case what was my answer what answer what was my answer you just told me that uh if there's a if insurance is U the state tell you to get insurance so it's a case of necessity but it was not in the case of does not like detail from my question that's why I'm asking I don't need to have details from your question now you've assumed that I did not uh understand your question and I accept this so many people think that I have no problem with that my problem is my answer was crystal clear the question is is it mandated by the authorities in your country yes or no this one is not but I think they got this from their card so now you're not ass sure yes no yes or no a can you get can you rent can you rent a car without insurance no way so some companies do this but this company no no no no there is no country to my knowledge that would give you a car without insurance no country so now you go and get your fact checked ask the police and tell him if you catch me red-handed driving a leased car and I don't have an insurance is it okay he said no I'll give you a fine and go to the company that your father is listening to and say I don't want the insurance would you would they give you a renewal they would say no so your question has no basis and this is the problem that the people ask questions and they assume that the Sheikh doesn't understand that the Sheikh I'm not I'm not offended don't get me wrong I'm offended when you accuse me of not being able to understand your question well I understood it from the first word but they tell me in the uh uh control room and the director and everyone she don't jump the gun don't answer when you hear first two words although you know the question wait for it so cut me some slack and give me some credit for doing this for about like 25 30 years of my life don't assume that I did not understand just maybe say she maybe I did not clarify my question yesterday I will tell you the same question if it is mandated by law it is permissible if it is not mandated by law you are not allowed to renew it or to take insurance full stop very easy so I hope this saves us the trouble from you calling next week and asking the same question and saying she again you did not understand my question"
