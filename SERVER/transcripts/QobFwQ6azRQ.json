  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam we've mentioned before that there were three reasons for these Expeditions for these detachments that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to send out of Medina to attack the Caravans and to spread around Medina one of these reasons was that the prophet Alat wasam wanted to threaten the trading Roots between Mecca and the countries of sham which is Syria Lebanon Jordan and Palestine and the second reason was the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam wanted to sign treaties with the adjacent tribes surrounding Medina and this was for logistic reasons because at the end of the day he had to have his back covered and protected and also he would provide these tribes with protection himself because he had more power than they did but he had to have his back protected sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the third reason was for the Jews and the poths who did not accept Islam and who were at that time neutral they did not determine whether to go against or with Islam he had to show them the power and strength of the Muslims so they would they themselves be intimidated from doing anything hostile against the Muslim of course all of these reasons added value to the Muslims themselves as it was a form of training for them and they felt that this was part of preparation for a bigger and more uh uh important event to come so they were they were waiting for the specific point to attack Islam well the Muslims were always anticipating such a point but the Muslims themselves by sending these uh uh detachments these squadrons these uh uh Expeditions military Expeditions they were training themselves how to fight how to uh pursue the enemy and also they were doing this to give the message that we are not weak anymore that era is over and now we are on the offensive side do you think sh this the orders the attachment comes from Allah or from the opinion of the Prophet Sall wasallam well what do you think Muhammad I think first of all you know it's a re Revelation from Allah because Prophet would never speak or state any statements unless he has Revelation from it but at the same time the like you know it's the the situation is open for the others to give their suggestions and the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam would listen to as well and would consider it you know the good to take it or the better to leave it okay in principle The Prophet sallallahu alai wasallam does not utter anything except by the instruction of Allah now he is always being revealed to but the Revelation he receives is the Quran which we all have a copy of and that has not been changed not even one single letter since the dawn of Islam and then we have the prophetic saying or teaching the Hadith and this also is a revelation from the from Allah the almighty being revealed to the prophet Alam to say and to do things now there are other incidents where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam makes an isad he thinks of an opinion and he thinks that this is the right thing to do if Allah Almighty accepts this it goes on and it is part of the Revelation if the almighty does not accept it he will reveal something to him correcting the mistakes that took place and this is evident in different incidents for example when the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam was once calling a prominent uh uh polytheists men who came from Mecca and he was calling them to Islam they were leaders of their tribes and they were pagans Idol worshippers and as he was calling them them to Islam they were not accepting it but he was trying his best to do so one blind man came in makum and he was was asking the prophet to teach him about Islam and the prophet would ignore him and Allah revealed verses of the Quran saying that the prophet had a frown on his face and he uh uh gave his back to this blind man though he should have given him all the attention because he's seeking the knowledge while he should given his back to those pagans who were rejecting his call so these verses of the Quran we still recite them until this moment which the Allah which Allah Almighty corrected the wrongdoing of the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam and the prophet did that out of good intention yet it was not in accordance to what Allah wanted so Allah subhah wa tala corrected the prophet Alam I'm Sor I'm sorry does it mean that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was in a such position that he was so responsible about manners and you know attributes that even founding I believe that as he was a blind that companion abdah when he came to the prophet wasallam I believe that obviously he couldn't see the frowning of the Prophet Sall wasallam but even founding in front of a blind man which he would never even notice that frowning is something that Allah subhah wa taala is blaming his Prophet for that does it mean that you know we asked all of us to have such a high good manners in Dean or is it like something high level too high for the other Muslims to do well it is definitely too it's it's it's it's much far greater than what we can do but at the end the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam is the living example for us though abdah makum could not see the frown of the Prophet Alat yet Allah the almighty is teaching and instructing his Prophet to be of this High uh altitude of ethics and and moral behavior and not to even uh neglect this poor man who is seeking the guidance and the knowledge of Allah the almighty now uh uh coming back to the battles and uh uh Expedition the military Expeditions of the Prophet Alat we remember that the prophet came to Medina in the month of r which is the third month of the lunar year of the Islamic calendar in Ramadan which is not more than 6 months away the first military Expedition or the first Squadron was sent out of Medina the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam chose his uncle Hamza ABD MB and he sent him in uh Squad of 30 men and he sent them and all of these 30 men were from the muajin none none of them was from the ansar ham was the leader was the leader and he was the uncle of the of the Prophet Al and he was also the brother of the Prophet Sall wasallam uh because they were breastfed by yes by the same uh uh woman and mun are those who migrated from Mecca to Medina while the ansar were the residents of Medina and the pledge the people of Medina gave to the prophet Alam was that if you come to us we protect you as if we protect our own children and wives but if you're out of Medina then you're on your own that was the agreement between the Prophet this was the agreement between them so the prophet Alat wasam sent his uncle Hamza and with these 30 uh uh Warriors to intercept a caravan that was coming back from the countries of sham but they could not uh uh uh found it they found it but catch up with it they did not engage in fighting with it now they had he had 30 men alongside with him but the Caravan had 300 men so they were 10 times as big and they were led by Abu jahal the head of the uh of the disbelief in in Mecca The Head and the leader of the pagans of Mecca so still they wanted to engage with them in battle they wanted all to die at the cause of Allah and Maj Alani he was also a Muslim but he was from the tribes that were surrounding Medina uh he came in between them and made them all go uh without fighting as sort of a truce so he managed to mediate between them and separate them from fighting but look at The Bravery of the Muslims there were 30 men against 300 and still they thought that they could manage this now this was in Ramadan could the could that you know inance could it indicate us that how they will stick with the orders of the Prophet wasallam that when they got an order from the prophet to attack that car and when they reach day they found out that they were 10 times more and it didn't stop them from doing what the prophet ordered them this is true and this was manifested in in so many other battles and incidents where they would fight an army that was 20 or 30 times bigger than their army but this would not prevent them or stop them from complying with the instructions of the Prophet sallai the faith sorry the faith can do anything as long as the human has the faith he can do whatever he want yes if you can believe then you can do wonders I believe that we have a short break so stay tuned and inallah we will be right back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman Alim each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in [Music] it and welcome back now as we mentioned the Squadron of Hamza ABD mutalib may Allah be pleased with him was in Ramadan on the first year of Hijra a month later in sha the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam set of in 80 of the m in 80 of the companions of the Prophet wasallam from Mecca who migrated to intercept a caravan composed of 200 men again almost four times or three times as big and they did not engage but they had some arrows thrown here and there between them close to the city of Rab in uh uh the Western area of the peninsula though they had the superiority though they had the number of Fighters more than the Muslims yet the mus the poth they ran away and why was that because they were afraid that there was an ambush here or there they could not believe that only 80 men are coming to fight us they definitely had something in store for us so they decided that to leave an abandon uh uh uh the area uh afraid of being ambushed and again and again this this is one of the characteristics of Islam and the Muslims that it's from Allah that people are afraid of their power and in the Hadith of the Prophet sallallah Ali wasallam he told us that Allah granted him Victory by terrorizing those he whom he is going to fight against so people hear about his Army coming and they are terrorized they're afraid they don't know what to do and this will also come up with us when the prophet Sall wasallam besieged the the The Villages of the Jews and how they were afraid of that now a while AG in in this same Battle of the polyst while running away way two of them joined the Muslims and those were andan these two companions were Muslims in the very beginning but they were not left alone their people would not allow them to go and migrate so were they they were waiting for the right moment to flee their people and go to the Muslims and that was the right moment they were Traders so they were coming back and the minute they found it possible for them to leave they went and they joined the Muslims a month later in the month of there was also this Squadron that was known of as and this was led by may Allah be pleased with him one of the first companions to accept Islam in Mecca and one of the the most beloved Companions of the Prophet Alat a great warrior and he was leading this group of men 20 of them only and they were also ordered by the prophet to intercept this Caravan and the minute they reached the the place they were supposed to intercept it they found that it it already passed the previous day so they missed that Caravan 2 in that first year of Hijra among the companions that died were the Great companion of the Prophet Alam and also I zurar one of the first to accept the uh Islam from the people of Medina and who was one of the captains Anda who came and called people of Medina to accept Islam and he set the foundation and the basis for them to accept Islam was a great companion of the Prophet Alam he died on that year the prophet Sall wasallam cried when this great man died and he buried him himself and he put a stone so that he would recognize his grave and know where to bury his own relatives the prophet Alam next to his brother madun madun was one of the great companions in the sense of worship that he worshiped Allah a lot he traveled to ABIA twice and he migrated to uh uh Al Medina with the prophet Alam and at one stage he requested the permission of the Prophet alham to sterilize himself in the sense that to operate on himself so that he would not have any urge to females in marriage and so on so that he would only devote his life to worshiping Allah and this was not strange because also Ali they also requested the the same thing and the prophet s wasallam forbid this completely because this is UN Islamic it's mutilating your body and it's preventing you from doing something that is natural marriage is natural in Islam and nowhere Islam tells us that you should be a monk that you should not engage in uh enjoying the life and the things and the Privileges that Allah has given you was one of the great Companions of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who died in that year it is also reported that one of the companions females of the Prophet alham when died she came and she the prophet came to visit this dead person because before burial and he heard this uh companion Say by Allah may Allah have mercy on you because my test my testimony is that Allah has have had his mercy on you and that he has honored you the prophet said Salli wasallam and how would you know that how do you say something that you have no knowledge of she said I I ask Allah for forgiveness if Allah would not have mercy on this great companion whom we've seen his life and his migration and his great Deeds then who will Allah have mercy on so the prophet saidat wasam as far as I know I wish Forman the very best that Allah will have mercy on him but it is me myself I don't know what Allah is going to do with me and this is a lesson from the prophet Alam to us that we should not have any testimony we should not testify for anyone living that he is in heaven or in hell this is something that only Allah knows about we hope we wish that when Muslims die that they go to paradise well we cannot say that this particular individual is in Paradise unless the prophet told us that he is in paradise and likewise we cannot say that a non Muslim is a particular individual Nam so and so is in hell because we do not know if he reverted to Islam seconds before he died and this is something that Allah is going to deal with we can generalize and say all those who die Muslims will be in paradise and all those who who die not accepting Islam will go to hell but we do not specify particular individuals going on there was the first military Expedition orwa that the prophet Sall wasallam participated in and this is called or it has two names Oran and this was on the second year of the Hijra in the month of sa the prophet himself sallallahu alaih wasallam went out with 70 of his companions and again they were all migrants none of them were from Medina and he went to intercept a caravan do you think sh why all the battles all the small battles the Warriors from the M do you think why well all this I've mentioned this earlier that all of these because of the treaty that he had with the people of Medina and that treatment between that that they would protect the prophet S wasallam as long as he was in Medina once he's out of Medina there is no agreement on that and that is why he did not ask any of the people of Medina to accompany these military Expeditions under country it might have been a sort of an incentive for them to look up for so they were eager to accompany the prophet Alat but he would never ask them to come out so as if it's building up in themselves that we would like to join we would like to participate so when the right moment was right they were asked to join the prophet as we will come to that inshallah later on so the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam went out to intercept one of the Caravans but he missed it so he took the opportunity and he signed the treaty with from and he was the leader of one of the tribes adjacent to Medina he signed a treaty with him and both parties uh uh honored this agreement to protect each other and not to Aid and not to give help and support to any army coming to attack Medina and the prophet sallallah alai wasallam in the third month or the fourth month of the second year there was the expedition of uh bat and this Expedition the prophet Salli wasallam set out in 200 of his followers to pursue a caravan was which was led by and this Caravan was so huge it had 2,500 camels and was protected only by 100 men and we all know this uh uh Tyrant we all know this evil man was famous to torture companions which companion in particular bil bil he was well known to torture bilb rabah he was an abanian slave and he embraced Islam at the very beginning reverted to Islam and would not swallow this easily so he started torturing this man he started to take him in shackles and into uh uh the desert and the Heat of the desert and put a heavy Stone in his uh uh a chest and in in that heat and instruct him to associate others with and all what says this evil man Abu Bakr came and told him till when you do this with this poor man why don't you sell him to me for 10 Dirhams he said okay and he bought him and after he bought him omaya told Abu Bakr Abu Bakr I've cheated you in this deal if you given me one dirham I would have bought it g given him to you he he said Abu Bakr told him in reped to him said well I think I've cheated you because if you've requested a 100 I would have given it to you this wasb and the prophet s wasallam missed that Caravan I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh m [Music]"
