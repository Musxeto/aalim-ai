  "transcript": "that fetcher begins when the horizontal dawn appears so the whole horizon is black pitch black all of a sudden we see this white line coming that's horizontal and this is the break of dawn we can pray fajr and we must refrain from eating and drinking if we're fasting this time of failure ends once the tip of the Sun appears that's it you cannot pray further anymore because the time is over and if you delayed it deliberately it's gone"
