  "transcript": "uh is it true that um who said that spending one third of your word on perfume is not wasting money if he has if yes can we actually spend a lot of money on perfume just a couple of iron did Roman say that spending money on perfume would not be wasting money I don't know if this is authentic or not personally I don't believe it's authentic why because everything can be under the category of extravagance even buying water some bottles of water you buy for half a real or one real Saudi riyal that is sometimes you find bottles of water of 20 years same water hello what is this holy water said no this is Branch so and so from Switzerland or from uh whatever this is extravagance this is nonsense water is water so perfume yes the prophet Islam loved perfumes and he said that there are three things when offered to you you should not reject among them is perfume it's very nice and smell it's very cordial to offer to people so it's inappropriate to not accept it but sometimes you can pay an arm and a leg for a small bottle of perfume so would that be permissible or waste of money or extravagance yes it can be waste of money and extravagance because nothing calls to pay as much for a bottle of perfume and Allah Knows Best"
