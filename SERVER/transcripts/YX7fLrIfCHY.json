  "title": "Is it permissible 2 support a sports team named after an alcohol brand #islam #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "So, there's a sports team named after like wine or alcohol brand, sorry, whiskey uh product. Uh so, am I allowed to support it? If you don't drink it, there's no problem in that. What's the name has to do with a team? If a team is called Budweiser or it's called uh uh gin or uh uh rum or brandy or vodka, what does the name has have to do with me supporting them as a sports team? It's beside the point the issue of sporting uh supporting a sports team. I'm totally against this. I I don't support any team, none whatsoever, because it's ridiculous to support a team and have the allegiance and see idiots fight against one one another about their own team that my team is better than yours. My team won in 1985 and and and yours did not win and this and that. This is pathetic. and get a life. If you're man enough, go and work out. Go to the gym. Hit the field. Do some exercise instead of sitting on your backside eating popcorns and drinking soft drinks, watching hours and hours of games that have no value at all to you as a Muslim. But this is beside the point. So the name has no uh impact and Allah knows best."
