  "transcript": "I'm confused about the I of Z on the first 10 days of should we say only and or should we say also and also theb do we need to say this from the day of or we should make zik with this on the first 10 days as well first of all you should only ask one question and sneaking two questions is not fair and if I answer it I will be opening the door so I will answer your first question the first 10 days of for those who are not going to perform Hajj the prophet saidat wasam that these days are the best days of the year and doing good deeds in it is the best and nothing would surpass doing good deeds in it except for a man who goes out of his home with his wealth to fight in the cause of Allah and he dies as a martyr and his wealth is gone and he comes back with nothing he's dead martyred but his wealth is also spent in the cause of Allah so this is the ultimate so doing good deeds cannot reach that level but it is better than any other thing such as fasting which the prophet used to doam in the first nine days of such as giving charity such as um helping others reading the Quran doing Vick part of the is what we call the expanded so in these 10 days it is recommended to say allahar Allah throughout the day and night not limiting it to after F prayer so we say this and say it hundreds of times and our tongues are moist with saying this Vick if you want would like to add Subhan Allah alhamdulillah that's fine but the prescribed deck is as as mentioned now on the ninth the F of the nth of which is the F of till before the sunset of the 13th or to be more accurate till after of the 13th of these four days days are known to be or the four or five days who's counting known to be where we say after prayers so in addition to throughout the whole uh day and night we specifically say it after the five F prayers then we do our normal and Allah Knows Best"
