  "transcript": "uh so my question is I I sold a few video games and I just recently discovered that it's not permissible so like as for the money can I keep it or like can I use it in s or get counseling with the she so whatever you did out of ignorance and you gained money out of that the money is Hal because Allah tells us that he would not torment a people before sending them a messenger meaning before they acknowledge and know what is right and what is wrong in your case when you sold these games you thought it was Halal therefore whatever money you made in the past when you did not know the ruling is halal as well"
