  "transcript": "to our hospital or why if our wife of our hospitals still approve naturalistic things on their gravity that are you know this is not related at all trust is an issue of infidelity cheating and materialistic thing has nothing to do with trust I want to become rich I want my wife to become rich I want to build a bigger house so I don't see the relationship between the two if you're saying that it's not trust maybe let's use another word my spouse is more interested in materialistic things while I'm interested in spiritual things and reaching Allah no you have to be balanced attention you have to remember foreign but don't forget your portion of Dunya so have a balance the prophet saws was not always praying and fasting he used to play with his wives he used to race and foot he raised to that twice the first time she won he did not forget he waited few years until she gained weight and then he said okay let's race she said I forgot and when I erased him he won he laughed he said this for that one to shake so the prophet used to enjoy life used to play with his wives you can't expect and this is a big problem with people who get committed to Islam all of a sudden all of my life you're my friend you're my relative you're my brother you're my spouse you're always been the one I know all of a sudden you started getting closer to Allah you started learning religion you started being practicing now the Gap is much bigger between you and I what do you do you keep on poking me you're not doing this you're not praying on time you're not wearing your hijab you're not a good Muslim Allah will put you in hell and the Gap is getting bigger and bigger I'm not getting closer to you I'm getting further away from you it's your mistake instead I have so many youngsters finding hidayah and their parents are against their hidayah because or move the pictures move the idols this is Haram don't do this don't do that you're a punk how old are you you just came from the egg and now you want to preach this is not the right way of doing it they have to respect you they have to love you they have to know that you want the goodness for them not to be Simon Says do this do that you're not speaking to them with arrogance from an ivory Tower rather I love you I would like you to be guided if you do this you will win your wife's heart but whenever the Gap is much bigger and you're failing to close up the Gap you will never find peace or happiness unless you try to change your strategy um"
