  "title": "What happens if the Imam faints? Should congregation continue or assist him? - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so brother mom do from Rana is asking two questions one the first one what happens if the Imam while leading the congregation faints and he falls must the congregation continuous a lot or must they rush to assist him this is hypothetical but it happens now to say that while praying in congregation our Imam falls so tough luck for him who will lead the prayer this is not realistic so it is a communal obligation upon the congregation that two or three men must rush to assist him if he has a heart attack they must immediately take him to hospital or help him if they know how to help him the rest of the congregation they must appoint someone and usually it is the one who's behind the Imam the Elven or some of the students of knowledge who would step forward and continue to lead from where he had stopped so if he prayed to records and to remaining the deputy comes and continues the third and the fourth raka not that day all the 500 or the thousand worshipers stop praying to assist him and this is not logical and at the same time is not logical that none of them assists him and they leave him to die this is not logical so two or three men must go to assist and the others must continue their prayer as usual after dupit izing someone else"
