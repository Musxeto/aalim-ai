  "title": "If forgiven for bad thoughts, why aren't we rewarded for good thoughts ( move lips ) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "alhan says we know that intrusive thoughts that are negative as long as we don't speak about them or act upon them Allah has forgiven them so why isn't it the opposite when we think positive of Allah and we make vicar and we make Dua but without moving our lips or without acting upon it why wouldn't that be rewarded the answer is simple the first case it's a gift from Allah it's a concession from Allah who forgave us for any such intrusive thoughts because Allah knows our nature and how difficult it is for us to control such and truths of intrusive thoughts the opposite is not the same because you're the one who's lazy to move your lips and tongue with making thicker or making Dura or reciting the Quran therefore you won't be rewarded for any of that"
