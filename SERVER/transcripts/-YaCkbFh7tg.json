  "transcript": "you're not praying so that people would say oh masha'Allah he prays or he stands all night in prayer for the sake of Allah as some show-off would - because you have to be sincere evening Josey may Allah have mercy on his soul says that I went once late at night with a friend to a mosque him by that and there was a man praying so we looked at him and we said to each other masha'Allah look at how beautiful and submissive this man's prayer is apparently they spoke a bit loud and the man heard this so he wrapped up his prayer in a quick fashion and he came to them with a big smile on his face saying as if he's saying to them that I've heard what you said he said to them how would you feel to know that I am fasting for the past thirty years every single day so look at what showing-off does to an individual this man interrupted this prayer and he exposed his good deeds by telling them that he did this form of worship or good deeds which is fasting for the past 30 years for the sake of Allah now he exposed himself and he used it to boast about it and to show off so if you pray nitrate during the month of ramadhan for the sake of allah azza wajal in this case allah would forgive your previous sense but praying from asia to father is very difficult well allah azza wajal had made this easy for us and he told us that if you pray in the congregation with the Eman until he finishes his prayer that is butcher so if you pray Risha and then you pray the whole taraweeh with him or the night prayer with him until he offers whitter then this would be counted for you as praying the whole night so imagine if you succeed in doing this every single night of Ramadan at the end of ramadan allah almighty will forgive all of your previous sin"
