  "transcript": "about Allah from Emirates Allah today I was praying the other prayer just like half an hour before Maghrib prayer and while praying I felt the discharge I was doubtful so after the prayer I checked and I found the traces of Madi prosthetic fluid and I repeat in my prayer but again doing the prayer just like maybe 10 minutes before the Azan of Maghrib I uh there was again a discharge and when I said salaam and I checked my pants again there was a crisis of the prosthetic fluid so what was I supposed to do because the time of the prayer had ended is my prayer valid if as you have said You Prayed Asar half an hour before Maghrib this is too late and you're I wouldn't say sinful but you have done something that is not recommended macro and the prophet told us that the prayer of the hypocrite is when the sun is about to set and he goes and prays it in like two three minutes quickly this is the the prayer of the hypocrite the Muslims prayed way earlier and the scholars say that the time of emergency and compulsion or disliking is when the glow of the sun is gone and it turns yellow where you can slightly look at it and this is a proctor approximately half an hour to 40 minutes before Sunset so you have done something wrong here now if the emission of methi was so continuous that you had no time for Purity and you prayed again and again your prayer is valid because this is the best of your ability before the time runs out and Allah Knows Best"
