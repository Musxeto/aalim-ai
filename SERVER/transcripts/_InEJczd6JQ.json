  "transcript": "foreign videos that have a female speaker okay first of all this is quite popular unfortunately in the US and maybe sometimes in the UK where a lot of the Muslim sisters have no problem in coming into the media and giving lectures or reminders and the likes and the most authentic opinion is that this is totally prohibited first of all it is not the doing of the Seraph never ever we heard that the mothers of the Believers who are the most knowledgeable among the companions would go to the Masjid and give a public speak speech or address men or lead them in prayer so you know better than them of course not secondly women come out with their faces showing and in Islam it's an issue of dispute whether a woman should cover her face or not but it's not an issue of dispute that men must lower their gaze so why would you leave all these great handsome speakers and Scholars and insist on listening to this sister come on what is it there's something hanky-panky here yeah you would not soften your heart except by watching the sister giving you a reminder maybe shedding a tear or two or the poor thing and you're getting closer to Allah give me a break thirdly this has not unfortunately been limited to this the sisters are sharing the platform and the desk with another brother adari or a scholar and their chit chatting and looking at one another and sometimes cracking jokes and high fives wait wait what are you guys doing is this Islamic dating or what so this is totally prohibited this is how you dilute religion and you get a new form of Islam not the traditional Islam everything is Haram everything is not permissible and you fear Allah no no no this is way better when a man sits next to a woman chit-chatting and maybe flirting and after the show if the mics are not on my place or yours what is this come on you see how Islam is in some of these countries is unfortunately deteriorating because of such there is and such Scholars now I'm not saying that all sisters who give lectures are like this they are there are many of them that are so fabulous and good in character and in knowledge but they have chosen the wrong approach by which other girls and women may follow suit but mislead the right track and end up in the wrong hands so therefore islamically this is not permissible sisters limit your dawa two other sisters no no uh free mixing total segregation this is how it was in the beginning of Islam this is how it should remain till the end of time best this is all the"
