  "transcript": "so I know that for someone who has Catherine consonants they may hold over every again but um my question is uh when can I take the dispensations of someone with gas and consonants like if I make my old one I'm certain that I broke it and I make a second one and then again I'm certain do I make a third one for how many will lose do I say I have gas and consonants so if a person is doubtful whether he has gas incontinence or not he's one of two again either he's a person that knows through previous experiences that once it's once it pops it never stops so it keeps on going on on very close intervals that would not be logical for him to make wudu in this case make one wudu and pray even if you break your rudu because you know from experience that it's not gonna stop or you know from experience that this would take 15 to 20 minutes or half an hour because of something you ate because of your habits I don't know how or why but you know that it's going to continue for half an hour and then it stops for another half an hour or an hour if you know this then it's prohibited for you to pray during this first half an hour you have to wait and until it stops then you make a widow and pray fresh without having any problem what if I'm in between I'm hesitant I'm not sure in this case I would think that delaying your prayer until almost the end of time when you feel that it's not going to stop and the time is going to expire in this case you make Urdu and pray without a problem and Allah Knows Best"
