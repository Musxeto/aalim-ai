  "transcript": "ESMA says that there's a viral video about not to consume broiler chicken because they are made with the exact same formula that is used to develop pigs and the feed that's given to them is also haram like feed made with blood of animals etc what's the ruling regarding this first of all in Islam we depend we rely on certainty we do not work with hearsay as Muslims we do not believe these videos if it comes from an organization that is an official organization that we trust and they tell us about a specific company or companies that they're doing something that is Haram yes we acknowledge but hearsay is not sufficient a lot of the sodas we get emails we get videos that it has pork components in them a lot of the toothpastes and the soaps we use in the shampoos that it has donkey ingredients or pork ingredients or this or that this is all hearsay yes but there is Tom Dick and Harry in America in halal group comm site that monitors food and they said that this in this we don't know that individual nor his group so all of these are not acceptable and a Muslim does not have to listen and adhere to any person that comes in and says he the the clothes you're wearing has like something nice in it and your slippers don't have shock absorbers so it will harm your knees and hence they're haram it what is this nonsense it has to be scientific it has to come from people that we trust and know in order to apply that analyzed Oh gel knows best"
