  "title": "If we make a mistake in sunnah acts in prayer, does it require sujood as sahu #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Um she my question is about prayer today. Um I remember that you said that and even the teacher here explained to us that you know even in the prayers where you can you are supposed to read silently you can read aloud it's not really a problem but he said here that actually it depends on the intention. If you were supposed to read it silently but your intention uh and you did a mistake. So basically you did a mistake on that time you are supposed to do because your intention was not to read it loud. So basically I was wanting to ask you if this was correct and also if this happens also if you are supposed to read it loud and you read silently by mistake. Are you supposed to do then as well? First of all, the most authentic opinion is that sujud is done when you make an error of forgetfulness or incorrect action or something you say which is obligatory or a pillar. If one forgets a sunnah that does not require and it would only open a can of worms. Imagine if I have finished my second surah after fat and I want to go for and I say Allah abar and I forgot to raise my hands and while in the I said ya Allah I forgot to raise my hands. I have to offer or I I forget to point my index finger into all of these are sunnas. If I forget them or abandon them deliberately, there is no sujudis for that and this is the most authentic opinion. Likewise, if the Imam forgets in and recites fat and a surah in the first and second silently and the congregation is absent-minded as well. He didn't raise his voice. So, we shouldn't remind him and say subhan Allah, subhan Allah. And he continued the prayer like that. He did not follow the sunnah but he did not skip something that is mandatory or a pillar. And I say that he does not have to offer sujud and Allah knows best."
