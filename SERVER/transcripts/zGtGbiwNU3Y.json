  "title": "The Dowry of a Woman in Islam",
  "transcript": "is a woman we know that she has to give her doubting so it is is it permissible to give her a dowry which is not in monetary form but rather to say that okay I will marry you and your dowry is that I will teach you the book of Tao hate for example that's fun he has to be a student of knowledge or he has to be a scholar to do this but I would not recommend this because this would be difficult when after a few years something happens and the woman wants to call the marriage off he wasn't as pious as she thought he wasn't as gentle as she thought and he's abusive he hits her he doesn't pray on time so once she wants to ask for holer what is she gonna return to him he didn't give her any money so she he would probably ask for a lot of money that she did not receive she cannot teach him back what he taught her but generally speaking this was done at the time of the Prophet era so sir and the man could not afford even a ring of iron to give as mehar so the Prophet ordered him at is awesome to teach her what he knows from the Quran so if it is a similar situation then the answer is yes no problem but if he has money then she should ask him for a dowry like all other women and at the same time as a normal husband who would refuse to teach his wife if she's willing to learn no student of knowledge no scholar no diary would leave his family in the darkness without teaching them and telling them the religion of allah azza wajal Nadeem from saudi yeah I love"
