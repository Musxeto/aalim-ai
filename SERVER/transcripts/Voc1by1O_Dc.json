  "transcript": "kuwait he says the second teslima in prayer so we know assalamu alaikum is a pillar of salat what about assalamu alaikum the second one is an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion that it is also mandatory and a pillar of salat because never ever it was reported that the prophet haslam concluded his prayer with one salam except in el janaza salatul janaza the prayer of funeral that's the only exception"
