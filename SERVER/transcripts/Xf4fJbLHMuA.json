  "transcript": "whether a Muslim who does not pray is still a Muslim or not if a person does not pray at all this is kufur and this is the most authentic opinion and I'm not talking uh uh about a person who prays on and off like brother M said a person who prays two prayers or three prayers a day is still a Muslim but he's a f he's a sinner without any doubt but a person who does not pray a single ra and if you tell him come and pray he ignores you and if he were to be taken to court and the judge says to him we will behead you if you do not pray and they said I believe in prayer and I believe in Allah but I'm not going to pray then this is a full-fledged cfir and there is a a beautiful uh um discussion between Dr Abu aminal Phillips and myself on this topic that was done three four years uh ago in Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham UK I think it's called the great debate you can find it on YouTube and inshallah it would be beneficial to listen to both parties uh opinions and uh uh verdicts so yes a person who prays two or three prayers a day is still a Muslim but he is in great Danger jalice from Saudi"
