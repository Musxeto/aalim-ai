  "transcript": "Pernell chimera cheese a few years ago now I got 128 grams of gold from my husband as a gift which I wore any once on my wedding day to have draft paper color on it and I also got two other small sets really small sets of gold from other people as gifts which I've never worn glow the pink which deals with zakat over jewelry now we know that there are four types of money or wealth if you would say that are that are due for zakat among them is gold and silver and there are on the top of the list however some scholars say that if a woman has jewelry that is made of gold and silver and she wears it then there is no zakat because it takes the same ruling of normal clothes it takes a ruling of the car you drive or the house you live in you don't pay the half of that but the most authentic opinion of scholars is that you have to pay the cat over gold and silver whether you keep them in a safe or you wear them or you lend them to people so that they were them when they go to parties etc as long as they are made of gold and silver it the artisans are capable and what is the nisab what is the limit if you have 85 grams and above then you have to pay each year that passes 2.5 percent of the value of that gold so if you have 128 grams of one set given to you by a husband and two more sets let's say another 100 grams you add this up you take 2.5 percent off it and give it away to zakat and I hope this answers the question"
