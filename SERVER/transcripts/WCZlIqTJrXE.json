  "title": "Is prayer valid on prayer mat that makes a barrier between my forehead & the ground? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is some prayer mats make a barrier between us and the ground and if it's a tight spot and we're forced to put uh our hand or a part of our forehead on it when prostrating is this valid this is most likely an OCD and this is an exaggeration do you expect us to uncover all the carpets in the masjids and pray on the solid concrete this is not logical the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to pray on straw mats known as and that was a barrier as well as you've described but it is not of a barrier that would invalidate your prayer the companions as mentioned in theah used to also whenever they prostrated and it was summer put their sleeves or their clothes and pray on that to avoid the heat of the ground and that was a barrier the turbin we pray wearing or this when we prostrate it comes between our forehead and the ground and this is a barrier this has no impact because it's negligible what invalidates your prayer if you pray on a spongy like carpet where you feel that when you place your hands that it's floating it's not touching the ground and you press it a little bit it goes deeper and deeper and deeper and the same thing goes with your forehead and nose this spongy like carpet that has a foam a real thick uh uh big foam that you float in as if you're diving in this invalidates a prayer and Allah Knows Best"
