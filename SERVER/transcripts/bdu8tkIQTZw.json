  "title": "Who inherits a revert who has no muslim relatives & lives in a non muslim country? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdallah says in a scenario where a Muslim is living in a non-muslim country and there is no Islamic Center in his area also the fact that all of his heirs are non-muslims therefore after the allocation of 1/3 as his will who will be the one that most deserving of the 2/3 of his wealth so the question is clear a person accepted Islam but he has no blood relatives who are Muslims and he dies what do we do with his wealth first of all the Prophet said that in salatu salam that a disbeliever does not inherit a believer so if you accepted Islam your parents are non-muslims you die your parents do not inherit you and if one of your in of your parents dies you do not inherit him or her because the hadith is crystal clear okay the person is not married he doesn't have children and he dies what do we do with his wealth if he's in a Muslim country then his money would go to the Muslim Treasury known as baitul mal so every Muslim government has a Treasury that this government spends from to the welfare of the Muslims of the country then this wealth has to go there okay the man is living in Europe in a non-muslim country or in Russia and there is no Islamic center around this is I don't believe it's possible unless it's in the Vatican because every country has an Islamic centre maybe not in your city but at least in the major cities Oh of the country and if this is the case then the whole wealth must be allocated and given to that Islamic Center where they will spend from it in the welfare of the Muslims in that country if there were truly no Muslim Center or Islamic Center at all at all then the Muslims around him who are legally capable of obtaining that wealth must take that and spend it to the poor and needy Muslims too on their education on their medication on their housing etc in that country and Allah knows all knows best"
