  "title": "Can I do Ruqya on Food & Water for my In-laws to improve our relationship? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says in case I suspect evil eye that is I a good relationship with my in-laws but sometimes they are suddenly changed without any clear reason can I make rakia for us like to read on water or food I cook then we eat from the same food actually I did this many times and hamdullah it worked but I am afraid this is considered as an innovation first of all reciting rakia over food is not from the Sunnah reciting rakia over water or things to drink is not from the Sun but it was done by some of the Salaf of the tabi mean etc so the concept of reciting Quran and blowing this is from the Sunnah say hadith of a Boucherie the hood we may Allah be pleased with him when they went and made her appear with the Fatiha chapter one - an idol worshiper a tribe's leader who was stung by a snake or a scorpion and he was in few minutes healthy as a bull no illness with him after doing rakia how was that okay done he recited the fat hand spirit dry spit on him blew on him so this is applicable we know that drinking water especially Zamzam water is means of a cure so there is nothing wrong in a combination between the two in sha allah and it has been proven to be quite effective now what the sister is asking about is that she wants to perform such a rakia on food and water presented to her in-laws and this would clear a lot of the argument and the relationship between them and it was practice and proven my own opinion is that this has no impact on your relationship with your in-laws it is all an issue of miscommunication usually we tend to imagine things and Shaitaan inflates such an imagination and makes it bigger than its actual size until we are convinced and we believe in it most likely your recitation of the rupiah is helping you internally it's making you peaceful so when you speak with them after that you tend to treat them nicely and hence they treat you nicely and this is the formula of communication and relationships between people it is told that it's a story that a woman was really upset with her mother-in-law who was sick yet taunting her oppressing her saying bad and rude things to her though the daughter-in-law is helping her so she went to a sorcerer or whom she thought he was a sorcerer and she said that I need to get rid of this woman so the man told her to do what he's telling her to do for a whole month like clockwork and he gave her some potion and told her to put a spoon full of it in her breakfast lunch and dinner and to serve her these meals regularly and in a month time it will be all over so the woman started doing that and the first few couple of days things improved with her mother-in-law after a week her mother-in-law started being so kind to her that the woman regretted her decision after 10 days she went back to the sorcerer or he whom she thought was a sorcerer and told him listen I'd like to reverse this I need the antidote so that I would not kill my mother-in-law I regret it what I what I did had done and my mother-in-law is a sweetest woman on earth so the man who apparently was a wise man he said to her I gave you nothing but some water with salt in it when you started feeding your mother-in-law and being kind to her three times a day she expressed her gratitude and she exchanged with you the same way that you've dealt with her in kindness and good words and love and affection and seriously this is what we need when we deal with others unfortunately nowadays the cause root the or the root cause of our problems is that we insist and we demand to have our rights we neglect others rights we insist on having our rights come first and this is why it's like two cars head-on in a very narrow road each one says no I must go and you must back off and both are stubborn and not willing to back off either they will have a head-on collision or they will not progress or go anywhere so my advice to you is if you want to do rocky on water this is OK and there's no problem in that the only thing that scares me a bit is that if some of them saw you do this and this had happened before a woman is trying her level best to do okay on her husband and her husband so that and he divorced her because he claimed that she is casting spells on him and she's doing black magic not knowing that she is reciting the Quran so if you do this secretively and no one knows about it on water there's no problem in sha Allah"
