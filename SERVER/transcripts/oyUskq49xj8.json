  "title": "Can we write notes in the Quran (Mushaf)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sohe says can we write something related to the translation in the Koran if I understand your question show her that you have a copy of the Quran in Arabic and you'd like to write something beside the margin related to the seer so you come to a particular word and you write the meaning of it this is an issue of dispute some allow it and some prohibit it and I'm inclined to the side that prohibits it simply because this is one safer to more respectful and three there are alternatives so nowadays we have stick notes we have notebooks that we can write whatever we want while keeping the Quran intact pure and without any form of disrespect yes some of the companions and this supports the opinion of scholars who said that this is permissible some of the Companions used to write something according to the tafseer they heard from the Prophet as salam beside the quran pages some of them yet some of them prevented that and prohibited that so it's an issue of dispute and no one would blame you if you write whatever you want on a separate notebook or on little pieces of paper that can be stuck and attached to the Quran and removed easily without affecting it nobody would say no no you must write on the Quran and therefore this is safer and Allah knows best you"
