  "transcript": "questions about shrimp is this allowed she says some Scholars say it's makr disliked shrimps an Islam as any other living creature I mean what's the ruling when it comes to food of all types how do we go about saying this is halal this is not what's what's the basic all food MH is halal with the exception of the things that the prophet told us not to eat for example we're for it's forbidden for us to eat meat that is not slaughtered animals that are not slaughtered so if someone hits an animal on the head and it dies or uh electrifies it or uh suffocates it this is a dead animal it's a dead meat we're not allowed to eat this we're not allowed to eat a pork meat we're not allowed to eat dogs we're not allowed to eat lions and and so on but anything else it's permissible for us to eat unless there is a special evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah making that forbidden for us so shrimps is uh something that we all enjoy eating there's nothing wrong in eating it"
