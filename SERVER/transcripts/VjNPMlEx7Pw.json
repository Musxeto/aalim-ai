  "title": "My son has 5 nightmares a week, is this black magic, jinn or evil eye? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in france she says my son has like five nightmares every week so is this related to gin to black magic to evil eye to envy the answer is not necessarily all people get nightmares maybe these nightmares are repeated due to what your son watches on tv maybe it's repeated because of what your son reads or the video games he plays with so there might be many things that are affecting your son's subconscious and causing him to see such nightmares but not necessarily everything that happens in our lives we should blame magic sorcery uh jinn possession etc and allah knows best you"
