  "transcript": "this is known among the scholars of following the weak hadith in what is known as provided in a man which means that the the virtues of deeds and they I did identify this by saying that there are certain deeds that are not related into Parag or Haram so it is permissible some scholars say to follow a weak hadith for example if we have a hadith stating that it is good to pray six records between maglev Anisha though the hadith is weak yet they say that it is not stating something with hard work on some scholars say that it is permissible to follow other scholars and this is the school of remember Bonnie may Allah have mercy on his soul and I seem to recommend it and follow it states that Allah knoweth has perfected his religion and completed it and part of this perfection and completion is that we do not rely on any weak hadith therefore we have the Quran and we have the authentic Sunna why should we go to weaken and why should we select some and reject some this is not the right methodology the correct and right methodology is to follow only the authentic hadith and this way you would feel much comfortable so whenever a hadith is not authentic whatever hiding is weak reject it inshallah you are on the right path and Allah knows"
