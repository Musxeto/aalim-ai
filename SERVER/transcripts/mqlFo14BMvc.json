  "title": "Husband & in laws don't like she's now practicing (does hijab, not watch movies No free mixing assim",
  "transcript": "what I understood is that she started practicing and people are not happy with that with her back not backbiting or slandering or watching movies and they're not happy by her wearing the hijab and so is her husband so what should she do the answer is very clear this is a religion that instructs and demands that you follow and submit your will to Allah we do not have any compromise in this so if Allah tells us to do something then the whole world tells us to go against it of course we obey Allah azzawajal to the best of our ability but the trick is how to be diplomatic you don't have to confront people face on head on as they say you don't have to fight rather be diplomatic be wise when they criticize you don't defend yourself don't argue with them just keep a smiling face and Nod your head without approving of what they're saying nor picking up a fight just let it slide after six seven times they'll feel um as if they're fools and crazy people talking to themselves and they'll let you be they will learn how to live with it the moment you defend yourself or argue it puts fuel to the fire and they'll continue and continue relentlessly so there are things that Islam had drawn the line there's no going back there's no compromise even if your husband tells you take off your hijab mix with my friends let's go to the movies let's listen to some music Etc these things are Haram be diplomatic give him advice he doesn't listen leave the room and go somewhere else let him with his sins and be diplomatic and wise in addressing these issues but never compromise with your religion"
