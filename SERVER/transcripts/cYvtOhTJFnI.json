  "title": "Is it sunnah to wear a Kufi (cap) and Jubba (Thobe) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I was wondering many Muslims where the thobe the the Juba and the CUFI hat and call it sooner but it is but is there any proof that they are Sunnah would it be lawful to call the coffee and the Juba soon again this is similar to the previous question these are not part of the Sunnah because the Prophet did not order the sides on to wear a cofee which is the head cap or to wear a Juba like this or to wear a soap like the white one I'm wearing this is not part of sunan this is part of customs so it is not something that you would be rewarded for because the Prophet did not order us to do it I saw some and he did not wear it himself like we do and sometimes this would not be even recommended so if you are in the States or in Europe and you decide to wear the Arab Saab while preaching the people and everybody is in their three-piece suit this is what the norm they do this is what they wear so you would stand out in the crowd and people may not listen to your teaching because they think that you're teaching a culture related to Arabs not the religion of Allah Azza WA JAL and therefore it is permissible to wear this when you travel if it is part of your customs if it's part of your country's costume no problem but if it's not and you are from a country that do not wear such clothes maybe that would be an attire of Fame though Bashara that people would look at you and you would feel proud of yourself and hence you'll be sinful the Prophet hasn't forbade us from wearing something that would make us proud and stand out in a crowd like a person wearing a pink suit for example Wow everybody's looking at him but yes this is not something recommended in Islam and it depends on the pros and the cons depends on the advantages and disadvantages to those who you are giving Dawa and called them and Allah so Allah knows best"
