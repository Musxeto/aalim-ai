  "title": "Is taking money for teaching Quran Teaching Islam, for being an imam a form of shirk assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is a very huge misconception among people that taking money in the exchange of teaching Quran or teaching the Sunnah or leading the Salat in the Masjid is Haram and minor Sheikh this is not true pleased with him said that we traveled on an expedition and we were ran out of food then we came to a tribe of non-muslims and we asked them for hospitality and they refused so we took aside and sat minutes later a servant comes and says is any one of you able to do rookia and rookie was for Arabs and non-arabs for Muslims and non-muslims of Jin for example so this is a kafir tribe why they said because our tribe's leader has been stung either by a scorpion or by a snake or something he's dying so one of them said I can offer urukia but we ask for Hospitality refused you give us 30 heads of sheep so they agreed so the man says I went there I recited only the Fatiha and blue darling and in seconds the man stood up as nothing has been affecting him so they gave us the Sheep now we were in a dilemma shall we eat the sheep or la la la we will take it to Medina so they went to Medina and said to the prophet we did this and this and this so the prophet said how did you know it's Rukia by Allah it's Rukia the man only recited Fatiha and took what money for that the prophet said take my share my 20 my fifth from it and he took it accepted it what does this mean that you can teach people Quran for money someone comes to me Sheikh I'd like you to give me an hour of your time teach me I said okay you have to pay me x amount of money you're teaching you the Quran for money he said do you think I'm a charity organization I have to make a living you're taking one hour of my time to do what so you're charging for the Quran Sheikh no I'm charging for my time is given money from the uh ruler or the Muslim government this is halal money teachers and universities they teach Hadith they teach they charge salary and the doctor doesn't fear Allah and the lawyer doesn't fear Allah so this is not logical this money is a compensation for my time not for my knowledge if you come and ask me while walking this teacher what's the ruling on this and said how much you're gonna pay yeah this is Haram But to answer questions to solve people problems with your spare time this is for Allah but when you say no I need time with you and I have a million or two or three million followers if I give each one of them five minutes how do I live I will die my time would be gone so it's not is when you bargain we would like you to be our Imam in Perlis this is excuse me so I said how much you're giving me he said give me you five thousand Ringgits and a house is giving me ten thousand so if you can match this maybe no ah bargaining wait this is not the right thing to do but I hope this answers your question"
