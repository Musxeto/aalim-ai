  "title": "Do calamities happen due to our sins or are they tests from Allah? #Assim #calamity assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sh recently I heard something like calamities only happen to a person because of sins uh and they only leave through repentance uh I I I was under the assumption sometimes it happens for sin sometimes it's like a test uh can you like explain this is true calamities can be attributed to one of the two either they are a form of cleaning and cleansing a person from his sins Allah says no Calamity befalls upon you except due to what your hands have earned and Allah forgives a lot so this is one of the reasons the other is it's a form of test and elevating the servants level at the sight of Allah as per the Hadith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him when he visited the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and placing his hand over his chest when the prophet was ill and he said oh prophet of Allah we speak that you get sick as two of us would get sick it's doubled and the prophet said yes the most tested through calamities are the prophets then the righteous than those below them depending on the strength of their IM the more a person is strong in his belief the more the Calamity and the test is upon him so this is how it is in Islam whatever happens to me I attribute this to my sins hypothetically if I was sinless I would still not argue or complain rather say alhamdulillah it's a test from Allah and I pray to Allah that he grants me and you and that he protects us from such tests but we have no other choice but to be patient and tolerant and Allah Knows Best"
