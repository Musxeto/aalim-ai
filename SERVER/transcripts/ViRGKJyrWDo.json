  "transcript": "alhamdulillah [Applause] for for dear brothers and sisters in Islam the longest Ayah in the Quran is known as and it translates to the verse of the death or of the loan and lending people money is part of the permissible transactions in Islam it varies from being mandatory to forbidden so it can be recommended and it also can be not recommended and it can be in the middle of the five rulings which is permissible depending on the intention of the the person borrowing depending on the circumstances and Allah has mandated in this long Ayah and the verses that follow it that we should write the that we should authenticate that we should ensure our own rights when we give and when we lend people and those who borrow so that no dispute would arise afterwards and authenticating such a debt could be either by writing or by the testimony of two witnesses or by giving something as a guarantee that you will pay back that loan and we call it Rah or mortgage this is Allah's ruling and Scholars disputed whether it's mandatory to write it or if it's my brother or my friend that I trust that it is recommended to write it it's an issue of dispute among Scholars however if someone comes and asks for a loan and you tell him to write a document to prove that and you see change on his face or resentment then know that he is about to steal your money because no one comes asking for a loan and he would refuse to have a document proving that or have witnesses testifying to that unless he has an ill intent and if you're shy some of us become shy to ask for such proof or evidence if you do that and he steals your money and he rips you off the money that you had lent him and you go and supplicate just before the of and you supplicate between thean and and you supplicate in the last third of the night oh Allah deprive him of his offspring oh Allah take his money destroy his health take his wealth Allah will not answer your supplication because you are the one who wronged yourself the prophet saysat there are three people that Allah would not answer their Dua and among them a man who lent some other person money and he did not have witnesses to testify or to witness what he had done so if he makes Dua Allah would not answer his Dua the other two are not relevant to us but just for the sake of argument a man who had a woman with ill and bad manners and he does not divorce her yet he prays to Allah Allah give her a heart attack oh Allah do this and that to her Allah would never answer his supplication on her not on anything else and the third one is a man who gave his money to a foolish person a youngster someone who's foolish in his family and the man or that person uh spent all the money Allah would not answer his supplication on that foolish person because Allah says do not give the foolish your money now lending is a beautiful form of worship if you have the good intention and if you do it for the sake of Allah the the the return of investment the ROI of lending is unbelievable there are three stages the prophet told us in the Hadith when you give someone when a Muslim gives a Muslim money twice it is equivalent to the charity The Sod of this money once so if I give you a th000 quid as a loan and you return it a week later and then you ask for another one and I give you a thousand and you return it a month later Allah Asel would reward me as if I have given for ,000 and the money is in my pocket this is 100% no it's approximately 50% return of investment not only that the prophet tells us if you postpone someone who cannot pay back so I give a person ,000 pound for a month and the month is due so I say give me my money back he said I don't have money can you give me an extension of a whole of another month and I said okay the prophet says these 30 days every day you have the reward of a charity of that money so every day a th000 pounds of Charity is being registered to you not only that the prophet says if the second appointment the second date is due and you go and tell the man give me the money and he says I'm I'm unable to pay you I don't have money the prophet says you have double the amount every day as Charity and this Hadith was reported in sunb MA authenticated by the albani imagine how many how how how how many pounds we have in the banks or under the mattress or wherever you hide your money when there are needy people in need of that money imagine how many people have invested their money in Haram rather in giving it to their brothers trustworthy brothers who will pay back insh who have good intention yet we refuse to invest with Allah investing with Allah is the best business you can have there is no credit crunch no one would be bankrupt because the provider is Allah he puts the food on the table he gives you the ability to stand and work and move around however the prophet tells us that this part of investment has high Returns the prophet tells usat wasam on the day of judgment a man whom Allah has given a lot of money would be submitted in front of Allah Allah would ask him what had you done and the man says nothing I don't have a lot of worship night prayer fasting voluntary going for going for Haj I don't have a lot of good deeds but I used to have transactions with others and they used to buy things for me but not on on credit and I used to tell my boys when they go and collect if he's wealthy take it easy from him and if he is needy and he's unable to pay back then postpone him indefinitely Allah says on that great day I the almighty I'm more more worthy of you in forgiveness than you set him free take him to Paradise because of postponing people who have loans and debts for him now compare this to someone who gives Â£10 as a debt and just before the man reaches his house after taking these 10 pounds he calls and he knocks on the door how is my Deb doing look and compare how stingy and miserable and and misery people are with that person whenever you give someone in thatt always remember that Allah forgives your sins as long as you're patient and tolerant Abu hanifah it was reported may Allah have mercy on his soul and may Allah bless him it was reported that he used to sit in the shade of a house of his neighbor every afternoon and one day his his neighbor came and borrowed some money from him and since then he stopped sitting in the shade why he said I was afraid of that sitting in the shade of my neighbor's house who took money from me would be interest and I want don't want to break his heart and remind him that he took something from me Allah says in the Quran and if the detor is in hard time if he does not have money then Grant him time till it is easy for him to repay and this shows how close Muslims are if he doesn't have don't bombard him with phone calls smss and knocking on his door give him time he's not trying to evade and to skip your loan or your debt but he is unfortunate not to have the financial means to pay you back so have it easy on him now having said that encouraging people to lend others as borrowers Islam puts a lot of boundaries a lot of restrictions for you not to borrow people I don't know if all of you have debts or not but the majority of the Muslims are in debt some are legitimate debts you have to feed your family you have to live and some are not the prophet says glory be to Allah Subhan Allah what Allah has revealed to me about restricting and limiting the issue of debt if a person were to be martyred in the cause of Allah and then brought up to life and marted again and then brought up to life and marted for the third time and he had thatt on him he would not be permitted to Paradise until his debt is being paid off to be mared three times now A lot of us Muslims are good in giving justifications and legitimizing our dealings so a lot of us would say yeah yeah this is is when it's to a Muslim but if I borrow from the government if I borrow from a big bank if I borrow from big companies if I borrow from a cafir this is a different story I can take their money it's okay it's Halal for me and it's not the prophet saysat in an authentic Hadith whomever borrows an amount of money with the ill intent not to pay it back he will meet Allah on the day of judgment as a thief as a robber and now I was yesterday just only yesterday a brother came to my hotel and told me about one of his relatives who was working in the USA and just before he went back to his country he took his credit card and started buying left right and Center things that he didn't need he went to his relatives what do you need you need this gold nuggets you need uh groceries and he bought everything that he could think of and he left for good this person would meet Allah on the day of judgment as a thief likewise this maybe you don't have it here we have it a lot where I come from but you do have it here so I hear from east Europe immigrants coming and working and you don't pay them on time or because they're illegitimate uh uh immigrants not legally in the country you make them work for a month or two or three and give them 10% of what you've agreed upon this is robbery the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says that you should give the man you hire his wage before his sweats dry not to postpone it for six seven months and then then start because he's in need and he cannot complain then you start to bargain with him to make it less and less compare this to what you do and how you will face Allah on the day of judgment I see I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness so ask him subhana tala for forgiveness the prophet's one of his frequent Dua was seeking refuge in from from the hardship of debt because that as we know it it is humilation in the daytime when you meet your the one who gave you the loan and it is a lot of burden and worries at night time because you don't know how you will pay it off and to be de free is a merit and one of the blessings of Allah upon you the prophet says three things if you're free of them you will be admitted to Jenna one of them is arrogance if you don't have arrogance in you that's good second thing is and is taking money from the public wealth so I'm taking money from the government I'm taking money from the muslim's treasury it's no not a specific person's money and the third thing is debt if these three you're free off Allah would admit you to Jenna now the majority of us keep on borrowing and unfortunately they borrow for silly things for a bigger LCD for a new uh uh video game for a car for a bigger house Etc and all this senses all this indicates the amount of foolishness we are in because we're in in this vision ious circle of trying to look like others and to behave like others and to be in the Melting Pot do what they do even it leads us to riba and this is the majority of the loans here worldwide you borrow but you borrow with paying interest now you can camouflage it as you wish any interest over a loan this is riba and nowadays so-called Islamic Banks are giving lots of Shar compliant transactions or windows so they call which is almost so they call it they call it they call it different types of uh uh schemes that look on paper to be good but if you look to the essence and to the spirit of it you will find it to be RBA they sell you something they don't not own they sell you something you did not see and then they take a power of attorney from you to sell it to someone else and then give you the money in cash much less than what you have to pay on installments and all of this is a trick for riba loans usually is equivalent to riba because look at the loans you get rarely you will find a neighbor who say listen this is 100,000 quid go and buy some house and and build it and pay it over the duration of 10 15 years although Muslims have money Muslims are not poor but unfortunately when you are away from the Quran and from the Sunnah you become stingy you don't you feel like paying a pound takes part of your soul actually you do not have a soul if you feel like this so look at the loans that people get a lot of the Muslims say we have to get a mortgage on the house you're paying riba said I have to do it where would my family live pay rent yeah I will pay rent for 20 years this is equivalent to buying a house pay rent for 50 years rather than get one penny being paid for riba where the Prophet cursed those who take riba give riba witness riba and register riba and he said in an authentic Hadith they are all in the Sin alike even if you're needy you are in the Sin like the one who is giving it to you look at the people that are borrowing for student loan 3,000 6,000 9,000 and they sign on a paper saying yes we will pay riba once we our income is above this or so and they're agreeing on making riba if someone makes you sign a contract that it is permissible for him to chop off your leg if you don't pray if you don't pay back or to do something that is more heinous you would not approve and riba is one of the major seven sins in Islam he says okay what should I do this means that I would would not go to the university so what don't go or go to the university and then end up in hell those who borrow through credit cards and credit cards people buy left right and Center they know and they've signed a paper setting that the after the grace period is over if I don't pay back I'm going to pay you 5% 7% this is riba says yeah sh what can I do what can you do you're agreeing on this and you're doing this and you're paying this and then you supplicate oh Allah free Palestine how will Allah Asel answer your call oh Allah cure my son oh Allah guide my wife oh Allah pay off my debts you are doing this and Allah does not answer the supplication the Dua of a person whose income is made of Haram now we all know that a person who has that will not enter Jenna but ABD may Allah have mercy and his soul Justified this and said this is to a person who takes up a debt and is capable of paying is not paying or he takes up a debt for something that is not needy for extravagant for showing off and he knows that he will not be able to pay due to his position but a person who takes a debt for something that is essential in his life it's a matter of life and death and death it's interest free Deb and he intends to pay it off but he is unable until he dies he would not be included in this uh uh Hadith or warning of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam therefore my advice that those who have money look around someone you know for 20 30 years you trust him like a brother give him the money that he needs as a loan interest of course free but make your onel and your intention to help people instead of them in forcing them to go to uh uh riba uh based Bank always authenticate your debts even if he's your brother this is not your money tomorrow you die and you have given a brother Â£10,000 and there's no documents to prove it you are depriving your Offspring your heirs your sons and daughters and wives from this money because you did not register it do not and I repeat do not spread around your bad experiences I want to give the brother Â£10,000 the brother comes up and say I gave couple of years ago Â£10,000 to a practicing brother who came in the first row in the Masjid until date I'm call him every single day and he doesn't pay back I immediately withdraw my loan and refuse to do this never spread the bad experiences you have because then people would never ever do good if you come back back from Hajj and you say it was hot it was humid it was dirty and the people did this and I was robbed and I next time you end up finding that people are not encouraged to go to Haj always give the positive thing for the sake of Allah and finally if you have a loan pay it off even if it's for the government even it's for the cfer Do Not postpone it because the prophet says the postponement in payment of the debt of someone who is capable of doing so this makes his reputation permissible for me to backbite him and it makes his uh uh wealth uh uh punishable by the judge it's okay for the judge to take his money half of it or whatever it needs and finally always be grateful and show your gratitude to those who do good for you the prophet says the reward of a loan if someone gives you alone his reward the reward is to praise him so whenever I go the brother he gave me this may Allah protect him may Allah increase his wealth the reward of such a loan is praising him and to pay on time I ask Allah the almighty that he prevents us from borrowing from others and that he makes us among those who share their money in lending others and to give us the upper hand and to make us fulfill our promises and our obligations m Sal"
