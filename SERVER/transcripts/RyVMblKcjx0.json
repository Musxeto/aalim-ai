  "transcript": "Cal we can do better than this let's try it again alhamdulillah alhamdulillah that's much better um my name is fi and I am the executive director of Penny Canada I'd like to start by saying we are truly truly honored to be here today um and working closely with our brothers from the AK Juma Center and the MCC in welcoming our Steve sh on his first ever tour of Canada I've had the honor of spending the last two uh events that we had uh one in Toronto on Saturday and one in Edmonton yesterday with the she and um you all know him uh for his very stoic and straightforward approach uh and he is exactly the same behind the scenes as well uh but he is such a pleasure uh it's been a pleasure to sit with him learn from him and just be in his s in his comp in his company um my Dua I I I have a request from all of you this is my community I'm based out of here I was just appointed as the executive director and in charge of the organization last uh Wednesday I need your duas that Allah allow us to do justice to the am and allow us to uh serve the um in a way that Allah would be pleased with us um for those that are not aware Penny appeal Canada is a global humanitarian relief organization we operate in over 35 countries and uh alhamdulillah um you know today we are here uh with the AK Center our event tomorrow and today this tour basically is to fundraise for our brothers and sisters in Gaza so please donate generously I'm not going to hold back to she any longer uh I'd like to introduce to you as the Sheik before me introduced him is that working [Music] okay ald usually people complain that they don't have a lot Allah has not given them money wealth and they complain and if you were to look at what Allah has given us you should evaluate yourself to be a billionaire not a millionaire a billionaire yeah if someone would were to give you a million dollars for one of your fingers or $100 million for your eyes or for your legs or for your ability to hear or to taste or to feel you would not accept any of that of that so you're actually and literally a billionaire but we do not see that now when we come and Ponder upon the human anatomy and how Allah made us we find Miracle after Miracle as Allah mentioned in the Quran wouldn't you Ponder upon the signs that Allah had created in your own selves in your own bodies and one of these small tiny organs that Allah has blessed us with is the tongue this organ that allows us to speak this organ that Allah says in the Quran have we not given him two eyes and a tongue and two lips so Allah is showing us one of his favors and blessings upon us this tongue and with this organ we differ from the animal world where we can speak and express ourselves and say whatever we think of and this is why we have to show our gratitude to Allah by speaking in which Allah approves of and refraining from whatever displeases him we have to preserve our tongues from what from speaking in vain in something that is Haram in something that is sinful the prophet saidat whoever believes in Allah in the day of judgment must either say good or refrain from Talking keep your lips sealed and the prophets also said the Prophet The Prophet okay also said when was asked who's the best among Muslims who's the best one is he the one with the biggest biceps is he the one with the fanciest scar he saidat whoever the Muslims are in safety from his tongue and his actions his hands he doesn't abuse them physically nor verbally and every time we have to evaluate what comes out of our mouths is it good or bad is it beneficial or it will throw us in Hell Fire now it's a studio stereo mallah should I use this or yes both mashallah how lucky I [Music] am and the value and the weight of the word is very heavy this is something that we do not usually pay attention to with the word you enter Islam in Arabic when we say word this refers to a single word or a phrase or a sentence this is also known as a word this is why the best word of all is the word of which is to believe that there is no deity worthy of being worshiped other than Allah this is one word and this is why the prophet Sall wasallam at the deathbed of his uncle Abu Talib said to him uncle say one word that I should intercede on the day of judgment with Allah for for you and he meant so this is a single word that admits you to Islam should we wait until they fix the microphones huh okay can we hear no it's not yeah the DJ is awful here I know the guy who controls I don't know what you call guys my English is lousy so excuse me get closer something I have to get closer yeah everybody wants to get closer yeah Reach Out And Touch someone so with the with this word you enter Islam but by the way with a single word you exit Islam a single word takes you out of the fold of Islam a simple joke you do not pay attention to you joke about the Quran you joke about the prophet you joke about the ritual and this is something everybody does unfortunately and they think that what counts is what in what's in the heart not knowing I hope I don't get a sucker punch uh not knowing that the Hypocrites were condemned in chapter nah TBA where Allah says and if you were to ask them they would say we're just fooling around is it by Allah his signs and his messenger you were mocking and making fun do not apologize you have exited Islam after being believers how many of us receive such jokes on your WhatsApp or on social media how many of us intentionally go to watch movies that mock the religion or say inappropriate things about our Prophet with this word you can get married the Father of the Bride says I give you my M my daughter in marriage for you say I [Music] accept that's done your man and wife don't we have to go to uh get a civil marriage no no no islamically she's your wife in the presence of two male Muslim uh men she's yours that's it with this word and with this word you break a Muslim home in an impulsive moment and in a very unsmart move when you're angry with your wife I divorce you you're divorced some of the people are like the AK-47 you know the Clash nikov divorce divorce divor divorce divorce divor multiple times alhamdulillah now fully automatic weapons were banned so you can't do that anymore you can use semi-automatic so this is problematic with this word people don't pay attention to in Islam the Sheikh has property Mah he's very rich increase him in wealth he deals in real estates mahab so I see a plot that he has and I say shik how much he said $3,000 $300,000 I said Kal I buy it and I reach out to him he shakes hand he says I sell it huh but this there's ambiguity in this transaction because I don't know which property he's talking about and he doesn't know what dollars I'm talking about Singaporean dollars Canadian dollars so this transaction is canel is canel alhamdulillah Saved by the Bell so by this the transaction is done 10 minutes later someone comes and says oh I'll give you 400,000 in your property he cannot come back to me and say I cancel my my deal with you we didn't go and register it we did not formalize the Muslim is bound by his word by his tongue and Subhan Allah Subhan Allah Subhan Allah look at the importance of the word when the first thing you'll be asked in your grave about three things who's your lord what's your religion and who is this man that was sent to you and the prophet told us those who were fortunate those who were practicing Muslims those who were walking the talk would find the ability to answer these questions without any hesitation who was this man that was sent to you and he would say Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam and that would make your day your future you will have Windows from Heaven open and you'll get the fragrance and the co Cool Breeze that will make you say oh Allah make the day of judgment now I want to go to my home I want to see my family I want to enjoy the rest of Eternity in Paradise those who were not walking the talk those who used to skip prayers those who used to deal in RBA and mortgage those who used to cheat and lie those who lost their identity and became similar to the non-muslims you can't tell if they're Muslims or not old them bling blings bling blings huh whatever and chains and bracelets and earrings and Subhan Allah and you cannot tell if they're Muslims or otherwise they would say huh huh I don't know I saw people say and I said what they said and that person is doomed for a very long time may Allah protect us so the power of the word is huge in Islam you know books of f they've devoted chapters for these words that would take people out of the fold of Islam or that would be considered a major sin words that are related to shik so you could say and swear by other than Allah without intending it it's either minor shik or major shik so many of us say by the prophet and some would say by the head of my father all of these are words of an oath and swearing all of these are words that indicate there is a form of shik some of them would even say Jesus Christ whenever they see something Jesus or holy cow holy M moli holy moly or holy sh star star or holy F triple stars now this might sound funny but it's a sad reality that if this is Holy to you you're going down Big Time who huh huh I don't know I heard them say and I said what they said so be careful what comes out of your mouth because Allah says not a rhetoric a word that comes out of your mouth except there is those who will note it down and they're careful of noting everything down and the prophet saidat a man may speak a single word that is from Allah's that that would make Allah angry it would drop him in Hellfire further than 70 years he will just keep on dropping in Hellfire for 70 years by one word that he does not even pay attention to in books of there are chapters related to apostasy what makes you leave the fold of Islam in also the books of and as well the ruling on speaking about Allah without knowledge and this is something that so so many Muslims fall into they talk about Allah without any knowledge about Allah's attributes about Allah's actions about Allah's Injustice the moment you attribute Injustice to Allah this is not fair why this happening to this poor guy he's a good Muslim he used to pray with us this accident is unfair are you attributing Injustice to Allah this is kufur what are you doing so we tend not to pay any attention to these things let alone lying and how many times do we lie even in lying you have racism there is black lie and white lie Subhan Allah what is this there is nothing as such a lie is a lie you have backbiting and we do this perfectly your mother did this and your mother did that who's saying this the husband or the wife both when when fighting they all accuse the poor M and this I I learned recently people sending me questions to my website my mil does this and does that and I thought okay I know men in black m l m l and I had to Google it then I said oh mother-in-law oh so Subhan Allah so this is problematic you keep slandering and backbiting your in-laws whenever a fight takes place why to hurt your spouse but you're hurting yourself it's like someone driving a fast car or in an airplane opens the window and spits the spit is going to come back to you what are you doing this is exactly even worse so many of us enjoy backbiting at the office you saw what our friend did well he did this and did that our neighbors our relatives and all of this is taking from your credit on the day of judgment the prophet saidat he said do you know who is a person that is broke said Okay a person who's broke who doesn't have a dime who doesn't have money he said nope a person who's broke is a person who comes on the day of judgment with lots of prayer lots of Charity lots of uh uh fasting but while while he was alive he used to slunder this person he used to backbite this person he used to beat this person he used to take unlawfully the money of this person so on the day of judgment the Day of Reckoning Allah brings this person and starts to compens at his victims from his own good deeds mallah how many do you have what good deeds do you have so he starts giving mashallah until his Good Deeds are over then says okay we're done nope you still have things to do and Allah takes from their sins and it's placed upon him and he's thrown into hell this guy was a worshipper he used to have night prayer he used to fast Mondays and Thursdays he used to give money appeal or somewh Penny appeal sorry don't don't don't don't sue me for that he used to give but he was bad news he never cared what comes out of his mouth now it's paytime and then he would be thrown into hell how many times do we mock Muslims and make fun of them speaks in a very funny way I get memes making fun of me putting sunglasses and a a cigar or a joint I don't know what and I I look at this is Whoa man I look cool why what is this make fun I payback is soon I'm I'm reaping lots of good deeds I no one can get under my skin no matter what you say I'm used to that but you be careful of what you do but it's going to haunt you it's going to get back to you and Allah doesn't let anything slip subah waala he may delay things but he never lets let thing slip unattended so you can go on and on and on talking about these words that may haunt you may impact you negatively the prophet saidat wasam among the worst of people at the sight of Allah on the day of judgment is a man who has a wife and then when they exchange secrets and intimate Affairs he goes around telling his friends and relatives about it wall I have hundreds of women coming to me crying and weeping because of their men going and exposing their most intimate Affairs to their siblings and to his parents by Allah such a person is not a man W he's not a man because a real man doesn't do this a real man is things you do that would prove that you're a man not your biological description and I know in these errors this is the biological descript deson has a lot of fog and ambiguity in it especially when you have the alphabets almost running out of letters because of that but still yeah if you consider yourself a man yeah he act like a man it was reported that a man had a dispute with his wife and was about to divorce her so a friend say ask him why are you going to divorce her he said a real man doesn't speak about his own wife couple of months later they were divorced so the same man came and said okay why did you divorce her and the guy said what do I care she's someone's else wife this is real manhood and the non-muslims say a gentleman never tells this is not true a Muslim never tells we are doing things because of our relig not because who we are and how we were brought up this is what Allah tells us this is how the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam used to teach us so this word that you do not pay attention to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam warned us from using it unwisely and told us that if you are wise then you should enter Jenna how the prophet said Alam if one of you guarantees to me that he would protect what's between his legs and his Jaws I guarantee Jen legs referring to private parts so you don't fornicate you don't masturbate you don't do any illicit Haram activities and what's between your jaws is your tongue so you don't speak in what angers Allah guarantee these two the prophet guarantees you Jenna and who would have this honor to say yes alhamdulillah I protect my organs and I observe this the prophet sallallah alai wasam as was described by mother an Malik and the rest of the companions may Allah be pleased with them he used to speak seldomly rarely and if we were to count his words we would have look at his speeches look at the Sunnah that was compiled at his time and after his death that was written at his time you will find that he says one sentence that you need books to explain I was given the concise of speech and the companions themselves were also afraid Abu Bakr used to grab his tongue may Allah be pleased with him and he said this is what took me to destruction may Allah be pleased with him says there's nothing on earth that is in need of incarceration more than a tongue IB Abbas says may Allah be pleased with him my tongue is a lion and this was also reported by ta my tongue is a lion if I set it free it would eat me and that's why I'm refraining it and this tongue is the cause of all our problems how many times in your life you said something and then oops I hope I wish I did not say it you can't retract it it's done the harm is already done how many friendships have you lost because of such an impulsive word how many text messages have you dispatched and sent in a group that caused you years of Agony and pain friendships that were ruined because of such a word marriages that were destroyed by such a words relationship between parents and the children were damaged forever because of such words and this is why we have to take care of this word that comes out of our mouth the prophet said after advising may Allah be pleased with him do this do that do this do that all of this is good but if to sum it up if you can't make all of these good things then the least you could do is refrain and take care of your tongue and mu said whoa that's strange are we accountable for what we say and the prophet said to him woe to you oh and what would throw the people on their faces in Hellfire more than their tongues most of our sins come from the tongue because it's the easiest thing to move it's a Time killer we're in a car we're in a plane we're in Gatherings what are we going to spend our time by let's talk about a bunch of Scholars this scholar is so funny this scholar is so ugly this scholar is so stupid this guy Isani this one guy is super salafy this guy is this guy is and we start slandering people and Scholars mashallah your Excellency is what do you know the Quran no do you memorize anything of a sun no do you know Arabic no so how dare you speak about Scholars like this left right and Center you don't even know how to clean yourself after defecating yes I do show me come on man you don't you don't even know the basics of Islam you don't know when to prostrate for forgetfulness prostration before Salam or after Salam you don't know the pillars of Salat you don't know what are the threshold of zakat of different categories you don't know the rules of Haj you don't know anything yet you have the audacity to come and talk about great Scholars of Islam oh this scholar he's a boot liquor and C aser excuse my French so this is problematic we we have a problem here you just talk thinking that this is all going to yeah for free everything is held you'll be held accountable for and this is why we have to observe what we say because the prophet saidat the IM of an individual would not be correct until his heart is straight and correct and his heart is not straight and correct until his tongue is straight and correct so your tongue identifies you and identifies what's in your heart and with this we come to a crossroad so is it best to talk or is it best to remain silent huh referendum it's up for voting what do you think to remain silent to speak anytime people ask you a question say there is a dispute among Scholars that's a perfect answer don't put yourself in a limbo in in a difficult situation what's ruling on a wife touching her husband it's an issue of dispute IM abua says it's okay IM sha says it breaks your aldah one equal 1 plus 1 to but to be specific when you are silent from saying Haram things you are rewarded but when you speak with things that draw people closer to Allah and part of the Quran and the Sunnah definitely you are rewarded so if you were to say that staying silent is best I should leave but this is not logical because I'm trying to benefit myself first and benefit you by talking by preaching by reminding people of Allah and this is what we always have to weigh before we open our mouths are we going to speak in Allah's pleasure or not if not then refrain but even if I'm not going to speak in Allah's pleasure sometimes I may speak impermissible things someone with his wife at home is he going to preach her all day long she's going to file for well this is not a life may Allah be pleased with him said I like to see a man being a lion outside his house and being a kid inside his house when you are with your wife you're like a kid you joke around but not about second wife you joke around and you you mess up and you do whatever it takes even to act like a clown just to make her feel happy she was do you want to do a question and answer as well or no okay you did not tell me what the time was okay let's wrap it up so you know you got the message huh so uh Omar says you have to be serious outside when you are with your wife be like a child like a kid joyful funny happy because she's stuck between four walls usually in normal life not with a working woman but this is beside the point she's stuck with uh uh the kids and the shores of the home she needs your attention therefore I'll I have so much material but the time is not sufficient but I hope you got the point whenever you want to open your mouth way is this going to be something I'd like to see in my grave or it's going to be like cobras and black mambas and scorpions and and the rest if the latter don't be tempted don't don't say something you'll regret if it's the first go ahead and say as much as possible and Allah knows best um we're going to have here my apologies we just trying to manage time we're going to do questions and answer session right now inah so we have brother who is going to point out and I'm going to ask how many questions in 25 minutes who cares who cares I don't guys I don't have my wife I don't have my kids I have nothing so I'm I'm I'm here till you guys tell me the fat lady has sung so we're going to get voice in the back there I'm going to give the mic and so he's only going to take 10 questions so the first 10 um he will vent those questions because and please no politically Affiliated questions brother o will manage that he'll be you in the back in uh in 30 [Music] seconds you have a question tomor don't talk to me talk to him he's the she someone public Comm okay we'll start with this one some somebody commits a uh a public sin and people talk about it is that considered backbiting so the question is if a person committed a sin in public are we allowed to backbite him and mention it we have to first of all understand the benefits of it a celebrity who does sins publicly when I speak to the Sheikh about XY Z that did this and he went to the nightclub and he was seen with a bottle of champagne he was surrounded by women what's the benefit everybody knows this so by talking about such a celebrity is sinful for us and it would be in our records of of book of record records of our sins yes if the Sheikh is going to someone who is notoriously known to be doing Haram but the she doesn't know as a form of warning him I have to do this she by the way the guy you're sitting next to your left is bad news so you have to text him and the she is taking them so heads up yep you have to you have to warn him if someone comes to me and says she so and so is proposing to my daughter should I give him a marriage and I know this guy is a Playboy or he sells drugs or he's with the terrorist groups and I said no no it's backbiting no no it's okay where are they spending their honeymoon in Syria well you have to stop because you are protecting an individual if someone comes to you and says and and and this is also very predominant in the western world and in the Eastern world and everywhere talking about celebrities talking about government officials rulers Allah that's a delicious meal let's put them on the table and start to slaughter them yes not slaughter them yeah cut them to Pieces Slaughter is too much so this ruler is a traitor he has this he took money he betrayed the yeah this is not beneficial this doesn't increase your IM even if they're corrupt even if they are S obes I have no problem in that but what is the benefit from mentioning their name other than causing hatred in the heart and causing FNA among the Muslims and causing enmity about one another between one another not all the people would agree with you so you start taking sides and this was not the way of the Prophet nor his companions nor the salaf so even if he's a celebrity or someone who does sins in public what's the benefit and the return of investment if I were to do such a thing always please ask questions one question was how did you get to gentic dose I wouldn't say use GPS because it doesn't work but when you ask a question please real be y logical exactly be a Muslim full stop seriously you want to be one among the inhabitants of J F be a Muslim that's it but then if you want to break it down we're going to spend till and is going to you bang me with a baseball bat I'm not up to that so no be realistic if you want to say what is this what is that it has to be specific and you give examples genetic questions get genetic answers and Allah Knows Best telling you about the left to you telling you about the sh left sitting left you is bad news son tell where are you to what w is The Whispers of Shan each and every one of us has it each and and everyone has it Allah described Satan in the last chapter of the Quran he whispers he Retreats the moment you remember Allah so he keeps on for coming forward and backwards so when would this WIS become Haram when you embrace it when you believe in it and it's a conviction whatever intrusive thoughts that cross your mind as long as you don't utter it nor act upon it Allah forgives it but when it turns into a conviction then you are in deep dooo because yes I got the image of Buddha while prostrating some people get this say I don't want to pray anymore whenever I prostrate I see Buddha I see uh um Krishna I see whatever ignore it don't pay any attention keep on prostrating and say subh but when you get the conviction meaning that Buddha's belly is nice I I think if I rub it maybe I will get three wishes I don't know you you know this is becoming conviction when you think that at time of stress I may seek refuge in this Idol or that uh grave or this or that this is a conviction this is when your Wasa becames becomes fatal and dangerous and Allah knows best right here question have oh wow a line up over there now you're suffering now you know what I was going through we'll take one here yes when you talk about someone but like they're not there anymore do you make like in general or do you have to ask them very good question the the the young brother says when I backbite someone and then I make Toba so what should I do should I make a general Toba and ask Allah for forgiveness and express my remorse or should I go to that individual and ask them for forgiveness this depends sometimes if you backbite someone like the sheh M is's big and I go to him and said forgive me I did a bad thing I said something about you when you were not present he would say what did you say if I say it it would cause more problems and probably he would not speak to me for life so I have to weigh the consequences if I know that the sheh is an easygoing person and he says yeah she whatever you said may Allah forgive you and whatever I said in you may Allah forgive me said no no what did you say to me I have to know this is okay but if you know that's going to cause you more harm refrain now you can ask generally like I just did I said something about or not even I said something about you she if if I did something wrong in the past I may not know of may Allah forgive me you forgive me he says I forgive you we're good alhamdulillah this is how it should be done if not then ask Allah for forgiveness for him in Dua when you sit with others and mention good things and inshallah Allah will forgive question Che there Che Brothers Yeah question on mortgage everybody's asking about mortgage uh just couple of questions uh one is in sub people were those things in and the second question you talked about you said one question yeah sorry so there's a question already questions requested from that side so I would refrain from asking questions here so let's just stick to the brothers that actually followed the process and stood there so we'll let so he aired his question so I'll answer it in quick the the ruling on wearing as called in the subcontinent or amulets these are things that people have conviction that it can protect them or bring something good for them it's called or and the prophet said whoever should wear such amulets may Allah not make his affair complete and he said so it depends if you don't have a conviction that it by itself brings benefit and protects from Evil rather it's something that Allah protects you by this is minor shik but if you believe that this by itself is a protection because my father gave it to me before he passed away or this uh uh Stone I'm wearing in my ring brings me powers yeah mallah you'll be with the Marvel soon no there's nothing as such this is main major sh as for the mortgage which is from uh the other side what is mortgage you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out it's an interest based riba I don't have money to buy this bottle I go to the bank and they say to me you can get this bottle for an x amount of money which you pay us on installments and we don't have it we don't possess it we're going to buy it for you for an x amount of money and add to that our interest sometimes the interest fluctuates and it increases according to the um interest rate and fluctuation rates and inflation and the likes so this is clear riba the vast majority of Scholars of all times and of all locations say it's Haram only minority who came to this land and found that we have to have a house why everybody has a house why wouldn't I have a house I'd like to have a house for my kids from so they jumped the wagon and they started giving fatwas left right and Center that's Halal some of them come and say well if it is the first house is business no w why is that because it's a necessity you're in a Strange Land you're in a cafir land so you're borrowing from kufar and the riba you're giving to the kufar is halal and it's the first house it's okay so I tell people okay I came all the way from Saudi alone without a wife and I'm in heat I'm desperate so could you find me the first time a one night stand this is har is even worse than Zena what are you talking about so what what's what's analogy what's the logic there's no logic Haram is Haram so don't beat around the bush if you do then well question what is the what is when someone falls in the same Haram over and over what is the path for repentance true repentance okay so someone who frequently falls into sin Time After Time and every time he repents he goes back to it this is human nature now I have good news and I have bad news the good news is Allah the almighty one of his beautiful names is he is the one who is a what does taab mean taab means two meanings number one the one who guides you to repent okay he guided me number two the one who accept your repentance he could guide you but he may reject your repentance so this is one of the two meanings of Al the most merciful Al the one who forgives this is is Allah's names he's known for that and this is good news no matter what sin you fall into no matter what swamp you dive into he's always there for you Allah extends his hand in the morning for those who sinned at night and accepts them and never rejects them the bad news is you want to hear the bad news nobody's interested the bad news is that the more frequently you fall into sin you're getting accustomed to it day one I fell into should I stop no no just tell the shabab to set sit down because okay so the minute I fall into sin I'm so remorseful regretful crying weeping Ya Allah forgive me and then I quit for a couple of months no sinning then I fall into the sin again I I fall weak and I commit the sin again my amount of repentance and remorse is less and a month later I fall again and it's less couple of weeks it's less a week later it's less now I'm doing it every day but I'm still concealing it nobody knows about it after a few months I have no problem in if people were to know about it so what yeah I'm human I sin and few months down the line I become an advocate of Shan I call people listen do this it's good for you it does this and that and I start to call and invite people to sin and this is when you become doomed because there's no going back you are an advocate of Satan and you've already condemned yourself may Allah have mercy on us yes from the sisters they're asking what is the ruing on Don organs after death the sisters ask what is the ruling on donating organs after death it's an issue of dispute the majority of Scholars say it's permissible I personally follow the opinion of and I think it's also the opinion of shwi long ago but don't quote me which prohibits this why it's a good thing first of all is this body of mine mine so can I as I'm alive donate an an an eye or uh donate a tooth well you old old fake so you can take whatever you want so can I do this no because I can't kill myself I can't injure myself this is an Allah has entrusted me with after death there are eates to deal with the corpse of a Muslim body the prophet says the breaking of the bone of a deceased is like breaking the bone of a living person so it's it's it's it's not permissible not only that it is not you guys I think by law have to uh do an autopsy to uh that people but I don't know some countries they tell me if the family object they refrain from that it it's not permissible to cut the deceased body we have to honor it we have to protect it we don't even treat it like that let alone having a a a donor list the moment you die and your uh heartbeat goes flat all of a sudden The Butchers come and take your heart your kidneys your liver your uh kneecap and and the rest of the no this is not a spare part shop where you keep helping people those destined to die if they don't take your kidney they're going to die if they take your kidney they're going to live like 5 years then they're going to die So eventually they're going to die don't allow people to mess up with your body here it's my body like you guys say what is the ruling during Ramadan of women reciting Quran demonstration what's the ruling during Ramadan when a woman has the monthly excuse her she is on her period to recite the Quran the most authentic opinion is that she can recite the Quran without any problem the issue of dispute is whether she can hold the mus the book and the most authentic opinion is that she can if she's wearing gloves she can read it from a PDA from computer from the phone without being in the state of Purity because this not is not a mus it's an uh uh an electronic Gadget she can read it from the books of T because the t is much larger in quantity than the Arabic text so it doesn't uh uh bear the name of mus rather it's it's a book so you can go ahead and do that without any problem inshallah yes last question inshah what should a non-muslim do if they want to learn about Islam what should a non-muslim do if they want to learn about Islam there are a number of ways number one come and visit an Islamic Center that has classes and they will sit with you and tell you about Islam you can Google the best Islamic website on Earth which is www. Islam qa. info and this is by far the best Islamic website the largest visited Islamic website on Earth there's no Islamic website that is Vis not two years ago I was with Dr zachar Nik and I was discussing this uh fact with him and he said yes two years or 3 years ago he said it's it's visited by not less than 100 million a year say it again the website www islamqa doino Islam questions and ANW but QA one word Islam qa. enfo this is Al's website since the '90s it's trust well trusted it has only trusted Scholars who answer the fatwas of of and the whole nine yards if he wants there are also a number of books that could tell you about Islam but I prefer a non-muslim to sit with someone who has knowledge to walk you down not the aisle I hope but to walk you down to know exactly what Islam is because Scholars students of knowledge have an Insight how to break things to you rather than flush you with information that would maybe repel you from looking into it deeper and Allah Knows Best mashallah let's have hello let's have uh I got one more question please sorry we we have to take sh the guy he's he's been holding back he just have one more question it's important it was question brother what's the question brother what's the question tell the question so this question is that he he has anxiety he when he gets close to water he he feels like something is holding him back and uh basically today he went to the registry and he saw somebody with a cross tattooed on his on his hand on his arm and he now he thinks he left Islam so he has all these thoughts coming in so when he goes in for wo to do his woo or or shower sometimes she it takes him more than 2 three hours in the washroom and he this is we we cannot answer this in the public for his sake and for the Public's sake he could come book a counseling session I'll give it for you for free for for the for the the guys I'll sit with you half an hour on Zoom for free special yeah I will I'll talk you out of it like this he hasn't left Islam No No Yeah if you give me a paper and I give it to Mr John he's a non-muslim and I tell him please read this and he says here you go has he become a Muslim yes or no why no conviction you're a Muslim by default how can I take you out of the fault of Islam by just whims and desires like say a few words"
