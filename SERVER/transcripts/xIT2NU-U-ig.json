  "transcript": "I swallowed the food in my mouth at the time of fan is my fast valid first of all fasting is to refrain from things that nullify fasting such as eating drinking uh and intercourse Etc from the break of dawn till sunset this is the definition of fasting for the sake of Allah to worshiping to worship Allah subhah wa tala now if a person swallows solid food whether it's beneficial or not anything that is solid that goes into a person's stomach this breaks his fasting if there are remaining food particles in person's teeth for example if they have a mass and he could dispose of them he could take them out yet he does not and he swallows them intentionally this invalidates his Salat this invalidates his uh fasting as well but if they're too negligible too small and one has no ability to take take it out or spit it out then it's forgiven with the grace of Allah and swallowing it would not impact your Salat nor your prayer your uh fasting now the case that the brother is asking about or the sister it did not specify is that if I'm eating a sandwich and I'm chewing it and is cold should I spit it out the answer is no inshallah you're not obliged to spit it out but don't finish the whole sandwich so what's in your mouth you can eat it consume it swallow it without any problem why because the aan of f is relative so it could be a minute early a minute late and you don't have certainty 100% that this is the of Dawn and due to the hardship in spitting out this morsel that you have in your mouth and due to the Hadith where the Prophet stated that when a person is holding a mug or a container that has liquid in it and the aan is C he should not put it down until he consumes whatever he wants from it so so comparing this to that inshallah this morsel in your mouth would have the same ruling and Allah Asel Knows Best"
