  "transcript": "foreign that we're going to talk about is the thicker we should say when waking up so do we say things when we wake up of course you're either awake or asleep so when you're asleep you're unconscious and the pen of accountability has been lifted nothing has been written against you but once you wake up it's not that i need to warm up i need to freshen up immediately once you wake up there is a set of duas and dickers that you have to say in order to be connected in order to be among those closer to allah azza so the first one is to praise allah azzawajal for giving you life after death and to him is the resurrection whoa whoa whoa whoa what life after death when you are asleep this is minor death as the prophet said that islam this is why the people of paradise do not sleep because sleep is a minor death now when you wake up this is a new life that had been given to you so many people die in their sleep permanently so the first thing you do is that you praise allah azzawajal for restoring your soul because when you're asleep your soul is detached it's not aware of what's happening around it this is why you may be seeing in a vision that you are in jannah or in a beautiful garden and others sleeping next to you may be in a nightmare being followed by crocodiles and lions and scorpions and snakes terrified both of you awake at the same time you're pleasant and he or she is so terrified that was a small minor death so you always praise allah the first thing that comes to your mouth when you wake up alhamdulillah [Applause] which is a beautiful dua where the prophet alaihistalatus told us that whoever wakes up in the middle of the night and says this dua and asks allah for forgiveness allah azza would forgive his sins and if he asks allah for something allah would grant him this thing now i'm i'm i'll tell you out of experience it took me like two to three months to try every single night when i wake up in the middle of the night to say this dua with great failure but alhamdulillah and all praise be to allah that after these two or three months alhamdulillah every single night when i wake up in the middle of the night i manage to say this beautiful zikr which is very simple you can open your fortress of the muslim read it memorize it and say it and in the longer version of the hadith the prophet says after you say oh my lord forgive me the prophet says if you go and make wudu and pray your prayer would be accepted the following hadith alhamdulillah foreign is also when people wake up there are different virgins and this is the beauty of islam you don't have to restrict yourself to one virgin rather in order to be contemplating upon all of them you say this once you say this the other night they say this then later on so this is praising allah again and again and again endlessly for giving you a fear for giving you health in your body in your health and restoring your soul back into your body again not only that to allow you to remember him and this wallahi is one of the greatest blessings of allah azzawajal do you imagine that there are so many people out there who fail to remember allah azzawajal finally there are these last ten verses of surat ali imran chapter three [Music] may allah be pleased with him that when he slept over at his aunt's house maimuna who was the wife of the prophet isalam he pretended to be asleep so in the middle of the night when the prophet woke up he looked at the heavens and he recited these 10 beautiful verses of the last of surat al-imran which is a confirmed sunna to recite this process these ayahs cement the belief in allah azzawajal the members of allah the virtues of women and men doing good deeds and being rewarded for it the virtues of those who do good deeds with belief that allah would grant them paradise would grant them gardens of eden in that they on the day of judgement and also it highlights the reward of the people of the book who accepted islam like a najashi of abyssinia like abdullah salaam rabbis of the jews and it concludes by asking the believers to be patient and to remain steadfast and to guard the front lines of the muslim ummah and protect it from the attacks of the enemies so that they may be successful ten beautiful verses of surat al-imran that we always infrequently recite every single night when we wake up in the middle of the night before we start our prayer for night prayer this is all the time we have and until we meet next time i leave you for him for allah oh"
