  "transcript": "sure [Music] similar rahmanir rahim and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad Enlil al-amin nabina muhammad in wada leehi wasabi woman dead Abbi weston - that hehe Alejo meeting a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the topic as you have heard is a little bit confusing because each word in the title requires a lecture and I won't be exaggerating if I say it requires a crash course nevertheless we will focus on something that is a little bit relevant to us as Muslims the Prophet said Allah his salat WA Salam in an authentic hadith every religion has moral conduct or ethics or manners and the moral conduct of Islam is bashfulness is al haya some translated as shyness so bashfulness is the prominent characteristic of a Muslim specifically a Muslim woman and this is what the lecture would be focusing on last year I was fortunate to be invited here may Allah be pleased with those who invited me and thought well of me and I had any question that was why have the sisters in front of the speaker now part of our modesty and bashfulness is that we do not look at women so when you put them in front of me what you want me to do make my rest of the lecture like this Annie I hope the organizers think of something at least I don't know it's not my job to design but you guys have to do something about it so the sisters might be offended who cares I was in Malaysia last week and I had a lecture in a university and after my lecture a sister from the Faculty of the Islamic University came to ask me a question so while she was asking me I was looking at the ground and I answered her question and left the following day a remark comes to me from a brother who's a colleague to her and he says that she is furious why why does it he look at me in the eyes Subhan Allah she's a hijab' hello you're a muslima what are you talking about so some of the sisters may be offended who cares the most important thing is that you have it in you and that you display the characteristic of a real Muslim and this is the problem we have the issue of bashfulness al hiya it is part of our manners it is a model conduct that is honorable that calls you to refrain from doing anything that is bad for your reputation that is sinful that is Haram and instructs you to do everything that Allah has instructed you to do plus to do whatever brings praise to you as an individual bashfulness is also one of a large beautiful attributes but we know and acknowledge that Allah has attributes are not like ours it goes without saying so when you say allah azza wajal is all-seeing allah has site is allah site like ours definitely not is Allah is hearing like ours definitely not Allah is hearing in site can detect the footsteps of an ant in the midst of the night on clear stone which no one can see or hear accept him as erosion and likewise Allah has el is described as being bashful and this type of bashfulness is different than ours because when a servant of Allah Azza WA JAL sins when he makes a sin Allah is capable of exposing him of tormenting him on the spot yet Allah is great generosity perfect tolerance and a laws perfection prevents him from exposing him how many of us have sins all of us and no one can claim that we are sinless if sin had a fragrance or an odor no one could sit next to us but allah azzawajal is concealing our sins though he can expose us and then and on the day of judgment Allah / fulness may and may not forgive these sins that he concealed on earth also bashfulness is a characteristic of prophets who sorry the hood we may Allah be pleased with him says that our prophet sallallahu alayhi wa alayhi wa sallam was more shy than a virgin in her seclusion so the Prophet himself are they salat was him the leader was shy was bashful would not come and say words we use in our everyday communication a servant of Allah like us is also bashful of the angels who are with you 24/7 who know what you do and record every move you take and every thought you think of and every word you speak of they record it so a servant of Allah is bashful is shy a true servant of Allah who has knowledge if he wants to do something in that says the angels are watching the angels will record the angels will testify on the day of judgment also we are bashful and shy of those who are around us so we are as as children are bashful from our parents we as individuals are bashful from our spouses we as individuals are bashful from our colleagues our relatives our neighbors we refrain so many times of doing something that may backfire on us because it is immodest because it does not fit the criteria of al haya and the best of these things on the human level is when you become bashful and shy of your own self when you don't care about people this is the best because even if you are alone in your room behind closed doors you may lie and fool people but you know deep down inside that you cannot fool yourself you cannot lie to yourself in this gives you sleepless nights a person would shut such bashfulness he may fool he made sheet he may say things that are not true but whenever he goes to bed he cannot go to sleep his conscious is killing him because he's shy of himself how can I do such a thing how was it possible for me to say or act in this fashion this is a sign of Eman and whenever someone does not have this in him he will sleep like a baby but he will be sinful from the top of his head to his toes the Prophet said are a solid wassalam the people learnt from the previous times of prophethood that if you do not feel shy act as you wish and this is a warning in that a permission which highlights the role of shyness being shy being bashful this prevents you from falling into sin and it is part of Eman and this is why the prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam well hiya o min al-iman bashfulness is part of faith it is one of the branches of faith Ben Raja bill hamberg may Allah have mercy on his soul great scholar of Islam divides bashfulness into two types one a type that is genetic that is inherent that Allah created you with it and this is found in the kafir and the Muslim in the disbelievers and in the believers this type which becomes a characteristic of a person that he did not acquire Allah built it in him this fits in the hadith where the Prophet said Al Azhar al haya ala yachty Allah be higher higher bashfulness brings only goodness regardless where it is implemented or by whom this type of hire of bashfulness is the one that prevents people from doing shameful acts even in Catharine countries you go there or catherine they're disbelievers but in some specimens in some categories you would find them bashful unwilling to lie unwilling to commit something that is immodest though their religion does not prevent them from doing it the norms do not prevent them from doing it but it is the inherent something that Allah instilled in them and this is something which is a favor and a blessing from allah azza wajal because allah gives it to you without you working hard for it the hopup says may allah be pleased with him whoever is shy and bashful he will hide meaning he will not commit sins in public and whoever hides then this means that he will be protective meaning even in when he conceals his sin his sins will not be as public or as large as when do get in public and whoever is protective allah azza will protect him and all of this coming from what from being bashful the second type according to a barrage eligible humbly the second type of bashfulness is the one that you work to get it it's not inherent you have to work hard to attain it and this can come only from knowing allah azza wajal from acknowledging his beautiful names and attribution from getting closer to allah azzawajal through good deeds once you do this once you acknowledge that allah azzawajal knows what is secret and knows your gaze where it goes when it looks at something unlawful once you do this you feel this gained type of bashfulness and this is the highest level of perfection or of san a Muslim can attain now this was an introduction to the topic of modesty and bashfulness what is the theme of this conference because every conference has to have a theme at the end of the day you want to go home and say I've benefited something what I have no idea so many long talks beautiful international orators coming in displaying beautiful English in the man just waves his hands as if it is in a concert or whatever I don't know I'm just watching is he doing sign language I don't know but it's beautiful but what was it about I have no idea there is no benefit you have to go back home and say listen I've learned this and this is what I'm going to implement what is the theme of the conference jumbo jumbo what is the theme of the conference I am a Muslim so happy when you say I'm a Muslim this has a lot of consequences that must follow it's not something that you are Muslim so much but I drink I party all night long I deal with Reba I do - and with unanimously you may look like a Muslim your name is Muhammad Muhammad your name is sounds like a Muslim but to a nice see you behave you're not a Muslim I am a Muslim means that I have an identity and this is what this conference is all up it's supposed to be I hope the brothers will talk about the same topic and that we are in sync but I don't who cares I care about my lecture so we have to look at our identity if you see me in Siberia or in the jungles of Africa or in America would you know that I am a Muslim I don't wear this anywhere except when I give my hotbar usually I'm with jeans and t-shirts but would you recognize me as a Muslim maybe how would you know that by the way I look this is important and by the way I behave because even the Sikhs have longer beat Fidel Castro had a longer beat but a big cigar so you can tell it's not a Muslim so is it the beard is it the maxi I'm wearing huh what is it so it has to be a combination of 360 inside-out our topic is the identity of a Muslim woman and the sisters are lowering their hazard here we go no no no wait wait wait don't jump to conclusion my lectures are original who cares so let us first begin with the identity of a Muslim woman the identity of Muslim woman was the target of attack since the first lady not mallanna definitely I'm talking about the real first lady who's that halwa peace be upon her imagine the attack on her identity was since she was created bubala listen to this ayah but Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts so he plotted since they won against hawa against Eve's identity to expose her it's gonna come in later generations and Allah gave us this warning by reminding us of the example where Allah says o children of Adam let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from paradise stripping them off their clothing to show them their private parts so the plotting began since day one and it continues and you can see this clearly if you open an Arabic which will help if you turn on sorry the television set if you go to the market if you walk in the street if you tour the malls you find that the common denominator worldwide is nudity shamelessness and in modesty to all those who are controlled by Shaitaan by Satan whether they are in the primitive tribes of Africa or the Amazon its nudity or it is on the catwalks in Milano Paris or New York the same concept of exposing their aura of stripping them of their modesty it's the same thing but they call this one civilization and they call this tribalism and primitive people of the jungle bashfulness is what adorns a righteous woman it goes side by side and a lot of the scholars demands of the message the Diaries the righteous men and the righteous women complain so all the good guys complain of what the bad guys are doing the ugly are watching unfortunately so they're complaining of what they're complaining that modesty and bashfulness has been taken out from the peoples character and if the enemy of Islam succeeds in stripping Muslim women from the bashfulness they have succeeded they would succeed in destroying the Muslim Ummah because you can spoil a man and his spoil meant if that was a true noun I don't know who cares if that is true is upon himself but when you spoil a woman she drags behind her a thousand man with a smile she corrupts a whole family children and in-laws etc one woman is more devastating to the Ummah than a thousand canons and the old invaders the old I don't know if it's the right word of I'm an Arab so take my English and throw it in the garbage the columnist people who came and tried to rule the Muslim country they said a beautiful woman and a glass of wine corrupts the Muslim Ummah more than a thousand armies it corrupts men men are you know their brain is this big with all due respect hamdullah our brains are so small when it comes to women when it comes to desires this is human nature this is what drives men so by focusing on women they would manage to destroy the Muslim Ummah in this topic this is still an introduction so gonna be a long day we will not talk about hijab and the conditions and the nabob and the miss issue of dispute among scholars you've heard this a gazillion time google the word gazillion you'll find so many zeros you have heard this you don't need to talk about this but we have to analyze how women look nowadays in an Islamic perspective not analyzing you know this is not what I meant analyzing the sense does it fit the Quran and the Sunnah does it please allah azza wajal if you look we find that women's hijab does not fit the criteria of islam a lot of the women wear hijab in a modern way we have modern Islam this is prevailing now in the media we don't have extreme Islam we don't have fanatic Islam we have modern Islam quote/unquote what do you mean by modern Islam is it the same that the Prophet brought friend is different it's a new version is 3.1 Marsha a lot of Arakawa I guarantee you that this is filled with viruses and it will destroy your CPU it will destroy your hard disk it will destroy everything in your house anything that goes against or out of the boundaries of the sender of the prophet Elijah Selim is total destruction and bound to fail but what kind of modern Islam are you talking about you find the sister covering her hair and wearing tight jeans or skinny excuse me Sid what a Mahadi uh-huh Masha a lot of our Akala HIV what kind of hijab are we talking about this seems to be difficulty in understanding you find them wearing sleeves that are so tight if they don't wear it they would so show all the scars and their bodies it's best to show these scars rather than showing that they are masha'Allah beautiful etc they wear tight a bias that can you can tell the measurements if you have a good eye which is not advisable it is not according to Islam this is something new and it's totally against modesty and bashfulness even between women and women I get my wife my daughters coming to me and complaining why they went to a wedding and they come after half an hour back why didn't you stay and enjoy your time and eat said if you saw and I said I wish I could see a bank Oh I was joking I was joking my wife has a very hard to hide any hard temper she doesn't take a good joke any home and they say if you see what we saw you'll be shocked women are wearing revealing clothes some of them you know tight some of them see through some of them short and this is not in a Kaffir country this isn't a Muslim wedding and they say Islamic wedding excuse me what kind of Islamic what is it there's no music mashallah there's no music but there's nudity what are you doing so they have a problem between women and winning themselves and nowadays sincerely speaking I believe that men are more bashful and shy than women well I sometimes sisters come to me and speak to me I feel and shy I feel shy and I am NOT a shy person I feel I was in a Muslim country I gave a lecture Islamic lecture you know full of motivation or an and Sunnah when I went out two sisters came to me say Salaam alaikum so lower my gaze as usual you know figure of my wife watching me yes I'm Salaam and one of them said shake can we take a selfie were you in the lecture yes beautiful lecture what did you hear what was i preaching rated R material what what is this and the sister felt embarrassed not shy not bashful felt embarrassed because of my question was a bit shocking she said no no no she who got us wrong it's two of us with you not one masha'Allah look at the fit she doesn't want who won so both of them men are more bashful than women nowadays you get women calling for women empowerment they'll ask for equality they want to have women rights and I asked are these rights within the boundaries of Islam that Islam guarantee it for women or something extra you know no there's something extra that you want a new religion you don't want Islam you want your rights in Islam go to scholars they'll define your rights from Tottenham's what you want is something more we want equality share equality of what Allah says well they said the carrucan Musa males are not like females yeah but we want equality like what Yanni I get pregnant this year and you get pregnant this year what kind of equality do you want there is no equality in Islam there is fairness there is justice and each has a role and this is the misconception that they are throwing at us through the media and the Muslims are swallowing it like medication without knowing that it is poison so the identity of your sister begins with your shyness and bashfulness if you lose shyness and bashfulness you lose your identity wear your hijab as much as you want it would not have any impact looked look at the way a sister deals with a co-worker some offices women work I will not come to the ruling is it however Haram but I ask you by Allah is what's happening in our offices and companies and banks something Islamic Mohammed I'm going to get a bite would you like some sandwiches Mohammed says I cannot answer it if so maybe you shall eat there is an answer but is this normal what are you doing share he's my colleague I work with him 8 hours I sit with him more than I sit with my father what about the Son and the Holy Ghost what are you doing this has nothing to do with Islam you are drifting away but you convince yourself that you are a Muslim and that you have your identity you do not have an identity sister how much time do I have ten minutes you gotta be joking I'm just in the into the introduction a lie okay let us move a little bit faster but I don't promise to honor the time bashfulness in Islam towards see females have different stages there are our the way they deal with bashfulness and modesty differs when they're infants and when they're toddlers when they're about ten or eleven years of age when they reach the age of puberty and then when they pass the 60 or 70 marker of age it's different stages we won't have time to go through this but Islam focuses on training and conditioning boys and girls to be shy and modest from an early age each in its own perspective Islam looks high at a woman's shyness and bashfulness to the extent that it instructs women to cover and wearing the hijab women ask the frequently asked question why don't men wear the hijab it seems valid question but it is not if you have 20 women and you get the most handsome man in the world to come in between two or three would look the rest would not my type but if you get twenty men and get one bombshell in there all of them even the mob / coroner in it maybe one or two now Allah make us among those who would lower the gays but this is inevitable this is human nature that's why women have to be wearing the hijab and men who go out and work are ordered while women are wearing the hijab to lower their gaze so it's not that she's wearing the hijab I can talk to her I can smile I can crack jokes I can have a good time she's a stranger to you she's a nun Muharram and you have to lower your gaze Islam protects women by preserving their modesty to the extent and this is what the Liberals in our Muslim community always brag about and the kafir in their civilized modern countries talk about freedom women have freedom there is no freedom greater than the freedom of Islam to women to the extent that if a single person slanders a woman and accuses her of adultery or of a modesty he is immediately instructed to provide for witnesses that she committed fornication or adultery if he fails we flog him 80 lashes in his back for what I just said that she looks like a prostitute what did I do collistar Habibi that we will take care of you we will cleanse you this how Islam treats women Islam protects woman's chastity and modesty to the extent that even shaking hands which have seen a lot here of course and where I come from it is widely spreading with the new trend unfortunately but this is apparent in all the Muslim countries I seen women hijab' women coming in I said am I awake and shaking hands with non Maha man and the man is if I can go further I want but sorry I can't what is this Islam prohibits this Islam tells us that it is best for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle of Steel rather than touch a woman that is not permissible for him so imagine my sister how Islam protects you and your modesty Islam prevents mixing with the maqam now let me rephrase that it is this one edited time let me rephrase that Islam prohibits women from mixing with nun Muharram relatives your relative who is a nun Muharram house that the Prophet is salat wa sallam said beware of entering upon women addressing the men so one of the men stood up a co prophet of Allah what do you think about the brother-in-law my brother what's wrong in him entering upon my wife mixing with her if we live in a joint family share so the Prophet Eraser Sam said the brother-in-law is death if you allow your brother to mix with your wife then this is inevitable death it's like allowing death to come a lot of the husband say ok let that come you can get a second wife well you can get a second wife with your wife at the moment so no problem for her to not to die in sha Allah so Islam protects a woman from mixing with nan Muharram relatives brothers in law the uncle of the husband the cousin of the husband it is prohibited the what is the ruling on mixing with coworkers someone who's a total stranger with a driver with anyone that is not a muharram and that is not related to you Islam protects the chastity and bashfulness of a woman to the extent that Islam prevents women from leaving their homes wearing perfumes in Adichie good she channel number 5 you name it the list is long I have 13 girls of my own so don't say how do you know I know I know things about girls more than I know things about men I haven't been with the moment I feel like you growing a uterus after this long anyhow this is beside the point when you come to wearing perfume even to the message it's Haram abuela was on the streets met a woman and he was like slapped by the amount of perfume she's wearing she said all servant of the Lord the mighty Allah are you going to the Masjid she said yes he said to her go back to your home and have a total ritual bath because I've heard the Prophet say that is awesome any woman goes out of her home to the Masjid wearing perfume Allah will not accept her prayer until she has a ritual bath and our sisters are coming and wearing perfumes what are you doing and then don't wear these same perfumes for their husbands no no no this is for going out yours is this route this something is five five shillings I bought the expensive one is only for going up this is wrong allah azza wajal prevented women from exposing things that are even hidden Allah says in the Quran and let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of the adornment meaning if a woman and a lot of the women do wear anklets it's very finds very nice but to your mother to your husband to your brother not to Dex and some of it has bells in it like horses you know when horses walk and you hear these bells some of the sisters do this and they walk in they make the sound even a man when his line isn't Wow she has to be a knockout because of the sound this is how Shaitaan works Islam tells her when she speaks she must not speak like a man because this would prevent her from entering hell entering paradise but at the same time she must not soft in her voice and this is a problem that a lot of the women do not pay attention to they even talk to a shopkeeper please come on how much money you're gonna make this for me come on give me a discount please and the guy says I'll give you what you want my customer whatever this is problematic even on the phone they have they softened their voices Allah says if you fear Allah then do not be soft in speech to men lest he in whose heart is diseased should desire or covet but speak with appropriate speech now all of this is just a sample of how Islam promotes bashfulness and shyness in women do we have this in our women inshallah we do but maybe we lack points here or there that we have to work with them together to attract to try and promote it if you succeed you will be a bashful shy woman and if you look at our righteous predecessors ourself a woman who used to have episodes of seizure it's something to do with the electricity in the brain and she loses conscience she falls on the floor and she shakes and foam comes from her mouth she came to the prophet alayhi salaatu say o prophet of Allah pray to Allah that he cures me the Prophet gave her an option one of you if you wish I'll pray for you and if you wish your patient and Allah will reward you Jenna with that so the woman saw know definitely I want Jenna she said I will be patient of Rafah to Allah but when I get these seizures I fall down unconscious and I am revealed my ayah is exposed you know when someone falls unconscious he doesn't know what's happening to him so pray to Allah for me not to be exposed and the Prophet did raise salat wa salam look what the woman is thinking of not to be exposed and look what some of our our women are doing at the moment spending so much time in front of the mirror before going out you are going out you are not allowed to put any kind of makeup on your face if you believe that the face is not our you are not allowed shift but I have some pimples here I'd like to cover cover it for whom why do you want to cover it I don't know maybe somebody is going to look a lot it is haram for you to do this so there one minute and hamdulillah so a sister says how can we increase our bashfulness and chinesse I have like seven eight points each point requires six to seven minutes so this is a good 42 minutes I don't think the moderator he's mashallah bigger than me will allow me to do this and I'm Yandy I have another lecture tomorrow so quickly first of all you have to increase your Eman your belief in allah azzawajal because it goes side by side the more belief you have the more bashfulness and china's this is for both men and women profit is also surpassed by two men one of them was scolding his brother telling him why are you so shy why aren't you up front you know loud and demanding etc and the guy is bashful and shy is is quiet so the Prophet isin't told him leave him because bashfulness is from Eman so he's not doing something wrong you're doing something I leave him and secondly what increases your bashfulness is to recall all those favors and blessings upon you whenever you want to do something bad whenever you want to do something Haram whenever you want to skip a Salah whenever you want to skip an obligation you remember Allah's favours and blessing upon you and once you do you are fearful that Allah will take it out take it away take it from you so you become bashful from allah azza wajal and do what you should do alginate may Allah have mercy on your soul said bashfulness is acknowledging a lot favors and blessing and confessing of your own shortcomings and from these two phases bashfulness is created number three one of the beautiful reasons for you to become bashful and shy is to acknowledge that there are people watching you so whatever you want to do something remember that there are people watching you of course Allah is watching over you but sometimes really neglectful we see only those who see us in the sense that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was approached by one of his companions and he said to him o prophet of allah give me an advice so the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam I advised you to be bashful of Allah as if you are bashful from a righteous man when looking at you if you are in a mall and you see someone and you'd like to talk to this someone from the opposite gender and get to know one another and maybe you know flirt for a while would you do this if Jeff seid Rajee is overlooking you and he's masha'Allah at all so you can have a helicopter view would you do that he said no she is watching let the go the Prophet is telling us this be bashful of Allah as if someone that you know as righteous is watching you how would you react I would definitely be modest and be shy number whatever take a role model who's your role model prophet muhammad sallallaahu and we know that he was more bashful than a woman in her hour virgin and her seclusion also Allah Azza WA JAL gave us an example in the Quran when Musa fled Egypt and he came to two women who were watering their sheep but were hesitant to do so because they are unable to mix with men and this shows you how bashful they were long ago so he watered for them and then went to the shade of the tree asking Allah Azza WA JAL to give him and to provide for him and expressing his poverty immediately on the spot Allah Azza l gave him his answer a woman Allah says then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness so this is your role model she came walking in shyness saying indeed my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us if my father was well he would have watered if he was capable he would have come and invited you but he has no one except me and my sister so I'm coming in bashfulness and shy and requesting that you come this is how a woman should be not what we hear sometimes when the sisters even in Islamic conferences I go and some of the sisters who are organizing they speak loudly more louder than the men and they laugh loudly more louder than the men this is not part of modesty our sister should be concealed she does whatever she wants with them other sisters laugh and talk and have fun but not in front of the men remembering the grave the hereafter the resurrection the Sarat these things of the unseen that we will pay for our deeds and for our actions and for what we say on these events when you remember this men and women will be modest will be bashful because they remember that they will have to pay for whatever they do and studying allows beautiful names and attributes we have great deficiency in knowing a lot beautiful names and attributes if someone gives us an a4 paper tells us to write whatever we know from Alice beautiful names and attributes we may not succeed in exceeding five lines and if someone asks us to explain these names that we have written we would fail to do that with five to ten percent and finally before someone comes you have to exert the effort you have to do your level best to fight your own your own soul your inner self because Satan is messing with your mind he's the one who's encouraging you to sin he's the one who's encouraging you to be immodest and to be like everyone else why me everyone else is not shy or not bashful or not modest so might as well be with the crowd even if the crowd goes to hell Shaitaan tells you dying with the majority is a blessing and a mercy from Allah and this is not wrong that this is not correct the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam bashfulness and Eman they are combined and joined together if one of them is uplifted the other one is taken away had a Allahu Alem when is betrayal merely he asked them was allah wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad in whether he was happy he is mine"
