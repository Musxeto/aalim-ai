  "title": "Eating meat in the west where animal may die before slaughter cuz of stunning #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um is if someone is living in the west like America Europe or Canada and the majority of the people are the people of the book or the people of the book plus the Muslims and un but unfortunately there's a law that mandates to stunning the animals or Electrify the chicken gassing them before slaughtering and there's a possibility that this animal die before being slaughtered and unfortunately there are Muslims who do not who do not care going to these restaurants who not label as so my question is is it sinful to eat a meat if it is stunned or electrifies or gas and it's not sure if the animals died or still alive before slaughtering the default is that these countries are Christian countries despite what so many people claim that oh they're agnostic they're atheists they're not practicing blah blah blah blah is in Quran they are considered to be and this is why we say Subhan Allah when it comes to the issue of eating the meat you say oh no they're not musl they're not and when you want to marry them their their women said y they're so this is a default Now the default is that I can eat whatever meat presented to me me by the people of the book unless it's pork because the default is that they slaughter as for aah 5 chapter 5 in the Quran if there is a doubt like per the Hadith of Imam Muslim when the prophet Alat was approached by his companions and they told him that we given food from people and we don't know whether they mention the name of Allah or not the prophet alai did not say to them asked them he said you say bismah and eat so this is the default that as unless I am certain it was killed before slaughtered it was electrified or stunned or gassed and died then they slaughter it if I have proof this is MAA this is Haram unless I have this proof we act upon the default so people who want to eat they're more than welcome you my friend if you feel that I don't feel easy about this I will never eat except in halal Outlets good for you but this is your choice and decision you can't blame others if they believe otherwise due to the default of our religion and Allah Knows Best"
