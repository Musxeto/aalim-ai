  "title": "Must I make up prayers that I deliberately missed due to struggling with OCD (wudu)? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sure I have had a CVO CD or Sports in order so sometimes I couldn't pray and I guess trust I get stressed in wudu so I deliberately skip some prayers so should I make up those prayers or am I allowed to make up those prayers or should I ask forgiveness repent to Allah and continue my normal prayers in the future this is too generic if a person skips prayer intentionally this is a major sin and he has committed a huge major sin can he make it up if he did that intentionally no he cannot make it up the time is gone like someone who did not stand in Mount Arafat on the season of Hajj on the 9th of delhija on the day of arafah and he came five days later he says oops I was caught up in traffic I was held up by the customs and and immigration authorities they thought that my Visa was forged and not real and then they released me five days later so now I'm gonna make it up and stand in Mount Alfa alone no you can't because it's time bound and you missed it but if this person is an OCD patient and he is compelled to repeat the wudu or to have these thoughts and it's not within his grasp or control and he missed the prayer unintentionally unwillingly but due to his compulsion in this case yes he can make that prayer up"
