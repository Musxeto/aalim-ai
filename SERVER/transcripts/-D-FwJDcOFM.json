  "title": "The Covenant of the Prophets - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay second question of Shrike he was asking about the Covenant mentioned in ayah 81 chapter 3 where allah azza wa jal tells us that allah took the covenant of the prophets that remember when god coveted the prophets and said if after i have given you the law and the judgment there comes an apostille to you who confirms the truth already with you you will surely believe him and help him and ask do you accept and agree and they said that we accept etc so he's saying that when was this covenant taken was it as the general covenant that was taken from all mankind before Allah created them and once says hey no one took any government covenant from me I don't remember anything do you remember when you were born you definitely do not so there are things that are taken you may not remember but it is instilled in you this is part of the nature so he's asking when was this covenant taken from these prophets and messengers and the answer is Allah knows best most likely that this covenant was given to them as soon as they were given the prophethood and they became messengers of Allah part of the revelation was that there will come part of the prophecy that there will come a messenger at the end of time his name is Muhammad once he comes he you have to follow him and they all agreed to that and allah azza wajal knows best"
