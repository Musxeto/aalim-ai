  "transcript": "brother sister I'm a black man was asking that can we shed more light on the mattock the answer is no we're going into a sequence but I'll give you some highlights so that you would not mistaken anyone coming tomorrow I may come on the TV channel say I am the Madi hallelujah prove it first of all the Prophet has not told us he would be called Muhammad like the prophets name and his father his name is like the prophets name Abdullah so the Madi must be Mohammed even Abdullah this is his name so if someone comes to me tomorrow and says listen I'm the Maggie I'm up I have a very long beard and very short robes and maybe I have something on my forehead to prove that I've been prostrating for ages and hours and my name is a Brahmin even I am it that's a tough luck no cigars why because the Prophet told us you have to be Mohammed Abdullah if someone comes to me he says my name is Mohammed they've been Abdullah I love cash money I said tough luck why because the stripe honorable tribe of pan is not related to the Prophet Allah status Allah and the Prophet said he is from my descendant so he has to be the son or originally in his family tree he has to reach to Al Hassan or to Al Hussein reaching to the Prophet or isola to Sarah the Prophet said that he would not be practicing and overnight Allah soldier would turn him into a practicing and pious and god-fearing not only that that he would fill the earth which means that he will have control that he would have leadership he would fill the earth with fairness and justice so if someone comes and he's killed or he is imprisoned and he does not have these conditions he's not the Matic so is it wise that we sit back and relax and say I'll wait for the Madi and when he comes I'll fight with him no Allah knows when he will come but we know that he will come definitely at the end of the time because there will be a severe and grave and serious battle between the Muslims and the Christians this is history this not is this is Sunnah this is our religion we believe in that and this will come inshallah to talk later on when we talk about the great battles and there will come a time when the Antichrist will show up and he will show up at the time of Mahdi and Jesus Christ will descend from the heavens when the fuzzer time is called and maddie is about to lead the prayer when he sees jesus he retreats and Jesus says no it was established for you and you should lead so he prays as an imam and jesus prays behind him so all of this happens at the very end of time so don't sit back and relax work hard because your day of judgment takes place when you die"
