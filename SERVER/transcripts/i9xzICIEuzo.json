  "title": "When to raise hands for Raful yadain if you join imam in the second rakat? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "bilal says it is Sunnah to raise hands when one is getting up for the third raka right is this right but when one should raise his hand when if he joins the Imam in the second raka do I raise my hands when I complete my two Rakas or when the Imam gets up from his third to his third raka Bilal's question is about raising the hands and we know that the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam according to the hadith of even Umar may Allah be pleased with him thus the brother-in-law of the Prophet I am the son of amram the hopup and the brother of Hafsah the mother of the believers and the close companion of the Prophet Ali salatu salam he described the prayer of the Prophet erase a lot salam and when to raise the hands and he told us in an authentic hadith it's in Buhari and elsewhere which gives it the highest grade of authenticity he told us that the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam used to raise his hands in four positions two of them happens only once in the prayer and to the remaining third and fourth-place happens in every single raka so the place of the takbir or raising the hands that happens only once in the inauguration takbir the very first tech video say which allows you to enter into the salat known as takbir or to hell on the takbir itself is a pillar to say Allahu Akbar is a pillar raising the hand here is a Sunnah so even if I wanted to pray Mallory but I said Allahu Akbar my prayer is valid if I did this without saying anything there is no prayer at all I have to say so the first position one in the beginning of the salaat second position is when I go to Luke or I say Allahu Akbar every single raka when I go to a court to bow I raise my hands the third position which happens every rakah with when I raise my head from the recurrence a semi Allahu Liman Hamidah rabbana wa laqad Han I raise my hands once the fourth position which happens once as well is when I finish the first shot so I finished two units two rakahs and I'm in the first shot if I want to stand up to the third raka whether I'm praying Madre the Horus or Orisha because they have more than two rakahs in Federer of course I don't do this because I conclude my prayer with Salam if I want to stand up for the third raka the Sunnah is as I'm standing I say Allahu Akbar I hope this is understood and it's clear it's not that difficult now what is the last question the last question is if I as a follower missed wonder how with the Imam so I joined my Imam in his second raka while it is my first I prayed it with the probably the Imam sad for Tasha hood and the Imam stood up for his third Raqqa which is my second raka so now I'm in a dilemma should i after concluding my Tasha hood with the Imam when he stood for his third raka should I although I'm standing for my second raka raised my hands in takbir or not the answer is yes you should raise your hand in technique because this is the position for raising the hand which is once you conclude your first shot and stand for the third he says yes sure but this is not my third this is the Imams third this is my second we say yes you raise your hand because your Imams Sunnah is to raise his hand this is a position for him to raise his hands and hence you should have raised your hand as well as when it is your third raka which is the Imams fourth no you do not raise your hand definitely because you did not proceed it with etosha hood so I hope this answers your question and clarifies your doubt"
