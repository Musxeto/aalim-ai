  "transcript": "[Music] foreign [Music] today in our 65th episode of the islamic film we shall try to talk about a chapter known in the islamic books as a man so oaths and vows or pledges so what is an oath an oath is using allah's name to confirm or to reiterate an issue to emphasize it so that a person would believe you and the arabic letter we can simply use the word i swear and usually this is embedded in it by allah's name so you say so and so on took place and the easiest and simplest form is to use any of allah's beautiful names or attributes with one of the three letters in arabic alphabet that are indicators of swearing the most well-known letter is wow or when we pronounce it we say what the second one is alba and when we pronounce it we say be and the third one is ta and we pronounce it as ta so you say this is sweating formula or tella and in arabic how do we know that these letters are used for used for swearing it is indicated by the vow at the end of allah's name if i say or wallah this is not swearing once i say he bella he tell he then this is a word of an oath a plat a word of swearing by allah's name and these oaths as you will find in the book can be divided into three types the first one is idol oath and we call it and this is when a person says the words without intending his statement and this happens a lot when a mother shouts at her kids well i will not put food for you and no one says that this is serious and she's not gonna serve them food well i am going to beat you until i break your bones this is something that is randomly used when a person may say an oath and he does not intend it likewise a person comes in and says why are you leaving so early i said well i have work to do here wallahi is not to emphasize the fact that i have worked because i can easily not have anything to do when someone asks are you hungry well i just ate but i didn't eat but i it's just used randomly without any intention so this is called lahu and likewise part of this yamin lagoon is when i swear about something which i was almost hundred percent confident it was true and then it appears to have been not true so a person may say an oath confirming that he believes to be true but later realizes that it is false so this is also considered level example um can you give me fifty dollars well i i don't have even five dollars in my pocket and i thought seriously that i'm stoned broke i don't have this money after he left a while a day i take off my wallet and i find two hundred dollars in there and i don't know where it came from maybe my wife put it in or maybe somebody gave it to me i put it in my wife and i forgot totally about it when i was asked about the money so is this considered to be lying no in the famous hadith when sad ibn abi what may allah be pleased with him came to umar and um was the caliph so he asked him remember did anything happen in this world that concerns the muslims that we should know about swahili said no why do you ask he said subhanallah i met uthman a while ago and we know that samuel will cause fan and are all among the ten heaven-bound companions they're the top ten so he says i met uthman he looked me in the eyes as we were coming close face to face and i said assalamu alaikum and he looked me in the eyes and walked away not replying to my salam this is a big offense how do you not reply to your brother salam so sad wanted some comfort some solace from umar now omar being the man who he is did not let this go unsettled so he sent someone to bring uthman and when if man came he's so sad he saw roma romar did he not give him a chance he immediately went on to into the offensive he said why didn't you reply to your brother's salam swarzman was shocked he said he didn't give me salam sad was shocked now he said yes i did i said no you didn't sad said wallahi you did and this is the point i wanted to mention uthman said wallahi you didn't and after a while he hit his forehead and he said for allah now i remember yes you did you know when you met me and read the salaam i was so depressed i was so confused because i remembered an incident where the prophet alice islam was talking to us in the masjid and he said that there is a phrase a statement that no one says it at times of this press depression or at times of calamity and then he could not complete his statement because a man came from the nomads and started talking to him so the prophet did not finish it rasmus says every time i remember this incident and failing to know what was the statement i get sort of blackout and we know the rest of the hadith said i remember it because i went and asked a prophet about it and he told me about the supplication of prophet yunus the one of the whale when he said my point is that though uthman swore but he did not expiate because he swore over something that he was certain that was true but then when he discovered that it wasn't he's exempted from such a oath now having said that idol oath there's no expiation in it this doesn't mean that people use it abuse it and say it without account allah says in the quran allah shall not take you to task for oaths which you may have uttered without thought so when you don't give it much thought and you say it out of habit out of this or that then there is no expiation over it this is the first type of oaths the second type is the confirmed oath and the confirmed oath is when you say something and this has to do with the future not with the past so either you say this to confirm or oblige yourself to do it or not to do a particular thing or not to say a particular thing and it relates to what is in the future and refers to something that is possible says in the quran allah will not take you to task for those of your your oaths which you may utter without thought but he will take you to task for oaths which you have sworn in earnest so i say wallahi i will not go tomorrow to my brother's house for lunch out of anger i don't want to go and they keep on insisting you have to go you he loves your presence and the food is good so i swear and i emphasize with using using allah's name that i'm not going or i force myself and i swear that i will do this if this thing uh um in in the future so i say wallahi i will resign tomorrow so i swore over something that i must do it either way i have to do it because this is a confirmed oath was in the future and it's possible to be done and i intended it the third type of oaths is the false oath something in the past that i deliberately use to protect myself to escape from a situation to deny something that is coming my way so the person saying it knows that he or she is telling a lie and it does not take place and cannot be atoned for you cannot give expiation did you take my pen yesterday well i didn't take it and i took it i forgot my homework but i did not solve it so i'm lying to escape punishment wallahi i did my chores which i didn't and the soul on and this is sinful but the sin increases multiplies becomes huge to the extent that it overwhelms the person who had said it when it is used to deny other people's rights or to take their rights unlawfully this is known as [Music] the immersing oath or the oath that dips the person who said it in hell fire so this is really serious and this we find it prevailing widely spread in courts of law you see taking an oath is not always prohibited it can be mandatory when mandatory things need to happen it can be prohibited when used in prohibited means it can be recommended and it can be not recommended and it can be in the middle which is permissible so not all oaths are haram sometimes you have to swear by allah azzawajal and it is one of the rules in islam which was stated by the prophet islam and it can be used as legal maxims but it is definitely used in law in a court of law the proof is mandatory upon the accuser so if i am the accuser i accuse you of taking a hundred thousand dollars from me you're not repaying it because you're denying so we go to the court immediately the moment i present my case the judge tells me bring your proof either two witnesses or a written statement from that accused from the defendant or his confession so i say well i i have none of those and it's my mistake but i don't i don't have no none of those but this does not change the fact that he took a hundred thousand dollars from me as a loan and he's now refusing to pay it back so the judge once he is certain that there is no proof he goes to the defendant the prophet said allah so the accuser must provide the evidence if not then the oath is mandatory upon who denies it so he took a hundred thousand dollars as a loan from me and now he is denying it so the judge looks at him and he says is what he's saying true and the defendant says know your honor it's not true so the judge says to him in this case swear by allah you did not take anything from him if the defendant says wallahi i did not take a penny or a dollar or a hundred thousand from him case is closed plus but if he rejects he says no i'm not gonna swear i didn't take any money from him then the judge obliges him to pay it back because this is the only way out so swearing is needed but you find in so many cases the desire for quick money and this is when people become greedy and whenever there is greed there is destruction and disaster a few days ago one of the sisters had the counseling session with me and it was regarding investments and she asked me about investing her money in some sort of a business which she is totally new for on all or two so i told her do you have a running existing business she said yes i've been running my own business in a specific field for the past five seven ten years maybe and i'm making good money out of it so i said is there any need for similar in projects like yours so though yes there is a lot of need so i said instead of investing in i.t which you know nothing about or in transportation which you know nothing about or in manufacturing which you know nothing about though the return of investment is far far more greater than your current business i advise you not to go into these businesses and i explained to her in a few minutes why not and the risks and i said to her the logical thing is to invest in what you know best so your current business you will make certain and sure profit because you know the ins and outs of the business no one can fool you you don't need anybody to run it for you you know the logistics of it the strengths and the weakness points in it so you can easily even ask people to invest with you so you save yourself a capital and secure a hefty profit due to your management skills and you can duplicate this all over the place she was very happy and satisfied and that was an eye opener for her and this is why we say that greed is the mother of all destruction and disasters if you go to courts you'll find people willing to testify for peanuts and when you pay peanuts you get monkeys people are willing to swear by allah azza for a meal for a few dollars so what i'll swear by allah that i you that you are the king of the universe that you are superman no problem i can do that and this is why it's immersing oath it dips the one who uses it in vain and lies about it in hell fire as the prophet said allah allah says in the quran do not use your oaths as a means to deceive one another lest your foot should slip after it has been firm and lest you should be made to suffer the evil consequences of your having debarred others from the path of god of allah with tremendous suffering awaiting you and this sin is huge especially when people do it in trading imagine that the prophet said that there are three types of people that allah shall not speak to them on the day of judgment should not purify them should not look at them and they will be severely tormented four huge great punishments for what the prophet says assam in the third category he mentioned three two and then the third one was a man who made the name of allah his merchandise he does not sell without swearing and he does not buy without sweating so many people they market their products come by from me come by from me and nobody comes and when someone bargains with him how much is this five dollars no too expensive i'll take it for a dollar in order to sell he says he i bought it for 95 4.95 meaning that he's making five cents profit now as a muslim when someone swears to me i believe him i see no reason not to believe him so i said okay as long as you swore by allah azza i'll buy it so he sells not the product not the product he's selling allah's name in vain and when he buys he does the same so how much is this this is five dollars well i saw it in the shop next door for 4 45. so the seller says if you swore i believe him honest take it for the same price and you're happy you think that you struck the jackpot you think that you made a very good deal and you saved money not knowing that you've saved your seat first class and hellfire so if i swore by allah's name what should i do you should pay the kaffar and what is the kafara what is the atonement of oaths allah mentioned this in the quran where he says allah has already ordained for you believers a way to release you from such oaths so what is that the prophet says anyone who swears about something and then discovers that a different thing is better should do the better thing and atone for this oath what does that mean it means that it is not mandatory for you to carry on with your oath i say wallahi i'm not going for lunch in my brother's house tomorrow and i'm angry because we have respect issues but then when i think about it okay if i don't go i'm gonna make a stance and people would understand why but if i go this would soften my brother's heart and he would feel and sense his mistake and how i am the one who's reaching out first and that would make him embarrassed and maybe reconcile so i think that the latter is the best alternative but i made an oath i said well i am not going what to do the prophet says as whenever i swear over something and i see something better than it i immediately expiate my oath and do the something which was better or which is better so i give the the atonement the kaffara and do it and what is the kaffara allah says in the quran the breaking of an oath must be atoned for by feeding 10 needy persons with more or less the same food as you normally give to your own families or by clothing them or by freeing one slave he who cannot afford any of these shall fast three days instead so now you are given a choice of three it's up to you up to your own preference whatever you want either feed 10 poor people and they have to be separate 10 people it's not sufficient to feed one p one person ten times or five persons twice they have to be ten separate different individuals and they have to be poor and i have to feed them which with something that is among the norm of my eating so a normal meal i shouldn't go for a single sandwich that is not a normal meal where i usually take three sandwiches or two and it shouldn't be something like a falafel which is nice but it's not the average meal in arabia the average meal is a plate of rice with some meat or some chicken on it this is an average meal so scholars say either you feed them cooked food of your average meal that you eat and your kids and family every day or you give each poor person one point one to five grams of rice so this is half assad two mud and this raw rice is a lot it's good for three meals maybe four meals or maybe more but because it's straw you're giving it to him in this fashion or if you don't want to feed them you should clothe 10 people and clothing them differs from one area to the other so in arabia you just give them this though this white shirt long shirt with a topping on the head like the one i'm wearing that's sufficient for one person other countries maybe a pair of jeans and and a t-shirt or a shirt would be clothing and so on or i may fray i may flee slave i have the option to do either one of these three up to my own preference if i am financially unable in this case i can fast three days the vast majority of muslims immediately jump the gun they immediately go for fasting though they're capable of feeding 10 people they are rich they have money but they always thought according to the people around them that fasting is the atonement and whoever does this while financially capable of feeding 10 people his fasting does not excrete his oath he has to pay for it again what are the conditions of atonement there are conditions for it to become obligatory and according to our book we have three conditions one it must be a valid oath so if i swear by the moon or the stars or by the prophet islam or by the kaaba or by jesus all of these are not valid legitimate oaths and hence i don't have to pay any kaffara for that so if i say and this is very um common in arabia to swear by amana so amanda put it there b is a letter of swearing the prophet said assam whoever swears by al-ahmad he had committed chick in another narration whoever swears by al-ahmad he's not from among us so this is a major sin in egypt almost every single person who's not practicing uses the word winner wow the letter what is as we've stated in the uh in the beginning is one of the letters of swearing so he says we never do this in that when nabi i'm not coming and all of this is shirk it's minership but still it's greater than major sense as minor shikh is below major shirk and above my major sins so if somebody swears by other than allah this doesn't take place if someone swears without intending though he used allah's names again you do not you're not obliged to atone or to expiate as in idle oaths and we we talked about that the second condition is that the person swearing he has to be doing that out of his own choice so there's not a gun pointed to his head there's no compulsion and when it is done through compulsion then this does not take place and this is cascaded on almost everything in islam the prophet said allah will not be accountable for what they do through a genuine mistake what they omit to do out of forgetfulness what they do my mistake what they forget and what they are forced or compelled to do so if i go to my wife's house and my father-in-law who hates my guts holds a shotgun to my chest and i know that he's crazy and he says if you don't divorce my wife thrice i will pull the trigger and i can see sparks coming out of his eyes so i say i divorce my wife i divorce my wife i divorce my wife and i give you a fourth one as a bonus i divorce my wife then he puts the gun down i leave i honk my wife she comes down and we leave to our home she says you divorced me four times i said no divorce did not take place because because i was compelled i was forced and the third condition is when you say it you give the oath you swear by allah but at the time you don't remember and as i said um that for example i swear by allah i'm not gonna eat red apples from now on and all of a sudden one day i was so hungry i just wanted anything to take a bite from and i saw this apple and i took it i ate it after i finished i remembered that i took an oath not to eat red apples i called the sheikh what should i do cher and the sheikh says did anybody compel you said no did you swear by other than the name of allah said no he said were you remembering that you made an oath he said no i said okay if you did not remember there is no expiation on you you are exempted and you're free to go now one last uh issue before we go to the questions is that can i exclude something and this is in arabic known as so when you say an oath or you swear by allah azza and you make an exception then this exception is valid so for example if i say wallahi i swear by allah i'm gonna come tomorrow insha allah ah this insha allah means that you're making an exception if allah is willing so if i did not come this is allah's willing because i didn't come if allah will did i would have come so you may argue you said this to protect yourself i said yes it's true and this is one of the legitimate ways of protecting yourself from atoning your oath and falling into breaking it is to say inshallah your son nags you that you take him tomorrow to the games and you say okay i will do that i will do that khalas i said i'll do that and he keeps on nagging on you and he said well i'm not going to take you tomorrow to the games inshallah and i'll show you how you stop nagging now he doesn't know that insha allah here means that you have the choice to go through or not so making an exception making an istifna is something that saves you from a lot of trouble it is also important to note that what you intend is important because we have something in islam called or a tauria which means a form of camouflaging what your statement is so you surround it with ambiguity that can go both ways and this is one of the ways of not lying when the prophet hassam saw a nomad in one of his expeditions he asked him did you see the people of quraish and the man said i will not answer you until you tell me where you are from so the prophet said i will tell you where we are from after you answer me so the man answered him and then he said okay i did my part of the bargain where are you from so the prophet said we're from water and the word ma which means water has a number of meanings in arabic it can refer to a spring you know the nomans live in oasis in areas around the spring so that they can water their flocks and herds from so it's this that they associate with water an area and it also means water which is referred to in the quran as semen so when the prophet said we are from semen we are from water this is not a lie the man thought it was the other meaning of water which is a well or a spring so he's asking which spring are you referring to so the prophet did not say and left so the prophet did not lie but definitely the answer was not according to the man's anticipation now this tareed can sometimes be used with swearing so when someone asks you did you take my pen i said well i did not take it and intentionally i am intending i did not take it that is your car keys but you're asking me about the pen so my answer is ambiguous because i'm referring to something else scholars say that whenever such an oath is given when you are the oppressor in this case it is according to the intention of the one asking you because this cannot be allowed we are in a court of law and the judge says did you take a hundred thousand dollars from him and i say well i did not take it and i intend wallahi did not take his car i did not take his bag i did not take his property so the judge says as long as he swore you are free to go and i'm happy no this does not exempt me from the sin because the hadith is your intent your oath your swearing is according to your opponent's intention not yours so your opponent is asking about his pen and you swore about something else this would not help you and sometimes such wit is needed it was reported that ibn jose the great scholar of the 5th century he's a different person he came in the 9th century or something like that he died in there no this one is the compiler of the great book of tafsir zadul masira and the great book said and many other books and he was one of the great preachers that they say when ever he preached in the masjid 5 000 to 10 000 used to attend and weep and cry when he reminds them of allah he was a full scholar from every aspect you look at him the story goes that he was once in the masjid in the grand masjid and two groups of hooligans one group is from the sunni and one group is from the shia they had this pute they had an argument who was best abu bakr or ali and they barged into the masjid with sparks flying from their eyes intending to do harm to someone hooligans and they asked imam who's better abu bakr um so he was a witty smart man and his answers were quick decisive so he said i'm going to answer you in one statement and i'm not going to allow this rubbish to continue in my masjid and i'm leaving afterwards so they said okay who was better abu bakr ali he said the one whose daughter was under him and he left now in arabic a wife is described as under me meaning under my protection under my guardianship etc so when he said the man whose daughter is under him the sunnis say that's abu bakr because abu bakr's daughter is under the prophet so he's a better man the shia said no no no he was referring to ali because the prophet's daughter is under him because she's the wife of adi so ari is better and ibn josie left without making a sound these ambiguous answers are extremely beneficial and good in cases where you need to defend yourself not in cases where you want to oppress someone or to wrong them in your life there is a type of oath and swearing which is dependent on case-to-case scenario but in case of harm or severe hardship a muslim is allowed to resort to that a woman got married couple of years ago has a child all of a sudden it came to her husband to ask her this question did you ever have an illicit relationship before marriage were you ever mad with you were you ever in a relationship with another man and she doesn't know what to say of course not and such questions must not be answered and you should show how furious and insulted you are when someone asks you such a stupid question and only stupid men ask such questions but the man comes and says swear to me that you never had a relationship or i'll divorce you so she calls what to do to do i said swear to him say well i had never ever had a relationship with another man before you and this is called swearing to seek refuge a tao with and this is dependent on case the case scenario but it is permissible in order to avoid the worst of the two evils and allah azza knows best uh we go to the questions and jannatul ferdow says i'm very confused about the arafah fast as i am from bangladesh here some people fast after the day of arafat that was held in saudi arabia and some people fast during the arafat in saudi arabia so what should i do though who fast during arafat said that it is haram to fast in a day because they follow saudi and also most of the mawlana from hadith do this and explain it logically to the people what that's why i am confused well there's no need to confuse jannatul ferdowsi because if you look at the concept of the lunar months how do we know that a lunar month has started and has ended the answer is by observing the moon detecting the crescent when it disappears and when it re appears and reborn and arafat is on the ninth of dulhajja so as in ramadan people in bangladesh india start a day after saudi arabia due to their sighting hopefully of the crescent likewise during the month of the alafat is dependent on the ninth of the month and so is eight it's dependent on the tenth of the month whether it's a friday as in the case in saudi arabia or a saturday as the case in bangladesh so you should not be fasting with saudi arabia on arafat simply because the pilgrims are in mount arafat performing their hajj because your ninth is a day later and it coincides with our aid so this is the permissible way of doing it each region in the muslim world has a different sighting of the moon and this was applicable at the time of the companions may allah be pleased with them and they all approved of it as in the case that each region has its own fajr timing maghrib timing so it is not permissible for people during fajr in bangladesh to wait until the people in mecca in haram are in the kaaba pray fajr that is a tuna out two hours difference and the sun is in the middle of the sky they have their own timings and you have your own timings and allah knows best rasheed says who will receive the blood money of the killed victim so a person the family of abdullah demands justice so the judge gives him the choice would you like execution or blood money or set pardoning him and setting him free so abdullah's family say no we want the blood money so ahmed gives them a hundred camels or the value of a hundred camel and they received the money how to distribute it this money is considered to be the wealth that the victim left behind so abdullah has died leaving property living money leaving stocks how do we divide them like the rules of inheritance likewise the blood money is divided through the rules of inheritance so does abdullah have a wife he said yes does he have children he says yes so the wife gets one eighth and the children gets the boys twice the share of the girls does he have a father and a mother says yes each one gets one sixth and so on so the money the blood money is distributed in such a fashion khadijah says is freelancing as a web designer permissible the answer is yes it is permissible but what goes during the designing is what needs to be asked about but to design a web page no problem at all she goes on saying and during designing of e-commerce web school or web travel web adding pictures is it permissible or not well this depends on the pictures if you put photographs of men of children there's no problem in that if you put photographs of women or deceased this is haram and not permissible if you're ordered to put a link for mortgage installments or buying transactions through riba or to put background music this is haram so actually your job description the details of your job as a web designer defines whether what you're doing is halal or haram says you said about kneeling that it is haram but what about the incident where umar knelt before the prophet salam i do not know of any such incident what we know of is the hadith of muhammad may allah be pleased with him when he was sent by the prophet alaihis was salam to yemen to teach them and to judge between them and he came back and the moment he came back he fell and prostrated to the prophet allah the prophet was said what are you doing so mahath said i saw this where the jews and christians used to do it to their masters and i thought that you are more worthy of them so the prophet said that if i were to order a person to prostrate to another i would have ordered the wife to prostrate to her husband meaning that prostration to humans or to other than allah to be precise prostration to other than allah is totally prohibited so i don't know where you got this story about kneeling but it is not true i believe that we will stop here and until we meet next monday i leave you for a manila salaam alaikum warahmatullahi"
