  "title": "How did Prophet ﷺ look like? (Part 1) Noble features of the Prophet ﷺ #islam #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] alhamd We Begin and with his grace sub with the first Hadith in the first chapter of this book The Noble features of the Prophet Alat and this is related to the physical characteristics of the Prophet Alam why because it is logical to begin in describing how the prophet looked sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam why there are many reasons for that number one is that when you visualize him through his description this makes you relate to him rather than someone you don't know secondly the prophet said in an authentic Hadith whoever sees me in his dream then he had seen me for a reality or for truth because Satan cannot impersonate me now this Hadith relates to how he really actually looked if you don't know his description I could get someone coming to me and saying she I saw the prophet Alam I say describe him to me he says the the prophet Sall wasallam was like 410 and and he was chubby and his eyes were like the South Asians and this and that said nope that's not the prophet someone says oh the prophet was like 64 and he had a big afro and he was like you know a brother he said nope doesn't fit the description once you are able to describe him in your vision in your dream as actually he was described by the companions then you had seen the prophet sallallahu Al wasallam and this is a great honor and a privilege so this is why we start with his physical description and then we go to other things of the things that he used to do in his daily routine and then his character and how he dealt with others in addition to what he wore what he used for eating and drinking and the likes so the first Hadith is narrated by an Malik may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallah alai wasam was neither very tall of stature nor short meaning that the prophet was an average so he wasn't like 67 or 66 and he wasn't 410 he was averaging his height nor and his skin was neither pale white nor Tony or dark in complexion which means that the prophet Sall wasallam was not uh uh from the Vikings and he was not from Africa rather he was white sallallahu alaih wasallam and we will come to explain this a bit further his hair was neither crispy curled nor lank so it was medium it wasn't n like the Asians you know let down and it wasn't curly and Allah the almighty had sent him to serve as his messenger Allah revealed to him at the end of 40 Years of his life meaning he was made a prophet like most prophets at the age of 40 and this is the prime of a man's life so he stayed in mecca for 10 years and in Medina for 10 years however we know that he stayed in Mecca for 13 why is Anna saying 10 some Scholars say that this is because he made the number even so instead of saying 13 He said just 10 so he dropped three some say that the first three years years was the silent and secret and the covert da which means in the first three years the prophet did not publicize it he did not publicly call people to Islam he W went covertly to the people one to one inviting them to Islam if they accept he would tell them keep hush on it keep it silent don't publicize it but after 3 years Allah told him to announce it so then it was 10 years of public dawa and calling to Islam and in Medina he spent 10 years and Allah took him onto himself at the age of 60 so Allah took him uh uh to himself onto himself at the end of 60 years again the number was made even because we know that the vast majority of Scholars if not the consensus that the prophet s died when he was 63 years of age and this is according to the hijri calendar according to the Gregorian calendar it's about 61 years of age andice goes on to say with fewer than 20 white hairs on his head and his beard so the prophet maintained having a black hair and beard with few strands of white on his uh um head and beard and this gives us a preview how the prophet looked he was average in height average in complexion and that he did not have any extremity in that and his hair and beard wear black with few white hairs this is the first Hadith we have we will inshallah conclude as we progress in the other Hadith related to this and go a little bit in depth in some uh of the issues related to it"
