  "transcript": "a lot of us men fail to express their feelings to their wives and they fail to send them a text message saying I love you I miss you they fail to buy them a gift sometimes in my counseling sessions I see a wife of 20 years complaining that her husband only brought her four gifts in their marriage only four gifts so women are different than men they depend entirely and they live and they thrive on their emotions and feelings if men are negligent ignorant not expressing any of such attention to their feelings their marriage is at the brink and there won't be a lot of what Allah described in the Quran among his signs that he created from uh uh for you from yourselves spouses so that you would find an abode in them and he made between you care Mercy affection compassion so if you fail to pay attention to your wife's emotions you have a big problem the prophet a role model was the master in noticing such emotions and feelings once he said to Mother AA I know when you're pleased and when you're angry so mother AA looked at him and said how would you know that so the prophet saidat wasam if you are pleased when you talk you swear by and say no by the Lord of Muhammad you swear by Allah being the Lord of Muhammad but if you're angry you would say no by the Lord of ibraim so the prophet would notice that she's not swearing by the Lord of Muhammad she's swearing by the Lord of ibraim which means she's angry of him she said said yes by Allah oh prophet of Allah I only abandon your name when I'm angry I would not do anything except not using your name when I make such an oath the prophet Alam was not such a person who would not care whether his wife is pleased or not also anas reports that the prophet Alat would console his wife when she is in pain or she has a crisis or a calamity"
