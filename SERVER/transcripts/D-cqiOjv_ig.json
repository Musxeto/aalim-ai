  "transcript": "is it permissible for me to purchase items online that I have only seen pictures of and asked me to pay through cart before they deliver some have a no return policy also is it permissible to go for cash on delivery first of all there are a number of conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the transaction to be halal among the most prominent conditions is that both seller and buyer are allowed to engage in such a transaction I cannot buy from someone who is classified as insane or from someone who is like 7 years of age his transaction is invalid so buying and selling from such a person is not permissible also the item that I am buying and selling the buying power the money that I'm buying and selling with must be halal so I cannot sell a guitar for example or a cross these are prohibited in Islam and hence selling and buying them is also prohibited you have to avoid any type of ambiguity and ambiguity can be in the description can be in the quantity can be in the price can be in the date of delivery imagine you're selling something and I say okay what are you doing you tell me I'm selling something so say okay I'm buying and we shake hands and we make a contract that I'll buy after a while I say what did I buy this is invalid because I have to know what I'm buying if you say I'm selling rice just a ok I buy the rice from you ok how many kgs how many pounds how many sacks it was not identified this is not permissible if I say ok I'll buy this kilogram of rice from you and we made a contract but we did not specify the price you may say ten dollars and I say it only costs one dollar so such ambiguity must be avoided it has to be through mutual consent there must not be any compulsion no one is forcing me to buy or forcing you to sell and there are many other conditions to be fulfilled even for your question buying something online the description has to be clear what do you mean by that so if I'm buying for example a bottle of perfume now I know that this brand and it is so-and-so milliliters in the bottle and I know the fragrance of it so buying it has no ambiguity in it I know the product and I can tell from the picture if I'm buying a pen if I'm buying something that can be illustrated clearly through pictures or a description that is so specific and accurate in that in this case there is no problem in that whether I pay them in advance or I pay them while processing or I pay them once I receive the product this doesn't affect the transaction because this would be like someone lending someone money the transaction is done when to pay is flexible the issue of no-return Islamically is not permissible because in Islam if I buy a pen and I find that it's defected broken it doesn't work the but the the the seller has no right in forcing me to keep it I have all the right in Islam to return it back and get my money back or get the actual item that works otherwise it would be consuming my wealth my money without any legitimate reason and this is totally prohibited in Islam selling and buying through credit cards we have addressed this issue before about the credit cards that are RIBA based and this is not something that is permissible to use if it's a debit card or if it's an interest-free credit card there is nothing wrong in that in sha allah in both ways buying it through a credit card whether had a credit card or Haram credit card the transaction is okay"
