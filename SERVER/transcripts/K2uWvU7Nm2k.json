  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord is and my back chapter 102 remembrance while ascending or descending now we are Travelers and we cross the lands inevitably we may rise up a hill or a mountain or descend down a valley may Allah be pleased with him in Hadith number 214 said foreign foreign while ascending we would say Allahu Akbar so while you're going up a mountainous terrain or a uphill you say Allahu Akbar because no matter how high that place you're climbing over Allah is greater Allah is the greatest and while or when descending we would say subhanallah how perfect Allah is subhanallah Glory Be to Allah so we exempt Allah from any short comings or flaws or defect because Allah is the perfect one and nothing can harm him as zawajal while going downwards while descending we say this vicar now remember this is while traveling unlike what some people think that whenever they get into a lift or an elevator they would say that Dua when going up and coming down this is not true an escalator going down or going up not true this is only when you are traveling chapter 103 prayer of the traveler as Dawn approaches we know that the prophet assalam used to travel sometimes at night because this is when the land becomes in in an Arabic expression shorter and smaller so the distances are crossed in a shorter span of time so there is a Hadith that whenever the prophet Allah um as a traveler saw that the dawn is about to break he would say this beautiful May a witness be witness to Our Praise of Allah what does that mean meaning that we're praising Allah so anyone witnessing may he witness that we're praising Allah for what for his favors and bounties upon us our Lord protect us show favor on us and Deliver Us from every evil I take refuge in Allah from the fire connecting your heart to Allah feeling that Allah azzawajal is with you every moment of the day or night when the day is about to break you say this beautiful duh it shows how much you're only connected to Allah and that you know and acknowledge that you will you you will return back to him so this is the power of vicar that we must all the time accompany with us chapter 104 stopping or lodging somewhere and we've been through this before and we have stated in this uh Hadith previously that the Dua is I take refuge in Allah perfect words from the evil that he has created what are Allah's perfect words on top of all of them of course is the Quran and the words that Allah azzawajal speaks that with it Allah creates anything in this universe and runs things Allah's perfect words are found in the preserved tablet when he decreed everything that is going to take place until the day of judgment so you seek refuge in Allah whether you seek refuge in his names or attributes this is seeking refuge in Allah the Almighty and you seek refuge in him from the evil that he has created which encompasses all types of evil now when we are returning from travel what is it that we should say we should say what the prophet used to say Allah reported may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that whenever the prophet Allah on his return from Battle from performing umrah or hajjah cool ah foreign would say at every High Point as we mentioned earlier Allah is the greatest three times then he would say this long Dua Allah he would say no or none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent we return I edun we are returning we are repenting continuously till we die and worshiping and praising our Lord Allah fulfilled his promise this is a statement so we're saying and acknowledging in gratitude that Allah has fulfilled his promise aided his servant that is the prophet Muhammad and single-handedly defeated the Confederates the allies when we say this when we're returning some Scholars said that this is related only to the prophet Islam after the battle of the trench because the Confederates or the Allies are mentioned here and some say no this is General so we can say it without any problem in sha Allah Muhammad oh [Music]"
