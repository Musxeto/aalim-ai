  "transcript": "foreign hmm last time we met we discussed the incident of if or the incident of lie where they the hypocrites that is and joined by a small amount or small group of companions satan managed to deceive them and lower them to the level that they slaughtered the wife of the prophet salallahu shallam and accuse her with adultery after one whole month of testing and intensity the prophet sallam did not receive any revelation from the heavens instructing him of the innocence of aisha or of accusing her of what people are gossiping of one full month then the relief came from allah almighty it was revealed to the prophet saw sallam that was innocent and this is located in the sura no surat nur now the azab had everything to do with banyak and the battle of al-azab the trench while surat and noor had at the very beginning all about and the incident of these lies that were said about mother be pleased with her going back to the consequences of this incident the prophet alaihis salatu as it was obvious and clear to him that she was innocent had to punish those who slaughtered mother aisha and accused her of adultery with safan abner because this is allah's given right to her and this is an islamic practice it shows you how islam honors women in the sense that if a person slaunders a woman and says that she committed adultery or any act of fornication if he does not bring forward four witnesses he is punished in islam by striking him 80 lashes as a punishment of what he had said for the men also and also for the men if someone accuses a man without bringing forward this then he they will be or he will be punished likewise do you remember the names of the three that talked about aisha and this is the funny thing the majority of scholars say that he was not punished though he is the head of the hypocrites yet he was not punished because there were no proof that he spoke and he was so smart that he would not condemn himself by saying something that would indict him he only used to say what did you hear did anything happen did you did you see anything happening between safwan and ayesha come on is it possible them traveling alone for a full day and coming late and he would you know make people talk and do suspicious yeah and then fall into sin while he's in the clear but he is the one who provoked them and made them talk so he was not punished muhammad yes so i believe that the companions which would punish like the three companions do you know their names and she is the sister in law of the prophet susan her her sister was zainab the cousin both of them were cousins of the prophet sallam now the prophet himself in his effort to know the truth because hamlet talked about in a bad sense so the prophet went to zainab his wife and he told her he asked her zainab do you know anything about aisha now zainab and ayasha are co-wives so it is normal practice that a co-wife would say something bad about her sister so that she would elevate her status with her husband but zainab as described by aisha herself she said while zainab when asked by the prophet allah her piocey her fear of allah protected her and no other wife was so close to the prophet sallam than zainab and myself so she was very close to the prophet it was her chance to take her position yet she said that her pisces protected her what did zainab say zainab said i protect my eyes and my tongue from saying something that i did not see all what i know about aisha is that she is a very good woman subhanallah look at this faith and belief and this again teaches us that though jealousy exists and anyone that claims that there is no wrongful jealousy between sisters between co-wives is insane this is human nature i it astonishes me when i hear brothers saying that we want to marry another wife and i know my first wife very well and i believe that the second wife will live nicely in the same house this is not the norm it's something that is not enormous abnormal you should be worried if they're not jealous they should they should be worried if they're not jealous if they're not jealous they definitely should be something or a reason of concern because this is normal to be jealous but what is not normal what takes effect after the jealousy in islam the prophet sallam was approached by one of his companions so the companion said o prophet of allah advise me so the prophet looked at him and said do not become angry so the companion said okay give me more advise me more the prophet kept on saying do not become angry do not become angry and he kept on repeating it scholars say that becoming angry is not a problem of itself because everyone has to become angry at one time or the other this is not something you can control but what you can control is your actions so your actions are the things that you are held accountable at the side of allah feeling angry is human nature and that is why in islam it's permissible for me if i i'm not on good terms with a brother if we have a fight that i do not talk to him only for three days this is a buffer zone to cool down a bit this is from allah azza after three days if i meet him and if he meets me and we do not exchange greetings in salaam then allah azzawajal is angry with both of us so look at the beauty of islam islam gives you a room to feel angry and to be upset but it tells you should not exceed three days and again islam tells us that jealousy is human nature so it's natural for a wife to feel jealous from her co-wife what's not natural and it is not acceptable is when the wife lies betrays or harms her co-wife in order to get a better status with her husband and that is why in islam as the prophet sallam teaches us that it is forbidden for a wife to ask the divorce of her co-wife this is completely forbidden in islam and this is illustrated uh clearly when a person proposes to a woman and he's married and she says well i'll accept your proposal and i will marry you if you divorce your first wife now this is completely forbidden you either accept him as he is or reject his proposal but to have it as a condition and request harming your sister in islam this is unacceptable uh in islam okay she was the sister of zainab and josh the second one has hassan even and has saddam and sabbat as we know from seerah was a companion of the prophet sallam from the ansar he was the prophet's poet so he used to say poetry defending islam and the prophet saw sallam and as we know that poetry was the only means of media at the time so he was very influential to the extent that when they kept on saying bad poetry about the prophet allah the prophet brought hassan and told him say poetry condemning the people of quraish and saying you know degrading them and and describing them as bad as they are but in order for you not to harm me and my family go and ask abu bakr because abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was an expert in the lineage of the people of quraish he knew every single family where they came from and who they were married to and who are the ones and so he went to abu bakr and abu bakr told him about the lineage of the prophet and he said poetry that is recorded up till the moment in describing the bad deeds of the people of quraish so hasan even sabbath do you know any other poets of the prophet other than hassan this is general information the prophet susan had three poets hassan amid ibn malik and he's a a great companion of islam of the prophet and we will hear his story insha allah when we come to the battle of tabuk and also one great companion who died at the battle of mutta he was among the three leaders who were killed in this great battle where a few of the muslims were fighting an army of over two hundred thousand romans he is abdullah ibn rawah these are the three poets of the prophet salallahu was one of the people who slandered mother aisha i believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we will be right back it comes to you the truth and the attribute of the one who created you that he's won and alone running this universe that he doesn't become born he doesn't die he doesn't eat and go to the bathroom this is not god there's no problems here yeah it doesn't make sense who was jesus worshiping emphasis recorded in the gospel despite all of the other issues about the gospels we put those aside we just say it's mentioned there jesus worship god who protects us just before the break we mentioned two of the companions of the prophet saw sallam who tripped and made the mistake of slandering mother the wife of the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam and these two were jash the cousin ancestor in law of the prophet and hassan ibn thabit the poet of the prophet the third man was ibn has a strange story muslim was the cousin of abu bakr which made it even worse because he slandered his cousin's daughter and the prophet's wife and he was not a normal man he was among the first to migrate to medina so he's he was a strong believer not only that he even participated in the battle of badr and we all know that allah azza had forgiven the sins of those who participated in badr and he said let them do whatever they want yet mustache made the mistake now when he came to medina abu bakr may allah be pleased with him used to support his cousin and you he used to give him an allowance so that he would live because he was very very poor and when master did what he did and said that about aisha abu bakr stood up and said by allah i will not give him a single penny from now on he's my cousin and he says this about my daughter and i support him i will not support him anymore any longer and after the innocence of aisha was revealed to the prophet allah the almighty also revealed in surat nur that those among you should not stop supporting those who migrate in the side of allah and those who are in need and they should keep on supporting them don't they want allah to forgive their sins and to have mercy on them so the prophet sallam went to abu bakr and told him abu bakr listen to allah listen to what allah has to say and he recited the verse of the quran don't you want allah to forgive you and to have mercy on you and abu bakr immediately said by allah i swear i want allah to have mercy on me and to forgive my sins i declare in front of you o prophet of allah that i'm going to support my cousin and i will continue to give him the allowance and i will never stop it if you look at abu bakr's attitude and what he did it's very strange a relative a close one to your heart hurts you so bad the normal and acceptable thing would be is for you to punish him if you don't want to punish him at least don't support him but abu bakr goes against all odds and continue to support his cousin because allah revealed in the quran that this is one of the means that you gain the forgiveness and the mercy of allah is that action from this attitude from abu be bakr with him is because the influence which he got from the prophet from the prophet's mercy that he the prophet's messi got an effect on by being with him all his life as a very close companion to him or because like something from his own belief well actually it's a combination of both whenever you are accompanied by a righteous person by default you have to take some of his characters and if your belief tells you to follow the quran and sunnah and the quran tells you to have mercy and to forgive then you're definitely going to do this by or your own self so it's obvious that it's a combination of both abu bakr is learning from the prophet and at the same time he is getting it from the quran and following the instructions of the quran now the prophet sallam had these three companions punished for what they had said and this punishment by itself known as the punishment for stealing the punishment for killing the punishment for slandering the punishment for drinking intoxicant or consuming intoxicants the punishment for adultery fornication all of these though these punishments are inflicted in this world they are a relief to the sinners because they erase all the sins and allah's mercy and kindness forbids that two punishments are given to the to to the same sin so whoever commits a sin and is punished for the sin in this life he will not be punished on the day of judgment so that does it mean that the punishment here in this life it executes the sin or redeem the sins which he has done so he is not going to have another punishment yes this is completely true therefore once the punishment has been inflicted on these three companions their records were set straight and alhamdulillah they will start a new page but this teaches us that the companions are human they're not angels they make mistakes and they are among the best of humans as in the prophet's hadith the prophet says all mankind is considered to be sinful and the best among these sinfuls those who repent to allah and they repented and they were punished for what they had done scholars also agree and it's the consensus of scholars that whoever dares and slanders after she was cleared and said to be innocent by allah in the holy quran whoever slanders her is not a muslim this action of his nullifies islam automatically and unfortunately there are sects among us who claim to be muslims who tend to slander her and say that she did this and she did that though the quran tells us that she is innocent and all of this is not true the consensus of scholars whoever slanders her aisha may allah be pleased with her is considered to be a kafir and he had committed an act of blasphemy this event is over alhamdulillah but it helped in elevating people and it was good as mentioned in the quran do not think it to be bad for you no it's good for you because this raised the level and status of isha who was cleared by allah in the holy quran and it also taught the muslims that they should observe their tongues and not to engage or indulge in chit-chatting that would probably throw them in hell as the prophet tells us that a man may talk and say something a word without paying any attention to it this word throws him in hell more than 70 atoms 70 just because of this word that he had said so it's very critical that we observe whatever we say now the prophet was approached by bint al-harif and we know that was the leader of banil mustalak because of their role in giving aid and participating in the battle of ahud so he went there to punish them he killed ten of them their leader fled the area and he got all their belongings and he took all of their land two thousand camels five thousand sheep and more than two hundred families were enslaved among them was the daughter of their leader juarez and she came to the prophet and she was seeking the prophet's help in order for her to free herself and as we know slaves are bought and sold and this is not only in islam in old times with the exception of the past 100 or 150 years i'm talking about since the break of dawn since mankind this slavery is was was on and islam came keeping slavery only to be legitimate through only one channel and that is the channel of of jihad when non-muslims are not allowing islam to be spread and they fight islam and they stand in the face of spreading the tawa they become imprisoned then they become enslaved yet islam comes and tells us that if you do this to expedite your sin you have to you have to free a slave so it's a form of expiation whenever you make a sin you free a slave if you say to your wife that you are like my mother this is called the har then you have to free a slave if you kill someone by mistake you have to pay the blood money and you have to free a slave if you have intercourse with your wife during the day of ramadan and at the same time you are fasting you have to free a slave and so on so islam encourages freeing slaves and this as we know juarya came to the prophet sallam as a slave wanting his help to free herself i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program but inshallah next time we meet we're going to continue talking about may allah be pleased with her until then illa was foreign uh"
