  "title": "Ejaculates while fantasising or watching something haram, does it nullify his fast? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign my question is we know that if a person masturbates while fasting his a fasting is fast probes because of ejaculation right so what if a person have any bad thought or rewards watches something hard on and then he ejaculates unintentionally ejaculates so would that break his fast or not this is an issue of dispute among Scholars whether a person who ejaculates during the daytime of Ramadan without any action just fantasizing so some Scholars say that because he did not act upon it these intrusive thoughts the prophet said that Allah has forgiven my ummah for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that cross their minds as long as they do not act upon it nor speak about it and in in either way the man who's or the person who's fantasizing or thinking of something and then all of a sudden ejaculates if there is such a person he's in big trouble but um if there is such a a person then the scholars say that this does not impact his fasting because he did not do anything action wise so it's like an external emission as if he was asleep but if he's watching Haram and this is an action by itself so this breaks his fasting and Allah knows best then"
