  "transcript": "uh fuad from uh the Emirates he's saying that I would like to know whether it is best for me to give zakat in my country in where I live in the Emirates or to send it to my uh family where there are lots of poor people uh the best is to give it out in your country but if you feel that that is in in the country of residence but if you feel that the people in the Emirates are well off and they don't have so many poor people or needy and in your country there are people who are more needy in this case no problem for you to give it uh out in uh your country providing that this does not exceed your Eid so let's assume that in your country in the Emirates the Eid is on Wednesday for example or or Thursday and in India the Eid is um on Friday so you tell your parents give zakat on my behalf and they give it on Friday your Eid was on Thursday this is not applicable because it has to be on your date on your terms so it has to be given before yourid in your country in the Emirates if it's given out after yourid this is not considered"
