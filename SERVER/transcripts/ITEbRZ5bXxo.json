  "transcript": "fida says did mother aisha exit her when she got her menses at surf how did she exit haram can you explain her hajj as it was out of the norm there is nothing that stated that she exited the haram on the contrary when the prophet entered alihem her tent and found her crying and he said to her this is something normal that allah prescribed upon all daughters of daughters of adam meaning females so do all what a pilgrim does but do not perform tawaf round the kaaba that's it so she stayed in the state of haram and she performed all the rituals other than praying of course and other than offering the tawaf uh in the beginning like the prophet salaam but we know that she offered it after she got pure from her menses"
