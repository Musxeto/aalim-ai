  "transcript": "Menahem hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD Hawara surah Helaman nabina muhammad in Mohali he or sahbihi ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have hadeeth number 62 with us and this blessed book of um little accom the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and who will read it for us yes brother narrated I shall hello Anna the Prophet was whistling loud Salam was never more regular and strict in offering any now a field enter akka sunan of the fajr prayer in another narration i shall raise a low and her reported at last messenger salallahu alaihe salam as saying the two rakahs at dawn are better than this world and what it contains now this hadith is highlighting the sunnah of alpha j the two Rakas that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was very keen in praying more than any other voluntary prayers and he told us about the great reward for those who pray it and he told us about its value to the extent he said that these two rakahs are better than the whole world and what's in it and these are the voluntary prayers of Fechter if this is the status of the voluntary prayers of furture then what is the status of the fire itself that people neglect and ignore now we know that the Prophet erase a lot of salaam always maintained praying these two Rakas not only that there is another authentic hadith by abdul of nor may allah be pleased with him and with his father stating that the prophet ELISA sign when he used to travel he did not pray the sunnah of the war nor of the Maghreb or of Asia but he never ever left or abandoned the Sunnah of Roger and whitter whether he is traveling or residing and this highlights the importance of Sunnah two alphas are these two rakahs and the prophet alayhi salat wa sir prayed them in a very special way and maybe a lot of you don't know that the Sunnah when you pray these two Rakas that you pray them as quick as possible you pray them as fast as possible they are among the fastest players in your life to the extent that mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her said that the Prophet used to pray or in salat wa salam the two Rakas of bodger so fast I would ask myself did he recite Fatiha or not so the scholars say that the Sunnah of fudger that you do not pray it in very slow motion and you take your time and you recite a quick surah no the Prophet Sunnah to pray in the first raka fatiha and choreography rune second record fatiha and to Allah who I had but you don't take your time you read it very quickly part of following the Sunnah I'm not reading it quickly to get it over with well actually I am but it is what the Prophet is to do so I'm following his Sunnah we move on to the chapter that deals with Adam and the prophet alayhi salatu salam highlighted the fact that those who call for the Adhan will come on the day of judgment with the longest next one would say yeah they will come as as giraffe for example no known in Arabic language when we say that he is one with the long neck means that he is the one with pride and with honor and with generosity so they will be identified on the day of judgment to be among those who used to call for the Adhan and the Prophet I saw some highlighted its importance when he said as in the sahih hadith had the people known the reward in the first row and in the call for the Adhan they would fought to get this and they would not find except to draw lots they would draw lots just to know who will call the Adhan nowadays people in the first row you come to the Masjid everybody's sitting behind the Viceroy's empty why I have backache I have to put my back on a pillar I want to sit near the exit I want to do this nobody fights for the first row and then you go to the Masjid it's already has been called for the end of the hall and you find 10 or 20 people in the Masjid Salam aleikum has anyone called for that that no no no ok anybody please call for that well you go you go ahead why I don't know it very well I don't keep it by heart I'm shy I get embarrassed Subhan Allah if American Idol or x-factor calls them to come and participate there will be the first we will write songs we will dance you make that no I'm ashamed I'm embarrassed I don't know subhanAllah why is it when it comes to Islam we're always at the back row and when it comes to dunya and when it comes to following Shaitaan mashallah we're up front we have a problem so the chapter of a van is a very important chapter what is the ruling of the Adhan is it sunnah is it for is it one-zip scholars have different opinions and they say it is formed key fire it is collateral obligation meaning that if some of us do it the others are not sinful but if they all neglect it and don't do it they are all sinful and this is why the prophet Isaiah for attacking a village he would wait until the time for fire if he hears the Athan he knows that there are Muslims and he leaves them and not only that the scholars say that if we are in a Muslim country or in a city that are Muslim and they have mosques and masjids and they call the Adhan and I would like to pray in a prayer is it a must for me to give a that no as long as the people they did a van and we know that the time has entered it's not mandatory for me to give that done what if I'm in a country that there are no Muslims at all then it becomes mandatory for me to give the Adhan so that I would be exempted from the sin of not giving it another question what is more valuable and important to lead the prayer or to give it an whoever says to lead the prayer raise your hands one okay about ten who says that Iran is more important raise your hands one to only and the rest are undecided Allah L melon and I agree I don't know that's good that's good it's an issue of dispute among scholars some say the best role is to lead the prayer why because it is the role of the Prophet that is awesome Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali so Allah would not choose for them except the very best other scholars say no the role of the moai's then is greater than the role of the Imam and why they said because all the hadeeth highlight the importance of the event but we don't have any hadith encouraging people to lead the parade right we don't have any hadith says that whoever leads a prayer Allah would give him so and so because this is a position of leadership and in Islam we are not encouraged to go up front and call for such a position and that is why a lot of the Companions used to go to the Prophet as Salam and would ask for a position in the government like in the hadith of Abu Dharr or a fairy when he went to the Prophet Amman requested him to make him the ruler of a particular area the Prophet took hold of his shoulders and shook him and said a bird are you are we person and being a ruler is an a man it is something to be trusted with but on the day of judgment it is a disgrace and humiliation but if the people say that this guy is definitely worthy and we would like to push him forward then it came without you asking for it then fear Allah and do the best in it so the Adhan is better than leading the prayer and why didn't the Prophet and his companions called for the event simply because they had bigger fish to fry they had more important things to be in the Masjid calling for the other than five times is far less important than judging people and giving the ruling or the verdict between two people who are in dispute and sending armies and expeditions and solving people's problems this is far greater than isolating yourself in the message for the sake of giving then what do we do the add-on for for the five daily prayers we don't do the azan for all eight we don't do the add-on for any other prayer the Iran is strictly for the five daily prayers because it is a form of worship it has to be performed by an individual and what do we mean by an individual it cannot be performed by a cassette some countries you go you enter the Masjid and they have a cassette they turn on the amplifiers and allahu akbar allahu akbar it is recorded this is not permissible it's a form of worship it has to be performed by an individual who's Muslim who is so and so and so and who is present not by a tape recorder we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum and welcome back what is the origin of the event where did it come from is it in the Quran no is it from the Sunnah yes has to be from the sinner it can't be from anywhere else and the origin of the event was that the Prophet Allah so salam was discussing with his companions how to call for prayers so some of them said let's take a bell like the christians and some say let's take a horn like the jews and they did not reach a conclusion so one of the Companions name Abdullah even's 8 went and saw a vision and he saw in his vision that he was going to the market to buy a bell and he saw a man telling him what are you going to do and he told him that I was going to buy a bell to call for the prayer and he said no I'll show you something better and he offered him the iron so when he woke up he went to the Prophet that is so Salam and he told him about the event and the Prophet liked it and drummer came and said by Allah I saw the same dream I'm gonna pop so i've beloved is 8 wanted to give the Adhan to call for it as he is the one who saw it the Prophet erestrum said no give it to belong because he has a nicer voice so Bilal became the more then that we know of course we know that dreams are not a source of religion but in this case it was due to the presence of a prophet Aristotle set up so we don't engage and occupy ourselves with dreams nowadays people are so fascinated with dreams they make it the most important thing in their lives every day I get calls hundreds of calls well this is an exaggeration tens of calls of people saying check I saw that this in that was happening to me I woke up and I dreamt like so-and-so and I keep telling them I do not have the ability to explain dreams or interpret dreams and don't occupy yourself with it if it's a good dream it's a good omen inshallah tell it only to those who are knowledgeable and able to interpret for you if it's a bad dream it's from Shaitaan with three times on your left providing your wife is not on your left and seek Allah's refuge from the Shaitaan three times this is what the Prophet said and do not tell a soul about it because it will not harm you but if you tell people it may harm you so we do not put a lot of emphasis on dreams therefore dreams are not something that we should hold on to and consider it to make it or break it dreams are dreams they might be good omens and they might be from what you tell yourself about or what Shaitaan whispers in your ears and that is why a lot of the times our dreams our interpretation of what we do in our daily lives now what is the ruling on taking bells it is forbidden for Muslims to take bells not doorbell not the bell of your bicycle the Bell that is like a glass with something dangling from it this is the bell of the Christians it is forbidden for Muslims to hang this on their rides or to have them as a toys etc but if it is sort of notification that is hung on camels or on cows or on sheep so that we would identify where they're going and where they're traveling to this is a shala permissible now we have hadith number 63 so I would like someone to read the for us there it is Ana's roseola one bilal was yellow and was ordered to repeat the wordings of dozen for payers twice that is in doubles and to pronounce the wording of the Akama once that is in singles al-bukhari okay now Una's may Allah be pleased with him says that the Prophet are some ordered Bilal to repeat the Adhan in doubles and their karma in singles now first of all we have to agree how many sentences do we have in the pattern of Bilad we have 15 for Allahu Akbar - a shadow la ilaha illallah - a shadow no mohammed ur rasoolallah hi Alice Allah hiya fella Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar la ilaha illallah so these are 15 share why are you repeating it because there are three different forms of Adan and they're all part of the Sunna so this Adan is known as a van of Bilad and this is widely accepted by all Muslims and this is a Deneuve Imam Muhammad ibn Hanbal may Allah have mercy on his soul then we have the Adhan which has been chosen by imam malik he bananas and this has 17 sentences by introducing something that is called at a year at college year which means the petition sort of but instead of having four times Allahu Akbar he is having only two times and how would that be listen the Adhan with the turkey is like this according to Malik Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar and then he says silently but repeating it a shadow Allah in a high number a shadow and Allah high number a shadow anna muhammadan rasul ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul allah and then he announces it ash-hadu anla ilaha illa-llah a shadow Allah Allah Allah Allah ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul allah till the end of the attack so these are how many seventeen we took two of Allahu Akbar and added for eye shadow Allah Allah I shall Sola the add-on of an imam shafi'i is composed of 19 sentences so it is exactly like Allah Muhammad which is there than of Bilal but you add to that what is known as a toad year and by the way this is originally referred to a boom Laura and who is abou Medora Abu McClure ax is one of the companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam who used to give the Adhan in Mecca Omaha Laura the story is very funny when the Prophet Alice of Salaam conquered Mecca on the 8th of Hydra so as he was going out there were children boys youngsters who were not much because Macao is conquered so they were making fun of the Adhan and one of them was well my guru so he's making me fun making fun not calling for that and the Prophet heard this is awesome he asked his companions to gather them all then he gathered them all of course the boys were terrified so he asked each one of them to give that a done until he heard the voice of amadora he knew that this is the voice he wanted to hear and he rubbed his chest in his forehead and prayed for him supplicated for him and he says that Subhan Allah I was guided to Islam and he accepted Islam and he became the more a vein of people of Mecca because of his beautiful voice his van was exactly like a bubala but with the 3rd year so 15 plus 4 Allah Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar then a shadow and laila angle ma a shadow and ila Allah ashhadu anna muhammadan rasulullah ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul allah and then announces it loudly a shadow a la ilaha illallah this is done on the microphone by the way so if you're next to the message you can hear the third year being very lightly done but you can hear it and it is soon to have all these so don't restrict yourself only to billa's Adan and the other eunuch but a word of advice never go and try this home alone in the sense that don't go to your message in the neighborhood who don't know about this and you give this event what will they do to you they will attack you you're inventing in the Dean you're a kafir your soul so yeah it is a Sunnah I don't know maggara so never ever attempt to do something in accordance to the Sunnah the first thing you do is you teach them if they accept okay we volunteer and do it and one of the biggest mistakes of youngsters who come and assume the position of an imam or the position of a teacher when they come to their congregation immediately they choose the odd things that the people don't know what are you doing this is a Sunnah I'm teaching them yeah you don't teach them by making them hate you first of all pray as they know how you pray afterwards give them lesson after lesson lecture after lecture of the Sunnah of how to comply with it how to follow it and give them the different IDs the different narrations algerie says a Muslim says relate the people to the Quran to the pseudonym once they know that this is part of the Sunnah you then implement it for example you come to a Masjid and this message it has been for the past ten years reciting in surah Hajj a very short is very short I from JUSA Amma and you assumed the position of the Imam - you go and masha'Allah - barik alaa the first Juma the first Friday I will make the sooner I will read Alif Lam Meem Ishida in the first raka and the second raka I will read Hallet I release any enemy enemy who shame at Quora approximately five pages in Fechter the Prophet Sunnah every single Friday to my knowledge no way that he recited anything else - reciting five pages in Fajar - people who for the past ten years they used to pray a half a page half a page what do you expect after the prayer they will do the least they will not give Salam to you once they start to learn and to accept you and to love you then you implement the Sunnah as you have learned it do we have any questions yes actually  you mentioned the only five are then isn't it true that in the harem Mozilla harem there is an add-on for Tahajjud as well Iran for Tahajjud no there isn't there isn't any an effort 200 we have to advance forfeiture the first event in a second again and this we will come to talk about but this is for the budget so it is not again other than the five prayers I know that you have a lot of questions rather you write them down because we ran out of time so until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
