  "transcript": "a brother says I'm studying in the West and one of the biggest challenges is the Zener of the eyes wallahi i tried lowering gaze but mostly to no avail so is there any solution for me to increase my taqwa and Eman so that I can lower my gaze ah hey this is a problem that is taking place everywhere see Allah created us to be tested already Hanukkah moto Al Hayat ax Lia blue Akuma hey you come a senora man Allah has created death and life for you to be tested which among you is best in deeds so life is a test and part of your test is where you find it hardest there are people who find no problem in lowering their gaze so their test is not in that the test is something else maybe in refraining from taking what is not theirs from consuming Haram money to you if I tell you give me a thousand euros and I will return them a hundred thousand tomorrow as RIBA you said our Allah I will never ever dream of consuming one single euro of RIBA you're crazy but if I tell you to lower your gaze you say oh this is the most difficult thing in life so Allah tests every person every individual according what to what is most difficult for him for you this is a difficult task and this is how Shaitaan works Satan is not in a rush he's willing to wait a month a year he's willing to wait five years until you are marinated and ready to be served so he takes you bit by bit and fighting your Islamic beliefs that calls you to lower your gaze so you lower them nine out of ten few weeks later eight out of ten few months later three out of ten next year you don't lower your gaze at all and you justify this by saying I'm not being affected by anything this is normal everybody's looking no one is raping anyone or jumping on other women and this is what Shaitaan is doing step by step then he takes you further to communicating to socializing to cracking jokes to leaving an impression on the office gender then maybe shaking hands touching maybe going for dinner going for a cup of coffee dating and then you know what happens my place or yours this is how Shaitaan works so okay if you want to sell save yourself if you want to protect yourself you have to maintain the borders that the palazzo gel told you not to cross keep a red line that you can never cross and always lower your gaze because this is for your own protection increase your Eman by increasing the amount of the Koran you recite every day listening to Islamic lectures attending Islamic lect lectures and this is very important because the more you are with the Muslim community the stronger you are and this is why in the West they're trying to reduce Islamic circles lectures they prevent scholars and dyes from coming to the country because they can see the result but alhamdulillah we have YouTube alhamdulillah we have websites that you can be with the share in his lecture in his conference in his convention as if you're there physically so you have to in is the coda of watching such programs and also you have to build your own circle you must surround yourself 24 hours 7 days a week with righteous practicing brothers who are knowledgeable you hang out with you go play sports whether you go to the gym wave you just sit and socialize with as much as possible per day you will learn from their moral effects from their behaviors from their adapt you'll learn from their knowledge of Quran listen because every word they speak there's benefit in it for you and this increases your imminent taqwa so when you are among people who most of the day when they want to thank you the sages Alcala Hawaiian jazakallahu khayran jazakallahu khayran a couple of days down the line you yourself going to end up saying use a comma and whoever anyone who does you a favor because you tend to catch up as sins are contagious likewise good deeds are contagious so if you hang up out with people who use the F word or the S word or the whatever word you want inevitably gonna use this all the time but if you hang out with people who say alhamdulillah Subhan Allah Allah Allah and they called verses of the Quran hadith of the Prophet Ostrom you didn't ever to really be part of that and inshallah this would save you from what you fear most"
