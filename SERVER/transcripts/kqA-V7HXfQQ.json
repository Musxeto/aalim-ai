  "transcript": "brother rosh from india says that his sister is not very happy with her in-laws because they have customs and they for example force her to celebrate the aids with her and not with her parents etc and her husband is a little bit uh easy going and he is always with in this at the side of his parents and family so she doesn't know what to do first of all this is prevailing in the subcontinent unfortunately india bangladesh pakistan they have this concept of joint family which i had spoken about so many times and i don't think that it is wise to repeat it if someone is proposing make it as a condition that i would not live with your family you have to give me in islam as a woman she is entitled for a separate accommodation this is her right in islam i don't care about other religions you're a muslim she's a muslim if you say that this is the hindu practice this is the culture that this is up to you her right in islam to have a separate home she is not obliged to serve your parents to see them or to obey them second of all if this is too late now you're married and you have children and you live with your in-laws if you ask from your husband he's he doesn't fear allah azza he's not a righteous person and he would probably tell you either this or i divorce you what to do you have to try to balance things and utilize it to the best of your ability this is your life either divorce or continue in this marriage with all its shortcomings after all it's better than being divorced most of the time sometimes it's not sometimes divorced divorcing him is a better option for your religion for your uh sanity for many other reasons but this is not something that we endorse or call people to do shaytan would love a spou a couple to separate this is the best thing in the world in his book so what i say is that you have to judge things weigh them properly and always be aware of the consequences of any of your actions be diplomatic with your husband acknowledge that you're not obliged to obey your parents-in-law they have no rights on you they cannot order you or restrict your movement the one who can do that is your husband so be kind with him try to be diplomatic try to win him over so that whenever you want to go to your parents house or to spend the eid with them or to do whatever you want you go through him not through them and may allah make it easy"
