  "transcript": "foreign charity the benefit of Charity which we all believe I have one question if someone wants to keep a charity maybe keep it like some amount on the monthly basis or a weekly basis do you think is it okay this is this is up to your preference if a person reaches to his pocket and gives money to the poor that's good for you if he decides to do that on daily basis like some of the salaf used to do the one who narrated The Hadith of the Prophet Allah where he said an individual would be under the shade of his charity on the day of judgment so one of those um narrators or those who reported this Hadith used to give every single day part of whatever he has even if it's an onion or a piece of cake or a piece of bread depending on this Hadith that he would be on the shade of his charity someone says no I'd like to do it once a week someone says no I'm gonna take a percentage of my monthly salary I know one of my relatives may Allah have mercy on his soul who used to take 25 percent of his salary every month to give it in charity it's fixed and it's between him and Allah nobody knows about this except those who were close to him so such a person does this for the sake of Allah there is no obligation upon him no one is forcing him he's not doing it as a vow this is what's not recommended or permissible um to do as a vow oh Allah on me if you do this for me if you cure my ill patient or if you make me pass the exam I'll give you 10 percent of my weekly allowance this is what's not recommended and that which the prophet saws told us not to do but to voluntary without vowing making a vow without obliging yourself in yourself you just say okay every week I have to do this thing like it was reported that even Tamia may Allah have mercy on his soul used to give money every Friday before he goes to the khutbah of Friday and this is something of his own he just loved to do this and when was asked he said Allah stated in the Quran Allah says o you who believe whenever you want to have a talk that is secretive between you and the prophet Allah you have to in advance give charity this verse was revealed when all the companions used to overwhelm the prophet Islam with questions so this was a bit tiring for him he was overwhelmed by it so Allah revealed this Ayah and when this Ayah was revealed the companions refrained from asking the prophet Islam questions because this meant money said I was the only one who actually executed and implemented desire when I took one of my rings and I gave it in charity and I spoke to the prophet Islam in private then this Ayah was abrogated and now everybody could speak back to the prophet Islam but they've learned their lesson so this is his understanding he never said that it's part of the Deen he just saw a beautiful hint in this Ayah that whenever you want to speak to the prophet give charity now I'm going to speak to Allah in a Friday sermon so I'd like to in advance give charity maybe Allah would reward me for that greater than anything else this is his understanding would it be a bitter this is on his own it's a voluntary thing it's like doing vicar on a particular pattern without thinking that this is getting you closer to Allah or this is from the Sunnah without spreading it to the people like we find booklets of Dua and none of it is in the Quran or in the Sunnah but they say that we've tried it as good no this is not recommended or permissible because people would think that this is from the Sunnah and they will copy it and do it this is different when you do something for your own or of your own like you specifically designate a particular Dua in your prayers in the first raka and second raka third raka because you love it you like it and you enjoy it and you never tell people that do this it's good for you it's it's part of this and part of that on the contrary you're doing it for the sake of Allah so therefore it is not a problem for you Heidi to designate a particular date in the month or in the week or every day with a portion of your charity without thinking that oh doing it at five o'clock P.M has great value like some people think no I'm just enjoy doing it uh this and it's for my own sake I'm not telling anybody about it there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
