  "transcript": "the center has one more question it's a bit technical for you check but it's it's to do with the wireless technology the internet she said that nowadays it's everywhere you you pick up a wireless internet connection she says sometimes i pick one up on my my laptop and it doesn't have no security so i can use it she says is this using allowed am i and i feel a bit uneasy am i stealing this connection from them is this allowed first of all any person who has a wireless connection usually if he does not want anyone to join him or interfere with his connection he would put a password so if he if it's unsecured and if it's there's no security on it and it's open this means that a person wants you to go in and join in but if you feel that you know the person and he's your neighbor and he doesn't know how to set a password i believe that getting this access is okay but do not do any downloads because this what consumes money from his account surfing the web doesn't cost him anything but if you download from his account without him knowing and without him allowing you to do so i believe that this is not acceptable"
