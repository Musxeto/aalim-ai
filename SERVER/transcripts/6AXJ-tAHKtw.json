  "title": "Prayer Sensor to alert how many Rakath",
  "transcript": "from my region created a Muslim sensor carpet which is supposed to help Muslims during prayer it will count the number of raak and will vibrate if you make a mistake also I read on a Russian Islamic group about an application for phones which is called raaka counter which will do the same thing is this permissible it as it is no it's not permissible this is B to have something like that count over your prayer and notify notifies You by vibration or by a ringtone or by an SMS this is all an innovation this is uncalled for and therefore one should not do uh anything uh as such however I may be inclined to say that this is permissible only for those who have severe um state of OCD obsessive compulsive disorder those who are severely affected in the sense that every single prayer they're completely lost they don't know what's happening and they lose count in this case for such people I hope that this would uh uh become permissible and Allah knows best we have Rana from"
