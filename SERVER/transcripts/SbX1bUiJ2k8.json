  "title": "Is it ok 2 make sajdah after Fajr prayer (Sujood Shukr Prostration of thankfulness) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a question um my question is that uh is it permissible after the fajr salah to make sajdah this is something that has recently appeared in our masjids where people after fajr prayer and after making their car just before they leave they simply fall down and prostrate prolong their prostration and then stand up and leave and when you ask him what is this they say we're so grateful to allah we wanted to express our gratitude to allah so we're offering this sajdah this is totally haram prohibited and this is an innovation because neither the prophet islam had ever done such a thing whether after fajr prayer or any other prayer nor the companions no that happened he know that having a taboo so it's not logical that you know more than them one says or argues that the prophet offered allah prostration of gratitude and we would say how many times and you said um i don't know maybe once or twice this indicates that such prostration of gratitude is done only when there is a necessity to it that calls for it so i always give the example every month when you get your paycheck you don't offer this prostration of gratitude every now and then when your wife manages to cook a good meal you don't offer such uh well sometimes yeah okay you don't why because this is happening regularly but something that is not regular if someone says alhamdulillah the muslims in palestine managed to free their land or to beat the uh occupying enemy of israel alhamdulillah we make prostration if someone says your uncle who was undergoing a serious major surgery alhamdulillah made it i make a prostration but not doing it every day or every now and then over such a thing that would be considered an a total innovation"
