  "transcript": "um I I wanted to ask uh uh this has a lot of it's a it's a very long context but I I just the main question is um I got uh uh I got pressured into a marriage oh about a year ago and uh there have been a lot of issues and some local shes in my area said that I have multiple grounds for H but uh none of them have granted me the Kaa yet and and my husband uh rejects it so uh what should I do if you don't have the ability to get from your husband due to the fact that the Islamic centers are too scared of the legal implication uh to do so in your country then you have to file for divorce legally and once you get divorced legally and there's no marriage according to the uh law then you can approach any Islamic Center with these papers of divorce and they will give you on the spot whether your husband likes it or not and Allah Knows Best"
