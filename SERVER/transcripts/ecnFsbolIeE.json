  "transcript": "mamd [Music] for for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] mam [Music] is the month of Dua and our Prophet Sall wasam told us that there is nothing more honorable to Allah than Dua than invocation and the prophet himself sallallah alaihi wasallam was given the concise of speech and he used to make a lot of Dua and over the 23 years of his life as a messenger and a prophet of Allah s alaih wasam there are only only few of his Dua yet they are full of meaning unlike what we usually do and say when we ask Allah we make a very long list due to our ignorance due to the fact that we are not certain that Allah knows what we want so we list every single thing and this is not the the Sunnah of the Prophet who used to make a general Dua having full full trust in Allah to fulfill his wishes today we will study one single Hadith where the Prophet used to frequently ask Allah so this is a recommendation for us to do what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to do to ask Allah what the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam used to ask it is easy to learn it is easy to memorize and it's best if we memorize it in Arabic the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam used to frequently ask as Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him said and the Hadith is inah Muslim so it is the highest grade of authenticity the prophet used to say Allah four things as easy as they come but let us break these four words in what whatever is time allocated for this first of all the Hadith translates to oh Allah I ask you I beg you for guidance for piety or righteousness for Chastity and for wealth or to be self-sufficient so guidance how important is guidance in our lives it is so important that it is the core of the fa when you praise Allah when you glorify him what is the conclusion you are seeking Allah's guidance 17 times minimum per day and night in every single ra you ask Allah for guidance and this is what the Muslims do every night in specifically and in night prayer in general when they say you seek Allah's guidance and Allah the almighty in theith says oh my servants all of you are astray you're going in the wrong direction except those whom I guide so ask me for guidance and I shall guide you so Allah is ordering us to seek his guidance compared to what people nowadays do they don't do that on the contrary if you say to someone Allah may Allah guide you he gets angry do you think I'm crazy do you think I'm misguided why do you say this to me any normal Muslim would say a mean may Allah guide us all and guidance is required in everything we do you require guidance in your work you require guidance in how you treat your wife your spouse your children your colleagues because without Allah's guidance you're misguided and you do the wrong things and you make the wrong decisions and guidance is divided into two types one type every single one of us is able to guide others to and this is directing them to the right direction Allah praised The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam by saying verily you guide to the straight path but this is guidance that is limited it's only directing the way as they say you can lead a horse to water everyone can lead a horse to water but you cannot force the horse to drink and this is the most honorable and favored type of guidance which is only is in the hand of Allah to make you believe to make you implement what you know this is only in the guidance of Allah and this is why Allah Asel told his Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he he was saddened by the death of his uncle Abu Talib without accepting Islam you verely do not guide Those whom you love but Allah just said that you guide to a straight path you guide in directing people but you cannot make them or force them Embrace what you guide them for this is only in Allah's hand subhanahu wa ta'ala to guide us to the straight path and and to embrace it and this explains why we see a lot of the Muslims why we see a lot of the Arabs who are born Muslims from Muslim fathers and grandfathers failing to abide by Islam because it's a cultural thing but while those who revert to Islam who accept Islam they abide by it more stronger and more strongly than the originally born Muslim a lot of the Muslims unfortunately face and complain of hard Hearts they find this stiffness in their Iman they lack the ability to attain in their Salat they can barely cry when they recite the verses of the Quran and why is that this is because Allah did not guide them yet may Allah guide us all why didn't Allah asael guide them yet because of their sins because of their Indulgence in whatever angers Allah and this is why Allah described the Jews in the Quran by saying so because of their breach of their Covenant we cursed them and made their hearts grow hard because of their breach of their covenants Allah made their hearts grow hard and stiff and because the sins we commit day and night especially when there's no one watching us except Allah if people are watching us we would not be sinful but we only sin when we close our doors and there's no one with us in the room and this is why Allah stiffens and hardens our heart how many of the Muslims do not pray jum altogether the most important prayer in the week the prophet saidat wasam whoever abandons three J in a row out of negligence will have a seal placed upon his heart how many of us hear the preaching hear a sermon every single jum and it doesn't change a thing in their lifestyle in my Masjid I so often come out of the jum sermon and I find people outside smoking speaking to each other mallah the sermon was very effective was very emotional and this does not stop them from going home watching a movie listening to music cheating lying dealing in ribba ETC all of this because Allah has sealed their hearts due to their ignorance and negligence Allah says in the Quran and we shall turn their hearts and their eyes away from guidance as they refuse to believe therein for the first time guidance is very important and this is what the prophet says one word but look to these words who were G who were given to or which were given to the man who was given the concise of speech s alai wasam it is without doubt that we need the guidance of Allah however guidance by itself is a theoretical thing it is not only the knowledge of Halal and Haram because everyone of us know the Halal and Haram we all know what is halal and we all know what is Haram and some of us even has the ability to give the evidences backing it up however guidance as a theoretical thing is required and if you get it you must implement it to be guided because there are Jews and Christians who know the Quran better than some of the Muslims there are rabbis among the Jew Jewish community who know the AY and who don't know theith andari Subhan Allah but they're disbelievers they're not Muslim so can we say that they're guided no they're misguided because they did not Implement and once you're guided and you make this into action you reach the second word Allah you reach the level of piety of righteousness because now you are walking the talk and by this we mean that you are implementing the guidance of Allah in your actions so what is tawa tawa is fearing Allah is keeping a barrier between you and hellfire is doing what Allah instructed you to do and staying away from what Allah has forbidden you to do this is tawa as simple as that so you don't have to be a nuclear physicist if you abide by what Allah has instructed you you're part of the mut and you're part of the righteous and the pious even if you're illiterate even if you don't know languages even if you don't know how to write your name at the S side of Allah you're the most honored person with him subhanahu wa'ta'ala and this is why knowledge itself is not sufficient the Hypocrites come to the prophet and say we believe that you are the messenger of Allah and Allah falsifies their belief by saying that they are liars so you have to implement this and this is what Allah ordered the whole of humanity Allah says subhah wa tala and verily we have recommended to the people of the scriptures before you and to you oh Muslims that you all fear Allah the most frequently repeated word in prophet's sermon sallallahu alaih wasallam and in the Quran as well and this is the advice the prophet Gave To His companion sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he sought his advice oh prophet of Allah advise me the prophet says fear Allah wherever you are whether you are in your locality or you travel abroad fear Allah and as a subproduct it is part of piety it is part of tawa whoever fears Allah there's a subcategory that comes underneath and that is Allah would Grant you Chastity and Chastity is part of piety so why segregate it because it is very crucial and dangerous you might be a Pious person when it comes to finance you might be a Pious person when it comes with dealing people and moral conduct but when it comes to the hidden desires or to the public desires people fall weak and vulnerable and that is why you have to see this as a fruit of your piety that it produces chastity Allah Asel the almighty says and come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse verily it is a and an evil way any sexual intercourse that is not legitimate it is a it is something of a major evil way so when you ask Allah specifically to Grant you Chastity you're asking him to guide you and you're asking him to help you to avoid all types of fornication whether minor or major and this includes not sending your gaze away and this is a big fitna we have the FNA of Z of looking to Haram things through our TV sets through our computer screens and through our mobiles it follows you it stalks you even when you are in the Masjid when you open an email when you open a WhatsApp message it comes to you nudity pornography so you need Allah's help because without Allah's help you are vulnerable you are weak and you're bound to fall into sin you need Allah to protect you from Zena of listening music everywhere you go into a mall you go into a shop you go into a restaurant people are playing music music and you see brothers who are practicing not saying a single word this is your money if you go in tell them either turn it off I'm or I'm leaving but do not sit where M and evil acts are being done and you do not say a thing a single thing and you seek Allah's Refuge by asking him to pray protect you from the major sin which is fornication which is what would eventually happen to a Muslim to a person who sends his gaze freely who listens to Haram freely who free mixes who touches without any boundaries to the opposite gender this is inevitable to happen it may take a while it may take longer Shan is not in a hurry he will prepare you and he will take good care of you until you fall into this major send me Allah Asel protect us and protect our children from all major and minor sin I see I say what you hear and I seek Allah Asel forgiveness for me and for you so ask Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to forgive us all alhamdulillah the fourth request the fourth word that the prophet asked Allah for is and the Arabs know that g usually means wealth money financing however if you look at the S of the Prophet Alat wasam you would find it contrary to this he never pursued any worldly gains if you were in the shoes of the Prophet Alat wasam literally you would have a number of shoes a number of dresses a number of uh uh rck rides a number of houses but the the prophet never had this he would finish the Salat in a fast fashion and leave to the extent that the companions thought that there was something wrong and dangerous that took place and then he comes back and says to them that I remembered in Salat that I had few Dirhams of gold under the bed that came so I did not want to spend the night with it in my possession so I rushed out and gave it in charity what kind of a leader was he what kind of a ruler was he sallallah alaih wasallam was he in pursuit of D he was never in pursuit of D however how does he ask Allah for wealth for well the scholars say has two meanings and this is explain by the other hadiths of the Prophet this is how a student of knowledge understand the verses of the Quran and the beautiful words and and teachings of the Prophet Alam through through understanding the Quran itself holistically and also searching for other meanings that coincide with all through the Hadith of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam it was the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam who used to invoke Allah by saying oh Allah make the provision of the family of Muhammad sallallah alaih wasallam no more than sufficient so he's asking Allah not to open the Dunya for his families not to grant them more than what they need he only wants the bare minimum and this shows you that the prophet did not intend wealth and money when he said Al Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said richness richness this is richness is does not mean having a lot rather richness is contentment so this is what the prophet is asking Allah for the real true meaning of richness which is contentment whomever Allah make him content with what he had given him W he is the wealthiest person on Earth I know millionaires who have everything that each and every one of us wish to have 1% of and they're never content there is a millionaire who has a jet plane and he's never content for his travels he said I know a friend who has a tri 7 it's three times bigger than my air airplane and the one who has a trip 7 is envious of that who has a whole Fleet and can travel whenever he wants and whever he wants Subhan Allah no one is satisfied with what Allah gives him makes that person the most miserable person on Earth and even if you don't have anything except what carries you throughout the day you have only little food that carries you throughout the night tomorrow you don't have food for tomorrow if you content wall you are the wealthiest person on Earth and you are the happiest person on Earth this is a glimpse of the Dua of the Prophet Alat if you want Allah to be pleased with you make Dua and if you want a to anger Allah do not make Dua the prophet says whoever does not make Dua to Allah Allah is angry with him ill Allah instructs you to ask him so that he can give you and he would be pleased by that and if you do not ask Allah asael he would punish you in hell for not asking him so do we ask Allah asael seriously do we ask Allah and invoke him with humility while displaying and portraying our poverty do we ask Allah Asel for every single thing in our lives or do we ignore Allah subhanahu wa taala we should fear Allah the almighty and we should supplicate we should invoke we should make Dua in this blessed month of Ramadan ask Allah as much as you can to whatever you want specifically at the preferred times of answering this is when you are in suud whether NE or F Salah ask him as much as you want and as much as you can before giving Salam from the Salat after the T and before concluding the Salah this is a time of answering in the last third of the night just before fa prayer an hour or two raise your hands supplicate to Allah Praise Him offer salutation to the prophet Alam and seek his guidance when it is time forar just before you break your fast with the piece of date invoke Allah oh Allah guide my children oh Allah make me the best of spouses to my spouse oh Allah cleanse my heart from hatred Envy from bad feelings invoke Allah and and by Allah you will find Allah Asel answering your prayers I'm going to conclude my sermon with invocations it will be in Arabic and uh I pray to Allah Asel that he accepts what we have said and to make all of this sincerely for his face Allah Allah [Music] m"
