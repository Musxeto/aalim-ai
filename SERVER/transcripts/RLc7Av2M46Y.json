  "title": "How to make wudu What things invalidate it? I take long time in wudu & make mistakes Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is I take a lot of time doing and I get confused because I keep on making some mistakes and I think to myself oh this is a mistake this invalidates the woo so I wanted to ask what some things that can invalidate the woodoo in a nutshell so that I will compare what I think and what is the truth okay W has six pillars and if you miss these six pillars one of them your wo is invalid so these six pillars are to wash your face to wash your arms to the elbows to wipe over your head and ears to wash your feet to the ankles including the ankles to have this in that particular order the face arms head and F feet and to be back to back simultaneously without leaving a gap plus not to make anything that invalidates woodo such as passing wind um sleeping eating camels meat Etc other than that such a mistake you may have done it can be rectified on the spot usually such a mistake would be after I washed my arms and while I was doing my wiping my head I noticed that this area was not washed oh this is a mistake I have to redo the woodoo again no you don't you just simply wash that area and continue afterwards that is wash wipe your head and ears and wash your feet so you have to learn the sequence of the woodo and that would solve your problem inshallah"
