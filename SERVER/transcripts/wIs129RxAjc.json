  "transcript": "rayan says how should we clean ourselves if maddie and many are discharged now many is semen and this is discharged in a gushing form so it's ejaculated it can happen while a person is asleep and it's called nocturnal emission a person wakes and finds stains in large quantities of semen and this requires a person to take a russell or a total bath to uplift the major ritual impurity that was caused of the emission of many of semen and it can happen when a person is awake either through masturbation or through seeing something that excites them and makes them ejaculate or other reasons semen as a substance according to the most authentic opinion of scholars is pure so it is not nudges so the existence of a drop or more of semen on your clothes on your mattress on your bed sheet does not render it impure the emission of semen renders you in a major ritual impurity that requires also maddy on the other hand comes when someone's is sexually aroused so it comes but it does not come out in a gushing format it's not ejaculated it's just discharged it breaks your wudu which means that once it's discharged you have to perform and it is also [Music] it's impure which means that you have to wash it off your body and whatever it came in contact with and washing it off is done by sprinkling water on it there is no necessity of pouring water and rubbing it and pouring it and squeezing it like normal impurity so if i have a drop of urine on my sleeve i have to pour water squeeze it and pour it again then there's no drop kalas it's clean but if i have a drop of melody all what i have to do is bring a handful of water and just sprinkle over it and that's it so its impurity is the least normal impurities like urine defecation menstrual blood is normal then we have the extreme uh impurity which is what a dog has licked when it comes to utensils your glass your cup your plate your pot this has to be washed seven times with water and once with soil so this is the highest level of impurity when it comes to washing off utensils so this is how it should be washed uh it's noteworthy that there's a difference of opinion among scholars whether when matthew is discharged one must only wash his private part for a male organ a penis or he must add to that washing his testicles and i'm also think authentic opinion is that both must be washed as per the hadith of the prophet alaihis allah to wasallam"
