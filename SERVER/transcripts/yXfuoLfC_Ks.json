  "transcript": "uh i would like to know that um since at the end of a woman's menses uh like before ever the end of time for every player we are supposed to check so uh how much time like uh like would 15 minutes before the end of each prayer be enough like to check whether we are pure or not or like should it be less or more there isn't any period given or prescribed in islam so we are not told in the quran or in the sunnah you should go 15 minutes maybe 10 minutes maybe half an hour maybe one minute we don't have this this is something that women know by nature by habit by their environment and they should do this accordingly so don't exaggerate things and saying no oh i'm one minute late no it depends some women don't check unless they go and answer the call of nature and some women when they really see that there is almost no discharge colored discharge that this is almost their purity time they would go before the end of the prayer time by 10 15 20 minutes enough time for them to have a hustle and to pray before the end of time so there isn't any specific uh prescribed timing for that and allah knows best you"
