  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] ahem of salat wa salam ala rasulillah Kareem and hamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we're discussing the issue of child rearing its beauties is virtues as well as this trials and tribulations with the intention of returning our fears back to the Quran and the Sunnah of our prophet Mohamed Salah asylum as we know the best of us are those who ascribe and those who follow the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad SAW I said I'm in all of our affairs so to help us with this endeavor which we were talking about today the reasons for which children go astray we have shaken asked him look man and Hakim who is a teacher at that Academy and KIU and has been an email and a teacher for over 30 years bismillah ma'sha'allah we would like to welcome our guest gossamer salam aliekum wa rahamtullah waalaikumsalam what Allah Allah catch oh thank you as always for joining us you gotta butter caliphs equals lol nom so we took our last episode discussing causes for which children go astray and we talked into depth about the environment but there are also another portion of the environment which is crucial as they say the eyes are the windows to the soul one soul to one's behaviorist everything you see has an effect on your profound impact on the way you think on the way you see the world so how does the media play a role in terms of the T things that children watch on TV now YouTube video games they play how does that affect their psychology and then affect their behavior Minerva Heymann hamdu lillah wa salatu was-salam ala rasoolillah what early was I happy Oh many today we had a Western Division that Hideo media Murat the media has a great impact in the life of people in general and Muslims in particular at the time of the Prophet I saw some people say we did not have any media and this is not entirely true because the media at the time of the Prophet Elisha Salaam and the Arabs where was based on poetry prose literature and to the extent that the prophet alayhi salatu salam made has an even fab it his poet and the prophet had three poets salah lorrison him he had Hasani meth habit cab even pneumatic and abdullah abdullah ha may allah be pleased with them all has seramins habit he used to instruct him to say his poems in the masjid because it was harder and more painful upon the idol worshippers then throwing them with arrows this meant that the media had a great role at the time of the Prophet Elisha a lot of cinnamon likewise nowadays we can see in the banana republics when they have a revolution or when they have a coup or overthrow a government what is the first thing they do they take hold of the Ministry of Information TV and radio because this channels whatever they want to say to the people the worst thing of media and not our media or media is okay and there's no problem in that it's halal its Islamic it's good the worst thing of thing in media is that there is no reciprocation it's a one side channel so you just sit there and listen and watch and you become like a sponge you absorb whatever they give to you whether it's sewer well water or pure clean water unfortunately now the children spend a lot of their time in their homes when they're growing up and if the children were not blessed with righteous knowledgeable and practicing parents the tendency and this is generally what happens is that the mother doesn't want to speak doesn't want to put some effort doesn't want to prioritize children she has chores to do cooking cleaning checking her whatsapp Facebook Instagram so she has a lot on her plate yet the children are the at the bottom of the priority list so when a child comes instead of listening and assisting she says go and watch the TV go and play with your video games and this is devastating us now when you go to cartoons which usually the children grow up watching I've watched a lot of cartoons to analyze and I tell you it is devastating it is harmful it destroys the a deed the personality and even touches on the chastity of the children themselves even the new Disney Productions you would have something related to homosexuality LGBTQ empowerment of women all of this goes against Islam when someone told me I didn't watch it hamed Allah yet frozen one frozen - this is one of the blockbusters frozen - I was told that there is homosexuality in it now this is a Disney production this is cartoons for children and when children grow up watching these things what would be the result definitely not Quran and Sunnah not only that video games we see what's happening in the States shootings in colleges in high schools in Walmart in shopping centers and it's discriminate shooting the one that had took place a couple of years ago in Las Vegas where they killed like 70 it's 80s something that's huge what is this how is this triggered what causes this hamdullah there is nothing Islamic about it so they can't say it's a Muslim terrorist or a terrorist organization or this or that no this is what from within yes they can say they were right-wing new Nazis they can whatever they want to say but what's happening in schools is not cold for so who's doing this if you trace it back to their homes you'll see that violence is the answer to all their problems you see that they are praising the amendment that protects gun equity not acquisition possessing your firearms and you will find that the contemporary videogames promote violence this what they call pop g pu BG and fortnight and these are can be used innocently as innocent games but it can promote violence and when children play and grow up on blowing up things killing people seeing blood I remember about 23 maybe even more 25 years ago 30 years ago someone introduced me to a game called doom where you go and shoot shoot demons and monsters one of my brother played it and in ten minutes his nose started bleeding I whenever I played it I used to go and throw up because of the tension not because my stomach was upset no I can tolerate such scenery but the tension you know killing and going and subhanAllah I stopped playing any type of video games since then because it's a waste of time it's a waste of energy and there's no benefit now children I know some of my relatives even spent literally 12 hours behind this king 12 hours a day sitting having his headset speaking to people do this kill this don't know what is behind the door okay this might be fun but we need psychiatrist we need doctors and professionals to tell us the impact negative or positive of such games without any doubt what you see on the TV screens impact your life the children grow up watching cartoons what about when they are like 12 13 years of age they want something higher so they want watch a Hannah Montana and we know what Hannah Montana is and who is she is Miley Cyrus and and and the rest of the gang they start to learn obscenity nudity bad words and they want to look like them act like them then they go to their mid-teens or late teens they want to watch movies and movies are rated PG parental guidance suggested or rated R so they want more violence they want more nudity more sex what do you think would come out of such a generation do you think they will go to school to to the message five times a day do you think they'll memorize the Quran do you think that they will be good practicing Muslims or they want to be like their role models doing smoking pot going to the prom dancing singing putting their headphones and listening to rap music looking like them acting like them this is one of the greatest negative effect of the media which we ourselves are guilty as charged of presenting it to our children not only that I know households where they put a TV screen and a satellite receiver and room and chamber of the child and we have not talked about the internet yet this is just normal Muslim family it is normal TV what's wrong with the TV what's wrong with playing video games and the father and the mother don't have an iota of what's going on they just want to get their children off their chest they don't want to listen to them they don't want to hear anything about them as long as they eat drink and wear new clothes they're okay this is a extensive topic as you said we haven't even talked about the Internet yeah which is as far as the TV at least parents have a somewhat roundabout idea how to cancel this show out to block this but the internet you can't keep up with a ten-year-old on the iPad or on the iPhone he'll run circles around you before you can even figure out what's happening so we're gonna pause here for a short break and shout out to Anna when we come back we're going to talk about the effects of the broader environments far as the community and the the nation-state at large as well Charlotte Rada viewers stay tuned we'll be right back with another segment of my life's adornments assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we're discussing the very very crucial topic of the causes that lead children to going astray thus far we've discussed environment we've discussed poverty and now we're still talking about the environment but more closely the in home environment as we know identities or social constructs and in early developmental years you find children the way they find out about who they are their ideas their thoughts how they see the world how they see their Creator how they see themselves and their families is by way of consuming the media the eyes and the ears are windows to the soul so everything you see everything you hear it enters into your soul enters into your subconscious so the shaykh mentioned the effects of TV we haven't even gotten into the effects of the internet as well but we would like to talk a bit more about the community in the world at large even in the school environment as Malcolm X once said only a fool would allow his enemy to educate his children so how do we control these environments perhaps a person may be able to do well with inside of the context of their home but when you let your children go outside into the neighborhood into the school that is beyond your reach how do you recommend this many children parents in the westerlies homes or their children and things of this nature or send them to a local school that is within a Masjid or something like this but you have no control over what happens outside of that well this comes within the remedies and the upbringing if we were to focus on the reasons that take children astray this might not fit in yeah so I believe that we have to focus on the reasons yeah that would make our children go astray so that we can block them now blocking is not the answer if we talk about the video games the TV blocking is not the answer simply the children can find a substitute they can find an other alternative they can pre gram the things they have much better than we do I remember that whenever I needed something and to do with my PDA or my computer I would go to my four year or five year old child and ask her to do it for me and they just do this with their finger in an in a magical way and boom you've got there so blocking is not entirely the right thing to do the internet is a menace there are a lot of good things you can learn from we can learn from but it is something that is dangerous for our children and the PDA iPad the iPhone the mobiles they call them the smart phones and I call them the the phones because you just sit there and work work on it and you just intake there's no feedback coming from you Instagram a lot of the children went astray because of Instagram they watch celebrities they watch their false tales and how they live and they want to mimic that and you can see this in the way they look in their haircut in the way they talk and the Prophet is awesome warned us from this when he said whoever imitates a people he's from from them he's among them so as you've correctly stated earlier the Muslim identity is a very important thing but do not get me wrong a Muslim identity does not mean that you don't wear a suit now this is not related to identity because Muslims a lot of Muslims wear suits but when you start acting like a non-muslim when you start speaking in a language not yours you're an Arab why are you speaking English all the time when you start listening to rap music and I listen sometime to some of these rap songs and I could not understand a single word and he is unable to understand a single word why are you doing it well it's cool I like this and the beat is nice and so it's something that is changing and shifting from within this is what we fear most and that is why the Prophet our ASL option placed a great deal on the identity the Prophet said Ali in stilettos selling about having these weird haircuts when he saw some child with part of his head shaved and and the other part is not so the Prophet instructed his parents either shave it all or leave it all so if someone wants to have the radical tomahawk like mr. t so what were you doing you fool he's doing this but why I like it wait this is an Islamic you should not do that I'm the lion tamarin alas comes to the Prophet as I'm with the garment dyed with saffron and this was only done by the kuffara the Muslims never did did this but this is part of the pre-islamic era so he came the prophet saw it he got angry the Prophet did not let it slip he said did your mother or do you to do this you're talking to a grown-up man when you tell him that did your mother ask you to do this means that you're you're a kid you don't think what are you doing so Abdullah immediately acknowledged he understood he did not reply he did not even apologize he said Oh prophet of Allah shall I wash them off so yeah I'm gonna wash my clothes from Zefram is it okay the Prophet said no burn them so he wanted to send a strong and clear message your identity is more important than your garments burn them to the ground and not wash them so that you learn from now on that identity comes first as a Muslim if you look at this you learn that the environment is important and what our children waste are wasting their time on is extremely dangerous so should I cut the internet totally from the house should i confiscate their iPads and their tablets should I ask them to do this or that no this is not realistic because unfortunately even if you want to do this the schools will not allow you their teacher would tell them search the internet and print this research and bring this paper and do this and they need to do it so what's the solution I think and believe that the best solution is to instill in them to put in them the fear of Allah the love of Allah and the knowledge of the unseen so that this would be their guiding beacon but not all of us can succeed in doing this and not all the children would embrace this so the second step would be to eliminate all of these so-called smart devices and limit their access to the Internet to a computer not a laptop to a desktop PC there has a huge monitor and the monitors back is to the wall so anyone entering the living room from all sides can see the monitor and what's displayed on it he the child cannot cover it up and he's not giving his back to the wall in his face to you so that you can see the monitor no the monitor is crystal clear to anyone that walks into the living room and give them access per day you have two hours a day they can surf the net they can do whatever you they want you can see it if they enter YouTube you know what they've entered you block it or you tell them you'll be grounded for a whole week from using the the PC because this is bad and they can do whatever they are seen cyclopædia there are news outlets there are so many good things and Hallel things but also there is always this Shaitaan lurking in the dark waiting for the right moment to strike I don't know knows best yeah excellent so this has a crucial role much of what you said has to do with active parenting in order to be on top of these things you have to be an active parent but many in many cases you find parents aren't active either by default of working working parents both parents at work in many cases or a mother at home and she's trying her best to look after kids and the father's completely absent so how do you return back to parenting where both parents are active and we can discuss the responsibilities in this way well they have to learn their obligations they have to learn their roles and they also have to understand that any failure in assuming your responsibilities would have devastating results on your child a lot of the children and this may help us move on from this point here a lot of the children's responsibilities are handed to the schools so they depend the parents entirely on the school and whenever someone asks them why is your child like this they said well I don't know the school did this to him the school failed in doing this and it is a blaming game you go to the school and the principal and the head teachers say the parents did not teach their son or daughter well you go to the parents and they say the school is corrupt bad and it's not educating the children so everyone blames the other one failing to find or to realize that it's a mutual responsibility it takes two to tango that the family but by itself cannot bring a child in a way then throw the child in a mixed environment in a corrupt environment in an Islamic school and expect him to become an imam and likewise you cannot put your child in an Islamic school while the house itself is corrupt we're free mixing is there music is blasting 24/7 movies bollywood hollywood nowadays we have Nollywood you know that knowledge from nigeria okay every country now is I hope they don't have South so we load whatever so this is problematic it's a mutual responsibility that must be shared by both the family and the school what happens in the school is crucial because they spend more time sometimes with your child than what you spend so if it's not a good school if it's not an Islamic school if the teachers are not well educated because they can be knowledgeable in chemistry but not knowledgeable and how to treat and deal with children then you have a big problem so it's a whole process that we have to look into we shake this is what we're gonna stop our segment today we've covered a lot hum did that we hope that the viewers benefited I know I personally benefited from your pocket viewers thank you so much for tuning in with us today we hope hope that you like our program you enjoyed it you benefited very much and we look forward to seeing you for another episode of life's enormous assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] you [Music]"
