  "title": "Drums, Duff or Music in Nasheeds - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh hania I think uh was asking about the drums permitted in the Nashid and it's an issue of dispute I personally follow the opinion that say that there are no musical instrument permissible in any form of nashed or a song or music it's totally prohib it except for the dof and the doof is round shape uh tambourine without the metal uh pieces and chips at the side so it's open from one side only and it's a round big thing and this is used only in weddings and when someone who is a dignitary and of of importance in Islam comes from long travel and in these are the three occasions other than that when you have nids of Nashid artists and there's so many having the dof in the Nashid this is not permissible in my uh opinion and this is the opinion of and all great Scholars of Islam now people have passed this level altogether and now we know that there are Nashid artists using pianos violins guitars and all the nine uh uh yards and this is Haram even if he's praising the prophet even if he's praising Allah you cannot worship Allah with something that he has prohibited uh upon you"
