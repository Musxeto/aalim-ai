  "transcript": "so we have we know that we have to give sadaka on behalf of every joint in in our body and we can do this by praying DHA but if like a person decide to give um the Sak where where is the last time to do this this is not mandatory as the scholars said otherwise would have become mandatory as well however it is highly recommended and as long as the Hadith stated there is no day except that 360 joints in our body requires sodak this means that this is related to the day so it should be done before Sunset and Allah Knows Best"
