  "title": "Can women travel without mahram due to hadith: woman travelling alone fearing no one except the wolf",
  "transcript": "first of all the Hadith um Amina is referring to is authentic and the prophet said to ADI IBN Allah please with him that soon you will see a woman vaina traveling on her own from Yemen to had ramout or from hadra Mod to Mecca or from this area to that area different narrations fearing no one except the wolf on herself or something similar to that as the prophet had said and she's asking how is this possible when we know that the prophet prohibited women from traveling alone without the companionship of a male mahram first of all the prophet was giving us a prophecy of what would happen in the future not that he is approving of it when the prophet tells us that at the jail the Antichrist The Imposter would come and do heinous things in the world within 40 days that's his lifespan on Earth did the prophet Allah endorse his actions of course not their heinous actions their kuffer their blasphemous but he was telling us a prophecy of what was going to come so this is one of the logical answers to why the prophet told us about a woman traveling on her own secondly the prophet has said in numerous hadiths a lot of hadiths and directed us and told us and taught us about the prohibition of a woman traveling on her own so we don't need to come to an isolated incident as such talking about the prophecy in the future and try to bend evidences to justify that women May travel alone the ruling is fixed till the day of judgment so we have to stick to it because this is what Muslims do and Allah Knows Best ah"
