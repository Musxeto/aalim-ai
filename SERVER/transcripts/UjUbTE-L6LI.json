  "title": "Cutting ties with a family member due to accusation of molestation or rape - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question about molestation so parents having their children and one of their children one of their sons was accused by his sister-in-law so the other sons daughter her mother accused him of molesting her and doing inappropriate things so they cut ties with their son according to her allegation and accusation so is what they're doing correct or wrong the answer is that when someone brings you a piece of information you must verify this Allah says yeah you had ladina a man who injure a confessor from another in Fatah beyond that whenever someone of a character that is not to be trusted he's a faster he's a sinful person and he may relay to you pieces of news and information that are not truthful Allah says o you who believe you must verify first before you take action and at the end of the day regret this likewise this movement all over the the world where if a woman accuses a man by default he's an assailant so if a woman comes and says that this person had asked me or this person raped me would that make me accused according to the me to movement yes but this is illogical in Islam it's the perfect system you accuse someone you slander someone you have to either bring four male witnesses to testify that this did happen this rape or whatever or the person confesses without that it's baseless if someone comes to your father and accuses him of raping her would you accept this no definitely not I know my father everybody knows his father everybody knows his brother everybody knows his son so in Islam it's not hearsay her word against his yes sure but she's the mother regardless maybe she has a grudge maybe she has some you cannot tarnish my reputation just because a woman spoke against me I cannot tarnish her reputation just because I spoke against her if I do slander her and I say that she committed fornication or adultery and I don't provide the four witnesses I'll be flogged 80 lashes because her reputation is as good as gold and so is mine so what the parents did was totally wrong if there are no circumstantial evidences no witnesses and the boy is a good person they all know that he is righteous and the girl is young and and and she's a child what would make him do such a thing and again without witnesses they have no right none whatsoever to cut their son for such an allegation yes maybe we may take precautions so this son would never be alone with any of his nieces or young girls Mahone's to him just to be safe rather than sorry but not to go to that extreme as of accusing him convicting him and then put the prescribed punishment as if he is a full-fledged criminal and Allah knows best"
