  "transcript": "first first of all I'm a big fan we have air conditioners alhamdulillah may Allah promote you to anaz they have so much dead hearts and black hearts and you find people in the heart of Medina and in Mecca with zero Iman this is a guy a taxi driver 15 years working in Haram taking people and pilgrims and people of om to the Haram for 15 years and they've never entered the Haram the souls are like soldiers in an army and I I don't like their guts I don't like their uh Vibes and he says Allah loves this individual so love him why is this particular individual loved by so many people you might be a Swifty and she has she has like 70 million followers there is a difference between having a friend and having a colleague the problem and the biggest problem is to be loved the problem is does Allah love you or not when you say allahar it has a different meaning so talking about hij do you think every Muslim should consider making Hijra I have three stance in my heart since 2017 I used to bench press 100 kg so I just keep a physique that when I put my jeans and t-shirts that's it relatively speaking yes we're much more conservative but this is not something that would yeah make a huge difference except for someone who's yeah a bit sick and too horny excuse my French normal people's okay I go to Canada and I see things I go to London I go to Europe okay yeah it's outrageous but this is your test from Allah do you have a father okay you have a mother is she a sweet person yes generous and you're kind to her imagine if your mother was the sweetest woman on earth giving you a th000 us every day your mom I don't need this no no no I would like to have it and she serves you she serves your wife and children and she goes around the relatives and Friends saying my son is the best man on Earth he's so generous you're so kind you're so brave would it be difficult to be dutiful and respectful to her where's the test wow I'm wise huh see this is what Allah created you for if if you're living in Utopia is's no fun but when there's Temptation and you stand for the sake of Allah and say no Yu if you go through the Quran Samir most likely have told you about this Yousef was sold as a slave when they found him in the well bought by the king of Egypt raised by him then as a foreigner as a Young Man full of energy seduced by the wife of the king when they were alone and he was harshly tempted now no one would stand so he the test with flashing Stars alhamdulillah this is the same that's happening to all of us life is a test Allah tested yeah created us to be tested and all what you're going to live is like 60 maximum 70 years of age then whatas 6 ft under but if you made it you've made it for good for forever so there is no point of again excuse my French bit whining yeah say oh we have so much Fitness okay welcome to the club you have FNA let's go to and see the people there what FNA are you talking about you you've got benefits in Australia you've got life you've got Medical Services free I think yeah yeah education you blah blah infrastructure you've got the power of the passport that maybe 90% of the population of Earth are envious of and then you're saying oh we want to do this we want to do you have it made so all what you have to do is identify the glass you're drinking from is it half full or half empty it's the same it's the same glass but it depends on how you look at it I don't know if this makes sense this is what you think unfortunately if you ask she Sam or abdah how many of the people living less than 2 kilom from Alam have lived for 40 years and not entered it of the locals it's it's it's in the heart what were you drinking of just a while ago from your a large bottle of water of zamzam zamzam yes and one of the sh was asked by his student and he said to him Sheik why is Zam Zam not tasteful Z is not tasteful is it I like it it's not that sweet or whatever it's a little bit salty a so why is it not that tasteful the Sheikh said so that Allah knows who drinks it for his sake ah yes this is your test wow people living in Mecca they don't know even the Haram how to go to the Haram they have so much dead hearts and black hearts that they don't feel the urge to go so I know people in jida of my own relatives that have been here for 60 years they went only once for Hajj and once for omah one in their lives and it's a stone throw to us so when you come and say oh I wish to come here and live here you don't know what will happen after five months or six months of seeing it I remember 20 years ago when I used to work with the corporate companies I was an executive and my office was in the sixth floor overlooking the SE Port of jeda one of the fanciest offices and locations in jida everyone and it was a huge office it was for the CEO when he left to another place I said I'd like to take it he said take it so even the directors and the vice president don't have this office everyone who came into the office was mized by the view for about 15 20 seconds and I just sit there and watch them and I say you like what the view he said wow the view is magnificent he said I've been working here for 5 years I don't even pay attention to it why the Heart Is Dead I've seen it so many times so unfortunately what dictates your level of Iman is not attributed to the land we you live it is attributed to your own heart you find people in Sydney and Melbourne in London and Paris and uh uh even in in Monaco with the highest level of Iman that anyone would expect and you find people in the heart of Medina and in Mecca with zero Iman so be careful I don't say that I'm not saying that coming to the holy lands and living there is not a plus of course it's the best thing ever but again don't make it a maker or breaker of a deal yes it's all here that you have to fix learn your religion increase your IM and then whever Allah puts you you become a beacon of light this is a guy a taxi driver 15 years working in Haram taking people and pilgrims and people of to the Haram for 15 years and you've never entered the Haram yeah you're just few steps away sh um for context obviously I'm a revert as the brothers mentioned um so I've grown up with like Western you know like wives tales Western sort of Western culture wives tales and all these things and one thing I've been curious about prior to being Muslim but especially from this trip being and since being Muslim is the the old sort of ideology of deja vu and whatja Vu is is there anything in the Quran or it's it's like the karma so there isn't anything as Deja Vu because Deja Vu means that I've been there I've done dust no this is your subconscious and as Muslims we do not believe in a previous life that you've been in so okay maybe I've been I I I met one of those um durus from Lebanon and the DUS is a cult that claim to be Muslims they're not Muslims so I met one of them and he was yeah trying to get closer to me and you know being courteous I'm I'm courteous to everyone and I don't face people with hostility so once we were talking and I said to him why don't we see you in the Masjid he's he's a neighbor he said you know I'm Dury and we don't pray in your Masjid oh Subhan Allah and I played Dumb and then he said to me you know I I love to go to the beach and to swim and to to ski so I said they believe in um reincarnation so I said hm you might have been a fish in a previous life and the guy laughed his head off you you're dangerous man you know too much so we do not have this concept yeah we know that we've born we live and we die yeah but your subconscious a movie you saw a dream you've dreamed of this gives you a recollection of h i I think I've been there I think this would happen and it's just a a coincidence that takes place your subconscious plays games on uh okay interesting very good point uh what about the Hadith of like the souls that meet before we're born you know the there isn't any Hadith to my recollection of souls meeting before birth the prophet said in a the souls are like soldiers in an army whatever knows one another it would find this Bond and chemistry some people I meet and they're might be D or great Scholars of Islam with many followers when I meet them I feel and I I don't like their guts I don't like their uh Vibes and I usually am a peaceful guy you know not that peaceful but any I I I just you know try to be polite and diplomatic but keep my distance sometimes you meet people and you feel that you know them forever and you go out of your way to help them and to be with them and to give them gifts and blah blah blah so this is what the Hadith says but no de is this before creation no no no no this is now oh this Hadith is an explanation of why would I find chemistry with some why would I like someone and this is in accordance to Hadith of the Prophet when he said that when Allah loves an individual he calls jel and said jiel I love this individual so love him so jiel loves him and he calls the angels of the heavens and he says Allah loves this individual so love him so the people of the heavens love him and acceptance is placed for him in this life why is this particular individual loved by so many people and we're not talking about people of sins and kufur because you might be a Swifty and she has she has like 70 million followers but this doesn't mean that she's loved by Allah we're talking about the people of Islam of righteousness of the Masjid why do they love this particular individual because Allah loves him and Allah placed acceptance for him sometimes you find a a scholar a professor of Islam and people hate his guts why because there is no acceptance of him for him there's an attitude there is a Bad Seed in his heart but we can't point it out so Allah puts this rejection of people uh uh in in people's hearts I don't know if this makes sense first first of all I'm a big fan we have air conditioners alhamd may Allah promote you to an amazing the question is um obviously you know us Brothers we live in Australia so we got a lot of us might have non-muslim friends what do you think about having a friend like that's very close there is a difference between having a friend and having a colleague so I have Christians who I know sometimes if I go to the gym I may work out and they come and we chitchat they're not buddies they're not uh my best friends I don't hang out with them I don't confine in them and tell them oh this happened with my relatives my wife my blah blah blah no but they like you guys say good day yeah that's as far as it gets and we may maybe play a squash game together maybe just exchange but to be close to them take them as allies and uh uh confidence no this is not permissible now if you have relatives or Shia or disbelievers and you think that if I speak to them I may be able to attract them uh uh to bring them closer to Islam to Sunnah blah blah blah that's a win-win this is the role of a Muslim to be a magnet to all good things and if it doesn't work I have so many people to divert my effort and and and and work to rather than focusing on this individual why would I invest in in in a losing company um we have a question from a follower it says what acts of worship increase the love of Allah in my heart and make me beloved to him see the problem is not to love the problem and the biggest problem is to be loved everyone even the Jews and Christians claim that they love Allah so good luck the problem is does Allah love you or not so you can do so many things and you claim that you love Allah but does Allah love you this is the AET test that you have to yeah ask yourself all acts of worship gets you closer to Allah the most beloved is to recite the Quran to memorize the Quran to understand the meaning of the Quran the most noble science of all in Islam is is an elastic word is part ofran the Quran yeah but the most beloved science to allel and the most noble of all is the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes because the value of the science relies entirely on what you're studying so if you're studying Allah what could be better and this is the Cornerstone of you can understand but without knowing who Allah is you have nothing so when you know Allah when you spend and devote your time and effort to know what are Allah's beautiful names and what all are Allah's attributes when you say Allah abbar it has a different meaning so many Muslims I ask them how many names does Allah have9 99 this is what the Hadith says but Allah's names are unlimited they're far more but the the the thing that the prophet told us about 99 names if you count them memorize them Implement them know the meaning of them you will enter Jenna good then I ask my second question how many of these names do you memorize people say um 15 maybe 10 said no problem so you are 10% knowledgeable of Allah of these 10 names how many do you know the meaning of then I said one not two so why are you complaining that my prayer has no sweetness I'm unable to enjoy it sometimes I skip it I don't find the motive and the drive because you don't know Allah very simple if you knew Allah all these fitnas you're complaining of will disappear you'll have full trust in Allah because oh she I have to work in an interest based bank I have to sell Lea I have to deal with Haram I have to go to a synagogue or to a temple and pretend to be a Hindu I have to do why because if I don't I will not have salary I will not have money I will be kicked off the house if you had trust in Allah if you knew Allah none of this would have happened so people don't know Allah and this is how you increase your IM number one know Allah beautiful names attributes number two number three Quran how many times do you finish the Quran a month people say a month yeah I finished Quran about like in 2019 in in in Ramadan but I'm I'm I'm working on it I'm working the minimum you finish Quran is once a month this is the minimum one juu every day bare minimum I know people who memor who revise five juo a day every six from memory every six days they finish the Quran from memory just to keep it steady six days so you come and tell me yeah but I'd like to make hij what have you done zero so start building the foundation before you think of and make Hijra what's your income what's your Finance so nothing sh a maab driver so you're G to come and work in meca doing what H I have saved money yeah you live for six months deplete your money then start begging people then go back to Australia you don't have a job and then you start begging people over there then you resent Islam then you say maybe I should go back to my old ways yeah it's difficult it's a test so play your game well if you want Allah to take care of you I don't know if this I'm good diverting from questions that I likeing rapid rapid yeah so just a I mean if you want to answer it quickly or whatever um so talking about Hijra you got four minutes four minutes okay I'm fine with it yes so talking about hij do you think every Muslim should consider making Hijra see Hijra was directed To Us by the prophet he said I have nothing to do with a Muslim who lives among the disbelievers in the proximity where if they light fire for cooking they can see each one's fire they're so close of course we live in Building Blocks we live in neighborhoods we live in so many places that are so close to one another uh drink with your right hand my friend you're in the presence of the sh I'm a re I've got my guns on me sorry this is an old habit you know when I see something like this I have to point it out so uh the prophet Salli wasallam told us to migrate now migration is essential but if a person was born and raised there and there is no better alternative meaning if he goes to a Muslim country they'll kick him out in six months or he would not have a suitable job or his social status and and economic level would be so bad that his wife would divorce him his children would go stray we say no stay where you are if you're able to practice Islam you are able to pray on time your wife is able to wear the N your children can go to Muslim schools nobody's forcing you to do something Haram per se so remain where you are pry your level best to improve your uh uh income maybe you know diversify your Investments so that you would have steady income that allows you to go to a Muslim country whether it's Egypt whether it's uh turkey whether it's Malaysia whether it's Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is very expensive we don't accept people and if you have $300,000 you can get a golden uh permanent residency maybe a little bit less but again if you have this amount of money so yes once you are able come um first of all I love your content always makes us laugh that and as well as it's um it's really good for the de but my question is cuz we don't have time so I'll just say a quick one talked about Jim and how you go there what's your P for bench I have three stance in my heart since 2017 okay you know what stance are sounds your arteries they become blocked so they insert three stance to keep them open so before that I used to bench press 100 kg after my operation doctor said no more heavy weights so I reduce like 70% of the weights I do due to the fact that doctors all all my cardiologists and heart surgeons said no weights so I just keep a physique that when I put my jeans and t-shirts that's it and just off there um one thing I realized while coming here there isn't many gyms and the those facilities are not I don't know maybe no one of the Medina mea jida and Medina and and uh all over Saudi Arabia we have the best gyms my grandson goes to one of the gyms Fitness Time Fitness time we're endorsing Fitness time is one of the gyms they have like maybe 40 or 50 uh Outlets all over the the country and the fun thing is if you're a membership a member in one of them anywhere you go you can be admitted so it's like oh good you you've changed from left to right I was almost going to I can see I could see the shock on he's already got called once by the IM of Mecca cuz he was drinking with his left hand tce that trouble's good so alhamd we have lots of GS and we have lots of um sports clubs paddle Outlets uh football small courts for eight eight players and the likes and everywhere everywhere very important for the de in terms of praying and Etc it's it's not an essential thing it is a subsidiary it's something that's uh uh um a third or a fourth in the priority list but it is essential to have um because we are running out of time we ran out of time already the is cold so uh just a quick one every 30 seconds does Islam allow child marriage does does is it legal anywhere in the world so why what's what's the point of the question this question is posed by Islam haters so it's illegal thing it's like some do does Islam endorse concubines can I buy one so no it's it's prohibited worldwide so why are you asking first of all was child matter allowed 15 centuries ago yes or no yes all over the world Christians Jews and so why are you guys jumping the gun on Islam secondly what's the legal age for in Peru Mexico France Japan you'll find that it goes down to 12 13 and 14 years of age till date so what's the problem I'm not saying there is problem I don't I know you're not saying those who's asking because they want to bring you back to why did Prophet Muhammad marry when she was 9 years of age so let's let's say if I have a 5-year-old daughter and I wanted um to married off to him I'm allowed to do that you'd be a stupid schmuck no no okay okay listen let's say Isa Isa comes down the end of time okay I say I want to marry my daughter off to Issa 5year old if she was even 5 months old yes okay that's Isa who who's in his right mind would reject Isa come on give me a break but those who ask such questions you look at their agendas it's not 1 plus 1 equals 2 no no they have a reason and if you're not qualified or equipped or know the background you would put yourself and others in in trouble M yeah I think it's got time you guys lost used to it no pun intended but uh can we take a final photo maybe together sure sure"
