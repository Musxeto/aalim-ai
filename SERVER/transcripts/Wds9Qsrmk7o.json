  "transcript": "is it smart to pray for a certain person to be your spouse or rather leave your Dua General and just pray for the goding rightous out of experience it's stupid to make Dua for a specific person and wait 6 seven years while this person has already got married and has three kids and thinking of a second wife he is not the last individual last man on earth move on don't be fixated on a specific individual making Dua thinking that he will look at you because this is one of the traps ofan because he doesn't know of you so you make Dua for 6 months and you feel that Allah is accepting my Dua maybe I have to go the extra mile maybe text him maybe throw him my number maybe you stalk him on his Instagram page I don't know so this is Wayan starts little by little introducing you to Haram no keep your distance make your Dua that Allah sends you someone who fears him and someone who Allah loves it would be much better for you and Allah Knows Best"
