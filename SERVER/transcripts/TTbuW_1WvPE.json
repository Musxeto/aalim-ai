  "title": "Feel frustrated & lonely due to lack of people around me following sunnah, what to do? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "okay um the next question talks about the afflictions of the heart and sometimes this particular person feel frustrated and lonely because there are few people around them applying the sunnah so either the particip the person is feeling left out or the the person is feeling frustrated that you know people are applying the sunnah and she is not any suggestion that he or she can do to heal their hearts of such a burden affliction welcome to the club this is what we all feel and this is what our teacher went through all of his life saddened by his people not complying not answering not responding not reciprocating with his dawah and allah used to tell him don't kill yourself don't burden yourself you're it is not up to you to guide them it is up to you to give them our guidance in the hands of allah so if you're a sister and you find few people around you applying the sunnah then you have to change your environment and look for another environment where people are abiding by the sunnah when the person who killed a hundred souls wanted to repent the scholar told him nothing stands in your way for repentance but you live in a evil corrupt town immigrate and go to this specific town where it's filled with righteous people for you to practice with so the first thing you want to do is to change your environment the second thing you want to do is if you're unable to find such people make such people and how is this possible by becoming a guy by learning acquiring knowledge becoming a guy like us capable of communicating with people capable of answering their questions and solving their doubts and this it doesn't come easy it comes with a great deal of hardship and pursue of authentic knowledge once you gain proper knowledge not just watching a lecture here or there studying the quran studying the hadith studying studying knowing arabic what you are set on this path you will find that you are changed internally you become a happier person you become more influential on changing people's lives because now you're able to talk to them before you tell them do this they say but so and so does not do these things and share so-and-so says otherwise you got you become frustrated because it's my sheikh against their sheikh and this doesn't take you anywhere but if you manage to know where your sheikh is talking from and you say yes but allah says in the quran so and so and so and it says so-and-so nobody can dare and say yeah but imam so does this because they cannot refute or reject the quran the sunnah with the sayings of imam no matter how great the imam is so once you are on this you know that insha allah such depression and feelings of sadness would leave him the more you know that this is the path which our professor had walked before you you"
