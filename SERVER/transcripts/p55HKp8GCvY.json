  "title": "What if Riya (Showing off) comes to me during Prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "saying what will happen if R develops during my Salah and I Ward it off and at the end my intention was for Allah first of all is something that is considered to be a form of minor shik minor associating others with Allah it's not major it doesn't nullify a person's Islam and a lot of us may um translate it into showing off so brother Muhammad is asking what's the ruling if a person comes and he begins his prayer and all of a sudden he gets these feelings of showing off so I'm praying and somebody's looking and all of a sudden I try to beautify my prayer so that people would think well of Me Maybe beautify my recitation maybe do prolong my prayer longer than usual so that people would comment and praise me for that so what's the ruling on that first of all uh Scholars say that Deeds vary there are Deeds that are connected the beginning with the end so if the beginning beginning was not good then the end will not be good and vice versa such as prayer if you begin your prayer without wo even if you continue the whole prayer the whole thing is gone if you begin the prayer with woo and just before Salam you nullify your woodo your prayer is gone because it's all uh connected together and there are Deeds that are not connected the beginning is not connected to the end such as Charity for example so if a person uh uh gives 50 real and then another 50 R they are not connected they're different and separate and Scholars say if it's separate then whatever has showing off in it is not accepted and the part that did not have show off in it is accepted for example I have 100 real this says always gives this example may Allah have mercy on his soul so if I give 50 R for the sake of Allah to the poor and my intention was for the sake of of Allah Allah accepts this but if I add another 50 just because someone commented positively or look is looking at me so I want it to show off then this 50 real the second one is not valid and the first one is accepted when it comes to prayer it's a different uh uh issue altogether if I begin the prayer from the very beginning with the intention of showing off the whole prayer is invalid so for example I'm sitting idle all of a sudden the boss of the company comes in and he looks at those around so I stand up and I start to pray just to impress him so my whole prayer is invalid and I'm sinful for that but what is the ruling if this feeling of showing off came to me while I was praying not from the very beginning it's an issue of dispute and because it's an issue of dispute then inshallah if you ward it off as you have said and then at the end of your prayer the intention was purely for Allah Asel your prayer is valid the issue is not when it crosses your mind and you contemplate upon it and you fight it off the issue is when you are happy with it and you go along with it in this case this affects your prayer so if it goes all the way to the end while you are happy with it and continuing with it Scholars differ some say that the beginning is okay but the end is not some say the whole prayer is invalid and because there is this difference of opinion among Scholars we say inshallah Allah accepts that which was pure uh and rejects which was not said"
