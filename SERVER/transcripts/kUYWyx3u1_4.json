  "title": "Rolling up or folding pants during Salah - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hallet question says a bread as per the hadith that is not permissible to roll up pants can you elaborate the actual meaning of it does it mean to not roll pants during salah as in office time I do wear pants below their ankles and usually roll my pants before Salah and perform accordingly is this permissible first of all the hadith is in the sahi where the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was Haram said I was ordered to prostrate on seven bones or seven limbs or seven areas of my body and he said the forehead and pointed to his nose as well the hands the knees and the feet and I was prohibited I was prevented I was denied from rolling any form of dress or tucking it in and from doing the same to my hair the hadith is regarding salat and we understand this because of the first part is talking about prostration on seven areas of the body or seven limbs and the latter part of the hadith also talks about salat and the hadith says that it is not permissible to gather any of your clothes or your hair when you pray for the purpose of praying what is the meaning of gather the Arabic word is a cough careful a soap is to either fold it to tuck it in to gather it so that you would not have it loose some scholars say that this so that you would not prevent your dress your clothes from prostrating and bowing with you when you bow and prostrate so for example you see this what I wearing my my usually this is how I wear it if I were to pray and then I bring it and I do this so now I am folding it I am keeping it in not it's loose and natural nature this is prohibited as the scholars say because I'm doing it for the salaat likewise if I have some loose clothes and I tie them in either with a belt or something for the purpose of salat this is not permissible going back to harlots question as for folding your trousers your pants so that they would not go below your ankles this is how it's supposed to be whether you're in the office in your home or outside on the streets you must not wear anything that exceeds your ankles as a man because the Prophet told the salary salat-u-salam that whatever exceeds the ankles is tormented in hell so if it is like 2 or 3 centimeters below your ankles or covering your ankles then this area would be tormented in hell and we know that the least torment of hell is a person who has a store of fire placed in his sandals or in his shoes where his brains boil from its heat so you can imagine the amount of torment a person who drags his soap his trousers whatever he is wearing below his ankles however if you are defiant if you are insisting on sinning if you fold it for the purpose of the salat this is acceptable and permissible because this is supposed to be the norm if you send and roll it down throughout the whole day but when it comes to Salah you fold it up then this is permissible insha'Allah I hope this answers your question"
