  "transcript": "his second question is one of them is very well off and he recently decided to give each of us that is the rest of the family a lump sum of cash to buy each a house or to start the business of our choice he gave us the money in good faith and not as alone to pay him back as muslims is it permissible for us to accept that money see if this gift was given to you by a non-muslim by a christian or by a jew i would have told you immediately to accept it there's nothing wrong in accepting a gift at all but coming from this apostate coming from this person who rejected his faith who rejected islam it would be like humiliating islam and humiliating you because now we've said that you have to be straightforward with him you have to hate what he has done you don't socialize with him and have family visits and dying at his house and as if nothing has happened and treating him as a true brother and no matter what he had done it's okay for you now this is not acceptable we've stated this in point number one now after doing this when he gives you money and it's a lump sum a lot of money to buy a house then shaitan comes and says well okay he committed an act of apostasy but maybe if i accept it and buy the house and a new porsche or a new ferrari maybe allah will open his heart and he would accept islam again so no now this is your desires intervening and your whims telling you to do things that are not correct personally i believe that you should not take this gift from him because it would be a form of consent to what he is doing and likewise the third question is it even allowed for us to accept a loan from him coming from a jew or a christian yes it is it is permissible to borrow for him but coming from this person who committed an act of apostasy and rejected islam it would be a form of compromise and i would not uh believe that this is permissible"
