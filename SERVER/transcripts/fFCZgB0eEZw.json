  "transcript": "okay we got a question uh here from a brother he says um I'd like to ask a question uh about some actions of one of my friends whenever we go to congregation he never comes and prays with us he always prays at home and the reason he gives he says uh because you guys pray at the wrong time you don't pray when the time comes in you pray much later so instead of praying with you in the Mosk I'm going to pray at home um what's the uh answer for this brother squish well unfortunately Satan moves in different directions and he looks at people and He tends to focus on their weaknesses so if a person is lenient he goes and he increases that and if a person is strict he makes him makes him goes uh go to the extreme that is why this brother's action is strong now he is hypothetically thinking that they delay the prayer uh from its time does he have any proof of that as long as a people are praying from the beginning of the aan till the end of the time then their prayer is valid M prayer is valid until is called prayer is valid until the sun's brightness disappears and this is when the shade of an erected object is half of its uh uh length which means that it's double the the length of this erected object and it extends up to Sunset M prayer extends from the aan to The Disappearance of the redness in the Twilight Anda prayers starts from The Disappearance of the Twilight redness in the Twilight until midnight which is usually usually 11:30 qu to 12 depending on Sunset and the break of dawn mhm and F prayer starts from the break of dawn until the beginning of the sunrise so it is prolonged time for people to pray you cannot come and say I will pray home because you delay or postpone the prayer unless they postpone it until the other prayers do and no one does this so this is a lame excuse from a lazy person who wants to pray home and Allah knows if he is actually praying home or he's also skipping it so don't pay a lot of attention to his allegation always ask this brother to bring evidence from the Quran from the Sunnah or from a trustworthy scholar saying that what he's doing is acceptable"
