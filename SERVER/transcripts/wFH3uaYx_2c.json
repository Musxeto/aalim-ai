  "transcript": "from the u.s she says people are enjoying life after when we migrated to the u.s i'm finding it difficult to pray as i used to pray and enjoy reading the quran making dikkar everything around me is filled with fitnah even my siblings my own brothers who used to pray in the masjid and go to circles of quran memorization and be students of knowledge now they've drifted far far away from islam and i am worried what to do unfortunately sarah this is the price you have to pay when you look for a better life quote unquote underline exclamation marks when you look for a better income when you jeopardize your islam by going to a kafir country like that i get counseling sessions every day alhamdulillah and 40 percent of these counseling sessions about their children how they drifted how they've deviated we get calls from parents weeping over their daughters and sons what happened they don't pray anymore they don't want to talk about islam they raise their voices and sometimes physically fight with us whenever we try to tell them to do something that is islam islamic or to stay away from something that is haram and we don't know what to do how can i help you you are trying to cure the symptoms while neglecting the core illness someone who has cancer someone who has a chronic illness and complains of headaches giving him tylenol or aspirin or panadol or whatever would relieve him from his headache for an hour or two then a tree occurs another pill a third pill a whole box it would not cure the cancer it would only cure the symptoms which is the headaches this is exactly what you're doing living in such kafir country failing to install in your children from a very early age the knowledge of allah the love of allah the commitment to the deen we fail to do this with our own children because we go out of our way to feed them well to clothe them well and to take them to the best schools but spiritually culturally they don't have an identity so they're torn between two lovers feeling like a fool this is what's happening they don't have a heritage to lean on or back to all what they see is kufur disbelief temptation so they fall pray to it and they become the victims you have to go to the core of the problem and solve it if it's not already too late so unfortunately this requires a lecture but i hope you understand what i'm hitting too"
