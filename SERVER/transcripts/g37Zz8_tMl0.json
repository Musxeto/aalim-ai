  "title": "How to stay on track after Ramadan? (Peak & Downfall of Iman) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "amatulla had sent us a question saying can you please give us some pointers to stay on track after Ramadan as our worship and it's sweetness do not seem to the same after Ramadan is gone and we tend to lag to lag behind so much first of all this is only natural that a Muslim has a peak and has a rock bottom the Prophet said in an authentic hadith sallallahoalyhiwasallam that every action has a peak and every peak has a downfall moments of fatigue or lack of interest the Prophet said that is awesome commented afterwards whoever his fatwa his period of being tired or lacking of interest is towards my son he's guided and whoever goes other than my Sunnah is gone astray and he's doomed what does this mean everything we do there has to be a peak and a bottom whether it is in religion or even in worldly matters even in sin someone picks playing the guitar he plays couple of tunes he Tunes his strings he starts to play and learn some chords he likes it he spends 10 hours every day just banging playing and after few months he his board he gives up usually someone else picks photography he buy cameras he buy lenses he buy cases he does this he does that he don't loads software he buys them to do the editing and Photoshop et cetera and after a few months usually he gives up someone Allah guides his heart to seeing the beauty of Islam so he starts to pray night prayer for two hours reciting the Quran he's driven to be committed to his religion then Shaitaan comes and he starts to whispers and a person by nature gets bored if he this individual who had a peak went down to the Sunna meaning instead of praying three hours or four hours night prayer he only prays Whicher once or one raka yet he observes the five daily prayers in the Masjid the whole nine yards he doesn't fast Mondays and Thursdays in the white days etc but he never plays with the fault which is fasting Ramadan then the Prophet says he's guided because this downfall would inevitably later on Hashanah pick up momentum and reach the peak again but those who totally give up so instead of praying three-four hours night prayer he doesn't even wake up for Fechter this person is doomed so what you amatulla our feeling we all share this we all have this in us why because Ramadan is a blessed month Ramadan everyone around you is striving to worship allah azza wajal the best of their ability everybody's fasting the majority of Muslims are praying Tara we had the Masjid the vast majority of Muslims are opening the Koran and reciting between adhan Anupama and some stay in the masjid till the following salat people are so generous they give and in charity to feed the poor they help the needy etc so they work a lot because the whole society the whole community is doing so and this is why a person finds Ramadan to be a moment of getting closer to Allah solution now after Ramadan is over we have a problem so how to solve this problem the answer is easy try to create a similar environment to Ramadan and how is this possible first of all you have to focus on your own individual forms of worship meaning I used to pray tell are we in the message I should continue to pray night prayer in my home so this is a fixed pattern that I should observe and always do like the Prophet our assumption like the Companions like all the righteous people so I have a portion of the night I have to pray whether it's five minutes half an hour an hour a couple of hours this depends on the strength of a man during which you recite at least one zero of the Quran because one juzo of the Quran means that you finish the Quran once a month and this is the minimum expected from you as a believer you fast Mondays and Thursdays so these are eight days a month you fast and for the sake of Allah and you will notice that you have reduced the amount of sins you do because of your fasting and of your night prayer you observe reciting the Quran memorizing it revising it occupying yourself with it and finally surround yourself with righteous practicing Muslims who share with you these forms of worship so Mondays and Thursdays the vast majority around me are fasting they give charity they encourage one another to go for ombres they revise the Quran together so they're a couple or three three people that daily revise Quran to one another with this inshallah you'll be in safe hands and you will maintain this momentum in Allah"
