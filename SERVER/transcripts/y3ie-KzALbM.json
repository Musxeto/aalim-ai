  "transcript": "foreign well the essence and the default is that Layman follows Scholars and I'm not a scholar however whatever I convey to you is taken from binbase 99.99 percent so insha Allah by following what I say and you can always test me or cross-reference with the real Scholars of bimbased and if you find that it complies with what they had said then you are in the safe Unfortunately today it is not that feasible to tell people no you have to follow a real scholar and a bad bad what he say because they're not available or they don't have the platforms we have Allah azzawajal has blessed us and tested us with social media with these TV programs with being a celebrity people calling us for conferences and lectures and alhamdulillah Allah has granted the US that the people trust us so it's a huge responsibility we always I always say that I'm not a scholar don't follow me but people keep on coming and saying Sheikh we can't get hold of anyone else in this case I would say due to necessity yes you will not be sinful with the grace of Allah and I hope you're not sinful because you are following someone who claims and I hope that the test of time has proven that he doesn't speak out of his own whims and desires rather the vast majority Nobody's Perfect the vast majority of what he says comes from the real trusted scholars in Allah Knows Best of course I will be waiting for your hate mail because I know that a lot of people don't agree with what I say who cares"
