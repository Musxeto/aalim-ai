  "title": "If a disbeliever calls the Adhan, is this considered as entering the fold of Islam?  Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk he says if someone left the fold of islam or if a disbeliever came and called the adhan would that be considered to be entering islam the answer is no this is not islam islam has to be done out of conviction and he has to announce the shahada he could be a kafir singing a song thinking that the adhan is a song and he likes the melody of it he could be a an apostate making fun and repeating the shahada again in the adhan or elsewhere just for the fun of it or mocking islam so this does not count as embracing islam"
