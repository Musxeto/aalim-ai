  "transcript": "amum because I live in a CF country do I have to read the ingredients of makeup products um or can I just simply buy it without checking the ingredients originally everything is halal until proven otherwise and it causes a great deal of hardship if I would look into the origin of this mug if I would look into the ingredients of normal soap or detergents or fabric that I'm wearing because I have no reason to doubt it and therefore it's different from consuming things eating things where I have to be careful whether it's Halal or Haram whether it has pork or not and the likes but when it comes to normal things such as cosmetics and makeup and the likes the norm is that it is halal and pure until proven otherwise if I have no reason to doubt it I don't have to look into the ingredients and Allah Knows Best"
