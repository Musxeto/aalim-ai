  "title": "Should we not go in public with men who shave beard & wear pants below the ankles? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um uh recently I watched a video of yours where you were explaining to a woman about um her friends who were wearing hijab and you told her basically that you shouldn't like hang out with her with them in public and stuff like that and uh I just wanted to know like is this same ruling applied to like men who do isbal you know like they leave the uh stuff under the the ancles like is it something that you shouldn't go in public with them and stuff like that no the answer is not this is a sin that is related to the individual himself and not transgressing to others if a man shaves his beard if a man wears his trousers below his ankles this is on upon Him nobody's harmed by it but when a woman does not abide by the hijab men are affected by that sin because they're seeing something that is Haram so she is the initiator of such a sin her being a hijabi and a woman of chaste cannot be associated with such individuals in public because this tarnishes her reputation as a hijabi and it acts as an endorsement of their uh transgression and sin and Allah Knows Best"
