  "transcript": "there's nothing wrong in that it's exactly like someone telling me that listen brother I like bodybuilding but I went to the gym and I put you know 100 kgs two plates here two plates there I couldn't lift it so why it's the same thing it needs training it needs a lot of preparation and it is a a way of life you cannot just you switch on switch off you just go to the Masjid allahar masallah you're flying in Paradise in the heavens and no it's a way of life if you're coming to the Masjid with a hip hop and a Hipp to the Hipp hop hop or whatever they say what are you doing said I love contemporary music and at night you're going to watch tonight's film feature film and in the morning you intermingle and you deal in riba and you lie and you backbite and you make uh sell Haram things intoxicant and so on and when you come to the Masid Allah you think you're going to have and contemplation no way it's a way of life when you find the taste of Quran when you recite it then we're progressing when you stop doing Haram why because Allah says it's Haram okay logical when you do what's mandatory and obligatory why because Allah instructs you to do it then you will find the taste and beauty of prayer other than that you have a big problem because the essence of your existence is worshiping Allah Asel and through prayer and if you cannot achieve prayer you're in vain your worship is in vain the prophet tells us the first thing that the servant of Allah will be questioned on the day of judgment is pray Sal if it's good then all of the other deeds will be accepted regardless if you have missing few things here and there Allah will accept them but if your prayer is bad Allah will reject all of your Deeds even if you have good fasting good zakat but your prayer is awful there's no we have a disease in Arabia I don't know if you have it here it's called the pray itching the the man is normal the minute he says Allah itching itching itching itching playing until he finishes Salah then he's normal what kind of prayer is this he doesn't know who he is praying too if I give you a paper and say write what you know about Allah you'll probably write three lines that's it if I tell you write the attributes you know of Allah and explain them to me you don't don't know who you are worshiping you don't know Allah this is our biggest problem we know we know we know lots of good things we know Arabic but we neglect we fail to know our creator subah because if we do when we say allahar you start to tremble like one of the companions or the followers of the companions when he used to perform m he used to have a pale face his face would turn yellow and His companion said what's wrong are you feeling ill and he said don't you know who am I going to stand in front of in a wi from that time so to have it's not it doesn't start from uh saying allahar it starts way before and I think I did a talk in Birmingham on this subject so again you can get the lecture"
