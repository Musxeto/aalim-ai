  "transcript": "from Saudi Arabia she says that mashallah her daughter is getting proposals of marriage so can she make the answer isar first of all is to be done by the person uh involved so the proposals are not coming to you Sarah it's coming to your daughter so your daughter is the one who makes and she does not make until she accepts a proposal so if she gets five proposals and proposal number two is suitable and she's happy and satisfied with it she may go and ask uh uh for a meeting or an engagement and before that she makes but not on the five themselves because she has to pick one of them secondly um when you say that they propose to her from outside of the community so you get um different nationalities different uh ethnicities and you want to reject this so is this permissible or are we um not being grateful to Allah for sending us such um proposals the criteria that the prophet Alam said that whenever someone comes to you with satisfactory religious practice and moral commitment so two things his religion and his if they are accepted then you should give him in marriage he did not speak about wealth he did not speak about beauty he did not speak about ethnicity or nationality however people say and Scholars say that if this is against the norm in the community if her relatives would be offended by her Marrying an expat or marrying someone of A different race Etc and this would cause problems in this case you have all the right to refuse such such a proposal and it's not the end of the world and in my opinion so many times we've seen that such marriages face a lot of difficulties and sometimes end up in Failure when someone from Saudi Arabia marries someone from America different culture different uh uh way of thinking different environment she cannot drive she cannot do this she cannot go on her own Etc she's lonely she doesn't have friends and then ends up in marriage different to a person marrying someone from the community from his locality she knows the habits and the customs and what to cook and what to say in uh uh um different uh occasions and events it's a different ball game however if the woman is willing and the family is capable of coping and adapting and the man is accepted in his his religious uh practices and his uh moral conduct then there is nothing wrong in that and it's up to the father to decide mainly not for you uh Sister Sarah with all due respect because the man is the one responsible for giving the yes or no and this approval of his or decline what is what counts in a marriage your approval or decline does not affect the marriage at all and you have virtually no say except advice but it is the man's decision that counts here"
