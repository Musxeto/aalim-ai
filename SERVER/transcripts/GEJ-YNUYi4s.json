  "transcript": "all [Music] we're going to start with our second lecture for today by entitled Muhammad wasallam the messenger sheim who I guess many of you recognize from uh peace TV or Huda TV um Mah has been active in the DA for many many years he by profession is a a director in a in a company where he heads up a ha and PR function he's uh has Bachelor's in linguist Linguistics and his diploma in Islamic Studies from om University in meccah he's also visiting in a Masjid in jida and I guess many of you'll know him for his lectures on TV and various other places it's his first time he's joined us um in Bradford so inah encourage all the Bulls to take some time to give him a warm welcome the Sheik would like to speak for uh part of the time and also offer the opportunity for some questions to be answered after his lecture which would be taken by um just putting your hand up inshallah uh and the question will be taken inshallah and if the sisters have so they would please write them down and send them through to the brothers um to proceed in will start now [Music] [Music] the topic I will be addressing inshallah would be the messenger sallam and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said the most stingy of you are those who hear my name and that do not offer so whenever you hear the name of the Prophet you always say the topic is vast and it cannot be covered in a whole day let alone covering it in 40 minutes if you would like to talk about the prophet Alat wasam you have to devote your whole life to studying his Sunnah because he is not like any other man he has been chosen by Allah the almighty he is the mercy not to the Muslims not to the Believers but to mankind to the worlds and we will try to highlight some of the points that the prophet Alat wasam was awarded and given by Allah the almighty as a messenger the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said that I was given five things that no prophet of Allah before me had been given them so these are some of the five things or some of the things that our Prophet wasam was given by Allah but before going into this how many prophets of Allah are there or were there and how many messengers of Allah now and this shows you again the weakness of our knowledge our ignorance of the Quran for example we have a number of Messengers mentioned in the Quran and a number of prophets but is there an authentic Hadith that tells us how many prophets Allah sent to man how many Messengers there is a Hadith which was authenticated by a albani may Allah have mercy on his soul and others and some regard it as weak Hadith but as long as our IM in Hadith is a albani then we follow him whenever he authenticates a Hadith or whenever he grades a Hadith as weak and he tells us that in the Hadi of alari may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasam told us that Allah had 124,000 prophets and that's a lot of prophets 124,000 prophets among them there were 313 or 315 messengers of Allah and on top of them all is our prophet s he was given five things among them Allah made him Victorious by aw and fear of a distance of 1 month traveling distance of one month so before he went to fight his enemies to to reach them it would take him one month that distance his enemies would fear Him and he was not a tyrant sallallahu alaih wasallam he would not torture them he would not mistreat them but Subhan Allah it is the fear that Allah throws in the hearts of the enemies of this religion and he tells us that the second thing Allah made Earth means of purification and a place of worship and this was not done except to the prophet Alat wasam other religions they have to worship their lord in their places of worship Muslims whenever aan is called whenever it's time for prayer no matter where you are you can face the and pray whether it's a school it's a mall it's a park as long as the floor you cannot see something that is impure you cannot be sure and certain it is NES then it's pure just pray you don't need a carpet you don't need a mat pray anywhere this is the blessing and of Allah and if you don't have water to perform ablution is you're unable to wash then just strike the earth once wipe your face and hands this was given to our Prophet Alat wasam number three he tells us that the bounty of war that usually people get when they're victorious in a battle this is made permissible only to our Prophet Alat and his followers before that they used to gather all of this and put it in an open area and stay away where fire comes and consumes all of that in Islam No we aren't allowed to keep that and number four the prophet wasam was given the intercession better known as and what is the prophet intercedes on the day of judgment and there are a number of intercessions on the day of judgment but he is given this great stat and level because of his position from Allah Allah loves him most so all the people go to Adam peace be upon him asking him to intercede it's hot on the day of judgment every single human being will be gathered they're all they will all be gathered in one open area in one Plaza the sun will draw close to them it's hot here right it's a little bit hot on the day of judgment the sun draws so close to people they will sweat it will be only a distance of what do you call this sh yeah a handpan or whatever and they will sweat according to their deeds those who have good deeds the sweat shall reach their heels if their deeds are not as good their sweat will will reach their knees their waists and those who have no good deeds at all they will be blocked to their noses with their own sweat on that day the people are petrified they're terrified they want to relieve themselves from what they're suffering so they go to the to the prophets they go to Adam Adam tells them I have sinned I've have eaten from The Forbidden tree go to n they go to Noah and Noah says that I had a supplication and I made that against my people that Allah would drown them go to Abrahim go to Moses go to Jesus everyone throws it to the other until Jesus peace and blessing be upon him and all the messengers of Allah say go to Muhammad s wasam and when they go to Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam he says I am the man I will intercede and he goes and he intercedes and Allah accept his intercession he will also intercedes to people who Allah had cast them and thrown them in hell so that they come out he will intercede to people who they were judged to go to hell so that they don't go to hell he will ined to people who are in this level of paradise to be elevated upwards and he will intercede for his uncle Abu Talib who supported him who defended him but failed to embrace and accept Islam and died as a mushrik he will intercede for him so that he is not punished as much so he is the least person in hell to be punished his uncle and what is his punishment a stone of fire put in his shoes from its heat his brain boils the man is not in Hell he's in Hell physically but there's no fire around him it's only these two stones in his shoes and his brain boils from its heat his body conducts heat now and the problem is that the prophet tells us that he is among the least in punishment in hell so if Allah will forgive a person's fornication consuming of intoxicants stealing lying backbiting sleeping over fer prayer sleeping over prayer sleeping over all the prayers if Allah will forgive all of this but he subhah wa ta'ala decided to punish you for a cigarette you smoked then you have an idea of the punishment on in Hell he's the least to be punished so what will happen if Allah decided to punish us for all the sins we are doing it's a grave and serious thing the prophet goes on and the last and fifth thing that Allah has given him over all other messenges and Prophets is that he was sent to all mankind while all the messengers before for him were sent to their people he's the only Messenger to be sent to All ethnicities all Races all tribes not only that he was even sent to the Jin luckily we don't see them but we believe in them we believe of their existence and we believe that our messenger sallallah alaihi wasam was also sent to them the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam Allah has given him a status that is second to none and all around the world there wouldn't pass an hour without people mentioning his name somewhere or the other and that is his name is called five times a day while making thean So when you say you as well so you also say and this shows you how important the prophet Alat wasam is in Islam that his name is being always mentioned with the name of Allah but the biggest or one of the biggest mistakes that Muslims do and this happens a lot in Arabia and they elsewhere that when you enter a Masjid or you enter a house you would find people with enthusiasm to Islam putting the name of Allah Muhammad and this is not good the you will see Allah's name and Muhammad's name sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this is not good you cannot associate the prophet with Allah he's merely a servant and a messenger of Allah but when you put the two names those looking at it would say they're equal or at least equivalent to each other and this is serious this should not be we love him we follow every single move he did and we pray to Allah that we will be with him on the day of judgment but avoid anything that Associates him with Allah in the sense of shik you cannot have his name with the name of Allah on a wall or even uh uh elsewhere Allah called our prophet sallallah alaih wasallam in the Quran but he never called him by name he never said oh Muhammad he would always call him oh prophet of Allah or and this was mentioned three 13 times in the Quran or would say oh messenger of Allah and this was mentioned uh uh uh twice in the Quran but but you will never ever find Allah addressing him with oh Muhammad while if you recite the Quran you will find Allah addressing Moses Noah Jesus all the messengers of Allah with their names yeah mus yah Isa and he would not say to them yeah oh Prophet or oh messenger and Allah Asel forbade us from calling the prophet Alam Muhammad so you should not say and Muhammad came and Muhammad went sallallahu alaihi wasallam you always have to say and the prophet of Allah Muhammad or the messenger of Allah Muhammad so never fall into the mistake of calling him by name alone this is a sin Allah when mentioning the prophets he would always mention Muhammad our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam name first and this is mentioned in a number of verses of the Quran I do not like to go into details into them but whenever Allah says that we have revealed to the prophets before you and to you and to Noah ibraim Moses mosa and Isa our messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam we have to love him it is a must it's not a choice it's not something that you do voluntary it is part of your belief and your Iman to love our Prophet sallallah alaih wasallam more than you love anything else and that is why Allah says inah that if your fathers Sons Brothers wives your tribes the money you've earned the trade that you are afraid of losing the houses you like and live in if all of this were more preferred more loved by you than the love of the Allah and the prophet Alat wasam and the Jihad in his cause then anticipate Allah's wrath and Punishment you cannot love your wife more than you love your Prophet alham you cannot love your children your money but what does this that mean the prophet is not here anymore how do I love him more than I love anything else by following him by having the feeling that if he were to be among us I would defend him with with my life I would put my neck down just to defend him sallallahu alaihi wasallam that companion who was abducted by the pagans and was sentenced to death just as they were trying to uh uh put him just before putting him to death one of the pagans asked him and said do you like that you're now in your house with your wife and children in Medina and Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam is in your place do you like to have this exchange you're going to be headed in a few seconds now but do you like this and this companion of Allah this companion of our Prophet said by Allah I do not want I do not desire to be with my wife children in my home in Medina and the prophet in Medina is getting a thorn in his foot not even this little itch of a thorn rather than him being in my place you crazy he's the prophet of Allah my love to him is far greater than the love of anything that you could imagine and that is why the prophet saidat wasam no no one will be a mmin you will not a Believer until you love the prophet Alat more than you love anything even your soul that you have if you love him more than your soul you're a Believer and the prophet says also three things that if a person has he will taste the sweetness of Iman now does Iman does believe have a sweetness to it yes why don't you find the sweetness When you pray f for example some of us do after they pray two raat of f in the congregation they leave the Masid they feel that they have the whole world in their hands others finish all the prayers and say the Imam prolong the prayer it's hot it's I didn't like the smell of the carpets um the guy next to me you know he's itching all over through prayer I couldn't concentrate they don't find the sweetness among the three things that the prophet mentioned if you have it in in you these three things you will find the sweetness of Iman what are they the first thing that you love Allah and you love the prophet more than anything so you check yourself when someone talks about his Sunnah in front of you and ridicules it or makes fun of it or makes fun of the Prophet Alat is it part of integration to say yeah I disagree but is this the way you treat it no but also you don't kill the man you have to you know have it in between you have to show your disagreement and disapproval of this kind of talk but do not continue to talk you just leave but accepting it and and having a laugh or a smile this shows that you don't love the prophet also the prophet was the Imam not only to the Muslims but to all the messengers of Allah when he Sall Ali wasallam took the journey from mecah to he met all the prophets and he led them in prayer and this indicates to you that he is among the very best of the messages of Allah because leading people is one thing but leading the messages and and the prophets is is another thing his Nation us is the best among all other nations the prophet said Al that you his Nation complete 70 Nations before you at the sight of Allah you're the best of them and you most honorable to Allah among all the other nations the prophet tells usat wasam that Allah has blessed him that plague the illness the the disease the plague and the deal who's known as the Antichrist will not enter his Medina and there are angels with their swords protecting it so if you want to escape the make hij to Medina I'm not making an invitation is very difficult but yeah we can all dream and also the plague will never enter Medina the prophets Alam is the first that the Earth will open on the day of judgment for him to be resurrected so he's the first to be resurrected and he's the carrier of Al which is the flag of praising Allah and he's the one the first one to enter Paradise no soul shall enter Paradise before him and he's among the most to have followers of all Messengers of Allah it was reported in the Hadith the sah Hadith that Moses so peace be upon him a lot of people coming and he said who are the who are these are these my followers he said no these are the followers of Muhammad our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so he cried and he was asked why do you cry he said a lad comes after me and he has more followers than I do and we love our Prophet Moses sallallahu alaihi wasallam we love him a lot because if it weren't for him we we would be praying 50 prayers a day can you do this pray 50 prayers a day he said what did Allah tell you he said he told me 50 prayers were prescribed for your umah he told him go back to your lord go back to Allah I know the Jews your people are not better than the Jews they will not do it so he went up and down Allah is taking five every time until they were five only he told him go back your people will not be able to do it he said I'm bashful Allah I'm ashamed of going up and down to Allah and Allah made it five but with the reward of 50 and are we doing these five or we have 20% commission or 20% sale off fuder prayer come on is too early Allah Allah is most forgiving okay what about prayer is too late what about I'm at work I can't pray what about I'm on the way to home what about listen I have to sit with my family so lots of the people unfortunately do not pray on time there are lots of things to be covered I'll just say them in in in points our Pro Prophet as mentioned in the Quran he islim he's the first among the Muslims meaning the first to accept the call of Allah but before him there were lots of Muslims so all the followers of The Messengers of Allah they're called Muslims so so those who followed MSA at his time they're Muslims and those who followed Isa at his time they are Muslims because the religion at the side of Allah is Islam is submission the prophet wasam as mentioned in the Quran the people should love him and be and he should be closer to them more than themselves as mentioned that he is he he supposed to be closer to us more than ourselves and his wives are his wives are just to sure that people are not sleepy our mothers and this is only to the prophet Alam his wives are our mothers we cannot marry them the companions could not marry them and they are a the they have the status of our own mothers flesh and blood so we respect them and we do not tolerate anyone saying one negative thing about them as you do not tolerate anyone saying anything bad about your mother the prophet Alat wasam always said to us that whoever obeys me he has obeyed Allah the almighty so by obeying him by following his footsteps and teachings you are obeying Allah and there is nothing in his teachings that is not logical all of his teachings people by Nature even the non-muslims accept this look at his teachings and have a broad Vision when you look at it don't you know isolate yourself into one thing and say why is this Haram look at the whole religion and you will find that it is logical that it is accepted by everyone the prophet wasam is a mercy to all mankind and Allah has pledged subhanahu wa'ta'ala to protect his religion and to protect him personally he was protected and this is this goes without saying but his religion since 1430 years ago when he migrated to Medina up till the moment the religion is preserved the only book that people can without any doubt say that has not been altered or changed is the Holy Quran Arabs speak the language they understand it and no one can falsify it or say that there is this or that it is the perfect book and this was the Pledge of allaha it is a sin as mentioned in the beginning ofat to raise you your voice over his voice so the companions would never ever raise their voices at his presence and to us it is a sin to think other than what his teachings state so if someone says the prophet wasam said so and so so what do you think Subhan Allah what do you think I am I'm a Jew I tell you the prophet said so and so and you say what do you think definitely going to follow the Hadith so whenever you get a verdict or a point or a Hadith from the prophet if you were a Believer you should not think twice follow it because if you don't then it's even worse than raising your voice over his voice sallallahu alaih wasallam at the time of the Prophet Alat and he was the only one Among The Messengers that we know of he would the the the companions were instructed before you talk to the prophet Alat wasam you should pay charity this was mentioned inah Al so whenever you wanted to speak to him because the prophet everyone could speak to him so Allah instructed the companions so that you do not overcrowd on the prophet Alam before you go and speak to him or ask him a question pay charity not to the monks not to the priests not to the Masjid pay charity to any poor person it's an act of Charity and the only one who did this was Ali may Allah be pleased with him he gave some charity and went to speak to the prophet Alam and then Allah obligated this removed this so it became back again that everyone would talk to him normally the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam is the only messenger we know of that Allah gave him instructions not on Earth but also in the heavens all the other Messengers were revealed to when while they were on Earth but the prophet Alam took some Revelation when he was in the seventh heaven when Allah Asel prescribed these five prayers we are praying it was not prescribed here it was prescribed upstairs in the Quran Allah tell tells us that they ask you Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam they ask you and Allah is answering so Allah answered so many questions on behalf of our prophet sallallah wasallam of course we know about the his ascending to the seventh heaven and we know that about the isra going from mecah to uh uh M AA the question is which came first have slow motion so that they can what what was I speaking about hello see this is what you get okay which one came first is and this is the majority of Scholars say that he was first taken on a journey to uh Palestine to and then ascended to the seventh heaven I cath says no it's the opposite it's the other way around why is that he said when if he was taken first to and this is beside the point but it's an extra added value it's free when he was taken to Jerusalem or TOA [Music] he led the prayer he led the prophets and Messengers in prayer is that true okay when he went first to the first heaven to the first and he was met by Joseph by uh uh uh Yousef by Isa by Yahya by ibraim by Moses by IDR and by Adam in the first every time they meet him what did what was their question to the angels who's this and they would say this is Muhammad he said oh masallah welcome the The Good Son and the good nephew they've just prayed with him so they should have recognized him and that is why kathir says no it was the other way around he was first ascended he met them all and then he went from mecah to Medina uh to uh mid AA to Jerusalem and then he prayed and led them in prayer but again this is another issue the prophet tells us okay that's more than enough the prophet tells usam that each one of us has a Jin a a companion but Allah blessed him and this jinam what does Asam mean it has in Arabic two meaning either that the this Jin this accepted Islam so he instructs him only of good things and this is the most authentic opinion among Scholars and the second meaning of Aslam that means that I am saved and protected from whatever he tells me so he's he's still not a Muslim but I'm protected I'm safe but again this is not the most authentic opinion of Scholars we all know that the prophet wasam was given by Allah a miracle not one not two so many miracles among them is the Moon being split into two halves and this was not a camouflage or a trick a visual trick this is true it's mentioned in the Holy Quran in the Surah known as the time of the hour is near and the moon had split now we believe this though we had not seen it and I believe that it will come to reality one day if not yet that the scientists will discover that this took place physically and I've heard some reports from Dr zul andar and he is a one of the best four geologists worldwide he's a very well-known doctor and I spoke to him personally and he told me that he met a brother from Britain who saw a BBC documentary on this fact people from NASA saying that they are studying the Moon being split as if there was a a crack or an earthquake and they could not justify it but unfortunate up till the moment I could not allocate this documentary because if I if I can if I can this would have been a shocking news to everybody no scripture had described this because it only took time at the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam our Prophet had one of his miracles that he could see from behind his back and he tells us that oh people when you are praying try your best to be in line with each other with the shoulders because I Allah is giv me the power of sight I can see what's happening behind me and his vision sallallah alaihi wasallam his dreams are a revelation as we all know that there are lots and lots of things that were giving to the prophet Alat wasam and that we're giving to his followers but I'm afraid that this would prolong our stay in this beautiful uh free uh sunbathing and and SAA so I I would assume that you may have some questions that you would like to ask brother take the questions by just raising your hand and sisters can write them down as you can see there's a lot of questions already arrived um I'll start with some of these and then I'll take people one by one inshah brother what your [Music] Christian the brother is asking that people around here say that Allah created the world for our Prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and that he was created AI that when he was created first he was already a prophet of Allah Brothers I don't know how to say this but by Allah I claim and this is something Allah will question me on the day of judgment about this claim I claim to love the prophet Alat more than I love my family myself and the whole world by Allah I would pay anything to meet him to sit with him to kiss his feet s Alam by Allah I will go against the whole world declaring my love to him declaring my love to his Sunnah but I will not accept by by any chance that our religion is deviated from the straight path on the claim of loving him sallallahu alaih wasallam he himself refused that on the day that his last child died he was blessed with ibraim when he was 61 years old and he had no male offsprings living imagine in Arabia not having a boy and he was 61 years old when he died he felt devastated he said the heart is saddened and the eyes are full of tears and we do not say anything that this displeases Allah and by Allah by departing you ibraim we are saddened on that grieving day the sun eclipses that's the only time that the prophet had an eclipse in his life so the people said ah the sun eclipsed because his son died the son of our messenger Alat wasam he did not accept the people saying this and he said by Allah the Sun and the Moon do not eclipse for the birth of a person or for his death they are signs that Allah throw the O and fear in the in the believer's heart so that they would supplicate and they would go or get closer to Allah Asel he sallallahu alaih wasallam do not accept people diverting from the straight path so when we hear these people saying that listen Allah created the world for our Prophet Alat wasam if this was true we would be more than happy to circulate this but this is not loving the prophet Alat wasam this is going into extreme this is going into Allah said in the Quran that I have not created the Jin and the in except to worship me and you're telling me that he created the ins and the Jin and the worlds for the prophet Alat wasam this is a complete lie but unfortunately people Bank on such lies so that they grow their followers and you get people kissing the hands of their molana their sheh kissing their knees and I don't know go up or down it do bad things what is this is this our prophet's Sunnah no it's not claiming that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was a prophet when he was created this is true in the sense that Allah decreed and wrote everything on Earth 50,000 years before he created the Creations so so he was a prophet before he was created he was a prophet when he was created but was he prophesized no when he was 15 years old do you mean to tell me he was a prophet when he was 15 years old and he did not know it he was a prophet at the eyes of Allah but he did not know that he was a prophet until he was 40 years old than Allah people say the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is alive in his grave and claim is okay to ask the prophet directly for sh um how would you reply to this with and yeah okay now the prophet well I'll take that back so erase it uh life is divided into three categories or three stages the life we're living in which begins with our birth and ends with our death it's over a chapter is is gone and then you have the life of the Hereafter after we resurrected and it's either hell forever infinity or Paradise may Allah Grant you and I this reward forever in between there's a third stage known as Al which is a partition in Arabic Barak means a partition so it's a partition between this life and the Hereafter and in this life you are not alive in the sense that you don't eat and drink you don't make you don't go to uh uh work out and so on and you're not dead in the sense that you don't do anything it's a life in between and that is why the people in their graves are being either tortured or being blessed by Allah in the in this window that gets to them wind and good things from Paradise so it's either a window to hell or a window from Paradise that they are either enjoying or being Ted with now the question is the prophet is alive in his grave what do you mean by alive is he eating and drinking and going to the bathroom and coming back the answer is no he's not Allah mentioned in the Quran says you're dead and also they will die so he's dead otherwise why did we pray the the funeral pray prayer why did we bury him I hear lots of you know the MK sects in Islam they say the prophet is alive and I heard one of them one of their says if you say Muhammad 500 times every single day you will not die before you see him live and I said you mean in his dreams in your dreams no no you'll see him live I said live on concert what live where he said yes one of my Sheikh he's from a country and he's used to do this and when he went to Medina and he approached the grave a hand came out and it was the hand of the Prophet Alam and he shook hands and he gave him the Pledge of Allegiance oh prophet of Allah and I said then what he said that's all I told him he let go he said yes he shook hands with the prophet said you crazy pull him out if he's alive pull him out we have lots of problems in this world we would like to see him if he's alive he said yeah he's alive but I don't think he can come out so Subhan Allah he cannot come out but he can extend his hand to you maybe give him a photo an autograph sign the book for you this is crazy we're Muslims our religion is so easy we don't need clergymen priests and and people to tell us what to believe and what not to believe we have the Quran we have the Sunnah so this claim is false the prophet is dead and he does not know what is happening on our Earth so by supplicating to him by saying oh prophet of Allah I've been married for 20 years and I don't have a child grant me a twin boy and a girl please if you do this this is shik you're associating others with Allah because calling the dead and the the dead cannot hear you they cannot benefit themselves let alone benefit the living and Allah knows what um if the will not go to Medina what will happen to the people there at that time the Hadith doesn't tell us what will happen to the people of Medina but if the Dalal will come to them and he's unable to come to their city and he will not be able to come to meccah as well then this means that it will be a safe haven for the Muslims the Believers to go to be protected from his evil acts but what will they be doing they will be going with the lives um brother with a white heart what's the difference between a messenger and the prophet Scholars differed in this but the most authentic opinion is that the messengers have a message from Allah both are being revealed to by Allah but to come with a new message with a new law this is only for The Messengers the prophets come they are revealed to by Allah but not with a new revelation they're instructed and ordered to carry on with the previous message and law of the messenger before them so that is why we the the the bani is the sons of Israel they have lots and lots of prophets but not so many Messengers and that is why the prophet Alat told us that on the day of judgment there will come a prophet with lots and lots of followers and there will come a prophet with a group of followers and there will come a prophet with a follower or two and there will come a prophet with no followers at all so this is almost the most authentic opinion of Scholars a messenger comes with a revelation comes with a new law a set of uh uh uh Juris Prudence different than the message before him a prophet does not have this but he fulfills and he follows the teachings and the message of the previous Messengers [Music] the completion of the Hadith sahu alai wasallam said I hope this answered your question it doesn't okay let me translate this the first one is that if you love Allah and the prophet more than anything else this is number one the second thing that you love your brother in Allah for the sake of Allah you don't love him for anything else and I believe that in English they are a bit sensitive when we say I love you brother and said excuse me I'm straight well this is not intended in Islam here they say I like this person no love is something that has nothing to do with what people think I love the brother for the sake of Allah why is that is it because he's bulky and and masculine is it because he's funny is it because he's Rich he's rying a Ferrari is it because he is handsome no my love that is identified by the love in Allah because he prays F on time because he is so obedient and nice to his father and mother because he keeps connecting with his next of kin so he knows his uncles his cousins he visits them because he's generous because he gives for charity because I've never witnessed him saying one single lie he doesn't swear he is always clean and tidy this is what we call the love in the sake for Allah so this is number two number three the prophet says that if you hate to be or go back to disbelief and to whatever follows that such as Sin if you have this feeling that listen I've repented from from going to clubs and whenever someone says listen let's go to Thursdays or let's go to this club or that and I say I I find the resentment and hatred in my heart to such evil act as if I were to be thrown into fire it's the same amount I hate to go back as if as I hate to be thrown in fire if these three were in your heart Allah will make you taste The Taste the sweetness of IM um last question I've seen the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in my dream what does this mean for me the prophet sallallah wasallam told us that whoever sees me in his dreams then he had seen me through because Shan Satan does not impersonate me now Scholars say that this is an authentic Hadith but you have to describe the prophet properly so if someone says listen I've seen the prophet Alat man I love this man he looks like brother Shaquil O'Neil he's like 7 foot you know with bulky and B he was you know playing basketball this is not the prophet it doesn't fit this description another one says yeah I've seen the prophet as in my dreams but he was blonde blue eyes fair skin sorry wrong info someone says I've seen the prophet Alam and he was like you know Chinese like he's 4 feet five and his you know strange eyes he said this is not the prophet he has to fit the description of the prophet in general if this is the case then you've seen the prophet and this is a good sign a glad Tiding from Allah you should change the way you you live and follow his Sunnah but if you just had had seen the prophet but you you cannot describe him then this is not the prophet sallallah alai Al wasam last question from the floor uh this brother here [Music] I think the brother is referring to saying Muhammad when his name is mentioned during the of Friday we're not is is this true yes because we're not allowed to speak when uh uh the Imam is giving his oration he's giving his speech on Friday so if his name was mentioned sallallahu alaih wasallam do we say sallallahu alaihi wasallam the answer is no but you say it in your heart silently so it's you can't have it you know in the middle it's not not to say it at all and it's also not to say Allah and the guy says sorry what what did I do wrong so keep it to yourself keep it silent and inshallah this will suffice usah there's no more questions [Music] [Music] this is another topic what's the relation between Jin and Shan and can Jin control men this is a invite me again I'll do it for you inah uh the problem is that whether they can control you or not is not an issue the issue is that we tend to justify all our failures on Jin on Envy on evil eye and on black magic so I'm having a problem with with my wife we're always arguing she's nagging she nags like hell and I say yeah this is an evil eye people give me evil eye I I never can reconcile with her the my son fails in school it says my neighbors envy him I know I lose my job because of the recession this is Magic somebody's made a spell on me the I have a flat tire and my car is possessed it has a jimy in it I will recite a and watch it tremble and then the Jin is gone alhamdulillah this is not the case we are responsible for our failures but the fact is if you supplicate if you say thear of the morning of the evening before you go to bed before you go out of your house when you enter the Masjid when you enter the restroom when you do this when you do that there are a list ofar of remembrances of supplications say if you say them I guarantee you that nothing will come to you but if you don't then anything that happens you will blame it on the Jin do the Jin control yes if a person is not connected to Allah and he's indulged in sin and he's weak and his heart is never connected to Allah his heart is connected to the doctor whenever I have a problem whenever my son is is is is sick or my daughter is ill the first thing I do I rush them to the hospital and after the treatment for 3 4 hours and the medication I go home and I say let me recite faat let me recite the supplications now your heart is connected to the doctor and to the antibiotics and to uh uh uh the things that would make the temperature go down after getting all of this you ask Allah for help it's the opposite it's the other way around and Allah knows"
