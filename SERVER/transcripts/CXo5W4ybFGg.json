  "title": "Why do we say Prophet is Allah's slave in shahada? Is Prophet best of Allah's creations Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "ahmed's question is not clear he says that you know that in shahadah which is a testimony we say ash i bear witness that there is no god worthy of being worshipped except allah muhammad rasulullah and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of allah sometimes we say then i bear witness that muhammad peace be upon him is his servant and his messenger so he said can you expand a bit because some say when we testify that the prophet hassam is allah servant is allah's slave um that this means that he's the best of allah's creation because the term slave is the highest in worship to allah i would say that this interpretation is not generally correct means servant or slave but it does not entail that he is the best of all creations because even the angels say that we are allah's servants and slaves other messengers described in the quran to have said that we are the servants and slaves of allah azzawajal and allah has given us revelation etc so this is not a correct interpretation however there is no doubt that the prophet alaihi salatu salam is the best of the sons of adam so he's the best human being ever and whether he's better than the angels or not whether he's the best of allah's creation or not this is an issue of dispute but we believe that he is therefore there is no need to go to um other interpretations that are ambiguous and not crystal clear and allah azza knows best you"
