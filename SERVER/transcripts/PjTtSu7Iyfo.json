  "transcript": "another question the question is regarding the hydra hydra if someone is he want to do he yeah you gotta impatient between a hydra and to move from this country with his kids him and the ego husband and the husband is not ready to go with the wife is that allowed oh and courageous explain to me regarding hitter i just want to know what is he and your husband is is not willing to do hydra no because he said that he is not he's not prepared yet feel okay okay this is shannon as for your second question which is deals with hydra hydra in english is to migrate and the prophet is awesome migrated from Mecca to Medina because they wanted to kill him they did not allow him to practice his Deen and simply Allah instructed him to migrated to Medina before that he instructed the companions to migrate to Abyssinia so that they would be able to practice their religion freely is it mandatory for Muslims to migrate the answer is yes if they are not allowed to practice they are not able to practice their religion freely if they're able to practice their religion freely and if they're not intimidated and they are able to do that WA they do not have to migrate on the contrary it is not recommended for them to migrate so we come to the issue in the UK so many people come up to me and say sure we would like to migrate to Saudi Arabia we'd like to migrate to Egypt we'd like to migrate to so-and-so and I keep telling them no you should not do this you are living in a country that is giving you the right to worship Allah to make Dawa and there is no restrictions for you what else do you want or what you have to do is coexist give that WA make the hour to people you're able to practice Islam as free as you want this is the earth share but we would like to go to this Arab country or to that Arab country thinking that they would live an Islamic life and this might be a little bit better in some aspects but it's surely worse in a lot of aspects therefore I believe that migrating to five or ten years to some of the Muslim countries and raising your children on a particular way of life then coming back after 10 or 15 years and having this cultural shock to your children who see things that they are astonished with excuse me I believe that this is not quite appropriate therefore and if your husband is sending you for his and he's staying here to work and to do certain things and then he would catch up a year or two later I bet you he's going to marry a second wife so be careful stay with him either you go together or remain together and Allah knows best"
