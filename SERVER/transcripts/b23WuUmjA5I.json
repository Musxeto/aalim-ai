  "title": "If I move to non muslim country cuz I can do sins there easily, is this kufr? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh what is the ruling on someone who moves from a Sharia law country to a non Shar country simply because he can do things more easily such as going to nightclubs Etc would this be considered an act of cfer since he's choosing a country where he have to pay taxes and go to manmade CS but not out of necessity no there's no kufur in that at all you guys have a a problem with understanding what im is and what kufur is and this happens when when people don't go back to the basics so if you go back to the basics and learn your religion from scratch learn the fundamentals of the religion what Islam is what im is what isan is and know the things that consist of kufur shik hypocrisy that nullifies Islam and would impact it negatively then you can understand what you're talking about is sins major sins someone loves to go to Western countries where he could party get wasted he could smoke weed and do everything he wants to do not out of the belief that this is halal rather out of his weakness out of his ignorance out of his Evil Soul pushing him to do sins but he still has the essence and the origin of Islam and IM in his heart he's a sinful person there's no kufur and shik in that"
