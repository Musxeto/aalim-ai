  "transcript": "I have a question about so ACC holding TI of kinship I half Moroccan half German this means on the one side of family the one side is loaded with Moroccan Muslims the the other is loaded with German non-muslims and now the thing is I have many many second cousins third cousins and possibly even first cousins who I don't know it's not like I hate them or I just don't know them and recently I have started to give my to try my best to get the numbers but it's like so many people and in order to get the numbers I have to call this one can you give me this number then I call the second one can you can you give me that number and it's like a spider web so it's like the last last days I was I spent really hours searching numbers and just trying to contact people so now my question is with with distant relatives like non-muslims like second cousin non-muslims or so um or like second cousin or second or third cousin Muslims is it okay if I talk like all my mams and and my and my first cousins and tell them to passam around like tell him Salam alikum or like I can't know them all and it's it's not possible for me to move to to go to Morocco so like I really spent hours trying to contact people so know to at what extent of the family like how far must it go uh for for it to be for it to be sufficient to say sayam to everyone you see okay I I get your question first of all Allah Asel did not Place hardship Upon Us in religion so yes we are obliged to connect to our kinship Beginning by the closest then the furthest so my relationship to my parents come at first priority then to my siblings then to my uncles and aunts from both paternal and maternal side but my connection to my siblings is far greater and closer than my relationship to my uncles and aunts so I may call my siblings once every few days and check upon them invite them dine with them while my uncle and aunts I may call them maybe once every couple of weeks 3 weeks maybe a month maybe visit them once every 3 months or so my first cousins the sons of my uncles and aunts because they're same gender I cannot have any relationship or contact with the opposite gender with the females so my cousins are a lower priority so I try to call them once every few months and check check up on them maybe send them a text message if there's a wedding or an invitation we see them we talk to them and this is sufficient now second cousins and third cousins I may not contact them at all maybe I see them once in Eid once every year maybe even more than that depending on the circumstances because it is illogical and it's sometimes not practical to meet all of these people who I and they have no uh nothing in common and so on so don't put hardship upon yourself when alhamdulillah there is much ease"
