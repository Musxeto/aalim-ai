  "transcript": "uh sheriff uh is it mandatory that the father's name has to be included in this the name of the son so if for example uh if my name is so is it military that my father's name which is need to be added thank you okay the answer is no it is not mandatory providing that you're not named after someone else so if your name is labib and your father's name is mukhit and it should be abdul mukhit because we've studied yesterday that mukhit is allah's beautiful name so if you and in your fa final name is um chodri so being called labeeb chodri is okay my name is asam al-hakim my father's name is luqman so i don't usually use my father's name when i'm referring to two names only asam and the family name but if i want to be more specific i would say asam the son of luqman al-hakim that would be my full name so this is permissible but to go and make a detour and say yes my name is labib the son of ahmed this is a major sin and totally prohibited you have to be called after your father or your family name"
