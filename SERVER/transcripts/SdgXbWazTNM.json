  "transcript": "radan Ramadan welcome holy month Ramadan welcome Ramadan [Music] in few weeks time we will be with the grace of Allah blessed with the Holy and Noble month of Ramadan and un fortunately to a lot of the Muslims this beautiful month is perceived as a month of thirst and hunger and it's also perceived as a month where people get tired and they become lazy and they sleep most of the day and play most of the night Ramadan is unlike this Ramadan is a season where Muslims should prepare themselves before entering this season this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to do he used to fast most of the month that comes before Ramadan which is the month of shaan and when he was asked oh prophet of why do you fast this month he said that it is a month between the month of rajab and the month of Ramadan a lot of the Muslims seem to ignore or neglect it and that is why I would love to remember Allah be grateful to him by fasting this month of shaan so this is one means of preparation for the month of Ramadan that is by fasting the month that predes that precedes it so that it would be like a training session for you the month of Ramadan this year means to a lot of the Muslims living in the west especially in Europe that they may have to fast for 18 or 19 hours and this is a lot but those who were blessed by Allah those who are blessed by Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to look at it as a season of opportunities for them only to seek and seize they would not feel a thing at all this life is a test and every single form of worship we offer to is also a test it might be difficult in the beginning but when we reap the fruit of it we find that all what we have done all the effort all the times that we've been tired hungry or thirsty it has all gone and nothing remains except a beautiful memory and a great reward at the side of Allah most of us have debts have problems have illnesses have needs and we don't seem to get the answer to our problems because we are not asking the right questions and we're not asking the people or we're not asking those who can answer our problems in Ramadan it is a gift from Allah where you can find all the solutions for your problems and all the answers for your questions if you knock on Allah's door eventually it will be opened and your requests will be answered only in the month of Ramadan so we have about 28 days to the month of Ramadan write a list of what you want try to gain your thoughts and gather them so that you know what to seek from your Lord the Almighty because soon when Ramadan comes you have to be certain that this is the time for your wishes and hopes and prayers to be answered the prophet saidat that among those whom Allah answers their prayers and supplications among them is a person who is fasting when he breaks his fast so imagine yourself few minutes before the sunset before breaking your uh fasting few minutes before your ifar imagine yourself with all the burdens and troubles you carry on your shoulder when you sit there in humility when you sit there in poverty to Allah's generosity raising your hands praising Allah giving salutation to the prophet Alat and asking Allah for whatever you want knowing that Allah will answer your call knowing that Allah would give you what you have asked for if you do this every single day until the month of Ramadan is over by the grace of Allah your call will be answered your problems will be solved and your questions inshallah with the grace of Allah would find an answer to them this month of Ramadan is a month of worship of giving charity of night prayer not only that it is a month of forgiveness it is it is a month of pardoning others it is a month of excelling and doing your best at your work and in your studies so that non-muslims would look and say Subhan Allah he is hungry and thirsty and he did not have a bite for 12 or 14 hours and look at him Masha Allah he is doing his level best to improve and to excel in his job this is a wonderful religion compare this man to that who comes to work late and leaves from work early and whenever he is assigned to do something he complains that he's fasting and you people don't have any Mercy what kind of an impression he would leave about Islam in their sight so this is an opportunity for us to take I know that we are a month ahead but you cannot go in the field and expect to do good results in a match if you did not have the proper training the month of shaan is a suitable month for you to train by fasting as many days as you can by dedicating more minutes and hours to your night prayer at night so that when Ramadan comes you are feeling at home and you would utilize it to the very best I pray to Allah Asel that we reach Ramadan in piety in righteousness and in fear of Allah and that Allah would grant us the full utilization of our time to recite the Quran to make thicker to fast as Allah would loves us to do and to give charity and to pray night prayer in and in and with the grace of Allah we will be able to attain night prayer in the night of decree and which is better than a thousand months of worship and whoever does this Allah would forgive their sins and I pray to Allah that we would be among those who their sins would be forgiven and Allah knows that and we [Music] will Ramadan [Music] m [Music]"
