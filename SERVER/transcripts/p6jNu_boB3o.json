  "transcript": "uh so SCH so scholar say that it's not permissible to make with water that has changed color or smell even due to things like perfume or MK so my question is like when I put perfume or M for example in my wrist or behind my ears and I when I when it's a time for prayer and I I do do when I wipe my ears the water reaches the place where I put the perfume and smell perfume comes out does this make my my life would invalid first of all sufyan you must not come or jump to conclusions you have to learn and understand what you learn and this is why it's dangerous sometimes to learn from teachers who do not explain the full picture for you what you've heard is correct when we talk about a an amount of water that we perform woodo with so we can only perform wood with water what if the color or the smell or the taste of this water changes if the three one of the three characteristics color smell and taste if one of them changes with an impurity this is totally Haram to use it's the whole thing is n capish understood yes no problem okay we come to the second part if the water changes one of its characteristics with a pure substance ah it's different so this mug I put in it a drop or two of lemon it tastes lemonade but it's not lemon it's water still or I put some flour or I put some rose water it smells nice tastes nice it's still water I can still perform wo a drop of musk fell into it no problem but if I bring a tea bag and I soak it and I throw it out tea is pure the characteristics color taste and smell has changed can I perform woodo from this the answer is no why because now this is not water with a drop of musk this is tea so it's transformed totally to a different substance it's not water it's called tea so your question has no place in our situation because you're performing wood the musk is under your ear or on your cheeks I wash my face the water covers all of my face and I can smell the musk no problem it has no impact on this being being called water or the water in my hands being called water or the water on my face being called water and I hope this answers your question"
