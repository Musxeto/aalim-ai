  "transcript": "or a scholar dies leaving behind videos and photographs of himself and then a woman falls in love with the sheikh so would he be sinful in his grave wallahi i yet to see a sheikh that would fit such a description not only that i'm yet to see a woman who's so nuts so crazy to fall in love with a dead person like that of course this is not applicable uh brother so hey brother labe simply because it's hypothetical secondly because men are not obliged to wear the nikap and the hijab allah did not order them to cover their faces no matter how handsome and beautiful they are so whether they are alive or dead there is no sin on them none whatsoever"
