  "transcript": "Ahmed says am I obligated to pay off my father's debt if he enforces me to pay it on his behalf before or after he dies what if it's interest-based debt now financially speaking you have no obligation towards your father's debts big or small you're obliged if you're earning to provide for your father to provide for your mother and to give them a decent life if they need a house they can afford it you do that for them if they need allowance if they need food if they need medical care and they cannot afford it you have to do that if they are well off and they have the financial means to attain all of this then it is not an obligation upon you you don't have to do this but if you do it out of your own free will as a good gesture as a payback for the the there's so many things that they have given to you that's being dutiful and it's good but am I obliged to pay off their debts the answer is no second question if these debts are interest based so my father takes a mortgage on the house or buys things through financing it through interest based loans from Banks or financial institutions am I obliged to pay them off if he forces me to do so the answer is no you must not do that because you'd be collaborating with him in paying interest which is a major sin in Islam the only possibility is that if he took a loan out of ignorance in his remorseful he's regretful and he's not happy with it and he wants to pay it off and pledges not to do this again in this case yes when you see that he's sincere you may help him to pay off his debt and Allah Knows Best"
