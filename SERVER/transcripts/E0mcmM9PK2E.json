  "transcript": "and welcome to the 21st class to of the islamic faith and today we will talk about one concept a concept of islam which is quite important and a lot of the muslims don't consider that to be part of al-qaeda mainly due to their ignorance and due to the vicious attack that people usually launch against islam accusing it of being a religion of intolerance etc and i don't think that it would be appropriate to go through all of these things because the time is quite limited and as we've stated before that this chapter or this book for swollen filament is very important for us to know what is our it is not to discuss the different factions in islam or to discuss the disputes among scholars because this would take ages a lot of the time when you ask people maybe beginners and students of knowledge what is your akida he's baffled he doesn't know the answer because he has been studying the disputes and difference of opinion the different deviant sects and cults of islam while this may and i say may make him lose his own compass he doesn't know what is what his atheida truly is so uh in this book it simply highlights what your conviction what your happiness should be in a very simple and easy language so chapter 13 deals with jihad and what is jihad to begin with so jihad is to put some effort to exert some form of effort and in legislative terms it is to fight in the cause of allah azzawajal to make allah's word supreme and it has different types so it's not only limited to battlefields you make jihad against satan you make jihad against your own evil soul by forcing yourself to do forms of worship and avoiding haram and what displeases allah you make jihad against the hypocrites by exposing them refuting their false claims you make jihad against the disbelievers in the battlefield and you make jihad against the sinners among the muslims by enforcing virtue and righteousness and forbidden forbidding evil and vice so there are different types of jihad but generally speaking whenever the word jihad pops up we mean by it to fight in the cause of allah and the sheikh goes to say jihad continues until the end of human life and remains in force all of the time as long as the quran remains this means that jihad is not for a particular period of time is not limited to a specific area of land and this is why some scholars made jihad to be the sixth pillar of islam there's no hadith as such but they all know and acknowledge that jihad is better than voluntary hajj voluntary fasting voluntary prayers jihad is the peak of iman because it causes a person to sacrifice not only his wealth but also his life in an authentic hadith the sheikh says a group of my community continue to fight for the truth prevailing until the day of judgment they will fight for the truth and allah would make them prevail until the day of judgment meaning this a group of muslims will always exist throughout history different locations different languages different different ethnicities but they will always fight for the cause of allah for the truth and allah would make them winners and they will be prevailing until the day of judgment when jihad is to repel an attacking enemy it does not require permission by the leader or the for formulation of the right intention now let us analyze jihad is divided into two types offensive and defensive at the beginning of the time of islam both types of jihad were prohibited so there were no offensive nor defensive jihad in mecca the muslims were ordered not to fight back the reason very obvious if a hundred or two were to fight back thousands of disbelievers of idol worshippers they would have annihilated them which would cause islam to be destroyed forever and this is the pivotal point this is the cornerstone that most of those freedom fighters those rebels those wannabe jihadis cannot understand whenever i comment and i don't comment from my own self i ask scholars and scholars relay to me from the quran the sunnah and i try to explain it to you i do not have the audacity to say i did this i did that i know i i don't i report what is in the quran the sunnah according to the understanding of the three favorite generations so when i talk about not going into jihad if this would lead to the annihilation of the muslim community and then i get lots of attacks of people accusing me of being wahabi of being madhali of being this of being that my my skin is getting thicker i don't care what you say because i don't say it to please you or please them or them i try my level best to do what pleases allah azzawajal jihad is divided into two types offensive and defensive and in the beginning of the time allah azza prohibited the muslims to defend themselves in mecca in order to preserve islam when they went to medina for a number of years it was defensive then after al-ghanda the trench the prophet the battle of the trench the prophet said assam now we conquer them and they don't it went into the offensive now jihad cannot be done except under the flagship of an imam of a muslim ruler who has an army who has a country established who has power and authority not any tom dick or harry coming from the jungles or from the mountains ruling a group of warriors claiming that they control this area or that country and they are a state this is ridiculous so offensive jihad has to be under the flagship of a ruler and it has to be with the intention of fighting for the sake of allah according to the sharia of allah to have the name of allah the word of allah prominent overall defensive jihad is when the enemy of the disbelievers attack us so if we are in a country if we are in a city if we are in a village we have to all fight and we are not going to wait for the instruction of the muslim imam so even if the muslim imam says oh don't don't fight surrender no we have to fight providing that we would protect ourselves and our families and our wealth and the responsibility of all muslims around us is to come and join us in defending our lands and our people and if they don't then this is the sin of the muslim population well actually the muslim governments so when we see what is happening in in the very beginning in al andalus and how it was lost and how the muslims did not do anything about it and now it's called spain and when we look at palestine and how the muslims still date are not doing a thing about it on the contrary they're doing a thing not to be freed from such occupation then we know how sinful they are then we look at different countries and different regions the same story goes on and on and on so the defensive war or jihad the sheikh says it does not require the permission of the leader or the formulation of the right intention so what is your intention one is not supposed to say well i intend to fight so that allah's word is supreme etc no this type of defense ashik says it is sufficient that it is undertaken to remove and repel harm and aggression this is the sufficient intention like when i have an adjacent on my hand if i go out in the rain and it washes off the najasa without me intending it would that be valid answer is yes even if there is no intention the removal of najas did take place and that's it likewise when i fight an offensive disbelieving army coming to attack me my intention would be sufficient just to repel them by saying that i'm doing this to um i'm undertaking this to remove and repel harm and aggression it is obligatory even if it is to defend one's honor life or property according to the hadith the prophet said whoever is killed defending his property is a martyr and whoever is killed defending his family himself or his faith is a martyr and the hadith is given in a shorter form into sahih anthologies which means that this was reported by imam bukhari and muslim if i'm not mistaken in a longer version now the sheikh says it is a duty to repel an aggressor in defense of one's honor honor here means either your reputation or which generally is understood your women folk so if one is protecting his honor from someone wanting to rape his wife sister mother daughter this is your honor so it is a duty to repel an aggressor in defense of one's honor self or property property means house wealth car whatever whether the aggressor is a muslim or a non muslim a man came to the prophet and said what should i do if a man comes aiming to take my money to take my property so the prophet says remind him of allah meaning fear allah what you're doing is haram you will go to hell for stealing my money the man said suppose he turns a deaf ear the prophet said allah then seek the help of those muslims who are close to you the man is adamant to steal my money so i would shout i would call muslims to come to my assistant the man said what if there is no muslim close by no one is coming to my assistance the prophet said al-sussam then seek the help of government authority call 9-1-1 call the police of course these are in cases that you would be able to go for such options the man said and if the authority takes no action to help me the prophet said then fight to protect your property until you are either killed and be a martyr or you keep your property safe now this hadith is talking about protecting your own property one may argue and say i'm not talking about an enemy invading my city or my country i'm talking about personally so if someone tries to mug me to steal what i have even if i have only like five euros in my pocket or an empty wallet but it has my driving license the hadith is crystal clear you try to remind him of allah you try to call people to help you you try to get the authorities to to prevent him from doing that but at the end of the day then you have to fight this is an issue of dispute among scholars whether it is a is it a must yeah and if someone tries to mug me personally and i have a hundred dollars five hundred dollars a thousand dollars in my pockets and i know that he's insisting an adamant to cause harm if i don't give him my wallet would i fight him knowing the consequences maybe there is no cctv cameras maybe there are no witnesses maybe i am a stronger person he doesn't know it and i have a trick or two down my sleeves and i can inflict harm maybe kill him what would happen afterwards maybe i would be indicted for murder and manslaughter because i can't prove that he wanted to mug me sometimes you don't get time to think many times i would personally say here's my wallet take it it's not worth me killing you so some scholars say no this is an obligation you have to fight this is your god-given right if you don't you're opening the door for reoccurring such incidents because you chickened out if you didn't chicken out you simply gave it without a fight others say no this is not entirely true because this hadith and the hadith before it who's ever killed defending his money he's a martyr meaning don't give away your money this hadith needs for us to read the quran the sunnah to know whether it is as it states or there are other hadiths governing it for example the issue of defensive jihad lots of them rebels and freedom fighters cause hardship to their communities because they think that it is a duty to fight the corrupt regime or the kafir government or the kafir army if you take a look at the devastation that took place in aleppo syria your heart bleeds and before that if you look at chechnya and what the russians did to it your heart bleeds it's a war zone built there isn't a single building or a single square foot of the pavements on the street without any fallen buildings and debris why they said we had to fight the aggressor we have to defend our people did you manage to do that is the people's life better now or before i'm not at all condoling the kafir government or the russians or the syrians or the libyans or the yemenis i'm just asking your course of action has a consequence now how many consequences do we have here how many scenarios do we have one you fight back the result that the vast majority of the youth are killed there is no hope for you at all to win because definitely there is no balance of power and islam is the biggest party being negatively affected those who say that no we have to fight we have to uh defend ourselves no matter what happens listen to these two ayahuas prophet urge the believers to battle encourage them if there are among you 20 who are steadfast they will overcome two hundreds and if there are among you 100 who are steadfast they will overcome a thousand of those who have disbelief because they are a people who do not understand what is their issue one to ten in islam in the beginning if the enemy army was ten times bigger than your army or less you must face them and fight them if it was more than ten times you're exempted to run why run to preserve islam to preserve the power of the muslims instead of being annihilated and destroyed after that allah abrogated this ratio 1 to 10 immediately the following ayah listen to it allah says now allah has lightened the hardship eased the hardship for you and he knows that among you is weakness so if there are from you 100 who are steadfast they will overcome and if there are among you a thousand they will overcome 2 000 by the permission of allah and allah is with the steadfast what does this tell you it tells you that allah azzawajal has lessened allah has reduced the amount to double so if the enemy army is double our size we have to fight but if they are a bit more this is when we must refrain and are permitted to take sides or run or regroup or whatever now this is the quran so when you watch those rebels and freedom fighters saying no no no we have to fight how many are you we're a couple of hundreds how many are the forces of the enemy or they're like a hundred thousand and they have a nuclear bomb and they are ruthless they don't care about women children elderly they would do anything so are you telling me that by throwing them with a rock or a molotov bomb by burning a car you are actually doing jihad what would that lead yeah i know they're going to destroy my neighborhood and they're going to demolish my parents house and my cousins and my grandfathers and all those who are around us i know that they will break into every uh house in the neighborhood and may rape some women and but this is jihad we have to tolerate we have to be patient we have to suffer in order to prevail is this what islam says of course not but these people don't understand they don't have knowledge they don't want even to ask so we have scenarios fight you know what's going to happen if you know that you're the are the underdog and you cannot win don't fight and wait until you gain the power the knowledge the know-how get into the system live your normal life not accepting the occupation but until at least you feel that you have something on the ground yes if they invade you you have to fight but when it reaches to a stage where you know that this is not going anywhere then you have to surrender not because islam is a religion of weakness islam is a religion of benefit where is the benef the advantages take much as possible where are the disadvantages block it and lessen it whom i'm named after who happens to be the grandfather of awesome ibn was with six of his companions going with a group of a hundred maybe disbelievers who [Music] told the prophet hassam that they needed someone to teach them about islam because they're considering islam so he sent them with them in the middle of the way they took their weapons and surrounded them telling them either surrender or we will kill you if you surrender we're not gonna harm you asam did not surrender and he said not a single kafir would touch me so they killed him two of the companions surrendered and one of them is khabib al-ansari and the other one was may allah be pleased with them all so we know that surrendering is not a sign of weakness especially when you see all what is happening in the battle of motta it was reported that the muslims were a couple of thousands or three thousands and the romans or the byzantians army was in the hundreds of thousands they managed to make a trick and retreat and the people of medina started the kids throwing them with stones saying that you are the fugitives you they are the one who ran away and the prophet said no they are not the fugitives they are not al-farah rather they are a korar they will come and fight again they preserve themselves to fight again with the prophet saws what would have they gained if they were to fight and die all of them nothing yes they will each go to jannah but what is the benefit for the muslim ummah nothing so you have scenarios that you have to choose from and this is why scholars say that the people of palestine for example must not fight at the moment the israelis the kafirs the disbelievers because they are well armed more armed than them they have airplanes they have tanks they have manpower they have an army backed by you know who what do the muslims have nothing slain shots maybe a rocket or two that the accuracy is five six miles instead of a couple of meters so they do these attacks what happens they bomb civilian neighborhoods killing women children elderly we all weep we are angry a few weeks later everything is normal this is not proper jihad so again let us i'm i'm distracted i'm all over the place so let us go back maybe i will try to focus a little bit so when it comes to defensive jihad we reached there when we said that whoever fights defending his wealth is a shaheed so the question was that was popped earlier can i give him my wallet and maybe save the day not fight not cause any problems the most authentic opinion is that you can because money and wealth is retrievable unlike if he wants to attack your honor your woman folk this is something that you have to die without allowing because this is not retrievable but your wealth it's retrievable your religion if he forces you to say the word of kaphor this is retrievable say it because you're forced you're compelled and we've gone through that before but your wealth almost the majority if not the consensus of scholars of hadith that the hadith of fight defending your wealth and if you die you're a martyr this is not general there is an exception to that and one of the exceptions is by the consensus of scholars of hadith or the vast majority of them is when the muslim ruler takes your money so it's happening nowadays the muslim ruler is taking our wealth without us being happy against our will so should we consider this to be a cause to fight back and to die defending my wealth scholar said no give it to him and allah will compensate you for it why because by doing so you keep the unity together and the ummah will benefit from your sacrifice though it would be harmful for you but there will be some uh benefits in order to preserve the unity of the ummah and he will be punished on the day of judgment also the issue of someone wants wanting to kill me or to fight me there is a hadith of abu musa may allah be pleased with him when times of fitna arrive and someone breaks into your home wants to fight you the prophet said allah said break your sword and take a sword of wood that has no power and if he wants to kill you and you're afraid of the reflection of his sword cover your face and be like the best or the better man of the sons of adam meaning the victim who was killed and if you wish also at the end of time when gog and magog come out and they kill everyone on earth who's there to fight them back you know that it is isa peace be upon him jesus and the believers do they fight back defending their religion their property their honor allah reveals to him go to the mountains because these creations of mine you have no power over them you can't stand in front of them so he runs because allah orders him to do that in order to save the muslim population these evidences authentic everybody knows them nobody applies them because they're bloodthirsty they just want gender we all want china but we want janna through quran and sunnah not through our own wins and desires and again i always repeat my answer my question that i give in my counseling sessions do you want sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires all of these or most of them don't follow shaya they follow their whims and desires and this is what is causing harm to the muslim [Music] okay when the muslim community is on the offensive the intention must be to make allah's word supreme so this is a condition in order for your offensive jihad to be accepted by allah that allah's name to be a word to be supreme in an authentic hadith reported by abu musa al-assadi pleased with him states a bedouin came to the prophet and asked messenger of allah a man fights for a share of war gains and one fights so as to gain a reputation and one fights so that he is seen meaning noticed which of these is considered for allah's cause the prophet says he who fights so that allah's word is supreme is fighting for allah's cause and this is a very important hadith highlighting the main condition of offensive jihad no one can wage war against another country unless there is a muslim ruler it's a muslim's flag that he's fighting under and the reason is not to gain territory is not to gain wealth but it's not to be famous it's not because there are countrymen and we're defending our country etc it is to make allah's word supreme in jihad it is obligatory to obey the leader of the muslim community provided that he does not order anything that is forbidden in islam now this is an issue many deviant sects had gone against they claim that it is a must that the muslim ruler we fight under his flag has to be a practicing muslim ruler and sunnah say this is not true a muslim ruler whether he is a sinner or righteous we have to follow him in jihad we have to follow him in hajj and we have to follow him in prayer so this is his right upon us regardless whether he drinks alcohol or fornicates or sins or gambles or does whatever he wants to do as long as he's a muslim we have to obey him especially in going to jihad the prophet salallahu salaam said whoever obeys me obeys allah and whoever disobeys me disobeys allah whoever obeys the commander i appoint meaning the imam the ruler obeys me and whoever disobeys the commander i appoint this obeys me so the issues of jihad cannot be taken lightly cannot be taken in a way that some extreme say that jihadis barbaric is not democratic is not something positive to do while others go to the extreme and saying that we have to do jihad we have to fight and die fighting regardless of the environment of the conditions of whatever those who say such things both don't know islam properly we call it jihad they call it fighting for democracy fighting to defend our values this is what they usually say so america can wage war why to protect its interests to honor its values to defend democracy to do this or to do that and it is so funny when they say what they are saying and then they condemn jihad so their fighting is justifiable us defending our lands in palestine is terrorism when we want to help our brothers and sisters in kashmir in china in everywhere the muslims are being oppressed this is interfering in others affairs they are the big father they have the power and they have the ability and they need no permission to invade a country like iraq destroying it totally killing more than a million people and then then saying oops we thought there were weapons of mass destruction but the reports were misleading we didn't find anything okay we'll compensate for the million killed of course nobody with a superpower we don't do this we were fighting for our values we fight for democracy and for human rights even if this leads to annihilating humans at least we have the rights remaining all of this is a lot of bs but when it comes to jihad to the quran to the sunnah to honor humans to liberate them from worshiping other than allah they condemn that and they tarnish the reputation of islam so we have to be proud of our akita we have to raise our heads and walk with our heads held up high islam is a religion of peace without weakness of strength without violence of pride without arrogance islam is the religion that everybody is afraid of because it doesn't change colors it is open to all to see its agenda is crystal clear we don't have to double talk we're straightforward unlike the politicians unlike the disbelievers unlike those who have hidden agendas our agenda is open to all to see and this is why they're terrified of it and allah's best we have 15 minutes or less to go through some of the questions and this is from abdul rahim he says if i apply for u.s or canada visa and when i get it i seek for asylum but the only way is to lie and is that haram to allah to lie for citizenship yet on my heart i'm lying but looking for a good life to support my family i feel to annoy allah of course if you lie you're committing a major sin if you lie claiming that you are gay or you are christian so that they would have sympathy to you and give you asylum this is a major sin that may take you out of the fold of islam for what i need a better life i want to live the american dream oh masha allah i thought you were starving no no she have a good job but you know in my country we are not respected we're this we're that yeah you cannot migrate to a kafir country leaving your muslim country and you cannot lie to the authorities in order to get asylum how do people like this think i remember like 10 years ago or maybe more a minister in the uk government i forgot his name is a short wicked person um he came in public saying that a woman who's anikabhi who's pregnant was asking for benefits being not married is this possible he says she's a liar she's married she has four kids her husband is living with her but because they didn't register their marriage so she's claiming benefits ready to lie being an hobby pregnant just to get a couple of hundreds of pounds look how cheap islam is to such people willing to compromise their religion willing to say they're gay or their christian or their disbelievers or whatever willing to insult islam for a couple of uh hundreds of dollars or pounds may allah protect us uh muneeb says what is the ruling of beard and what about its length the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory to grow the beard this is the consensus of all schools of thought that it is not permissible to shave it and it has to be left whether to shorten it or not it's an issue of dispute but shaving it is totally prohibited by all four schools of thought and evidence backing this up the prophet has some instructions to leave it honor it to let it go let it be so if someone is by nature in his genes he doesn't have beard do we say put fertilizers or put medication to grow it no just leave it about the length as i stated earlier it's an issue of dispute the vast majority say just leave it like it is there is a hadith by bin umar and some also attributed to abu hurairah that even um whenever he performed hajj he used to understand the ayah and surah that you will shave and shorten shave your hair heads and shorten he understood shortened to refer to the beard so he used to whenever he performs hajj take a fist of his beard and cut whatever is access of it but this was again his understanding the prophet aslam had never cut short his beard and he had a very wide thick beard the companions as well so this is the most authentic opinion that you should not take anything of it unless it grows to an extent that endangers your safety so if you have a beard that is this wide and this long this is a problem to those who are eating who are driving who are riding when the beat comes in their faces and in their mouths and it may jeopardize their safety if they're working on a machine in this case their safety is a priority they may shorten it at least to have two fists or something of a normal length instead of that exaggerated one and a lot of knows best shah burhan [Music] don't get clear according to the quran the hadith first of all there are no salafi sect it's not a school of thought it's a conviction it's a belief you follow the quran or of the seraph do they come and say we don't do takhlid what is to imitate to follow the verdict of someone this is not true even some of the hardcore the hardcore salafis due to it so they say yeah we don't do it to the schools of thought of abu hanifa malik and we are free thinkers and with this with that at the end of the day they follow we all do so in essence we at some point of time have to do takhleed but our taklad is not blind following it is to lead through evidence so do you share follow abu hanifah i personally do follow abu harifah and i do follow imam malik and i do follow imam shafi and i do follow muhammad when what they say coincides with the authentic hadith and it goes side by side with the quran i follow them in that particular issue and that is but to blindly follow one school of thought whether good or bad whether right or wrong this is what negative takhlid is and this is what a muslim must not do unless he is a complete layman who doesn't know anything about islam pothik says as you said if i'm not wrong after prayer in the part of asia we put our hands up for dua it's innovation our prophet please say once more sorry for this allah i would advise you people to try and write in good english so that i can understand whether this is a statement or a question it's an innovation our beloved prophet never did it then question marks is it a question or a statement nevertheless if you go through the books of phil and before that if you go through the books of seerah the biography of the prophet and before that if you check the books of hadith you will never find that the prophet allah had ever after every for prayer raise his hands and make dua like most people in the hanafi school of thought do whether in the subcontinent or in syria lebanon in the levant region or in egypt you will never find or in turkey you'll never find this present in the hadith so what do we base our belief and conviction on quran simple as that i'm not going to follow what my father used to do or how my f grandfather used to pray because they don't have knowledge where did they pick it up from from their ancestors and if i go to another region i'll find people praying differently and they picked it up from their ancestors this is not possible the truth at the side of allah is one it is not something that is reoccurring so it can't be two or three types of truth it's one but people may differ in understanding it or realizing it people people may find a different opinion which is not true but this is the best of their ability so we have to be really careful in following the truth rather than following blindly different schools of thought or are ancestors if the prophet had never ever reported to raise his hand after every fourth prayer nor abu bakr roma uthman or adi or the companions where am i getting this from where are you getting at this from you say i don't know you tell me no i'm not gonna tell you you're the one who's doing it prove to me show me some evidence from the quran and if you fail then you should know that this is an innovation which is not part of the sunnah and you are better off avoiding it so the last question ramar farooq says if i eat three times a day and say bismillah and the dua after eating that we say and gets our sins forgiven would that day be better in terms of reward or the day i fast voluntary or um you cannot calculate such things with a calculator when you deal with allah azzawajal you don't go to such extents and hypothetically saying okay so if i say bismillah and i eat and so if i eat five meals this means that i've erased my sins five times how about if i eat seven meals small small meals these hypothetical questions are not beneficial fasting one single day takes your face far 70 years away from hellfire the distance of traveling 70 years your face is kept away from hellfire what can be more than that allah says all the deeds of the son of adam is his or his except fasting it's for me and i reward for it what can be better than this so at the end of the day definitely fasting is better than eating three days and saying the dua because at the end of the day when you break your fast you're gonna eat and you're gonna make the dua so it doesn't make any sense at all to compare this to that and allah azza knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's class until we meet on monday is it yeah monday inshallah i'll leave you for my"
