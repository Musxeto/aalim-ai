  "transcript": "when I choose someone to marry my daughter I trust him I give him the most precious thing in my life my daughter and likewise when I treat my wives I treat them in a way that their parents entrusted me with their daughter so I should never betray that trust I should give her the best life treat her the best way I can I fail but I tried okay we move on to the third fourth fifth Cooperative in learning obeying Allah and Advising if a girl marries a man she wants her man to cooperate with her why a practicing sister her vision her Mission her statement is I want someone to take me to paradise I don't want to live here for forever can we live on Earth forever our days are counted we have very few days left Allah a th day 100 day one day Allah Allah knows best so she wants someone to be cooperative in learning in obeying Allah and in advising so she needs a mentor she needs someone to help her but if she gets a husband that prevents her from going to durus from going to workshops from going to Circles of memorizing the Quran and he deprives her of night prayer he deprives her of fasting voluntary fasting he deprives her of doing a lot of good things what kind of marriage is this she is like Asia the wife of unfortunately a lot of the sisters suffer from this I got a lot of complain not a lot few complaints from sisters married to practicing Brothers they are squeezing the circle so that they would not acquire knowledge and when I speak to the brothers I can sense that they are jealous they don't want their wives to be more knowledgeable so they try to pull them down and this is very very dangerous a woman loves in her husband to be a to provide for his family I get a lot of emails and and and uh queries especially from sisters in Britain in UK where the husband is a bum he doesn't work he doesn't go out he just sits there on his laptop of course giving his back to the wall facing the family with the headsets and he stays up till 2 or 3:00 in the morning doing nothing except chitchatting and sometimes doing Haram he's practicing but it doesn't work and the sister works in a hospital in a school she provides for the family she provides for the kids she provides even for the husband what kind of marriage is this Allah says in the Quran I'm not going to quote this in in English I don't know how to say it in English I can find it but Tak line you know it everybody knows this sisters no this why two reasons because Allah favored some over them so they are the controllers the providers the Guardians of women providing they they do what they spend money but if the man doesn't spend money then he loses his then his is under suspicion under doubt you're not spending and you also commanding me to do this and that who's the man of the house this is a problem so a woman wants a man who's able to open a house not necessarily a big mansion maybe one room is enough but at least provide for me a decent and dignified life where I don't have to go and beg my family where I don't have to go and work to support you you should do this and this is the responsibility of the husband by the way some of the brothers say don't uh spend money to my wife why said she's a millionaire masallah even though even if your wife is a millionaire you are obliged to provide for her so my wife comes and says I need a dress so no you have money you go buy no this is not allowed now if the wife is generous is kind is caring is loving may Allah grant us all the such wives and Rich at the same time if she's rich and she's providing yes no problem but it is your responsibility to open the house to support the house to give her even if she's a millionaire um a husband has to be providing for his wife her natural needs and I will not elaborate on this but you know what I mean some and and this is a big problem problem abdah may Allah be pleased with him when he got married couple of weeks later his father went to see his daughter-in-law so he came in and said masallah daughter-in-law how are you how is your husband with you she said mashallah he is the best of all men he prays all night long and he fasts every single day was one of the smartest companions ever he was very Mah a genius he understood it like this if a man prays all night and fast all day when is he going to have intimacy with his wife this means for two weeks since they wedded since since they got married he did not approach her immediately he went to the prophet Alat wasam and the prophet told him this is not the way and you know the Hadith he restricted him to to pray or to finish the Quran once a month he used to finish it once a night he instructed him to fast the maximum a day and skip a day like d and he used to fast the whole month Etc and then he told him that your lord has rights over you the same same Hadith of Salman and Abu D same thing he told him Abdullah your lord has rights over you your guest has rights over you your body has rights over you and your wife or your family has rights over you so give each one its due right so a man has to give his wife her rights you cannot neglect her rights you cannot because she's human and likewise she cannot neglect your right she has to also give you your rights and we will come to talk about the rights later on inshallah but this is one of the things that are required in a man also a man has to look good and smell underline and smell good A lot of the wives complain bitterly about this we are unable to find yeah we are able to understand understand it because if we smell our bead it sounds it smells good but it's not what who you smell your wife doesn't have a beard so if she comes close to you and she finds this odor this is bad some of the brothers do not shower their personal hygiene the prophet Al instructed the men and the women to pluck their armpit and to shave their pubic areas right this is part of Islam cleanliness you don't hide when you say this you have to say it openly some of the brothers have a strong smell they don't they don't shower some of the brothers shower twice a day that's good some of them twice a month this is bad some of the brothers have odor strong odor but some of the brothers when you smell them you say they have o deer not an odor wow It it's it's deafening and it's going to make you faint a man has to look good for his wife otherwise she's going to look somewhere else he has to smell what is the first thing and this is not authentic but the the scholars you always mention it the first thing the prophet begins when he enters the house is mwak cleaning his mouth the Abbas may Allah be pleased with him they saw him his companions you know calming his hair putting Jill they didn't have Jill but they oil to come it and taking care of his beard and wearing beautiful clothes putting perfumes and they Abbas what are you doing he said I like to beautify myself to my spouse as I like her to beautify herself for me it's a two-way two-way street so a woman wants in her husband to to look good to smell good as you want her to do the same so this is natural always take care of the smell of your mouth always perfume your beard always shower at least once a day so that you can ensure you don't have the smell of the sweat W sometimes I sit in a public transportation I have some I bring a straw and put it out of the window so that I can breathe from it's very bad how can you tolerate this in the Masjid you know in the Masjid people stand next to you and you cannot concentrate in prayer you just want the prayer to be over sometimes when you prostrate because of the smell of the socks in front of you you as it w I am serious I'm not saying this to make you laugh wall I do this sometimes I cannot breathe so I as if I'm diving so why is this you should be always clean you should always be and the prophet is your role model isn't he an Malik may Allah be pleased with him said I accompanied the prophet Alam for 10 years W I never touched softer than his hand it's softer than silk and I never smelled anything better than his smell better than musk and inah you know the revelation of it was revealed anyone honey because H Anda it was one of the narrations collaborated because the prophet used to go to Zab and eat honey called so they collaborate say listen if the prophet comes to you say oo what is the smell so the prophet the most awful thing he ever disliked was people to to find a bad smell from him this is the prophet our Prophet role model so she he went to and she said what is the smell he said this honey I ate it at zab's house okay he went to said what is the smell he said I will not eat it over so Allah told him that you should not have done this but the point is the prophet always had the best of smell so you also should do this one of the most important same as the woman one of the most important characteristic is keeping secrets a man is The Confidant of his wife you never ever spread the secrets of your wife do men spread the secrets of their wives raise your hands Liars do men spread the secrets of your W of of their wives yes raise your hands all lying well well I don't want to swear but believe me you're lying or mallah you don't have any secrets because you live with your in-laws maybe I'm talking about ideal places in Saudi so many men spread the secrets of their wives to their mother others and this is the biggest mistake the biggest mistake a man could do is complain to his mother about his wife because you are destroying the relationship between the wife and the mother you're agitated you're angry with your wife you go your wife is not with you well my mother my wife did this did that imagine she did this and she said that imagine she could didn't make me sleep how would your mother feel your mother would be very protect effective if she saw her daughter-in-law she will kill her because she is harming my own son originally speaking a mother-in-law hates her daughter-in-law true because she took my son so if you add insult to injury and you go to your mom and say well she's doing this and she's doing that you even make her more Angry never ever speak against your wife in front of your mother or in front of your father always say the best of things so that you would bring joy to them and you also protect your wife's reputation keeping the secrets the prophet Alat wasam went to the companions women and men and said does anyone among you talk about intimacy issues in public does anyone among you raise your hands anyone okay the same thing happened to the prophet Alat wasam and the companions did not raise their hands because they were yeah I wouldn't say they were lying but they were hiding the truth one woman stood up and said prophet of Allah by Allah they do it and all those who did not raise their hands were ashamed were afraid I wouldn't say they were lying like like you but they didn't he didn't they didn't talk a woman said yes by Allah we do it all of us and the prophet said whoever does this whoever spread the secrets of his spouse is like aan and a a male and female uh devil having intercourse in the middle of the road it's an awful description so keep your secrets to yourself a marriage is never successful when the dirty laundry is spread all over keep your laundry in your kitchen characteristics he has to honor his in-laws so a woman feels proud when her husband honors her family how does he honor her their family your your wife wife says my father is coming over and my mother are coming over for dinner tonight so okay I'm going to my friend's house why I don't want to see your father and your mother always nags a lot so I don't want to go she feels hurt she feels betrayed would you like her to do the same when your mother and father come over no she can't who will cook Subhan Allah so you have to honor your in-laws and honoring uh the in-laws have a lot of means you can honor them financially bringing food for them you're are welcome my house is your house getting them food getting them uh uh decent Hospitality things that are are good for you and also I would think that honoring the in-laws the best way of honoring them is to compliment their daughter what do you mean by this I mean this is what I do and again I'm not bragging of what I do I'm just giving you an example I am one of the worst husbands ever if you ask my wife they will tell you I don't think so but I always do this because I want my wife to do the same to me so when her father and mother comes to Theo to the to the house I spend half of the time saying W this is the jewel of your family so and so if for example the family of uh so and so yeah Muhammad's family I said this is the jewel of Muhammad's family oh M I cannot live w i i lie until I feel sorry for myself I keep on lying and I say when she cooks food mhall look at this food how my wife I love the way you cook beautiful hands look at the food mallah eat eat and it is uneatable but I and I when I look to my parents-in-law and I see the joy coming out so happy W I feel good although I hate my wife but I feel good why because you're making Muslims proud now imagine and compare if they come to visit their daughter and the husband says why is the food late come on go and bring me this bring me that how would they he did not insult but how would they feel they will feel insulted her father's heart's going to break her mother also is going to be sad if he's treating her like this in front of us how would he treat her when we leave always honor your in-laws they entrusted you with the most valuable thing in their life and that is your their their daughter so don't make them feel sorry no matter how much trouble you have with your wife no matter how angry you are with her when they come always put what they call in we don't have it alhamdulillah Poker Face be yeah act that you are happy and she's caring and you're loving because you will H gain a lot out of this a husband has to have and a recommended amount of Jealousy what do we mean recommended amount isn't jealousy required all the time no jealousy is divided into two types praised and acceptable and unacceptable the unacceptable jealousy which we do not want is when it is only suspicion she I want to divorce my wife why sh whenever I come to the home I find her talking in the phone when she sees me she says okay Salam alikum and she hangs up she's definitely talking to a man what kind of Suspicion is this no no no I this is Haram most people most women even most men when someone comes into the room says I'll talk to you later I'm not feeling uh uh uh having the privacy of talking and they're talking to the same sex not to opposite sex so this is doubt that is not recommended I know W I don't have to swear I know I know people that when they leave their houses they lock the outer door I had a teacher a friend of mine working with me he used to do this his house got burnt while he was at school and his wife and child were inside could not get out but with the grace of Allah their neighbor broke the door and got them out and imagine the amount of insult we all teachers gave him because of this why do you lock the door you crazy you're having animals in your house they're human beings you took free a free woman from her house to your house why do you enslave her in such a manner so this kind of jealousy is definitely unacceptable in Islam now on the contrary on the opposite side there are men who have no jealousy at all so the wife says uh we need these groceries you go you go and buy it take money uh the kids you have to go to school and talk to the teachers in Saudi we have segregated schools W the woman goes and talks to the teacher of her son why because the man does not want to waste the uh football game between Saudi and usbekistan it's life and bistan it's early morning is this acceptable no some of the men have no problem asking the driver or asking the doorman to bring the plumber into his bedroom to fix the kitchen the fix the bathroom while his wife is inside okay what about you well I have work I'm going where is the jealousy how can you enter allow a man to enter a stranger to enter your house don't you have any jealousy in you ah she this is a necessity Subhan Allah this shows you and and women love it women love it when men feel jealous when I walk with my wife in the market which is I do mallah every five years or six years and I noticed that her nikab she does a very good nikab they wear this Zoro mask and she puts another or ninja mask some we say it and then they uh put um a veil that is like this so you cannot see her eyes it's like this but she can see the road and if she wants to see something she raises her hand sometimes it goes a little bit up and her eyes are visible or she wears gloves in women gloves is like this so if she does this Thea you can see maybe a small part and I say cover your hand she immediately does this and I love this when you say that so now whenever I see her walking cover your hand she says cover I know but you love it you told me you love it so anyhow um so recommended jealousy is very good women love it show your women your woman your wife show her that you are jealous show her that you are a man and you're not another scumbag who doesn't care if she comes or goes show her that a recommended jealousy tolerance and forgiveness we spoke about this why did I mention it again ah forgiveness forgiveness is a big issue unfortunately men are like camels are like elephants they never forget so so many times women have shortcomings and then we kiss and make up we forget the man still keeps it in after one 2 5 years you still it's like that time you never change Subhan Allah 5 years she's with you she never repeated it and once she does it again you never change lucky for you men that the prophet did not say that you are the majority of Hellfire he only said it to them but unfortunately you also have it in in you you complain a lot and you don't appreciate what the women do women need men who are forgiving if they make mistake and the best of men is the tolerant and forgiving men do not become a sponge as I said yesterday today I don't know yesterday do not become a sponge observing all the problems until you become very heavy and you fall no become like a glass anything that comes on the glass is reflected it's gone and you always have a clean and pure uh uh chest okay before that Among The Men Who considers himself to be tolerant and forgiving to the wife only three this is a big problem seriously this is a very it's good I appreciate your honesty but we here to fix things huh we're not here to Pretend We're Here to fix our relationships I told you I did this in a year and a half ago in the UK I was the first one to benefit from it I went to my home I changed a lot of things in the way I yeah treat my wives alhamdulillah it lasted for 3 days but then but I tried now to this time I'll try to make it last a little little bit longer inshallah the last point is sharing the responsibilities and the men are irresponsible unfortunately when it comes to the children we're very irresponsible I'm talking about myself I never sit with the children to teach them mainly because they're girls you know why I tell her listen you got to work hard you're going to study you're going to be the first over your class then what you're going to get married and sit home so sit home Daddy I need you to explain this I don't have time and I know this is selfish from my side but I have 13 and if I'm going to teach each and one of them only English this will take my whole day so I tell them depend on yourselves when I was young I depended entirely on myself when it comes to uh studies and school Etc so I tell my children to depend on themselves I never believe in getting a teacher to uh pay him money to teach them I never believed in getting extra classes alhamdulillah my girls are very very well educated alhamdulillah one of them yeah the average is I have two of my girls getting 99 9.9 in in their high school and one of my daughters in her four fourth and last year in J IM studying Shar and she's among the the best three or four I think and the other one also is doing very well the third one is doing they depend on themselves sharing the responsibility is not only in teaching them sharing the responsibility in the house who among you washes the dishes in the kitchen over the men 1 2 3 4 five which is very good W is very pleasing in Saudi Arabia everybody let raise their hands and say she we have plastic dishes well disposable we don't we don't need to wash which is good the prophet who cooks in the house one the same one who does the [Music] dishes very good I cook sometimes I I make excellent steaks I make excellent hot dogs that's all the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam when AA was asked how how is the prophet in the house the she said when the prophet enters the house he used to sallallah alaihi wasallam he used to work for his family so he used to se his clothes he used to fix his shoes himself and he used to milk the goat but when it was called for was calling for the Salah he would go to the Salah now compare Apple to Apple how are you in the house when I enter the house I throw my clothes everywhere in the bedroom I don't care about the bathroom I sit and extend my legs and have the remote controls and I just make orders bring me tea bring me coffee go and get me some water turn on the condition I don't move in the house I just instruct people to do things okay do you help with the family with the wife no Why Did I Get Married she's supposed to do everything no this is wrong you will not be fulfilling the needs of a woman if you do not share the responsibility now a great deal of responsibility lies in doing the things that you wife do not like to do a lot and I give you example personal example one of the most horrendous tasks for my wife is take a guess ironing uh no no not much ironing is good alhamd until now they did not complain take a guess CLE dishes cleaning the dishes the daughters do it right dry cleaning no no don't we don't have it's all THS we don't it's all in the washer toilet cleaning toilet cleaning the girls do it and the wives do it they don't have any problem alhamdulillah the most difficult and horrendous task to them that they want me always to share in waking the kids for fer do you find this difficult the I see I sit I pray fa and come back home and I sit in the living room answering emails and I"
