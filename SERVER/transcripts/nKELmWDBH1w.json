  "transcript": "foreign T is similar to your paternal aunt they are part of your kinship that you're ordered in the Quran and of course in the Sunnah to connect to by visiting by calling by helping if they need financial help because anyone related to you from your father or from your mother's side he is from your kinship and the maternal aunt is a mother as mentioned in the Hadith so she's close to you as close as your mom and she's closer to you than your paternal aunt in some cases due to the amount of time spent next to your maternal side of the family in most cases therefore yes you have to honor her and connect to her because she's your mother's sister and Allah Knows Best"
