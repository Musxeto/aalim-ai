  "transcript": "they say that some people sometimes complain and say you should not ask allah azza for detailed things you should only use dua of the quran especially in your prayer and this is bogus this is totally not true yes the highest level of things that you can make dua in the salat is the prescribed dua whether it's from the quran or from the sunnah but if i want to ask a specific question or request oh allah my car's engine broke down oh allah make it easy to fix and find someone who is honest and cheap who would do a good job with the least cost on me what's wrong in that there's nothing wrong at all and you can ask allah for specific things without transgression transgressing so you cannot ask allah make me a person who does not need to sleep or does not need to eat or or drink or make me able to fly all of this is transgression and it's haram and not permissible"
