  "transcript": "um how can one maintain a high level of human throughout his life as you know fluctuates it increases with good deeds decreases with sin so it is not possible to maintain a high level as in the Hadith may Allah be pleased with them when he met Abu Bakr and he said to him how are you I've become a hypocrite and Abu Bakr was shocked and when he told him the reason Abu Bakr was confused and he said well I feel the same let's go to the prophet and check it out with them so they went both to the prophet salaam and they told the prophet is and handle explained he said oh prophet of Allah when we are with you we are at a high level of Iman that We Are So Satisfied that when we go back to our families and to our businesses and to our children and we mix with them we do not recognize our hearts few minutes ago when we were with you our hearts were different now they're totally different the prophet said that Islam said to alhamdulillah if you're Iman level was the same with your families with your businesses with your children then the Angels would shake hands with you in broad daylight and this is not possible your Iman has to go down and up when you're with me it's at the highest and this is logical you're with the prophet so the prophet said this is inevitable this is life you have to maintain an hour of high level of Iman and an hour where you attend your daily needs you have to work you have to sleep and rest and mix with the kids and have quality time with the wife and and do business Etc so it would fluctuate and this is normal but to try and maintain a certain level of Iman that would not go beyond the Red Zone the red line yes this is something that might be sought after and this is not very difficult but a lot of us don't want because it deprives them from the desires their Hobbies their lusts the things that are so lucrative and beautiful so maintaining yourself in the message most of the time doing your job in a Halal way not a free mixing not flirting or socializing with the opposite gender not wasting time rather utilizing your time whether it is to get closer to Allah in forms of ibadah or to excel in this world in business and hobbies you do in working out in the gym in maintaining a social connectivity with your kinship and Friends Etc you need to balance and there is a lecture on my YouTube channel by the name of the balance in Islam or a number of lectures a number of times go for the latest because that would have should have been should be the the best of them all insha Allah you may be lucky to benefit from that because the happiest person on earth is the one who can balance this and Allah Knows Best uh"
