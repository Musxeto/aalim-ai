soothing I mean the being a Mohammedan why the early he was happy a demain assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh anas bin malik may allah be pleased with him tells us about a night that people heard a noise that frightened them and it was in the middle of the night so by the time they got over their fear they went out to check out on this sound this frightening noise that they had heard and as they went out they were matched by the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam on a horse without a saddle with the sword in his neck coming from the outskirts of Medina calming the people down saying do not be afraid do not be afraid this hadith it indicates one of our profits characteristics may allah be pleased with him it shows us one of the characteristics of our prophet sallallahu re why do you sell them and peace and praise of allah be upon him which is bravery before the people could come over this fear of this he already had gone out and came back with the news telling them that it is not something to be afraid of in the middle of the night on his own a prophet erase a lot was saddam as described by the companions was the most generous the kindest and also the bravest among all people and we all know that I leave that we thought it may allah be pleased with him one of the bravest soldiers of Allah he says that whenever the tough got going on the battlefield we used to shield and fight behind the prophet alayhi salatu salam because he would be always the first to fight so we used to shield behind him sallallahu alehiwassallaam and on the battle of the prophet alayhi salatu salam stood firm while everyone else ran away and he only had 12 of his companions fighting next to him with him Solarius ilum seven of them died while fighting with the prophet alayhi salatu salam also in the battle of her name when the Muslims were overwhelmed with the errors from the archers who hid in the mountains and ambush them the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not retreat he did not run away he stood firm not on a strong horse but on his mule charging forward to fight the enemies saying it is I the prophet and this is not a lie it is i the son of Abdul Muttalib he's crying and calling the disbelievers to come and fight him on his own saying an ana be you like added 11 Abdulmutallab peace and praise of Allah be upon him stood with him his uncle al abbas also abu bakr umar ali alphab work awesome and abou sofiane I'm inherit his cousin may Allah be pleased with them all being brave was indeed one of the characteristics of the prophet alayhi salaatu wassalam and bravery is the opposite of cowardice and it is the strength of the heart in facing calamities and difficult situations that is why the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam used to supplicate to Allah and he used to seek Allah's refuge from cowardice and he would say o Allah I seek refuge with you from worry and grief and I seek refuge with you from incapacity and laziness and I seek refuge with you from cowardice and my silliness and I seek refuge with you from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men this the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to supplicate a lot and if we would like to explain this hadith this would probably take us a long time but indeed a Muslim should memorize this hadith and should supplicate with it during his prayer and out of his prayer cowardice is a characteristic that the Prophet re salatu salam feared and supplicated to Allah that Allah avoid him from having it cowardice leads to failure and it leads to dispute among the Muslims and that is why Allah tells us in the Quran and obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute with one another for the fear you lose courage you'll come coward if you dispute this is the result you will lose courage and your strength depart and be patient surely Allah is with those who are patient among the submarine and if you read the biography of the companions may allah be pleased with them all you will find that they were all courageous they were all brave and if we would like to mention examples this would take us ages for example they've been remark may Allah be pleased with him and with his father is telling us about one of the Companions of the Prophet etisalat sturm and this one was Jennifer ribbon ABI talib Jennifer ribbon a beat on it may allah be pleased with him was one of the leaders of the great battle of muta there were three leaders appointed by the prophet re salatu salam which was not his habit and the Muslims understood that by appointing three leaders that they will be martyred so they were traveling to the death they were happy because they knew that it is their chance to be martyred and a martyr goes straight to paradise as we are told in the Quran and in the Sunnah providing his intention is for the sake of Allah and providing he has no debts over him because everything is forgiven for a martyr with the exception of debts so he has to pay off his debts so the Prophet told the Muslims that their leader is a double haritha if he's martyred then it is Jeffrey we thought it if he's martyred it is up the line Aloha and if I'm the live now aha then choose a leader from amongst you and this is exactly what happened they were all martyred and they chose holiday Melua Reed who managed with the grace of Allah to fool the enemies by pretending that he's getting reinforcements from the left and from the right and this he did by just switching the right to the left and the left of the army to the right and the hamdulillah this caused the N me to fear the Muslim army and to retreat and they retreat it as well and they called it a day jaffna be taught him as we are told by Abdullah number haha may Allah be pleased with him they found him on the battlefield with 50-plus stabs and wounds only in his front side which meant that he did not get one single injury in his backside retreating or running away he was going forward all the way and by Allah this is bravery this is courage that you know you're traveling a month and a half distance to your destiny you know you're dying you know you're a dead man walking the Prophet RSL Absalom gave you the glad tidings that you will be martyred and when you meet the enemy you do not retreat you do not give them your back you do not take one or two or ten blows he had more than 50 plus injuries in his face his body but not in his back because he was facing the enemy he was fighting the enemy by Allah this is what we call bravery we have a short break so stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back peace ceremony camera have to LA and welcome back bravery is needed deeply on the battlefield this is when people seem to be afraid for their lives so if they were not true believers with strong hearts they might flee the battlefield the minute they sense danger this is not a true believers stand a lot almighty says o you who believe when you meet an enemy force take a firm stand against them and remember bur the name of Allah much so that you may be successful at the beginning of time the prophet alayhi salatu salam was instructed alongside the believers that one man should fight and stand in the face of ten of the disbelievers and Allah will grant them victory and this was how it went on the Muslims used to fight an army that was ten times bigger than them and Allah would grant them victory and after few years this was abrogated and Allah made it 122 so it is forbidden for a Muslim in Wars to run away from an army that is twice his size if it was more than it's ok not to run away but to retreat and regroup and it is not only necessary to be brave and courageous on the battlefield alone but also in day-to-day life a Muslim has to be brave a Muslim has to be courageous when he enforces virtue and calls people to Islam and when he prevents vice and evil work he does this though he knows that there will be resistance and that is why the prophet salallahu slm instructed one of his companions and he said say the truth even if it was bitter say the truth even if it was bitter people usually do not accept the truth it's bitter to them they would like someone to tell them lies yet make them feel comfortable rather than telling them the truth which makes them sad also our prophet alayhi salatu salam ordered us to change the evil by hand if we can or by our tongues when we talk and forbid it or by the heart and this is the least of a man and belief yet we have to be courageous when we do this because in so many cases people refrain and stop from changing the evil when they see it because they're afraid or they're embarrassed or they feel shy and all of this is considered to be signs of cowardice a Muslim is brave and he does what he does for the sake of allah and that is why we follow the prophets of allah who were the most courageous people who were the bravest people to have ever walked the earth and they stood firmly in front of the forces of disbelief the forces of cofrin shirk and that is why the Prophet told us re salatu salam that the best martyrs are Hamza been abysmal type and a man who spoke the truth before an unjust ruler and the ruler killed him so this is part of our bravery to disclose the truth and to speak it out even if it were to be in front of a tyrant who would execute you but of course you have to be wise and you have to be reasonable it is not Islamic to go and cause chaos by speaking impolitely with a ruler in front of his subjects this is not part of the wisdom that the Prophet erased elapsed time instructed us he instructed us to talk to him in private if he executes you then you are among the closest to a la Sol as you are one of the best martyrs it is part of bravery to confess if you do something that is wrong so many times we make mistakes we have our own shortcomings yet we would like to conceal that and not to show it to people and in the process we may lie well this is signs of cowardice a brave person does not do this a brave person admits his guilt and he acknowledges that he did a mistake and this is exactly like when the prophet alayhi salatu salam accepted the ransom for the prisoners of war captured in the battle of better allah azzawajal revealed verses in surah al-anfal in chapter 8 where he condemned the prophet is awesome for accepting such a ransom instead of fighting and killing these prisoners so that they would learn their lesson and he the prophet is a loud slam wept and cried when these verses were revealed and said by Allah if someone would to be saved from this punishment it would be or it would have been Alma hop up may Allah be pleased with them because he's the one who rejected this in the first place and said that this is not the right thing to do also you need courage to acknowledge your mistakes and acknowledging your mistakes confessing them is half of the way for forgiveness and with the grace of allah azzawajal we do not have confessions to make to humans you only confess to Allah the Almighty there's no one to enter meet between you and Allah so jeal there's no intermediates between you and Allah the Almighty you confess to Allah and the best means of confession is to supplicate the Prophet says alia salata said I'm the best player for seeking forgiveness is to say o Allah you're my lord none has the right to be worshipped but you you created me and I am your slave and I am faithful to my covenant and my promise to you as much as I can I seek refuge with you from all the evil that I have done so you're confessing and you have to be brave to do this and I acknowledge before you all the blessings you've bestowed upon me and I confess to you all my sins so I ask you to forgive me and to forgive my sins for nobody can forgive sins except you the Prophet tells us our asaram whoever says this during the day having faith in it and dies before the evening comes Allah will make him among the people of paradise and likewise if he says it in the evening before the morning comes so what prevents people from confessing their sins and asking allah forgiveness well among these things are arrogance that prevents people from admitting their guilt and that is what keeps people away from allah forgiveness the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to encourage his companions to be courageous to be brave and to admit he used to encourage them to be truthful as mentioned before with cap even magic may allah be pleased with him and that is why we have to treat our children in the same fashion we have to bring up our kids to be brave and courageous lots of times I've seen people intimidating their children making them afraid of night whenever the child wants to do something they will tell him it's dark don't go and we get this phobia in our kids of darkness of monsters of being able to talk or speak because the stranger the boogeyman will take you and that is why we get this generation that is afraid of everything this was not the way the Companions used to bring up their kids and children they used to teach him how to be polite but they also wanted them to be courageous they've been our motley allah be pleased with him says that we were once with the prophet salallahu idea where you sell them in a gathering in the masjid abu bakr umar and the rest of the companions were there and the Prophet had some used to give them puzzles to solve so he told them there is a tree that is like a Muslim and it leaves does not fall on the ground so tell me what it is and the companion started giving names of trees in the in the desert sand here and there hibben are says I felt that the prophet Isaiah salatu salam is asking about the palm tree because never ever you would find the palm tree with leaves falling on the ground ever and it dies standing and it's fruitful while it's alive and while it's dead and this is the same with the believer the Muslim he's always benefiting others like the palm tree is so even Thomas says that this is what I felt but I was bashful to speak in the presence of a Bakr and Umar and after the Prophet I some had gone eben amar said to his father father I it crossed my mind that it was palm tree but I did not speak because I was respecting your presence and Abu Bakr his presence I don't want me all of a piece with him did not thanked his son for not speaking and being polite he said by Allah I wish you spoke and told the Prophet any salatu salam better than if I had the wealth of the whole world coming to me because this would have shown the Prophet how smart my son is and this brings me honor and joy the Companions used to raise their children on being brave and courageous and this is what we should do with our kids if they're brave enough to confess of a mistake they had done we should reward them for that and we should encourage them not to say a lie this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh SI o"
