  "title": "How to know if Allah has accepted our fasting & good deeds of Ramadan? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we would like to then ramadan and knights other than laylatul what happens after eid itself how does the belief is for steadfastness going forward and if we look at the month of ramadan what lessons do we take from it that beyond we can become mean okay if i understand your question correctly the salaf used to say the sign of acceptance of your good deeds that allah will support you to do more good deeds and the sign of rejecting your good deeds that you will turn back on your heels and you'll resume doing the sins you used to do before this season so if you want to know whether allah has accepted your fasting your night prayer and your dua let's see what you do on the day of eid some people feel as if they are chained during the month of ramadan the moment reid is announced they are unchained and they do everything they want to do so they celebrate eight with free mixing listening to music haram movies some of them even prepare in the beginning of ramadan or in the middle of ramadan that he is going to his holidays in the 8 to non-islamic countries to celebrate and to feast on islamically what are you doing this is a joke we usually say in saudi when you ask the brother what are you doing he says listen i fasted 30 days for you now it's time for my eight i'm going to party and i'm going to drink i'm going to do everything but this is a joke actually it is a reflection of what's truly happening people think that they fasted 30 days for us i fasted 30 days for you no you didn't that was supposedly for allah so it's a clear indication whether allah has accepted your fasting if you continue maybe not as strong as you used to be in ramadan but at least you continue to read the quran unlike so many people who do not touch the quran until the following ramadan 11 months you see dust on their copies of the quran no a proper muslim continues to have a portion of quran every day not compromising it he starts to pass the six days of shawwal so that he would be awarded as if he had fasted the whole year and he also tries to observe mondays and thursdays and if possible the white days he on the night of eight does not forget to pray with her and a portion of his night prayer so if not eleven raka's as you used to do in ramadan maybe seven but don't leave your night prayer every single night charity is not only limited to ramadan he looks for the poor the orphans the widows the one and need and try to help as much as possible throughout the whole year and this means that allah has accepted his ramadan"
