  "transcript": "he says that we've made an oath to respect the teachers and to be polite etc so if we don't do this they'll reprimand us what to do if the oath is in allah's name there's nothing wrong in that you should say it if it is in other than allah's name this is shirk even if they torture you you should not say this hypothetically speaking unless you are forced to do it but generally speaking no quit the school rather than swearing by other than allah's name and if you just pretend that you are talking or saying that oath while not uttering it or moving your lips with the same words rather you say allah for example and they think that you're making an oath there's nothing wrong in that insha allah"
