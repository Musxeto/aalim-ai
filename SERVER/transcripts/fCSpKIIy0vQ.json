  "title": "Allah said We've created man in  best form So why are people handicapped Have defects Assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sheikh my question is um for an explanation of the verse in surat we have created men in the best of form um so one of the possible expansions that uh that i've heard of is that for example our eyes are at its place and our nose at its place and so on and if it's somewhere else if they are somewhere else then we we won't be how we are um but likewise for other animals these are also in place they are functioning and they have allah created them in a way that they are performing at their best but we also see that humans have some are born with defects or those people are handicapped and so on so i'm just requesting you to maybe explain this first so that i can understand it better so this is mentioned in surat 18 and as i usually refer to the tafsir i don't usually give things out of my own head and yes allah azzawajal stated as according to the seer of al-barawi and assadi that allah azza has created mankind in a perfect form that everything symmetrically is in place he is standing still and he does not miss anything that he needs whether externally or internally and most people must show their gratitude to allah azzawajal for such a blessing now you cannot compare how allah created us to how allah created a gorilla there is no one who would say oh this dinosaur was created perfectly more than a human being the humans are the most perfect creation of allah the almighty in the sense externally and internally so physically the way they look the way everything is engineered even the foot itself logically i'm not an engineer but usually the leg should have been in the middle of the foot so that there would be balance but subhanallah the leg is way at the back over the heel and this is the best position so that a person can be mobile can be mobile can be mobile and can move subhanallah this is how allah created us so this is the perfect way one could also say that allah has created mankind in the perfect sense in terms of his actual nature of worshiping only allah azzawajal of wanting to enter paradise and to be submissive to allah and a servant to allah those who refuse and follow their whims and desires and worship their sins then they have gone to the worst of creation and allah knows best"
