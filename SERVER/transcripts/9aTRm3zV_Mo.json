  "title": "When a brother is not let to grow his beard",
  "transcript": "a Muslim brother goes to boarding school during the week he wants to practice growing the beard but the people there won't let him they tell him that he must shave it or else during the weekends he can't uh uh or else during the weekend he cannot go home every time the brother feels guilty will he get sin or not please advise yes he would get sin the easiest thing for him to do is to quit school and I think that this would uh uh go very well down the throat of a lot of our lazy uh brothers and sisters but unfortunately that this is the only thing to do when you are requested either to for a sister for example either you take your hijab or we will not let you go home either you skip prayers or we will not let you do this or that what am I here for I'm here on this Earth to please Allah so if you're asking me to go and sin and to do something that is not please Allah the almighty so that I could please you then be assured that Allah would be angry with me and Allah would make those whom I'm seeking their pleasure angry of me as well therefore there are no uh uh Middle Ground here it is even us or them it is either pleasing Allah or pleasing them while displeasing Allah the almighty growing the beard is not an option if it was if it were an option I would have shaven it long time ago growing the beard is mandatory it's obligatory and this is the consensus of the four schools of thought the Hadith the Hadith NE different different versions of the Hadith clearly state that and even the Quran states that growing the beard is part of the sunnas of the uh prophets may Allah uh have uh his peace and praise and blessing upon them all therefore you have to make it clear to them either I'm allowed to keep my beard or I'm creating school and Allah Knows Best"
