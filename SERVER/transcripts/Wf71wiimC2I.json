  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] alhamdulillah a man once came to the prophet Alat and he sought his advice he said advise me so the prophet said sallallahu alaih wasallam do not become angry so the man said give me more the prophet repeated do not become angry do not become angry and he kept on repeating it this beautiful Hadith highlights to us the dangers of becoming angry and we have to be careful see when the prophet advised His companion not to become angry he didn't literally mean mean that who is unable to become angry in all cases if someone attacks attacks your wife if someone abuses your daughter would it be logical to say it's okay don't become angry don't become angry definitely not so what was the essence of the prophet's advice Alat wasam the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam did not actually mean do not become angry but rather he said do not act wrongfully according to your anger becoming angry can be praised can be something that is considered a characteristic of a Believer when you see Vice taking place would you give it a smile and move away or you become angry when someone is sinful when someone does something without any shame or or bashfulness a Muslim must be angry a Muslim must be jealous this is recommended and he's complimented and praised when doing so but what is not permissible is when you react in a wrong way so you see some Vice you see some sins and you act in an unlam way for example you see a place that sells alcohol this is a major sin this is prohibited so you think that okay I'm going to burn this place to the ground on what ground are you doing this this is totally proh hited they deserve it no I was angry this is not justifiable so many people go out of Islam's correct way and justify this by their anger and this is not permissible anger can be truthful and can be fake people come and say I divorced my wife in Anger this is normal nobody divorces his wife while drinking a cup of coffee or tea and he's in a good mood and says listen my love I divorce you all divorces take place in Anger however the anger the true anger is the anger that a person has no control over hitting your wife and claiming that this is anger is unacceptable let us see how your anger is when a police officer mistreats you or when your boss who has the ability to give you a raise or increment says something bad to you or when a 64 full of muscles says something to you let us see your true anger here if you suppress your anger and don't say anything yet you hit your wife you abuse your children and you are undutiful to your parents and justify this due to your anger Let It Be know known let it be known that you are lying and this is not real anger so let us suppress our anger and only express it in the way that Allah is pleased with in accordance to theah [Music] o [Music]"
