  "title": "80 kms travel distance - combine & shorten prayers? Hadith explained (Qasr) #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh according uh to Islam KU um many uh schoolers have set a standard for combin and shorting prayers with uh 80 kilom and this is also what the summary says uh from this topic but in this topic is a Hadith is also mentioned where the Prophet shed the prayer when he traveled this is which about 17 16 kilom and the letter view is the view like um Islam favored by Islam because Allah did not state a specific distance that makes shorting prayers permissible and neither the prophet and according to the end in this topic Islam says the view of Islam is closer to what is correct so my question is what is the minimum distance for traveling for short and combined prayers for someone which travels sometimes 30 or 40 kilometers and feel like as a traveler this is not right and that's is good and the reason is the Hadith talking about that he shortened and combined after leaving for three far or just as he left Medina is not talking about the distance people don't understand the Hadith and this is the biggest problem with Layman when they read classical books or hadiths without going back to understand from the scholars and and I ask them I'm traveling from Munich to Frankfurt the distance is I don't know how much and after leaving Munich for about 5 kilomet and I want to pray after leaving the borders of Munich for 5 kilm or 4 kilm should I shorten and combine or not the answer is yes not because I traveled the 5 kilom my travel is like 500 kilm maybe so this is the distance of traveling not the 5 kilom not the three far the people when they read this Hadith they thought they think that the prophet went for three and came back no he went for a whole month of traveling or for two weeks or for a long distance but when did he start to shorten and to combine the moment he left the city limits of Medina three so those who don't know or understand they jump the gun oh okay so if I travel from this neighborhood to this neighborhood and it's 10 kilometers this is more than three I can shorten no you're not a traveler anyone who goes from point A to point B which is 20 km or 30 km or even 50 50 km we all know that this is not traveling they commute but not traveling and if it's on the autoban with your 9/11 Su you can do that in like 5 minutes this is not traveling so understand the Hadith and don't try to bend the rules to fit your whims and desires rather go back and check with the scholars reading articles on QA Islam Q&A or Islam web and the likes without the interpretation and the explanation of Scholars would put you in trouble and Allah Knows Best"
