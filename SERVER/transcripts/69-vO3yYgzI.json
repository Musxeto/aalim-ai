  "title": "Do we pray Istikhara to make a choice between two or more things or after making a decision? Assim",
  "transcript": "this hop from india says we know that istihara is not to make choices like the vast majority of muslims think so he always understood that istihara is when you have a number of choices you have to make up your mind on one of them and then you pray to allah azzawajal seeking his support if there is good in it for you to facilitate it and make it happen and if there is no good in it for you that he distract you away from it chooses something else for you and make you content with his choice so now he said that lately i've heard people saying that no this is not true istihar is just a ritual and i don't know why do people keep on listening to people of ignorance people who are not knowledgeable people who are not scholars or students of knowledge and allow them to confuse them today a brother after us or prayer came to me saying to me that i've heard someone telling me doubts about islam that now i am a little bit doubtful so i'm asking you sheikh so i said subhanallah is your faith and religion this fragile that any tom dick or harry could come and cast doubts on you be firm on your religion be steadfast if you brothers hack had the conviction that what you knew in the beginning was correct why do you allow ignorant people to come and confuse you simply reject whatever they brought you because it's not founded it has no basis and they're not among the people of knowledge that we can take knowledge from so what they have told you is totally bogus what you had believed in in the beginning is the right thing it's istihara is not to make a choice whether should i marry fatima or khadijah or aisha um i don't know i pray tehara no you have to make up your mind that khadijah is the best of them all that's it you've done your due diligence all boxes are checked now you praise tijara and go ahead with the proposal so i hope this answers your question you"
