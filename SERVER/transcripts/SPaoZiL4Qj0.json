  "title": "Ruling on loving someone from the opposite gender but not disclosing it to him/her - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it means to love somebody but you but you are not willing to tell him or her this is something in your heart which only Allah knows about and no one knows about it this is a feeling feelings of love feelings of hate feeling of resentment as long as you don't show it to anyone else this is in your heart Allah will not hold you accountable unless these feelings are translated into actions so if someone loves another person from the opposite gender a Man Loves a Woman but he does not freely mix he does not socialize he does not text he does not make a pass he does not look at her he tries to avoid where she is but still he has feelings for her he's not sinful for that and Allah Knows Best"
