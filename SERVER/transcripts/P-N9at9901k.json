  "transcript": "uh I just had a question about you know when J there is evidence from the Sunnah that a person will be back with his family so they will be gathered in the same level in Jenna but I wanted to know the extent of this like for example Prophet Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam he will be with his wife in the same level and most if I'm not mistaken it's children but the his grandchildren if they are also right will they also be in the same level and how long does this extend like in the lineage line so after the grandchildren the children of the grandchildren and so on and so this also applies to like normal families okay first of allar this is way above your and my pay grade now it's like coming in questioning the government for their housing distribution and Allah has the highest example you don't have the authority to go and question the Prime Minister why did you give housings for free for those and not for for for us and why did you put us in this neighborhood and not in that neighborhood this is according to the preference and the planning of the government now Allah has the highest example we are told that those who believe and their offspring also Believers we made their offsprings catch up to them so whether the offsprings are caught up with their parents or the parents are caught up with their children this happens in Jenna to what extent this is in Allah's hands we don't have to read between the line accept it as it is on the day of judgment we TR Allah the question is and this this is what the 1 million Kuwaiti din question is it difficult for Allah to put everybody in the same level of course not but is this what's going to happen I have no idea I know that Allah promised us to be satisfied unconditionally I believe in that and let's stop here"
