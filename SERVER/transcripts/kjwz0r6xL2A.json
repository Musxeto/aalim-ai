  "transcript": "today's topic is about the status of parents in Islam and it goes without saying that the parents are the cause as we know that for everything Allah has placed a cause and the parents are the cause of an individual existence in this life so when you look at how we came into this world you'll find that our parents were where the reason of that and this is why Allah Asel made it essential and important for each and every one of us to take care of their parents to obey them to respect them to the extent that Allah has made this Associated even withed and as we knowed is the most important thing in a person's um religion it is the essence of our religion now Allah Asel says in the Quran your lord has decreed not to worship other than him and to be good to your parents and this shows you how important being good to your parents is in theah Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him said I asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam which deed is most beloved to Allah so the prophet saidat to pray on time he says and then I asked then what the prophet said and this is a very generic word that includes under it obeying obeying the parents respecting them being kind to them cheering them up doing all what you can to be kind to them and then I M said then what oh prophet of Allah thirdly the prophet said Jihad in the cause of Allah so being kind to your parents is far greater and more important to Allah asael than Jihad in his cause now there is a huge difference between the culture of a Muslim and those who are not Muslim in the west we see how people treat their parents not all of them of course but generally speaking they mistreat their parents and once an individual hits the puberty age he becomes independent he becomes Rebellion he would not listen to instructions or obey let alone respect his parents and that's why a lot of them move out of their parents' houses there's no respect there is no obedience and if the parent grows old they would throw him in uh a special place where they pay the management to take care of the elderly in what is known as caring homes or what whatever they call them now this is totally different in Muslim world and also in some Asian non-muslim world as well among the Muslims the individual is considered to be a winner if he gets the honor of Hosting his father or his mother or both of them and he would boast about it among his siblings because it is indeed a cause and a reason for boasting and being proud the father or the mother once they reach the age of retirement and they become old and weary once they have a lot of Offspring and grandchildren they become like a king and a queen they move from one house to the other treated as royalty among their children not because of anything thing other than because Islam instructs us to do this Islam has made certain rights for the parents and instructed us to fulfill these rights these rights make the sun captive and indebted to them while while they're alive and also after they die to the extent that that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the Jenna that is Paradise would not be admitted would not be entered by someone who's disrespectful disobedient unkind to his parents and people when they come to treat their parents they're divided into three types the first type is those who are kind obedient and doing all what they can to make them happy and to fulfill their rights so this kind or this type they are rewarded by Allah the second type are those who are not so kind and going out of their way to please them but at the same time they don't do any harmful things they don't disobey them they're not abusive to them so they do what they are told to do exactly without no pluses or minuses and this type is sinful this type will be punished on the day of judgment for not going the extra mile in seeking their pleasure and expressing his kindness to them the third part are those who combine between not being kind not going out of the way to please them two being abusive being disobedient disrespectful always breaking their heart always making them depressed and this type is a goner this type is a loser and he had committed one of the major sins in Islam abak may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet said am should I not tell you about the most major sins of all and the prophet said associating others with Allah and being disrespectful and disobedient to your parents imagine it is the second in rank after associating others with Allah and this shows you the importance of obeying your parents regardless of their religion and this is something that a lot of the Muslims and the the reverts mistake about they think that yes if my parents are Muslims I should be dis I should be respectful and obedient to them and I should be kind and cheering them all the time this is wrong even if your parents were non-muslims not only that even if your parents are going out of their way to make you Retreat and go back on Islam you should not obey them in this aspect but you still have to be kind and respectful to them now people would ask how can an individual offer them B how can individual offer them kindness and obedience and uh uh respect well by default being kind to them is something which is natural this is a natural thing and because it's a natural thing you can find this even with animals so this is possible even with animals that are kind to their parents and that is is why it's a major sin to go against your nature whenever nature dictates that you do something and there isn't the means to do it you become sinful your nature tells you to be kind to your parents if you're not you're sinful the Hadith of the Prophet wasam three Allah would never speak to them or look at them or purify them or and they will they will be tormented greatly on the day of judgment who are they the prophet said a lying king a king that lies nature states that a king has all the power in the world and he doesn't need anybody he intimidates people with his army and with his forces so nobody can go against them why would he lie this is against nature number two an arrogant peasant an arrogant poor and a a beggar nature states that you are in need so whatever comes to you you should accept that but when a peasant when a beggar is arrogant and you give him something he says what is this this is not even sufficient to buy a pack of cigarette he's arrogant this calls for torment on the day of judgment and the third one an old man who fornicates and commits adultery now old men don't have the desire that young men do or young men have so if you go against your nature and you start picking up fagas or sealas or whatever and you try your level best to do something that there's no call for it there's no desire for it then this calls for torment on the day of judgment so how can we be obedient to our parents respectful kind if you try to always recall the great reward that Allah will give you when you do that everything will come become easy and you will be supported by Allah asael to be kind to them once you remember that one of the greatest means and reasons for being admitted to Jenna to paradise and to erase your sins is to be kind to your parents once you remember this it would become easy for you to seek their pleasure and tolerate whatever shortcomings they have just to gain this great reward and among that is to speak softly with them imagine speaking softly to your parents erases your sins a man came to Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him man with his father and the man was terrified he started to tell IB Omar about his sins that the man thought were major sins and the man was terrified about these sins and he was fearful of entering Hellfire IB Omar asked him are your parents alive so the man said only my mother and she's with me I Omar asked the boy do you fear fire and love to enter Jenna the man the man said yes indeed I do IB Omar said by Allah if you speak speak to her softly and you feed her food you will enter jenah as long as you avoid major sins Allah Asel has forbade us from expressing our anger even by simply saying O and O is not even a word Allah says don't say o to them or chide them and say kind things to them with respect so if this sigh that comes out of your chest when you are frustrated if this sigh you are prohibited to say to them then what is the ruling on those who shout at them or abuse them or swears at them or even beat them there's no doubt that such an act would erase all of your good deeds may Allah have mercy on us all may Allah be pleased with his father and his mother and may Allah have mercy on him one of the great he said if your parents made you angry do not look at them with that angry look because the first thing that announces a person's anger is the way he looks at those who angered him and he also says by Allah whoever looks his father in the eyes did not respect him nor be kind to him Muhammad Sirin used to speak so softly when he was in the presence of his mother to the extent sent that those who did not know him thought he was Ill of course he did this out of respect among the salaf there were those who did not eat with their mother from the same plate fearing that his hand would reach out to a morsel that his mother had looked at and desired without him knowing Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him saw two men he addressed the youngest of them and he said who's this to you and the youngest said this is my father so Abu hura said to him if this is your father do not call him by his bare name do not walk in front of him and never sit before him meaning that he should sit first and you should always walk behind him as of respect now these are all rights of the father and the mother which we have greatly neglected the father has great roles in the society and he has great rights over individuals the prophet saidat to one of the companions the father is the middle gate of paradise so preserve that gate or lose it it's up to you so if you do not respect and obey your father you are in great Danger The Prophet Alat wasam told us that Allah answers the supplication of a number of people and one of them is the supplication of a father against his son so this intimidates a Believer and he's always afraid to do something that would anger his father to the extent that he makes Dua against him and Allah answers this and though the father has great rights over an individual by far the mother has greater rights a man once came to the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam asking him who among the people is more worthy of my companionship my good companionship so the prophet said your mother the man said then who the prophet said your mother the man said then who the prophet said for the third time your mother and the man said then who and then the prophet said for the fourth time sallallah wasallam your father so the mother has 75% of your good companionship while the father has 25% Allah says in the Quran and we have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents his mother bears him with hardship and she brings him forth with hardship and the bearing of him and the way weaning of him is 30 months so the mother suffers a lot by conceiving him by giving birth to him by breastfeeding him and taking care of him it was reported if I Rec correctly that a man came to Abdullah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and he said that I have my mother with me I wash her I feed her I take care of her totally as she is unable to do any of these things so do you think I have compensated her and I fulfilled my rights to her IB Abbas said no the man said why what she had done to me when I was young I'm doing it exactly to her at this age IB Abbas said yes you are doing what you're doing hoping that she dies soon but she did what she had done in the past hoping that you grow up and live to become a man there is a great difference between our intentions and our parents intentions alari in reported that may Allah be pleased with him so a man during the month of during the season of Hajj the man was carrying his mother on his shoulders going around the Kaa in ta and chanting that I am her camel I am her ride and whenever other people's camels or rides are threatened and frightened I am not meaning that he is protecting his mother and the man addressed I Omar ohar do you think I have compensated my mother do you think that I have fulfilled her rights over me and IB Omar said by Allah you did not not even by one of the cramps or uh uh uh the the the feelings that a woman gets while in labor extractions or I don't know how they call it the prophet Alat wasam was addressed by a man who wanted to go for Jihad with him so the prophet said do you have a mother and the man said yes the prophet told him go back and be kind and obedient and respectful to her the man asked again oh prophet of Allah allow me to go to Jihad and the prophet asked him about his mother and he repeated his instruction and in the third time the man is adamant he wants to go for Jihad the prophet said to him be close to her feet as Paradise is there meaning stick with your mother obey her service her serve her and be kind to her because this would take you to Jenna and the prophet did not take him with him and this is the bir we are supposed to offer our parents not limited to a particular day it is a 24/7 process unlike what they do worldwide when they designate A Day in the year and they call it Mother's Day and they buy their mothers a gift and this is as far as it gets the rest of the year it would be fine if they give them a call twice or three times a year not knowing anything what happened so many parents died and rotten in their bedrooms for days unnoticed until the neighbors found the smell and the parents and and the children did not know about them so many of them die and for months the kids don't know that they had died because they never contact them in Islam it is not like this we're in instructed in ordered to be kind to our parents even if they are evil even if they are abusive and saying bad things about us or about Islam we must be kind respectful and tolerant because this is what Allah has ordered us to be and to do being kind to your parents far exceeds than just saying good things to them in their life it goes on even after the death a man once came to the prophet Alat wasam and he said that my parents are dead is there anything else I can do so that I would be considered as being respectful and obedient to them see sometimes when our parents are alive we may misbehave or be disrespectful we may get so involved and indulged in life that we forget to give them a call to sit with them to see them and check whether they're happy or not and this negligence may go on until they pass away then one finds this awful feeling of regret burning his heart I missed a gate of Jenna and now the gate is closed so the man is asking oh prophet of Allah what can I do I have a problem so the prophet answered the man and he said yes you can do something after their death you can pray for them seek forgiveness for them execute their will honor their friends and connect to your kinship which you do not have kinship except through your father and mother this is what remains over you from their bir after they die so it does not end when they die it keeps on going because the Gratitude one holds to his parents can never stop until our souls depart our bodies ibar may Allah be pleased with him met a man once while going from Medina to Mecca so he was traveling and when he say this when he saw this bedwin he was a nomad so IB Omar dismounted his mule or donkey he greeted the man spoke with him for a while and then Abdullah Omar gave him his donkey that he was riding gave him his turban that he was wearing and was kind to him I Omar's companion said may Allah forgive you these are nomads they are poor they don't have anything had you given them something little you know some money or something little that would have been more than sufficient for them why give them your ride and your turban which cost so much IB Omar said this man's father was a friend to Omar my father so Omar did not know the boy did not know the man he said that his father was a friend of my father and I heard the prophet sallallah alai wasallam say that it is among the best of B among the best of being kind respectful and obedient to your parent is to connect to Those whom were friends with your parents or with your father after he dies so this explains his generosity and kindness this explains why he gave that Nomad so much because he wanted to be kind obedient and respectful to Omar who had died and Allah would Grant him the greatest reward because of this we could go on and on with this because the prophetic tradition is filled with beautiful examples about the status of the parents in Islam however if we manage to benefit from this lecture from these words from this advice by implementing what we had learned if we manage to immediately go and look for our parents kiss their feet give them their due respect and obedience call them every day and if you can see them every single day and check on them and sit with them for an hour or two cheer them up bring good news to them if we can do this through learning from this lecture that would make the day and would benefit us in this life and in the hereafter and Allah Knows Best"
