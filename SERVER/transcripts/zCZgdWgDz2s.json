  "transcript": "uh in my room there was an accident and urine splashed all over the ground now the thing is there was some small drops some bigger areas but it's not completely covered so I walked over this floor I walked over this floor with red feet sometimes and and I said I don't know whether I touched the urine so by default nothing spread now the thing is if I overwhelm the area with water what happens is some of the water gets impure and then as the mod comes everything is good in the end now the thing is if I do this I know the urine will have spread now if I now pour water all over the place do I have a problem do I then have to repeat the prayers before which I touched it or is everything okay who in his right mind after having such an accident would feel negligent and feel free to walk on it with wet feet and go around and do whatever they want and after six seven months they come and say oh what should we do now you did this you deserve the consequences what to do this is not my job to tell you what to do you're negligent you're ignorant you are doing this intentionally pay the price so bring a Hoover that washes the area and shampoos it and clean the whole place and have some trouble doing it but at least you can uh do it with uh um peace in your mind uh so that you can pray and consider everything to be pure and Allah Knows Best"
