  "title": "Can I pray in a Hanafi masjid that delays the prayers? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh so basically I'm it's been like n nine months since I'm in India and uh one thing that I've noticed over here is that almost 98% of the mosque over here they delay the Salah for about like 2 hours one and a half hours like that like for example let's say take D okay basically D must be like uh prayed at 12:30 but they delay it up to 2 I understand ibraim I understand understand so what is your question they're Han so what's the yes so like what's the solution to it okay the solution is that you must pray in the masjids with them though they delay the and the and sometimes but they still pray it within the parameters of the prayer you know every prayer has a beginning and the end their beginning is a bit twisted and late unlike the other three schools of thought and they're fixed on it they don't want want to follow the Sunnah this is up to them but as long as they pray within the accepted timing of the Salat you have to pray with them in the Masjid if they delay it way off in this case no so for example starts at two at 12:15 and starts at 3:30 if they delay aan to 3:30 now this is not permissible for you to pray with them because the time is expired you have to pray on your own in your home but if they offer the Adan at 2:00 so it's still an hour and and 30 minutes before then you have to pray with them so that you would not miss the congregation and Allah knows best but of course if you can go toid who pray on actual times according to the Sunnah that would be a win-win and Allah Knows Best"
