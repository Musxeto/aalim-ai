  "title": "Can we give zakat to non muslims (whose hearts are inclined to Islam) Tawbah Ayah 60 assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah the almighty says in chapter 9 verse 60 of the Quran zaka expenditures are to be allocated to the poor to the needy to those employed to collect the zaka to those whose hearts are to be reconciled for freeing slaves from bondage for those in debt and for those striving in the cause of Allah and for the Wayfare an obligation imposed by Allah shake what is meant by the fourth category those whose hearts are to be reconciled this Ayah which is 960 chapter 9 Surah TBA verse number 60 is listing the eight categories of the recipients of zakat and the fourth category are those whose hearts are inclined to Islam meaning that this is the only category that can be given zakat and they're not Muslims such as the tribe chief of a non-muslim tribe who's interested in Islam who's showing sympathy to Islam and we believe that if we give him some money being the tribes uh uh chief that he would accept Islam and by him accepting Islam the whole tribe would accept Islam and this in this case this is permissible and the likes and this is an issue of dispute because some scholar say that that was this category was only at the time of the Prophet Alam which is reported that Omar said may Allah be pleased with him that this was in the beginning of Islam now those whose hearts are not inclined to Islam we don't need them so we don't give this to them but the most authentic opinion is that we can utilize money of zakat these eight categories are the are of zakat which is mentioned in this Ayah so it can be given to those whom we may fear their uh um wrath and harm to the Muslims or we are hopeful in them becoming Muslims or sympathetic with Islam and the Muslims so we may give them this and Allah Knows Best"
