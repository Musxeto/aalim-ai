  "transcript": "even a while early he was happy for many today behavior Western visuality Hirayama Dean I'm a bad dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh all praise be to Allah the ocean the creator of the heavens and the earth the one who bestowed upon us his endless favors and blessings that are beyond count Allah the Almighty had given us everything and the best gift dalla had given us is the gift of guidance imagine if allah azza wajal made us the leavers made us people without a purpose in life how life would be allah azza wajal gave us seasons so that we can worship Him so that we can get closer to him so that we can benefit ourselves Allah tells his messenger sallallahu alayhi wa ali was tell them why I bowed Rebecca Hetalia tear carotene and worship your Lord until there comes to you the straight initi which is death so this is our mission and vision on earth we have to worship Allah till death do us apart from this dunya we worship Allah strive to gain his pleasure subhanahu wa'ta'ala and we will find that Allah is most generous that Allah is most merciful no matter what we do to please him Allah would come to us with folds and folds of appreciation and gratitude imagine prophet tells us allah√≠s author Sam whoever fasts a day in the cause of Allah Allah will distant his face from Hellfire the journey of 70 years one day and this is your reward then what do you expect would happen to you for fasting in the whole month of Ramadan which is the forum which is a pillar of Islam Allah the Almighty has displayed his mercy when he made seven gates to hell and eight gates to paradise and paradise is Allah's mercy when the Prophet told us in the authentic hadith alayhi salatu wassalam Hellfire and paradise complained to Allah how did I said oh Allah only the weak and the poor enter me fire says that only the rich and the powerful enters it and it has consumed itself Allah said to paradise you are my mercy paradise is a large mercy eight gates Allah dedicated a gate only for those who fast and it's called Al Rayyan may Allah still make me and you among those who enter from that gate so when we speak about the month of mercy we definitely know that ramadan is when allah smurfs e is highly visible for everyone to see Roma Bahn the Prophet tells us Holly salatu salam that whoever fasts ramadan out of belief in it and anticipating the reward at the side of allah azza wajal Allah will forgive all of his sins holla you fast because you're ordered choice yet look at the great reward that allah azzawajal gives to you through fasting usually people think that fasting is hard it's difficult especially for those brothers and sisters living in the Scandinavian countries where fasting could be as long as 20 to 21 hours a day yet by Allah it is a mercy imagine this hardship you're suffering from due to fasting this hardship will intercede for you on the day of judgement the it's a dolly salat wa salam fasting and Koran will intercede on the day of judgment to the servant fasting says oh allah i prevented him from eating and his desires during the daytime so except my intercession and the Quran says o Allah I have prevented him from sleeping at night so accept my intercession and allah azzawajal accepts their intercession if you look at the doing of the Companions of allah the companions of the prophet eres la Jerusalem you will find that they used to adorn the Koran during the month of ramadhan they used to recite it a lot contemplating upon its verses some of them would finish the whole Quran in three nights some instead some intent rajab said the seller used to recite the Quran during Ramadan during prayers and outside of prayers kitada may Allah have mercy on his soul used to teach only the Quran in Ramadan Azzurri used to say whenever Ramadan is due it is only for reciting the Quran and feeding the people in nil hakkim by the way I'm not fasting this is being pre-recorded before a day before Ramadan so if you see me drink my tea don't say who the chef is fasting no I'm not fasting yet and the Hakka says that whenever Ramadan was due a man Malik a blue anise the great imam of Medina used to run away from reading the hadith and sitting with the scholars and would isolate himself to reading and studying the Quran and so did Sofia Anna theory he would recite the Quran as a priority throughout the whole month and this is what Muslims do this is the month of or an quran' was revealed in ramadan if you look at the profit that is a lot to Salem he used to study and revise the Quran with with gibreel every single Ramadan and in the last Ramadan he revised it with gibreel twice and this was an indication of the approaching of his death so Lala are you are using you Roma Bahn people recite the Koran a lot during night prayer and only in Ramadan we have taraweeh night prayer that is prayed in congregation only in Ramallah we pray a night prayer throughout the whole year but not in congregation in Ramadan we all gathered in a masjid as the Prophet did that is awesome for two three and maybe four nights in his life until he stopped and he told his companions I saw what you did the previous night's that is praying behind me in Taba but I was afraid that it might be come mandatory and I didn't want to burden my own after he died alayhi salatu salam Omaha pop revived the Sunnah and made the companions all pray taraweeh hang congregation behind oh babe niqab and Tami Matt daddy may Allah be pleased with them they didn't prey half an hour a night like we do they used to pray reciting about 200 verses of the Quran and the people were so tired that they used to lean on sticks to be able to stand up and they used to finish night prayer just before fetcher nobody complained of being tired the complaint of not having time because of work they dedicated this month to worship in a large diligent because this is a season this is where you make profit if you miss the season and you don't work the end of the season nobody's gonna buy it from you anything the Prophet told us had a historic was Sarah the glad-tidings whoever prays night prayer during Ramadan Allah will forgive all of his sins if he had done this out of conviction and anticipation of reward from Allah Allah subhanAllah Allah is ojen want forgive our sins just Ramadhan just training training normal Allah forgives you then a large doujin even gives us a glad tiding that whoever offers night prayer during lailatul utter the night of decree allah azza wajal would forgive his sense so no matter where you go Allah wants to forgive your sins Oh what you have to do is show that you want him to forgive your sense if you look at the times of Muslims they're wasting it the previous years when people used to gather in the messages you would find the heedless their moles or in their clubs watching TV neglecting the bounties of Allah soldier that are given account during these blessed nights of Ramadan now people are in lockdown things are closed they are confined to their homes the happy only the fortunate only those who are guided will be able to utilize it those who are not those who are unfortunate would be sitting on their smart smartphones watching the TV screens killing time as they say and time has no guilt to be killed for in Ramadan though prophet alayhi salatu salam used to be as generous as the wind and the wind is generous to all it doesn't select an area and neglects one it's for all so he used to give generously and the most generous he he would give was during the month of Ramadan when gibreel used to come and revise the Koran with him why because whenever you revise the Koran your Eman increases and your spending in the cause of Allah increases the Prophet told the sorry his salat was thinner and encouraged us to give in the cause of Allah whoever brakes fast of someone who is fasting meaning providing him with food to break his fast with allah azzawajal will give him the exact and of reward that the first fasting person had received so the Prophet is encouraging us to give to feed those who are fasting and now at times of difficulties the Muslims are suffering everywhere a lot of the Muslims depend on their jobs put food on the table without jobs during the lockdown we're unable to get out of their house houses and work from doing this for the welfare of the whole community and for their own safety how can they eat if they were not fortunate have good brothers and sisters to have good neighbors around them to look after them send them money to send them food there will be in dire state this is your chance to follow the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salaatu seven who told us that on the day of judgement when the sun draws closer to the humans when they sweat to their deeds every believer would be under the shade of his charity so if you have given generously during your lifetime cause of Allah to the poor and needy Muslims you will have this shade to protect you from the heat of the Sun but if you did not then you will be in need when fasting and charity are combined when Sbrocco and fasting are combined this is a formula for a loss forgiveness the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam fasting is a shield protection and charity extinguishes that extinguishes thin as water extinguishes fire an enormous Jeffrey said may Allah have mercy on his soul I like for a Muslim to increase spending in the cause of Allah following the footsteps of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam first and also because the people need his charity for their livelihoods and because a lot of them are so busy with fasting or tired because of fasting that they are unable to make ends meet so fasting during the month of Ramadhan is definitely a plus to you and to those who you give to and the profit is awesome said that loud and clear when he said that money does not become less when you give charity from it which means that it encases it doesn't count how much you have what counts is how much Baraka how much blessing in it Allah Azza WA JAL puts you can earn tens of thousands a month yet you still considered to be poor and needy because there is no Baraka in it and Allah Azurill could give you a thousand or two a month which is more than sufficient and you save from it so what we need brothers and sisters is to acknowledge the things we can do in Ramadan and as we said before this Ramadan is the acid test of our Eman throughout years before covered 19 we used to worship Allah in the Masjid aggregation spend time between Arthur and Maghreb in the Masjid after Fajr prayer until schloop in the Masjid break our fasts in the Masjid pray taraweeh in the Masjid offered the hundred in the Masjid now is the test where allah azza wajal would see whether we worship him out of habit or out of love and sincerity those who would find it difficult to worship Allah in their homes get bored when do when they do few minutes here and there and that's it and then start watching TV or playing video games those would have failed miserably may Allah protect us all but those who business as usual offering night prayer offering tearaway with the family reciting many Jews of the Koran per day and night making dua making vicar reciting the Quran when they're standing when they're sitting when they're lying down occupying there day and night with things that would get them closer to allah azza wajal they are on the right track and they will be among those who are winners so I pray to allah azza wajal that he makes me anew among the winners among the successful and among those who taste a las mercy in this life before they find it clear on the day of judgment I mean and may allah azza wa jal keep us all safe Allahu Alem when I swear to Allah Almighty he asked them was a lot allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa d he what else would he be and i made it wider Ernie he was off me he as me you"
