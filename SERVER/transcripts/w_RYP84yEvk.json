  "transcript": "Zephyr says could you please explain the meaning of the hadith souls are like conscripted soldiers the hadith is a cycle Hari and elsewhere the Prophet says souls are like conscripted soldiers those whom they recognize they get along they get along with and those whom they do not recognize they will not get along with the hadith simply states a fact that we all find and can sense and that is there are people that you are drawn to without knowing why and there are people that you are repelled away from you don't like they they're just not your type there's no chemistry this chemistry is what the Prophet is telling us about Aristotle sir where is it originating from some scholars say that good guys enjoy the company of good guys righteous people enjoy the company of righteous people and evil people enjoy the company of evil people and this is why they say birds of a feather flock together this is natural someone who likes shooting ranges and guns would like others who go hunting and when they sit together they speak about the gauges and the distances and the best target they have tried and the different calibers of bullets etc those who like cars they like others who like to speak about cars about the turbocharged about drag racing about zero-to-sixty about electrical electric cars etc those who like music who like rap songs who like movies sit with people who are like them so mice's natural and the Prophet is telling us this alehissalaam and some interpret this hadith as the souls when they were created thousands and hundreds of thousands of years ago before being inserted into their bodies allah azza wajal met made them meet and those that were similar and alike they were having these feelings and when they were created on earth these feelings resurfaced and allah azza wajal knows best however this doesn't mean that if you see someone who's righteous practicing and a good person and you feel sort of resentment you don't like him I don't like this guy's guts I don't like the way he speaks this doesn't mean that you should consider this hadith working for you rather it means that there is something wrong with you because by default if you're a righteous person if you're a good Muslim and practicing one that person you should have chemistry so this means that I have to change myself I have to change my character and adjust it so that I would be interested in taking that brother as a close friend a close ally and a good brother to hang out with and Allah social knows best"
