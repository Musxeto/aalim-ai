  "title": "Does Laughing or Smiling nullify your Prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hammad says does laughing nullify our prayers what about smiling during prayer the consensus of scholars is that laughing nullifies a person's prayer it's like speaking so when a person is laughing in he's shaking his shoulders or uttering a sound anyone looking at him would not say that he's praying because this goes totally against prayer what kind of prayer is this when you are laughing and breaking in laughter so the consensus of scholars that this prayer is invalid now smiling is a different issue and smiling is an expression on the face it's like frowning it's like an expression that comes due to the pain you're having in your stomach it's an expression but this does not impact your prayer in terms of validity so it is valid without any problem insha'Allah however it is not something that is productive it reduces your reward the more you do it because definitely it impacts your who sure so when a person smiles then this negatively impacts his prayer in reducing the amount of reward is getting and I'm talking about normal people because I've seen people who have problems in their lives that during prayer if you look at them they're always doing this smiling excessively to the extent that you're afraid this is is this a serial killer or what the clown why is he doing this and you keep on looking at them while they're praying but they can't help it and if you tell them he says I know but I don't know why I just simply can't control the reflexes on my face and this is may Allah protect us and save us is different this person is doing it because it's out of his control this is different for from someone who's praying and then he looks at the children in front of him and he smiles because they did something funny you shouldn't have looked at the first place and even if it took place in front of you if you were realizing who you are standing in front of and the Jenna and the NAR are waiting for you you wouldn't have smiled you would have thought differently because prayer is something that is different altogether from your normal day-to-day activities"
