  "title": "If Muslim sins & repents will his bad deeds change into good deeds like new reverts? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question today is um so we know that people who are reward and converts to Islam from other religions once they um like accept Islam all their past things are forgiven and whatever things that they may have committed in their ignorance in this has been forgiven so is it the same for the Muslim person who was a Muslim born Muslim and race who committed almost the same levels of sin and repented to Allah with his things also be forgiven or should he like come like say shahada and everything and come to Islam in order to reach that level of forgiveness so if I understand brother Abdul aziz's question is the comparison between a person who reverted to Islam who was originally a disbeliever and accepted Islam as mentioned in Surat al-fore Khan Allah azzawajal would transform his sins into Good Deeds and that's a huge gain and reward so he's asking what about an original Muslim if he was an open sinner he committed so many major sins and he repented will Allah azzawajal also transform his bad deeds into Good Deeds similarly to the person who accepted Islam there is an issue of dispute some Scholars say yes some Scholars say no and we Depend and rely entirely on Allah the generous the most forgiving the most merciful so it is not beneficial for us to go into details especially with those who have a problem up here I had sessions with people who were so despaired of their sins that shaytan managed to trick them into committing acts of apostasy and leaving Islam so that when they return to Islam all of their sins they've committed would be transformed into Good Deeds and this is outrageous how would a Muslim commit an act of apostasy just to get more reward this definitely indicates that this person is not only a delusional rather he is not a real Muslim because this goes against his true DNA to commit kuffer just to get more reward of course this is not acceptable or uh um approved by anyone to be done so trust Allah if you were engaged in major sins in the past and now you've repented you've expressed sincere and deep remorse you pledged not to go back to such sins and life and you sought Allah's forgiveness and you're still seeking it and you're doing good deeds rest assured that Allah will forgive your sins and that his generosity subhanahu wa ta'ala is unlimited and if he wills it he will transform your previous sins into Good Deeds but don't make this your prerogative don't make this your Target rather repent and feel deep remorse and do good deeds and inshallah you will be in good hands"
