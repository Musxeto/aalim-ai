  "transcript": "I I've been struggling with this one ever since I read this hadith which um stuff I have to admit I I didn't like when I read it. And the hadith is uh the prophet peace be upon him he said that the people of Yemen are the best of people. And I also read a hadith where it says that there's uh no race is better. There's no racial supremacy. And then I I read this one and to this day I'm still struggling believe like why are the the people of are the people of Yemen better? Why are the people of Yemen the best of people? The prophet did not say that they are the best in the sense of that they are the most believers. He said that they have the cleanest of hearts and the truth the most truthful and honest of rhetoric. They don't lie. That's in generality. And this is one of the ways of the prophetam of being positive. He said positive things about all the tribes in Arabia about the people in Tamim in Naj. He said this about the people of hij. He said this about this and that because the prophet was always positive looking at the positive things of the people not looking at the negatives and to put them down. So this is not a blank check blank for them to do whatever they want. They said that simply they have clean hearts. They don't hold a grudge and we see this among the people we know from Yemen. We know them. I'm not talking about the Houthis. So it's you can't say that this about people uh uh in generically. I hope this makes sense. Well, could you don't mean to keep going on this, but could you not argue that that's racial supremacy? So what? We do know that there is racial supremacy. We do know that although blacks and whites, red and yellow are equal and they only differ with the tawa, the piety in the heart, but we also know that Allah selected the Arabs due to their language, due to their their heritage, due to their uh supremacy at the time between the Bzantians, the Persians, the Jews and the Christians of maintaining a level of moral conduct and um a level of social uh justice between them at the time. But today we don't judge people by the color. If in Saudi Arabia you see this, we may have imams who are black. We have non-Arabs leading the prayer. You'll have me. I'm not originally Arab. I'm originally from Indonesia. So nobody says anything. Nobody dares to say anything with my 9 mm Glock. But still we respected and and we feel they're of our homies. We have no problem. So at at at a certain time the Arabs were chosen people the same way Jews believe that they were chosen at the Yes. And this is why Quran is in Arabic. It's not in any other language. You can have translations in many languages but Quran is Arabic. So can you say Arabs were the chosen people? No. Because we have the worst scum from the Arab world. Yeah, you give we can few name few but it's not the race you don't have the uh um what is it the notion that I can say bad things about Islam because of this or that we don't have any racism in Islam blacks and whites are equal we have this we can see it everywhere my father-in-law is was black as night. My father-in-law, he's black and he's the most beloved person to my life. May Allah have mercy on his soul. That doesn't make any difference. We don't have this in us. We don't think of a race. Where are Where are you? Hispanic. No, I'm uh I'm everything. So everything, but originally my uh mom is Filipino, my dad is black. Yeah. So we we we we integrated. We don't look down at anyone."
