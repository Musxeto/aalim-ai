  "transcript": "perfect with no flood other laws of Allah a way of life of life a way of life away of knife Islam he is a way of net al hamdulillah he wa kafa was salat wa salam o Allah I bet he Ladino stafa all praise due to Allah and that is sufficient and we ask Allah to exalt dimension and send his blessings upon the prophets whom he has chosen this episode is a continuation of our previous episode where and we were discussing the issue of Buda and innovation I'm your host Abu Musab og I carry with me today is she husband Hakim dr. Mohammed and Sheikh Salim and Amory may Allah bless you all we were at some crossroads I believe when it came to the issue of innovations we dealt with many issues but the question which arises is are all innovations the same meaning they all have the same degree or some greater more dangerous than others their gravity can perhaps someone can discuss this issue and somewhat of an elaboration hamdullah salatu salam ala rasulina early he also here woman whether from a Terre Haute I am with Dean I'm about I just digress a bit then come to this that's fine issue no Muslim would like to commit with us if you ask any Muslim see his reaction I'm not the Nevada you are the Nevada so it is built within himself that we die something Despicable something abhorred no one likes it yet many Muslims they fall into this the tribe of Buddha why is that the reason is that you don't know the antithesis he don't know the opposite when you know the opposite you will know the better so if you're not the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah Salaam then you will know the bid annual avoiding that's why if you go to the Hadees about the reflections the feet and the trials most of them were narrated by sayidina her diva and he said sir of the allahu anhu people were asking about the good I was asking only about the evil blessed I don't fall into the mire of either because if you're not the evil and you're avoiding it that means they are doing good and listen and kill you know the Sunnah and what is right and what's correct you'll be falling and doing this thing out of ignorant good intent wrong action exactly so deeds would go back we we need to lay the foundations for every Muslim the deeds the ibadah the acts of worship in order to be accepted the scholar they say there are six conditions should be fulfilled condition of the one the reason a seventh why this particular act of worship is described why do we pray let's pray what's the reason the Eclipse takes place solar or lunar solo Oh noona if I want to play a clip spray and now it is Vida because the reason is not there the reason is not there so only you pray Eclipse prayer when the reason exists okay second condition number certain acts of worship Allah prescribed them and he specified a number so for prayer Taraka and i pray three it is vida why because this Avada has to be performed this much of this number of units like amount okay so if I increase I become I fall into the bid or decrease or decrease will do if I want to wash my older limbs five times owed which prophets allah salem said because we do but is required the why job is 1 or 2 O 3 is recommended the minimum is 1 and then the profs are celebrated that said famines add like a viola more time down whoever exceeds three is a transgressor and hear wrong with himself so if I wash 5 times Allah told me 3 upon the tongue of his prophet Salih Saleh so exceeding so here bidadi guarding the number and also here I like always digressing sorry the dickham the remembrance of Allah there are certain Dicker's limited by number certain Dicky's unlimited by number so if I reverse I may the limited unlimited and the unlimited limited advocate I fall into the Vida ok after the Salah if that is returned and make him 15 in this particular place then I fall into the Vida so the number who measured the reason the number the place this a bad has to be performed in this particular place I'll help you out of know how outside earth if we want to make hygiene Mina doesn't work no to off except around the Kaaba the place the place so the place of the avada the man who sneeze in the presence of Sedna Abdul of normal of the laranja and the man said wa alhamdulillah was salat wa salam ala rasulillah did not blood enormous it Khun Danai epaulet Ali I like in Makka the Harlem era personalized no mashallah so this man sneeze in the presence of abdullah nama and he said the Salah upon the promise of a cell he added that to the hand after sneezing he said hamdulillah that's fine then he added a next was salatu salam ala rasulillah and we and blessings be upon the last prophet did not de l'avenir model here to learn to learn from him he didn't tell him immediately you are deviant you're innovator he said first of all cool reliable Adel all of us send blessings upon the Prophet SAS Allah but this is not the way the puffs wasallam taught us very particular in this particular this is not the place of it after sneezing you say alhamdulillah and you see ya season she reveals does this relate to the place or to the context or your combining no no he this is the place of it at this the place where you should not offer the salat ation of the Prophet er will you say alhamdulillah I thought that it would fall under the context this is not the right context to say that but what they say the ulema this is not the place of it here okay this is not like for example in the prayer by the way his brothers and sisters bidders are in everything starting from the Voodoo they are books voluminous this size in Vedas because about the wudu be talked about the Salah it as a soap it as has crept into everything Saran Allah so the some people after the raising what they say send me Allah him an Haneda Habana wa lakal hamd what sugar very common was shook so they add this is bitter what's wrong with you thanking Allah is Vida you see the misconceptions that's why the mindset of the Muslims concepts are not clear I'm not telling you thanking Allah speed but this is not its place like thanks Muhammad Ali Oh silly mother say it's a hidden in the Salah no problem it's a hidden because our brothers may Allah guide all of us the K they are saying you hate problem you don't even want to call him a master no he is my Master isn't the top of my head solo Lyle Evans and he's the master of all the children of Adam but this is not what he taught us so please let us together hand in hand because all of us we loved the Prophet Elias Elam so let us follow his footsteps and let's stop calling each other names labeling each other's we are all Muslims and we love him so long I am and we want to be raised in his assembly in his gathering we don't want to be deprived of drinking from his fountain with the hadith in Sahih Muslim many Muslims there would be recognized they have the marks of the salon they followed and the marks of Voodoo and they would rush to this fountain to drink and the angels they would stop them they would chase them and the process of Jose said my companions my followers myomas you don't know what they did behind you after you they are changing and I believe he says accordingly second woe to them take them and the word is you do not know what they have innovate innovate see we don't want you imagine you see your prophet in front of you and he is given water and someone angel is grabbing your way they can go away we don't want that to happen so reason number place and the manor the manor the way in which this a bada is conducted carried out for example the will do how do we do we do by washing the hand so there is a sequence we have to follow if someone started by the fee in the reverse mode he worked all the limbs is his Oodle valid no because this manner this way is not what allah prescribed and his messenger told us okay so the manner also the dimension time okay time there's a time kind reason time time yes one of those reason so reason reason time will elaborate now place number mana yeah and one which is called the genus of the kind how about this at the time which one have we not yet discussed the time and the genus let's postpone them till after the break this is like Allah here salam alikoum it's alive but I gotta be back shortly allah allat salam ala rasulillah - you said kind and time these were we were discussing before the break I guess the prerequisite so for a deed to be accepted it has to be in compliance with the Dean in these six aspects to have not been addressed which is the time one of them is time yes so certain acts of worship bound with time okay the players all the five prayers they have a fixed timeframe okay I cannot pray failure now I cannot play the hole at mark the time Madlib I cannot sir can someone vest Ramadan and shout that your body cannot ELISA was sick or pray Jummah prayer or something exactly sir so Allah subhana Allah impose or prescribe certain acts of worship in particular time this act of worship has to be performed Hajj is a clear example the Hajj okay so the time and the last one so if we are doing it not in it is time for example you and me gave the example of the Eclipse prayer okay then it becomes Vida becomes be done but this is not the time of it then the kind of the genus this is actually talks about the kind of the animal that needs to be sacrificed the sacrificial animal because sacrificing an animal is a bad Karuna solar Tavano tsukuyomi ayah or Marathi Alya so linear America one 1/2 so these are acts of worship the sacrifice so Allah mentioned and specified certain types of animals that we call them the life of stocks Helena which means cows panels she-goat these are the types can someone for example offer a chicken for like a pea no on AE that is not correct for has half a million even it's not because should not miss the point the point is a a vada submission and worshiping Allah on his terms so he is telling you I want you to do this no I will do you I will do it but something else do you know better than Allah I think this is very important particularly when we talk about the cattle fertile because some people have said they rationalize it and they rationalize it and they said that it's possible to give money instead of the need of the poor and all that and here you're talking about the kind does this fall under that a does for them that's why because this is 50 issues both the four amounts when it come to the cattle fertile or the recommend food even imam abu hanifa i know i said in when it becomes difficult for you Nazir in session meaning yeah not as a recommendation there it is it's difficult you don't have the food and this income few years ago when communism was as peak yes you could not find food because the food they give you it was Russian selection okay so then that factor is applicable no so coming to this point which is the time so you cannot come out if someone who say I'm going to slaughter a horse horse is halal by the way it is holla at the time of the problem it was slain and people they added no problem but you cannot because then it becomes Vida she has him can you tell us about the gravity of bida are they an equal level how do we the scholars when they commented on the hadith of the prophet aerosol salam when he informed us that his own mode would be divided in 73 sects all of them our inhale except one and that is those who are following the footsteps of the prophetess and the companions some people objected and said is this possible 72 SEC of the old Muslim Ummah will be in Hellfire well the scholar said that this is not for eternity and they differentiated between the innovation practiced and they say that there are two levels of innovation a level of innovation that nullifies Islam totally and even if that person prays fast offers hatch because he nullified his Islam with this innovation he's not a Muslim anymore so this is known in issues of art either if someone prays but he goes to peers or he goes to grave yards and he asks the deceased give me benefit and prevent harm from me he slaughters to them these are acts of shift of associating others with Allah it nullifies his it's not even if he prays so such innovations is called Buddha Mahavira it will take the person out of the fold of Islam now there are other kinds of Buddha but it doesn't reach that a serious level and these Buddha's are either related to conviction or related to action but they do not reach the level of things that nullify your Islam and we have in that like Sheikh Salim said the sky is the limit when you want to innovate every single thing you can innovate a lot because islam is restricted it's limited to a number of things that you should do you should believe and this is a sunnah so if you want to innovate if you get out of this inner circle the sky is the limit you can innovate in every single thing we are actually getting close towards the end and there's one thing which we have to address before we conclude the issue of the previous generations are maybe forefathers our ancestors may be relatives currently who are engaged in beta or have been engaged in bida and they fell into this trap and we said in the earlier episodes that you know as a hadith of the Prophet Allison I'm explicitly says that every innovation will lead astray and whatever the stray is going to the fire one may assume that therefore every one of these anyone who falls into any kind of bid is gone to the Hellfire and so the mirror involvement in a bit irrespective of its gravity is gonna lead to the Hellfire is this is sound understanding or do we need to explain that better this is good question actually and here we need to differentiate between two things what she hasn't mentioned and what you hear the scholars are saying this is whoever does this is going to hell and he's the kafir they are talking about ex person in general this is an optimal arm about an action not the action not about the actor though the rulings and the Sharia as mentioned by the scholars there - type pokemon our general ruling X person X element and the specific so now if someone comes and say my father is doing this this is this and that which he is doing acts of Cofer and he died is he covered you cannot say so here you have to understand the following a person might commit co 4 and that will not make him cover there are many examples in the Quran the disciples of essa aleihsalaam in surat al mahalia's 30 year order Buchannon of Jalali enema edit and minister ma can your Lord send down a table for us questioning what singing his ability in keeping video captioning allows ability and power down King allows ability and power is covered did they become kafirs disbelievers for the table came down the table came down and Allah did not considered them disbelievers because they were ignorant the followers of moosa alaih-is-salaam oh sorry the moment they came out of that the pass over their feet are still wet was tell when they passed by people worshipping idols they immediately change a point for house of God like their God Allah Allahu Kamala who alia did Moses tell that you became disbelievers you're a negated apostate it now they were ignorant the companions of the prophet Salih Saleh he galinha data and Wat Kamala home data and what the Companions they were travelling with the prophecy of Salem and they passed by the pagans Domitian and they were hanging their swords on the tree seeking you know victory blessing so some those who said this not all the Sahaba those who are you yes recently reverted they said oh there was another tree why they should have them three so you see the prophecy last element is a full tomb well the Dean of severe chemical at Renison ie the Musa Elena Allah had come along early he said by Allah a statement exactly like what when Ursula Elko houses a pouring father God like they go so the parcel assalam he equated the two statements that this statement is equal to this is covered this is covered this is blasphemous this is blasphemous did he say that you are did he consider them disbelievers the confinements know why they get the word ignitor so now coming a Muslim as shyffilis LA we've been Tamiya in the Vltava I think volume 18 he said what Cathedral mineral Emma is self will be done and many of the scholars of the Salif they made with us and they fell into the bidders yeah had it done no house area some are hadith they thought they were authentic how I act Lamia for more or some ayat they misunderstood so the a person will fall into the Buddha and not by necessity becomes a move today if I ask you if I want to work my arm up to here to the amp it is the Sunnah this Vida no hesitation Vida Abu Huraira was washing up to the amp who has Abu Hurairah move that enough that was his understanding and misinterpretation of the hadith table called earlier lalu though they wanted to wear ornaments up to his armpit and he was doing this secretly but the action itself Peter Abdul of narooma used to wash the inside of his eyes till he became blind he's washing the inside of the eye sooner mitah did he become up dead after loved neuroma no because that is his II yeah so we tell all the Muslims don't be frightened those who passed away Allah is more merciful to them than our mother than their mothers Allah is the just but we have to be careful we have to be careful now we know now yes they didn't know we knew that this is wrong but we have to the very important thing that I Annie just remembered that the prophet alayhi salatu salam said in an authentic hadith which is frightening and we should be careful about he said that allows oil has blocked repentance from every innovator after a debate after all so people who indulge in major sins they can repent because they know that they're doing wrong the person innovating would never repent not that Allah doesn't want him to repent he would never repent because he thinks that he's doing he's doing a good thing and this is why it is a must upon every single Muslim to revise to review if he's falling to Quran and Sunnah or not because this is the focal point otherwise he would be in losses even Allah he just reminded me with the sturdy from nodosa daemul I said I was worshipping Allah and doing certain acts of worship based on hadith which is fabricated for 40 years though he has compiled the book about the fabricated hadith he said I didn't check this nut after 40 years I checked this nut as found Subhan Allah so what's he doing bid are 40 years Allah Allah here and we will catch you in shallow Thailand the near future o sallallahu sallim ala nabina muhammad was Sarah Mary o muhammad aleyhi barakato we are life away"
