  "title": "Is small amount of Nutmeg in food permissible? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "isn't having some of it like having little amount of alcohol that is not wine and i say the answer is no it's different first of all nut mug is spices the vast majority of schools of thought consider to be intoxicating like weed like hash so even even considers it to be like hash so the the malik is called the chaffee school the hambali school they all say that it is haram however some scholars contemporary especially say that little bit of it that fixes the taste would make it permissible so it's an issue of dispute but the vast majority say it's haram and whenever there is doubt we always take what is better to be safe than sorry first of all second of all industrial alcohol is not intoxicating by itself so if you ask me the question again and say if we add a drop or two of wine or brandy would that be haram said definitely haram but if the product itself has a drop or two of alcohol that is not intoxicating even if consumed in large quantities that is the food itself not the drops i said this is okay because this is not wine haram for itself when we go to nut mug we find that the vast majority say it is intoxicating it's not like industrial alcohol it is like wine it is like brandy it is like other intoxicating material that a single drop would be haram so i hope this answers your question"
