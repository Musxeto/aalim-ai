  "transcript": "Ondra says I want to buy from a website and can I pay for it with my credit card and after that in few days time I'll receive it is this permissible we talked if you remember a lot about credit cards and the action of buying through a credit card providing that you pay within the grace grace period and there is no possibility for you not to pay this is permissible providing a number of conditions for example if you pay an interest over what the actual dress is costing you then this is RIBA why is that because you're actually borrowing through this credit card you're not buying something from your own bank account you're actually telling the visa corporation or the mastercard that account blodge or the American Express to you authorizing them to buy something on your behalf pay for it and then you will pay them back now they usually give a grace period where they will not charge you an interest so if they do not charge you any interest and you pay immediately or soon afterwards and without any possibility of you indulging in RIBA then this is okay secondly the actual fees or membership that a subscription you pay for these credit cards they have to be realistic so if you pay like $30 a year $50 a year as a subscription this is reasonable scholars say this is within range but if you pay more than that then this is actual benefits actual interest over the loans they're giving you thirdly you should not withdraw cash with it so sometimes people use it as an ATM and when you use a credit card as a neat ATM when you draw a thousand dollars they'll charge you a fixed amount maybe it's ten dollars plus or minus so this ten dollars is considered to be an interest Ariba because again you know withdrawing from your own bank account you're actually borrowing so whether you borrow a dollar or you borrow 100,000 whatever extra you pay that would be considered to be River so in a nutshell if you already have a credit card and whenever you buy something you buy it and you have already authorized your bank to withdraw the amount from your bank account before the grace period is over so there's no possibility for you to pay RIBA then this is permissible inshallah oh my God Allah says"
