  "transcript": "um there is something called Law of Attraction uh it states that if you affirm something so many times you would start to believe that this will come true so like if I keep saying I'm getting a job I'm getting a job so many times then I will believe that I get a job and hence it does come true uh I tried this method and this is real and it works uh but I feel like it might be sh but then again I think Allah says that he as we think of him and he also says Allah acts according to our belief so so if I make Dua to get a job and then affirm again and again that I will get a job then I will start believing my Dua that it will come true uh they say is kind of signs but I feel this is a trap of the disbelievers yes this is a trap of Shan believing in the law of attraction is a form of shik it can be minor it can be major when you believe that you have the power to convince yourself that this is going to happen not depending on Allah not calling Allah subhana wa tala rather oh my cancer will be healed my cancer will be healed I put my hand where it is my cancer is going to be healed and I of a sudden mallah it's healed oh I did it I met a brother who's a dii who had cancer and he said I kept on saying this and repeating it and I got cured and the NLP and and the likes and and and all this Hocus Pocus stuff of of walking on uh fire and and and the likes without being harmed all all of this is shik you are depending on other than Allah claiming that by repeating something so many times it will happen by whose will I repeated it it happened so you're claiming that you have the influence and the power to do things you didn't do Dua you didn't ask Allah a gazillion times so that it would happen rather you depended only on yourself and Allah let you depend on yourself may Allah protect and this is not permissible at all"
