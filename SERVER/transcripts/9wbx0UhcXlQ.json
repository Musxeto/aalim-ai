  "title": "Husband buying house with Riba based Mortgage, what should the wife do? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for Fairuz husbands wanting to buy a house a mortgage and pay Reba we know the mortgage is RIBA based it's a loan where you give RIBA interest over that loan and the problem is when it fluctuates and it goes up so the property instead of being a hundred thousand dollars now with the interest it's 120 some say okay no problem I'll pay the 20% not only that during throughout the coming years it may ray rise up more and more and more according to inflation etc so it becomes complex it becomes compound interest and all of this is totally prohibited the third part would be what would fire ooze do because her husband is giving her an ultimatum whether you like it or not I'm buying the house you want to come you're welcome you don't want to come it's he has no problem with that I tell you and I give you an advice go and enjoy the house because you have zero sin on you living in such a mortgage house all the sin which is a major sin all the punishment or the torment in the grave and in the hereafter would be on your husband's so have no problem you did your due diligence you did your duty you gave him the advice that Allah told you to give him and hamdulillah you made your duty now he is the one who is sinful everything that he brings home from his Haram earning is halal for you and for your children because he's the one who earned it you did your job by advising him he doesn't want to listen it's up to him however usually it is not that easy especially when you love your spouse you don't want to see them end up in hell you don't have any other alternative advise them kindly showed them the fatwas this is not a necessity even if someone is forced to do or perform a surgical operation that requires money and he does not have this money he is not permitted to go and borrow with interest sure if he's going to die and how do you know that if he borrowed with interest and did the operation that he will live life and death is in the hands of allah azzawajal so even in the case where you are forced to do or undergo a surgery but you don't have the money for it you are not permitted you're not allowed to borrow for that by Arriba andele surgeon knows best"
