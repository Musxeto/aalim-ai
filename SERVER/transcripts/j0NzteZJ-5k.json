  "title": "Can I do adhkar (not aloud / silently) by only moving my tongue & lips #Assim #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I I saw one of your videos on YouTube where you said that it's permissible to recite Salah by just moving your tongue without without any audible noise my question is can I do the same with the morning and evening ofar by reciting thear without Sorry by resetting thear with just moving my tongue without any audible noise of course imagine if you're in the Masjid alongside 200 individuals and each one of them is making a noise when saying thear or reading the Quran that would be annoying and disturbing the peace and distracting you from even doing your own yes the Sunnah is to say it silently without making a noise"
