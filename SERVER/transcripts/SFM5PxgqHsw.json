  "transcript": "if while doing so I happen to touch my private part while cleaning myself would I have to perform another will do afterwards or not first of all we are presuming that this whistle is to uplift a major impurity a ritual impurity whether it's due to menses or to sexual intercourse so this is our first assumption assumption because if she was or he was taking a shower just to clean himself up then we say yes you have to make Woodill in the sequence known the face the arms the the wiping of the head and washing of the feet because this order has to be followed if you are taking a full rich major ritual bath you do not require the sequence because Buddha is a small impurity a small form of purity goes underneath the bigger form of purity which is ocean so number one she is performing a hustle to uplift a major ritual impurity number two it's a difference of opinion among scholars whether touching a person's private part invalidates the wood or not and the reason is the presence of two contradicting hadith on the surface and the scholars some of them said that one obligates the other and some said we don't know which one came before the other and another group said well we know that the default is that touching your body does not nullify your Woodill so touching any part of it afterwards means that this abrogates the old default and some went into a compromise by saying that touching your private part does not invalidate your Wordle unless it is touched with desire and lust so if we follow this last opinion and it might be inshaallah yan in the most appropriate in the sense that it makes things easier especially when there is a mixed opinion among scholars regarding this issue if we follow this opinion then your hustle is valid without any doubt but your Woodill is valid as well my personal advice would be to follow the sunnah when you make hustle therefore you do not need this the Sunnah is that you first of all wash your hands three times then you wash your private part at the very beginning then you wash your hands again from any dirt that might have stuck into it and then you perform Woodill without washing your feet then you pour three scoops of water on your head ensuring that the water reaches your scalp then washing the rest of your body at the end you wash your feet voila it's over this is a Sunnah so you make sure that you did not touch your private part in the process and Allah soldier knows best"
