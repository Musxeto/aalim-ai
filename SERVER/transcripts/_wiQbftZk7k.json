  "title": "Can I pray behind deviant imam who doesn't believe in islamic practices & other things Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "from canada says there's an imam and this imam believes in deviant things such as that stoning is not part of sharia prescribed punishment such as amputation of the hand of a person who steals something he doesn't believe in black magic he doesn't believe that non-muslims would not be admitted to jannah et cetera so he says can we pray behind such a person the answer is no this person is bad news i don't know how such a person can be allowed to give sermons but it's canada it's the u.s what do you expect there's no body governing them you want to become famous you go to these countries and say anything about islam negative you reject the quran everybody will clap to you say heinous things lie talk about corrupt akida they'll give you a thumbs up especially your ethnicity so if you're from pakistan all the pakistanis back you up if you're from egypt all the egyptians will back you up in that in that country no if you're from morocco all the moroccans will back you up people do not follow quran sunnah anymore they follow their football club they follow their country of origin and this is problematic when you don't have a body of real scholars auditing such imams preventing such imams from addressing the people because at the end of the day tomorrow is going to say here are tawis you wear them and it protects you from evil eye or from this or from that it's doing shirk but nobody is there to stand up for such imams so should we pray behind him the answer is no"
