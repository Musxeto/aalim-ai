  "title": "Ruling on men traveling alone in Islam? Is urban exploration permissible? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um Shake um here in America I'm an Urban Explorer uh I usually like to explore abandoned areas I've been to abandoned asylums abandoned caves abandoned mines etc etc um I actually visited France a couple of years back and I explored the catacombs unfortunately I haven't been able to find anything online that pertains to this I'm not sure if Urban exploration in theice Haram or Halal so I was just wonder if you could clear out this issue for me may Allah bless you what's your objective Muhammad from this um for me you know I don't go to parties I don't go to concerts for me when I go Urban exploring I get a really uh large sense sorry very large Rush of adrenaline and it's just really fun and I find is someone fulfilling so that is my main objective it's just like the sense of adventure in do do you go alone uh yes sir I do and is it dangerous um there is an element of danger to it that's a good question Ashley there is an element of danger to it sometimes but it's really rare okay so basically speaking traveling alone is not recommended in Islam see Islam encourages unity and being in congregation the prophet said said Alam a rider is a devil two Riders are two Devils three Riders are a convoy or a group in a journey so it is highly recommended that when you travel you travel with a group of Muslims to have your back to help you when you're in need and not to be like someone who goes mountain climbing for example and then he's stranded and no one to help him and in order to save himself he cuts his hand off why did you go there in the first place so traveling traveling alone is not recommended in Islam this is when a person is prone to The Whispers of shatan more than anyone one else imagine yourself in the Rockies uh camping alone in a tent and all what you hear are yotes and uh uh wolves and scorpions and everything is around you what do you think Shan is going to say to you trust Allah say the Dua yeah this is unheard of secondly endangering yourself you're just telling me that you go into caves and we know what may await you in caves these are yes they they may pump adrine in your veins and you may get the rush out of it but is it something that Islam promotes or encourages the answer is no it's a waste of money waste of time and as you've said you've done it for so many times and years and you've not discovered a treasure that would make you wealthy for the rest of your life or a historical uh uh forgotten uh continent or a city it's it's just waste of money yes you may find enjoyment in it but it is not something that may add value to as a Muslim Focus your effort Focus your uh uh uh energy invest the money you want to spend in something that would get you closer to Allah if we were to say it's a permissible thing it's a permissible thing it doesn't gain you any reward or or any closure to Allah if we were to say it's permissible let alone if there are any Haram things as I've mentioned to you and may Allah make things uh easy"
