  "transcript": "perfect with no flaws at all are the laws of a love a way of life a way of life a way of life all praise belongs to allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are going to be discussing the rights of the funeral joining us to discuss this topic we have with us from saudi arabia muhammad from the usa and from the uae may allah wrote you all for joining us now up until now we've covered death we've covered the washing of the body shrouding the body so now the body is ready to be buried also the genesis so everything has been done the janazah has been prayed so now we say for example we're outside of the masjid we've just finished praying salatul janazah and i'll start with you as always one part of the funeral right is that we carry the funeral whether from the place it was washed in to the masjid or to the place where we're going to pray and from there to the graveyard or to the cemetery and carrying it by itself you can carry it on the shoulders of men usually the best number is four so they take four corners and it has a handle for each corner where people would put it on their shoulders and carry it if it's a little bit more then there is no problem but providing that it does not jeopardize the funeral itself so if you carry it they may trip one of them they may trip and it may fall following the janaza has a number of sunan and it has a lot of bida innovations so do i walk behind it in front of it on its left or on its right the scholars say you can do all of that the scholars say even you can ride following the janazah but preferably that you are on the back some scholars say nowadays riding is dangerous so it is recommended that you ride in front of it so that you would not run over any of the people who are on their feet pedestrians etc the prophet ordered us alison so this is a clear instruction not to follow a janazah with fire nor with a loud voice and what does fire mean what do you think fire means literal fire the scent the people you know want to honor it so they bring sent coal and they would or even torches so that to announce to people look this is a dignitary this is an important person and also not to follow it with a voice salt and the voice means that the wailing and people say oh he died we and this is a characteristic of women usually they say that he's my husband in arabic they say he's my camel he's my wall and they say we and all these not necessarily referring to a country that other than any this is the norm where they start to do things and doing these things by itself is a major sin for example tearing the clothes slapping the faces all of this or even scratching the faces all of this is part of the jahiliyyah this is part from the jahilia indeed and and yes i want to remind the sisters in particular the bewailers unfortunately and even today in some muslim countries they hire women to beware to cry and this woman if he didn't repent before her death he will be resurrected clothed in town with a cloak made of tower this is what the prophet sallam said and we forgot maybe to mention that it is very important that the deceased should write in his will that i absolve myself i am washed my hands of any bewailer any bewailer so if they cry after his death then that would not affect him otherwise he'll be tortured in his grave because he did not forbid them from doing such acts just this the innovations and the innovations the innovations the moment the people that carried the body started making takabeer shouting the khalid and all these arbiters saying what i do saying all these are innovations we have to walk and march in sakina in peace and calmness reflecting that one day you will be the one who is carried but not in a slow motion like dead people do not quickly we carry the generals not running not running in a risky way okay so that is we hate sin okay if it is a righteous as the prophet said if it is a righteous person you are forwarding it to something good if it is evil soul you are getting rid of it from your shoulders from your shoulders yes so these are many innovations me what they are doing and when we reach the grave insha allah is going now to explain how to lower the body inshallah before we get to that i wanted to just i suppose make a point to ask we have wailing crying and saying why why this and that the extremes that people go to now this is the thing that we should avoid because it shows that you're maybe not even content with what allah has decreed i want to compare this if one of you can remind us  tears might be natural but we see the reaction of the prophet peace be upon him when his son passed away perhaps we can give the comparison between these two so shedding tears is natural and that's a sign of rahmah okay allah puts it in humans hearts and when the prophet his grandson okay the son of his daughter passed away they saw him that the tears were rolling on his teeth and he mentioned that this is from allah subhana tahalla what islam not the proofs of is the wailing the lamentations slabbing chiefs because these were practices and traditions of the pagans because we have to keep in mind that a muslim believes that this is something inevitable and you are moving your lord it's not the end it's not the end he's just moving from one phase to another reason then we reach the eternal life so in addition to this also you find people started wearing particularly women wearing black and sometimes it takes them three days sometimes 40 days sometimes a year a year it depends and it depends on the as they interpret it the degree of sadness and so which is completely better it is nothing and this was imported by through the christians for example in countries that have some christians in them because they do this muslims by imitation who were ignorant they started imitating them and they applied it into islam and we have to be careful in other countries it can be different colors it can be different practices we have to be careful by just asking what is the sunnah and forget about the others any other thing is just take because which is easier to learn the sunnah and by learning the sun all the others you can say that this is better the prophet didn't do that yesterday i would like to comment on an issue that a lot of the muslims may have misconceptions and not only that the even the companions had misconceptions in the prophet said allah in an authentic hadith that the deceased is being tormented by the crying of his family and the scholars interpreted this but the companions themselves had dispute upon them and among those who stand out is mother aisha and she said why do you say this that a deceased is being tormented by the crying that is of his family where allah says that an individual would not be blamed or accounted for someone else sin and the hadith is completely authentic there's no way we can say that it's not authentic it has been narrated by a number of companions but the scholars differed into interpreting it the majority say that this is the fact when a person actually orders his family to cry and wail when he dies so show off and make a scene out of it and the arabs the pagans used to say poetry they would make a will when i die do this make a scene out of it other scholars say no in case of a muslim if a muslim does not if he knows that his family is going to wail on him he has to put it in a will the most authentic opinion is that this is the norm the torment mentioned in the hadith is not a punishment it is something that saddens a person exactly as interpreted in the hadith of the prophet alaihis that traveling is a piece of torment and it's the same adam adam and this is the choice of him tamiya may allah have mercy on him he says that if a person dies and their his family cries not well christ he's saddened by this and this is a part of torment but it is not a punishment from allah in islam other than the husband it is not permissible to mourn anyone for more than three days the hadith of um may allah be pleased with her when her father passed away may allah be pleased with him she on the third day requested her maid to bring her some perfume and she put it on the side of her face and she addressed those next to her because she was teaching them she said by allah i have no intention to perfume myself or to wear this but had i not heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam say and command us that it is not permissible for any person to mourn a deceased more than three days except for a wife mourning her husband had i not heard this i wouldn't have put that perfume i may allah wrote you for this we're going to stop here and go to a short break so dear viewers do stay tuned insha allah will be back with you in a very short moment welcome back to your viewers we're here discussing the rights of the funeral now before the break we're mentioning some of the part of the morning and whaling and things like this so we mentioned some of the things which are forbidden and one of the ones that we were still discussing i think was the 40 days and customs like this that might be taken from other sources so you had something to add to this well in islam other than the husband it is not permissible to mourn anyone for more than three days the hadith of um be pleased with her when her father passed away may allah be pleased with him she on the third day requested her maid to bring her some perfume and she put it on the side of her face and she addressed those next to her because she was teaching them she said by allah i have no intention to perfume myself or to wear this but had i not heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam say and command us that it is not permissible for any person to mourn a deceased more than three days except for a wife mourning her husband had i not heard this i wouldn't have put that perfume so what we hear and see some people commemorating the death of a person on the third day and they invite people on on the 10th day a week afterwards and then on the 40th and then after passing of the whole year islam doesn't tell you to live in mourning all the time like other sects do islam is a religion of progressiveness you go on move on the issue of 40 days originated to my knowledge from the pharaohs when they buried their kings and their priests they used to put food and money and also a ride next to them because they thought that after 40 days they'll be resurrected and they would be hungry and they would need these things and more in addition to this when a king died they used to kill his servant and bury him inside the same grave yes you know that they had very big they killed the servant they killed the seven believing that that when the king comes back to life so the servant would come back to life and he would start serving him to this level of ignorance they reached that so they kill a living soul just to imagining that based on their belief that it serves us and the poor servant damned when he's alive and damned when he's dead yeah i'm like we haven't picked up this customer yeah i want to ask this question in particular what is the meaning of mourning in islam mourning is avoiding permissible things so when we say that a woman has to mourn her husband and the period known in normal circumstances is four months and ten days for a wife to mourn her husband she has to mourn him mourning is a sign of grief so a woman is not allowed to wear fancy clothes that would beautify her she should wear normal clothes but no colors so the color is not related so people say that when women are in mourning they should be wearing black but this is baseless in islam she wears anything but definitely not something that is too extravagant so she should not wear perfumes or makeup things that beautify her she should not leave the house unless she has a necessity for example people go into extreme some people say it's okay as long as she comes before sunset she could go to the fun fairs she could visit france she could go to her mother and she could do whatever she wants and on the far extreme you find people and i know you may have heard of this saying that she's not allowed to go to the roof the moon is not allowed to look at her and it's forbidden and she's not allowed to answer phone calls because people should not listen to her voice and she should not reply to salaam all of this is nonsense so this is what we call the edda period for a woman who is widowed yes so she is allowed to go out when there is a necessity or when there is a need what's the difference between a necessity and a need a need is not necessarily a necessity in the sense that a woman works as a teacher and this is her livelihood the government does not give her time off to spend four months and 10 days in this case because she is afraid to lose her job it is permissible for her to go to teach if she has sheep as in the old times if she worked in a farm it's so permissible for her to go and work in her farm or shepherd her sheep this is a need a necessity is something that is even greater than that so even if it's at nighttime and she's sick she has to go to the doctor no one would say no no she is she has to say even she dies so this is the difference now part of why she's not allowed to do these things decorate herself perfume go out is because she can't be married at this time and for her to go out and attract people would so it's not necessarily to say oh it's because i'm grieving my husband necessarily it's also to protect herself from this matter like during hajj we're not allowed to propose so for her during this period morning doesn't mean you kill yourself these are the things you should avoid but is there any problem of my female cousins my sisters my brothers my mother visiting me in my house that is a widow of course giving me a good time chit-chatting and enjoying her now this is so completely permanent she lives her normal life yes now the burial in islam there's no coffins there's no complication all what you have to do is dig a grave and we have two types of graves what is the sunnah the sunnah is that you have but it depends on the soil itself what is the difference between a shock is something that you dig deep down and then you make another hole extra deep down and then you bury the person and then you seal that place and then you put inhale the soil another way you're saying that flat on the ground yes yes al-ahed is the recommended one which the prophet alaihim said that it is highly recommended to the extent that we only should have but this differs from one country to the other according to the soil and this is done by digging deep and then go like an l shape so it's like a drawer like a groove in the side yes on the side see in some soil this is possible in others it would collapse and not be possible once you put the body you put then mud or anything that would cover it this is better why because even people if they dig they will not find this or this side hole if you wish now how do we get the body inside if you read in you will read the terminology rus the head of the grave and the feet of the grave so you'll always find the people saying that he was admitted to the grave from the feet and people are confused so they think ah okay from the feet then we have to go feet down and this is not the right way of doing it the right way of doing it is head first of the deceased but they meant by the feet is the feet of the same grave so when you want to put a deceased head first from the place of the feet of the disease when he's lying in the grave and one other thing we forgot to mention if you go anywhere in the world all graves will be facing the qibla like prayer anywhere in the world so if the qibla is in this direction the grave should be like this it's dug like this the head of the deceased is here his feet is here he's on his side facing the qibla anywhere in the world and this shows you the unity of the muslims because they're not doing this for well i'd like to face you know the beach i always loved surfing so when i die make me face this is not too habibi you have to do this so all the graves are dug in this fashion and we get the deceased head first we place him on his side facing the qiblah we do not uncover his face as a lot of the muslims think in the grave you should uncover his face no but what we do is we loosen up the knots but we don't uncover the face we leave it as it is the top and the bottom yes just regarding facing the tibialla the muslim ureth they discussed the issue if a muslim is married to a non-muslim christian or a jewish and she died and he is pregnant so that soul is muslim so where should we bury her they said we bury her in the muslim graveyard because of what she had in her delhi now how to place her we make her back facing the qibla so the face of the child is facing the qibla because the child inside is facing his mother's back so her back is facing the qibla so the child inside is facing the qibla and we bear her and the muslim could have yet how smart the muslim scholars when they went into details you cannot imagine the level of it okay it does seem like we've come to the end of the episode unfortunately inshallah we'll leave the rest of the burial to next episode so now we're finishing here that we're putting the dirt shall in the next episode we'll go into a little bit more detail about the grave tombstone all of these matters many questions to come so may allah reward you all for joining us and contributing to the episode and may allah also reward you our dear viewers inshallah we hope to see you in our coming episodes until then i greet you all assalamu alaikum warahmatullahiah"
