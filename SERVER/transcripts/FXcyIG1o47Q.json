  "transcript": "a an anonymous person says I felt discharged while praying couldn't check then checked later and found wetness is my prayer valid answer's no if a person while in prayer believes that he discharged something that nullifies his woudl or passed wind if he's certain of this or almost certain he has to break his prayer if he's doubtful or he is frequently getting these feelings without any proof in this case no he should not leave the prayer unless he hears the sound or finds an odor as the Prophet said a sir regarding someone who doubts passing wind but if a person does emit something and after prayer he finds wetness this is a clear indication that his prayer was invalid so he has to clean himself meguro Andrey prayed again"
