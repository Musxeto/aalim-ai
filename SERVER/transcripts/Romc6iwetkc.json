  "title": "Sufis Barelvis say asking help from dead is not shirk cuz we go to teacher 1st then to the Principal",
  "transcript": "when we tell sufis and B that asking help from the dead is shik so they say that seeking help from a doctor is also sh and they give example of going to the teacher first and then to the principal in spite of showing them verses of Quran that seeking help from any other than Allah is sh how to counter that argument this is total ignorance and misleading people when I go to the doctor doctor or when I ask a scholar or when I go to an individual on the street asking him to direct me and and show me where the directions of a specific per uh place I want to go to can or can't they answer my request no brainer that they can the doctor can help me and uh prescribe medication The Scholar can give me a fatwa the person asking me or asking him to guide me would say go second right then you'll find your destination but when you ask the dead for protection or to Grant you help and benefit question can they deliver yes or no if they say yes this is sh takes them out of the fold of Islam because Allah says in [Music] Allah says who is it other than him that responds to a person in distress and reveals your calamities and makes you succeed one another is there another God beside him of course the answer is no so when they claim yeah then they're disbelievers and associating others with Allah so they're yeah misleading people with their analogy it's like saying to them and you give them the same answer and I hope they can find an answer to that so you say to them is fearing other than Allah an act of shik they said yes you can only fear Allah so okay good for you if a lion comes wanting to eat you would you hold your grounds or run the heck out of there of course you would run this fear is different than the fear of Allah and the Dua and asking people to do something that they can execute and help you in carrying a heavy box is different than asking Allah to relieve a Calamity or to save you from an earthquake or to Grant your wife a child and I hope this makes sense"
