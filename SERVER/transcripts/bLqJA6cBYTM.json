  "transcript": "uh the next question that we have is from sister samia uh every year i want to fast i start fasting in a few after a few days i get very unwell uh dehydrated serious pain and i have to stop fasting i have approximately missed 110 days of fasting like this though i uh give vidya i'm still worried as to what i should do i'm not sure if i can keep uh 110 days of fast i know sisters with 300 days of fast they've been married for like 14 15 years one year they're pregnant the other year they're suckling the third year they're pregnant the fourth year they're cycling and it goes on and yet alhamdulillah now after their uh assembly line is out of uh production they are making up every monday thursday three days of a month of white days and this approximately mounts up to approximately 90 days a year so in five years they're over with and done now your case this requires a physician a muslim doctor to comment on you if the doctor says yes this sister has serious chronic illnesses that prevents her from fasting and she will never ever recover from it then yes we tell you not to fast and to make up for the missed days by feeding a poor person per day but if the doctor say no she's well she there's nothing hazardous to her health and after doing the checks all what we came up with is that she's lazy she can fast but she's lazy she thinks that oh i'm dihydrating i am dizzy i'm sick but the doctor said everything is fine in this case she should fear allah azzawajal and she should uh do her fasts and make them up as soon as possible"
