  "title": "Is it sunnah to say Rabbana wa lakal hamd loudly behind the imam? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh so I had a question that the Masjid I went to here there was one man who after the Imam said samiyanka he in a loud voice in every Salah says and he says it's a longer version of it but loudly while all the people say it silent so I just wanted to know whether this is from the Sunnah or not well if this man is behind the Imam and the microphones are not working and he's raising his voice so that the people in the sixth or seventh row would be able to follow the Imam this is called table and this is permissible in large congregations nowadays with the microphones available when the Imam says excuse me what are you doing says I'm relaying the takbeer of the Imam there's no need there is a microphone and a speaker in every single corner everybody knows what the Imam is saying they can hear his Whispers even so this is not permissible unfortunately a lot of the people follow the Customs the Traditions they don't follow religion so don't associate with Islam with the religion except what's part of it now most likely this guy is an isolated case he's just someone who watches the Salat in Haram and he sees what the mother is doing and he likes it and he likes his voice so he raises his voice like that this is inappropriate if he's doing it purposely to make people listen to his voice and annoy people it invalidates his prayer if he's doing it without paying any attention sometimes when you're in record or in sujood the guy next to the guy next to you like three four guys down the road would say and what is this guy doing why is he raising his voice like this some people have OCD some people don't feel that they're doing this be unless they hear it this loud would it invalidate their prayer no their prayer is valid but they are not following the Sunnah and they should not be doing this this person this individual who raises his voice like this has to be um advised after the Salat we go to him hey brother Uncle son listen what you're doing is wrong imagine if each and every one of us raise his voice like that would not be appropriate did the companion ever do such a thing then inshallah he may come back to his senses"
