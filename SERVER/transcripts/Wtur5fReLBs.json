  "transcript": "oh I want to ask if jogging outside is all right or like for example if I jog in um um like a fitness studio where like little men are or like just some men are no this is not permissible at all for a woman to uh uh do yeah no matter how protective she is a woman when she's out shaan raises her so that W men would look at her and she would be a cause of fitna for them all imagine a woman running no matter how ample the clothes are her body curves body parts would shake and wiggle and jump around no matter what she's trying to conceal and and protect it's the FNA for anyone just to see a woman walking it's their imagination it's the illness in their hearts so no this is not permissible save a little bit buy a treadmill it takes only 1 M by 1 and A2 meter in your home and you can run your head off there inshallah"
