  "title": "How can Laylatul Qadr be on same night in India & Saudi (Odd & Even nights) #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh I have a question about we all know that is a single night and that night is better than thousand months and that comes at the end of the Ramadan but there is one day gap between India and Saudi Arabia if India Saudi Arabia has hardd nights India has even nights then how it is possible to get both country in a single odd night first of all is not necessarily in odd nights and this was proven by Islam because in some hadiths the prophet saidat said detect for one or three or five or seven or nine nine nights remaining and we don't know what's remaining until the month is over so this means that could be on odd number of nights 21 23 25 27 29 or it can be on even number of nights 20 22 24 26 28 30 depending whether the month is 29 days or 30 days so by this alhamdulillah we have no confusion number two don't worry about because Allah the almighty only knows it so if you're in India or in Saudi Arabia or in Canada as long as you're doing your level best in the last 10 nights I guarantee you 100% that you will attain without any doubt and Allah Knows Best"
