  "title": "Doctors advise against DNR due to her old age, what to do according to Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign my grandmother is old and her physical health isn't the best so whenever she goes to the hospital for anything doctors often ask my mom if she wants them to attempt to resuscitate her if her heart were to stop they advise against it because of how frail and old she is even if her heart were to start again she may have broken ribs and would most likely have to live intubated and rely on machines so my mum wants to know what should she do according to Islam should she ask them to always try to resuscitate her anyways well this is an Islamic and ethical question the concept of DNR do not resuscitate is often presented in Western hospitals and Cafe hospitals rarely done in Muslim hospitals due to the emotions and a number of other factors dealing with the Muslims as for the non-muslims they see usually the patient as I wouldn't say a guinea pig I wouldn't say that don't quote me but they don't have that affection doctors in some cases not all would look at the patient as he's got two months to live no we should focus on someone who has six months to live let that person go away we need the bed and this is unethical and unislamic how to deal with DNR Scholars say that if a patient is sane capable of living can be resuscitated and to live an honorable life in an acceptable level a level of dignity and honor for an individual then it has to be done even if it's going to cost money this is what most people think oh I see you how much would I have to pay if my grandfather or grandmother or my loved one would stay there for a month for five for ten for a year that would cost an arm and a leg hmm should I just pull the plug or not but if resuscitation would lead to losing the dignity and honor of that patient and giving him a lot of hardship more than what was expected in the sense that he cannot live without these machines and the life presented to him is not a real life we hear about a lot in the west calling for legalizing euthanasia or mercy killing as they may translate it to and this is not permissible in Islam but what made them go that step in many cases because the hardship and the pain and The Agony and the loss of dignity and an honorable way of living is unbearable neither to them nor to their loved ones in Islam if the patient is sane he can still live with his sane mind he can pray he can make thicker and there is some hardship but he's alive we can never pull off the plug we can never say do not resuscitate but if resuscitating him or her would cause into living on continuously um uh I don't know the terminology in English so excuse me things that make their lungs work their heart beats machines and continuous dialysis Etc and it's like living in a vegetative state not a real human being but he's alive the blood is running but this is not a an honorable dignified life in this case yes you may sign for a DNR uh State and the doctors hopefully Muslims can evaluate this level of um life to be given or to be taken away not because they're playing God rather because this is after weighing the pros and and cons and I think the Ministry of Health here in Saudi Arabia has issued a paper stating these conditions and what defines as a dignified honorable life and when to sign for a DNR and to apply it and Allah knows best may Allah make things easy for your grandmother um"
