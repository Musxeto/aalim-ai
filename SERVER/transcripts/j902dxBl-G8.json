  "transcript": "foreign I am suffering from Sudden sexual thoughts during Prayer Will these thoughts lead to secretion of Madi these thoughts are frequent and unintentional what can I do I would highly recommend that you book a counseling session because first of all we have to identify are these discharges actually related to methi and your sexual thoughts or its only Whispers of shaytan so many women confuse their normal vaginal discharges with methi so any random thought shaytan would say oh you discharge something you broken your wudu and you've broken your Salat when actually they did not so basically speaking if you're certain that this was discharged then you have to go break your prayer make Odo clean yourself make wudu and pray again if this is continuous and there is a great hardship because you are forced to continue to renew your wudu and wash yourself seven eight ten times without these thoughts stopping without you stopping emitting Medi in this case you become and you can continue to pray without breaking your prayer on Allah Knows Best"
