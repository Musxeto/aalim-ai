  "transcript": "I mean says can we learn the Quran from a person whose atrida is deviant this depends if you're learning the Quran to memorize it and to be good in touch with and the etiquettes of reciting it this is permissible and a lot of the scholars of the salaf took the Quran from people who were with deviant akidas because the Quran is the Quran you're not going to mess up with it but if this would involve tafsir in going to the verses of the sifat the attributes of Allah and the likes in this case we tell you to refrain you cannot learn the tafsir from person who is or who has a deviant or who does not have Akita to begin with someone who just listens to asharawi and takes notes and come to talk about it this is not property and you cannot learn your religion and archita from such people and Allah knows best finally"
