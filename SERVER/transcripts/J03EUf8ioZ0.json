  "transcript": "my question is uh that if somebody passes away and after the janaza um I see people uh touching the coffin and uh the she tells us to read three times my question is uh is this authentic okay so touching the coffin is definitely not from the Sunnah because putting a disease in the coffin is not from the Sunnah the issue of coffins which is a wooden box is not from Islam at all in Islam we are ordered to wash the deceased and to perfume him or her and then shroud them in three uh uh pieces of cloth or five if it's a woman and then take them as they are and place them in their grave no coffin no plastic bags nothing this is Islamic way of doing it putting him in a coffin this is a western concept so touching it this is definitely not from Islam and reading three times or or fa is definitely an innovation and whoever orders it is an innov and such an IM should be taught that this is not from the Sunnah and he should not make these Bas and tell people to do them if he doesn't have an authentic evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah backing it up and definitely he will not be able to back it up"
