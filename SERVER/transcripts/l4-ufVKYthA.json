  "title": "Does washing the face in wudu suffices for a Thin beard? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "second question is that he has a thin beard that he can see the traces of his skin so i hope the director shows my uh close-up yeah so this is thick you cannot see my fingers underneath but this area is thin so if your bead is as thin as this and you can see the skin so the water you wash your face with is sufficient you don't have to take another water like for my beard this is the sunnah again the prophet used to wash his face three times and then at the end fills up his hand and does this so that the inside is thoroughly any uh touched by water it's not soaked i'm not gonna get this and put it in a cup and and make it soaked in water no i'm not gonna cook it so it's just this but if your beard is thin and you can see the skin what you wash your face with does the job sufficiently insha allah"
