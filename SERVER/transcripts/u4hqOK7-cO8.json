  "transcript": "what is the best thing to do for a deceased especially dua prayer well she hit the nail on the head the best thing you can do for someone who had died is draw we tend to think that well maybe this is better best this is better no the Prophet said that Islam when an individual dies his deeds would be cut off with the exception of three things and he mentioned that Sadako tongs Aria which is a charity that's ongoing in reward Elmen affair you never will be beneficial piece of knowledge that people would benefit for off and a righteous offspring a righteous son or daughter who would supplicate who they'd make dua for him so this is by far one of the greatest deeds that a person could do to his parents now other than that you can ask Allah for forgiveness day and night and to have Allah to have his mercy upon them you can give charity so you have access money you feed people on behalf of your parents you slaughter sheep and you distribute the meat on behalf of your parents you build a Masjid you dig a well in the name of your parents all of this reaches the ma'sha'allah as well you can also perform Umrah or perform Hajj if you have already performed numbre and has on yourself for yourself then you can do this if you cannot go physically you can pay money to someone who would do that on your behalf and this is called hedge battle or umrah battle so all of this reaches the individual with the grace of allah azzawajal"
