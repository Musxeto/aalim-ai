  "transcript": "so shake my mother passed away uh two years ago and may allah make it easy for her in the grave and hereafter my question is what are the etiquettes i need to follow when i visit her grave so when i visit her grave should i stand next to her grave raise my hand and uh and uh pray make the dua aslam of alaikum and make uh darudi brahim on her suryapati on her and then proceed to make dua in my own local language to make it easy for her and forgive her sins and then is it permissible if i get emotional is it okay for me to maybe uh if i get emotionally trying to okay i will answer you because we're almost out of time the etiquettes of visiting a grave when you enter you say the dua salaam alaikum is [Music] when you make dua are we supposed to face the qibla it is not a requirement you can face the qibla and you can face the grave you're not making dua for the grave and when the prophet salaam said make dua for your brother and ask allah for forgiveness and make dua for him to be steadfast he did not allah say face the qibla so just making the do i would do should i praise allah azzawajal and offer salutation upon the prophet to make dua that's recommended should i recite the fatih totally prohibit it it's a an innovation if i get emotional and i cry there is no problem in that this is human nature we all feel sentimental and emotional when we remember our loved one and deceased one and allah knows best you"
