  "transcript": "one of the brothers asked yesterday about racism and especially here in the Gulf in the GCC countries and he was telling us they're asking me to comment about it first of all racism is not something isolated or it is not a characteristic of the Muslims nor the Arabs Islam is the least racist religion in the world you could have a black Abyssinian ruling the Muslims and they're ordered to obey Him as in the authentic hadith of the Prophet Harry salatu salam you must obey and adhere even even if a black Abyssinian slave takes power and his head is like a raisin so the Prophet is telling us there is no racism the Prophet tells us assume that there is no preference for an Arab over an an Arab or the opposite and for a black over a red or the opposite except via piety and righteousness a taqwa by fearing allah azza wajal and in the hadith of abu dharr that are mentioned accidentally in the first segment when he said to bilal you are a son of a black woman bilal should have said yeah my mom is from Abyssinia she's black and I'm proud of it he didn't say that because a Buddha did not say it as a compliment he said it as a form of insult so when bilal did not reply and went straight to the prophet arizim and complained the Prophet summoned Buddha and he told him you are a man of ignorance for what you had said and done now Abu Dharr was one of the earlier Muslims to accept Islam in the very beginning of Islam era so this was a shock to him because he Priya seniority and ranking wise he should be in the top but because of his actions and racist remarks the Prophet told him the Sun is awesome so Islam abhors and incriminates racism racism is a sign of arrogance the Prophet said that is awesome who ever has the weight of an ant of arrogance in his heart would not be admitted to Jinnah therefore is not something to be taken raise any softly or easily however this is not only in the GCC countries it's not only in Saudi Arabia or in the Gulf area it's everywhere even in America look what they say about the animals referring to immigrants accusing them of being rapists and drug dealers and the vast majority of these immigrants whether legal or illegal are doctors and engineers and having a good positive role in the society look at the white supremacists in Germany in Europe generally and what they're doing this is racists when you kill someone just because she's wearing a veil hi jab this is racist what are you talking about come to Saudi Arabia and look how real Muslims treat their brothers were there expats legal or illegal immigrants we treat them as ourselves come to our message do you think that the first straw is first class or business class in the Masjid only Saudis pray there there's nothing as such we're all mixed together sanding shoulder-to-shoulder loving our brothers ok there's always a black sheep in every family and again black sheep does not mean I'm racist this is how they say it don't be too sensitive color is just the color Allah created you black or created you white or created you yellow not as in a coward but whatever so don't put a lot of pressure on Islam or on Muslims or on the GCC countries just because there are some black seeds black sheep black apples rotten apples in the Box doesn't mean the whole box is rotten racism is totally unacceptable in Islam in any shape or any form and this is what islam teaches us and this is part of our values"
