  "transcript": "Yves no stomping perfect with no closet or having loads of a love a way of life of life away of life away of knife assalamo alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh all praise belongs to Allah and may his peace and blessings be upon His Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alehiwassallaam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are discussing funerals and death joining us discussing this topic we have our dear she off first of all share a similar Hakim from Saudi Arabia chef Muhammad a shitty from Canada and share Salim alimony from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us now we've began discussing death the inevitability of it the reality that it's something none of us can hide from and also that we have responsibilities before death we have the responsibility of being upon a man dying as Muslims we also have paying off debts we have many many things that we have to do to be prepared for this death now before we jump in a lot to the topic one of the things which unfortunately a lot of Muslims might tend to forget a little bit about is a will sometimes we might want to avoid a will because it's related to death we think I've still got time you know I'm young I don't need to prepare a will but we have sudden death sudden death is something that can strike at any moments which means really any person who is of age you know they're past puberty they're going to be held into account they have some wealth you know that they will be able to distribute after they die does a will become compulsory for them in this case an Alaska chef has him about to the world shmellow handle of sorts of sir my little sweeter a will is something that is highly recommended in Islam even armor may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it is not lawful for a man to spend three days without having his will next to him but what is meant by the will the will is something that you may want to give away that does not exceed one third of what you leave because in Islam it's unlike any other religion the distribution of the inheritance was done by Alonzo Gee not by any scholar or by knew you as a person I have no right in saying my son I'd like to deprive him from my will I'm going to give everything to the cat as they do or to the dog this is not a part of Islam Islam tells you this goes to the wife this goes to the Sun this goes to the father this goes to the mother this goes through the daughter and a will is something that usually declares the finances of an individual so if I gave Salim an amount of money as a alone and no one knows about it if I die this money would go so i have to say listen I gave shocks at him so and so brother Musa gave me so and so nobody knows about it because Musa would come and say I gave him a hundred thousand but I don't have any proof people who are inheriting they will say well sorry if you don't have any proof any one could claim likewise so it is recommended that you have this to free yourself from accountability and to give all those who have rights their own rights whether it is a sudden death or a death that was prepared for and by the way with the issue of sudden death it is a sign of that ending it is a sign of bad ending only to those who are sinners the Prophet says re salatu salam sudden death is the taking of someone who's angry that is a larger so if a person is sinful and he dies while surfing the pornography websites or watching a movie or putting the headsets and listening to music and it comes he's deprived from saying la illaha illallah which if he did would entitle him to go to Jenna he's deprived from returning rights to their lawful owners while the person on his dying bed who's been sick for a couple of weeks or a couple of months a couple of years he has all the time to say give the money back to this person forgive me my brother I said something a bad about you so when death comes to him hamdillah he's clear I wanted to add something about the like the sudden death there's a brother he had cancer he had a big operation that he needed to do and some people gathered together to do like a mini fundraiser for this brother and they asked me to speak and then I said and I thought about the situation I said there's no doubt this brothers being tested right I said but we're all being tested and it's not him that's gonna die only we're all gonna die however we've all gathered to focus on his death yet some of us may die even before he dies so Connell right so this thing about sudden death what's scary about it is the person is not prepared for it when somebody and this is a blessings upon Allah when somebody's diagnosed with cancer and everybody feel sad if you step back and you look at the big picture it's almost like they've been given the chance to repent to allah subhana Dada before they die they've been given some time no doubt it's a very painful situation to go through but there's a blessing in it as well that the person is given that chance to repent to Allah spa no Dada and slow and you know chefs adam said that their deeds are increase in allah forgives their sins before they die so pendulum now that you mentioned this there's a very very good friend of mine and he actually went through cancer twice the first time he went through cancer he was very young he wasn't so practicing but this was a wake-up call to him he became practicing in hamdullah one of the best people you could ever meet subhan allah may allah bless him and protect him mm and then again a second time he was afflicted with cancer and it got to the point where doctors were telling him to come in every day test after test everything's going downhill and naturally people are going to visit him and it almost got to the point where we were going as if to give him the farewell because this is what the test seemed to be saying and this brother may allah reward him i mean you can't understand all i don't understand but he said you know going through this drove him crazy you're a man is played with you know it's a very big test but even then people would go to visit him as if to farewell him and he would say to them do not think for a moment's you're going to pray my janaza i am going to be praying your janaza hello and this brother Subhan Allah day after day as I said things were getting worse until one day the doctors they called him in and they had told him by this time you have two weeks to go they've called him in and they said yeah we'll do our test they did the test and they said please we need to do another they did please one more so he thought so panel of this must be it until the end of the day came very very long day test after test after test and they said we don't know what exactly has happened but it's all done you're free the cancer is completely gone mushroom and he's alive until now and brothers have died and he's prayed there janaza who would have ever thought that this could have happened so you see not only did was a second reminder for him and a purification but it was a reminder for us or panel on that you can never be sure nobody could ever be sure when it's going to come now that I mentioned is I have to mention I have to mention this ad ehf of else who passed away may allah have mercy upon him and he had lung cancer i'd never smoked a cigarette in his life but he had lung cancer and we went to visit him as well to you know consoled him as and we know it sooner to go visit the sick and he was very very close to death until Subhan Allah he had all of his family there amongst you know with him that day until he said to one of his sons he said please help me to make such done and he couldn't make sajda because of his condition so all he could do was raise his finger and say la illaha illallah muhammadur rasulullah and at that moment allaha subhan allah ta'ala took a soul and i remember going to the funeral and wondering what do I say to my friends to console him to you know say some kind words but he was smiling so panel law he was smiling and he said a lot of my father sold while he was saying la illaha illallah he was so happy that his father was able to go in this state subhanAllah me have a fun evening Marshall but now that we've said this I asked shacks on him they also reminded me I were here most of amake that's Harry was teaching us with all the classes that he was giving on death from the jenna is dell then then he fell sick we visited him and he became very thin I remember that one of our brothers asked him how do you feel Shh what does this your situation is a our week he said there you go Pablo ahi woody him in Asia this is a blessing from Allah this is the bounty from Allah so Allah He bestows it for whom he see this how he sees what a lot of Hana wa'ta'ala and the sickness and this and this contentment river to have this river with your Lords of Han and wattala that only Allah because out of love is doing this to you out of love not be is torturing you remember Billy Josie rahamallah he mentioned maybe after the break hey the sellable gots a very short break and I will continue with this very good topic mail or dual dear viewers do stay tuned inshallah we'll be back after a very short moment assalamo alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome back dear viewers were here with our dear show discussing the topic of funerals and death now just before the break asylum you are mentioning the saying of Chef hymnal tells your whole life yes if me go cemented in his books he said there were many people we used to see them in the first one de Mesilla to find them in the first run Demasi it and one would envy them Masha Allah then Allah spot Allah tested them he said one of them he felt sick and we heard him saying why are you punishing me welcome to Allah why are you torturing me this is when you worship Allah upon ignorance you have no le see our chefs use they say this is bounty blessing this is a punishment this is the ignorance when you worship Allah without knowledge he said another one he had one child and a lot took that child he said my neighbor has many children and you took mine the only one Sahara so this river about the loss of Hannah Darla this contentment that we are in L in lehi when they lay he all right your own what does it mean we are alarms a las he owns US and unto Him will be the return we are his he takes us anytime see the true Mina a mousseline when she lost her son she told her husband what do you think my dear husband because first of all after he came from the player he didn't tell him that his son passed away she gave him the food and after the food she prepared herself for him and after that he told him what do you think if our neighbors lent us your Tercel then they asked to have that you turn cell back said we have to give it back said the one who gave us that our child took it Allah gave it to us and he took it when he informed the prophets allah salam in the morning the prof salah salem said did you sleep with each other he said yes he prayed for them and she conceived from that very night Allah took one and give them another one so this is the river so when you fall sick during before you die just any sickness the Sahaba the used to rejoice when one gets the fever because they know this is a way of cleansing and watching away the sins there was a certain at a point to that in the topic of a child dying and the question that comes to you know parents mind mother's mind is why did Allah take my child and if you look through the Quran and Sunnah there's no answer to that question the verses and the ayat it will talk about the reward of the person whose patient right doesn't open a discussion with the human being and really I thought to myself what kind of answer would be like the mother would agree with that kind of answer nobody'll agree but just like chefs adam said it's about riddla it's about acceptance so if it's not a discussion between the servant of Allah and Allah spa Nevada is that if this happened then the person accepts what the situation is and turns it for the better makes it the merciful I'd like here to have something that the glad tidings actually for when you lose a child when Allah takes the life of a child who hasn't reached the age of puberty these children are called a fraud the flop and they are intercessors they are in the Jannah waiting for you among the intercessors on the develop direction are those children they may like at the angels they tell them go inside go inside they are at the gate of the Jenna they say no we will not go inside until you bring our parents subhanAllah the father of the mothers in the Hellfire so Allah tells them bring the mother bring the father so this child is there waiting for you that's why we Muslims hamdulillah ala na mattila salon will lie this is the blessing of SLAM brothers and sisters the way life to us we move from one phase to another phase that's it we are not afraid because we are in this life then we move to another form of life which will call it butterfly transitional life then from that phase we go to the other phase water meter los on earth Allah and they always tell my brothers and sisters you see the way we have to look to it that we are sitting in the lounge in the airport waiting for our flights in queue so we are chatting then ok chef and hammered this is my flight ok if they will catch you in the next one that's it so flight one before the other one will arrive before the other and the real home is the Jannah that is our real home we should always think about it and work for it the moment and the authentic hadith the soul arrives there the moment the soul arrives to his in the jannah and is taken and put in the shower all those believers who preceded you your friends are waiting the moment you had obviously haha tell me tell me and they ask you about the news of the people behind and they ask you about someone they know and he died before you but he didn't make it to the young you tell them didn't he come oh the hava lr me how he didn't make it did it make it that's why a Muslim he knows this is why the non-muslims are afraid of death and they don't want you to mention it because they are in the dark they don't know what awaits them they don't know this but the Muslim if you think is clear alhamdulillah he knows from this to this to that thanks o'connell we know and is just reminding me the reality is that our Father Adam alehissalaam he was from Jenna yes from paradise so therefore we can almost consider ourselves we're all immigrants away from our homeland waiting to return and we know the Prophet peace be upon him said be in this world like a travelogue passing on his way stopping for a moment and then passing on so this in essence is a reminder don't get too attached to this world because it's only a short time until we go to eternity until we return to Allah who Subhan Allah Ta'ala and these going them if the theme of what we were discussing about having our whole life as a preparation for this sometimes we might get caught up in the Danielle sometimes we might think or we might fool ourselves and not think of death so we think that this world is going to be our eternity that there's nothing else but when we have that right perspective may Allah reward you for reminding us we're going to truly see that it's just part of our journey what shocks adam said about its share from safa macd may allah have mercy on his soul reminds us of the balance in Slim's life so we have the fear of Allah and we have the hope as well and the Prophet said this is awesome beautifully and eloquently do not die except thinking good about your Lord but the Prophet is telling us awesome at the time of dying you should not be in despair however scholars say at the time of living you should be afraid because if I am wishful and hopeful on the negative part rather than being fearful of a larger gel I'd be encouraged to do sin I have the money I have the health and wealth I have everything that facilitates this for me if I don't have the fear at the back of my mind I would find it difficult to resist the temptation while I'm alive when I'm dying while I'm in my dying bed it should be the opposite I should not be fearful that Allah give me a bad ending on the contrary I should think positive of a large yet because this is a time where I'm hopeful and wishful for Allah's mercy the prophet alayhi salatu salam visited one of those unsolder was on his dying bed and he asked him how do you feel the man is dying so that young man said o prophet of allah i am afraid of my sins but I'm wishful in Allah's mercy look at the balance which a lot of the Muslims don't have when they're alive or when their undying bed the Prophet gave him the glad tidings adding in salotto son by saying by Allah these two fading your sins and wishing for Allah's mercy do not come or join at this station or this position you're in except allah azzawajal would give you what you wish and will protect you from what you feel in Medina I was once praying it was in last days of Ramadan today via with Allah he was he was making daughter to a las panna cotta he said this dry and even in Seoul I was thinking what an amazing and the dot is saying what it means is that oh Allah fire good deeds are not good enough to reach you then your mercy is good enough to reach us because it's a two-way direction so the person has their sins but they know a las panted Allah's mercy can reach them now when we're looking at death as we mentioned some of us might be that we have time to repent we have time to prepare I'd like to take a look just a little bit at the best of examples about our prophet may Allah speeds and blessings be upon him he fell into a sickness and he did have some time what are some of the you know the tips because we all want a good ends we want to be prepared as best as we can from the death of our beloved prophet peace be upon him what are some of the lessons that we take because we know his death you know went through stages until it got worse and each time he reacted in certain ways so I might go to you sure how's him because I love to hear from you some lessons from the how the Prophet peace be upon him faced this trial of death the Prophet Alistair Sam felt sick for about two weeks and some scholars say that the Prophet himself said that I'm finding the pains coming back to me from the poison sheep I took a bite off so it used to come back to the Prophet as amused to fall sick for a number of days each year at the time of his death sol La Jolla me felt sick for about coupla weeks and it was difficult for him and while he was on his dying bed he had a pot with water and he used to dip his hand into it and wash his face and says in neural moti sakurada that verily death has its not intoxications but it has the drowsiness of death that the feeling of death coming associating with it hi she may Allah be pleased with her vision and viewed that is the pain that the prophet ism was going through and she said after seeing this happening to the prophet of allah so jeal by Allah this is a good sign therefore I would not wish that any of my loved ones would not go through this see we have a issue is that when we think that a sudden death is a good death oh it's painless and such illness in sickness and paint is a bad sign it's the opposite as chefs adam said this it Aizaz and eradicate saul remaining sin so when you actually die you have no sense to be held accountable for its all gone it's all forgiven so this is any one of the things that's the panel we have come to the end of the episode inshallah we can continue on this point in our coming episode may Allah reward you all for joining us in contributing so we hope to see you in our future episodes and also to our dear viewers may Allah reward you for joining us inshallah we hope to see you in our coming episodes until then I greet you all send our mighty compartmental like you or better cancel we are late
