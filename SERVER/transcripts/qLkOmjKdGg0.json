  "transcript": "says that I've never met my biological father or mother and I do not know my father's name. I was adopted at birth and given my adopted father's name but he abandoned me. I reverted to Islam and changed my name. Is this permissible to do? I have or I have to uh uh keep the name of my adopted father or take the name of my mother which I have just found out or can I take my husband's name as I have just got married. This question is a bit complicated. First of all, generally speaking, a person must not be called except after his father and his forefathers. So what many Muslim women do due to their imitation of the disbelievers or of the non-Muslim countries and traditions when they get married, they change their name to their husband's name. This is totally prohibited and it has to be changed and it's awkward when people call for uh uh feminism and when they call for the rights of women yet they themselves are the first to change their god-given names to their husband's names. In Islam, we don't have this. A woman keeps and uh uh uh is called after her father and her grandfather and her family name never to be changed into anybody's names. This is the basics. Now if a woman was born out of wedlock, so her father did not marry her mother, she is not to be called after her biological father because there was no legitimate marriage. She would be called either after her mother's family because this is the trend that the mother the the child that was born out of wedlock is not to be called after the biological father but rather by the mother's uh uh family or in an an incident where a child does not know the father nor the mother in this case he would be or she would be given a name that is general. So the first name we have no problem with whatever your first name is this is okay. Now the second and family name it should be general. So each and every slave of Allah is Abdullah. So if her name is Katherine then her name would be Katherine the daughter of Abdullah. Katherine Abdullah. If she w uh took a Muslim name, her name would be let's let's assume Zanab bint Abdullah daughter of Abdullah or Abd Rahman because this fits all uh humans Muslims and non-Muslims they are all slaves of Allah they are all slaves of Alman in your case if your mother whom you had discovered recently acknowledges that she had a marriage contract with your biological father, you have to be called after him. If not, then you may be called after a general name like mentioned, Abdullah, etc., but not after your husband. And I hope this inshallah answers your"
