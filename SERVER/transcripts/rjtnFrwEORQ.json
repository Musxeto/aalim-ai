  "transcript": "Lala from Saudi Arabia she says that we know that the deeds as in the hadith are displayed to allah azza wajal every Thursday and this is what he used to fast it well I'll add an extra edge to it the Prophet arizo sallam said that Mondays and Thursdays the deeds are displayed to allah azza wajal for approval and this is why he loves to fast them and he recommended us to fast them so yes fasting Mondays and Thursdays is part of the Sunda because the deeds are displayed to Allah so gel every Monday and Thursday and Monday has an extra edge that the Prophet was born on that day as well"
