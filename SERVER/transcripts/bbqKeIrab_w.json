  "transcript": "foreign is approximately like three centimeters long is that about is my arm still covered I don't know what you have to do is cover your wrist and whatever is under uh up your wrist so if you expose this area no your thought is not valid this is your wrist this is what you cover whatever is above that has to be covered so I hope this answers your question and you must be careful not to go into OCD so it's not an issue of millimeters and centimeters and bringing an auditing company to check whether your prayer is valid or not be normal and try your level best to cover your hands without even an elastic band just try to wear your sleeves up to your wrist if something exposed and you see it you simply pull it down and that does the job insha Allah we are"
