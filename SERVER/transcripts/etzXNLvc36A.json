  "title": "Is watching football haram?",
  "transcript": "uh she is watching football permissible I'm not an addict uh but I watch it occasionally and I love you for the sake of Allah and may Allah love you as you love me in the sake of Allah uh watching football we went through this question before and we said that if you recall of course I'm talking about watching football meaning gents watching uh uh uh Men playing football not the other way around so it's definitely not permissible for women to watch Men playing football due to their uh uh outfit and it's definitely not allow for men to watch women playing anything at all whether football or volleyball or anything now for men watching Men playing football it's an issue of dispute because the scholars disputed on the uh area of the thighs is it considered to be to look at or not and there are different hadiths supporting those who say it's not and there are hadiths stating and clearly saying that you should not look at it and you should cover it because it's so it's an issue issue of dispute and I personally uh believe that because of this dispute we cannot say clearly it is forbidden to watch now I'm talking about watching the itself the hadiths of the Prophet state that you should cover it and you should not not look at it however there are hadiths that he himself would sometimes uh uh sit with his companions and show parts of his his thigh as in theith of I think where he was sitting uh at a well and next to him was Abu Bakr then Omar then then when Ali came wasallam he covers his thigh and when they told him why didn't did you do this while you did not do it with Abu Bakr and om he said wouldn't I be bashful from a man who the angels are Bashful from so uh uh they say that well if the prophet did this then this indicates that it is permissible others say no this is something that is special to him while his own rhetoric goes against it so we have to follow his rhetoric not his actions when there is a contradiction between them so both ways it's an issue of dispute um if we hypothetically claim that it's okay to watch men wearing shorts now um what would you watch if you as you claim uh not to be an addict to watching it so you are not hooked on watching football and following uh the modus League or uh uh whatever uh leagues they have in Brazil or in Italy or in whatever if you're not addicted to that in this case it is occasionally okay to watch A Match here and there but what we see from people they start easy and then they become serious and they devote a lot of time and what would a person gain from watching a football match I'd rather you go put on your shoes your trainers and play football yourself you burn calories you lose some weight you get more stamina and you enjoy yourself rather than sitting for an hour and a half or how long I don't know it takes just watching 20 uh people running behind a leather ball full of hot air buy a ball for each one of them and get it over with instead of them fighting over one single ball so I believe that this is time consuming and it's not worthy of uh a Muslim to waste his time especially if he's watching non uh uh Muslims disbelievers playing and we in Saudi Arabia people are so hooked on football that you may sometimes hear men shouting at a a Christian may Allah Grant your religion Victory this is an an Arabic word that we say to a person when we approve of what he's doing we say may Allah Grant Victory to your religion so you may hear people when uh uh ronaldino for example scores a goal he would say this to him and this is if you contemplate this is a word of kufur but people say it because they are not paying any attention nobody wants the Christian or the Jew or the non-muslims that Allah would give them or grant them victory at all knowing that they are false religions and Allah Knows Best"
