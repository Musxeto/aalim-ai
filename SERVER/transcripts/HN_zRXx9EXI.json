  "title": "Is there any enmity between Suni and Shia?",
  "transcript": "of Shia and Sunnah and the enmity and hatred between them we have no enmity or hatred against the Shia if you look at us sunnis you never see a Sunni condemning or slandering or cursing any of the imams or of the sahabas or of the uh righteous predecessors it is the Shia who talk evily and in in in in bad mounting and saying off things about Abu Bakr about Omar about about mother about all the companions of the Prophet except five or six or seven of them and the rest are all kufar and they curse our religion they curse our imams they curse everyone on uh uh the grid they have no problem in that so we have no enmity we peaceful people it is them who have hatred it is them who whose religion is based on Revenge we have to avenge Al Hussein for his Massacre and his martydom I wasn't there you go Revenge go and avenge him if you wish but don't blame the Muslims the sunnis and they're a minority they're even negligible in their number or in their impact or in their benefit to humanity as well so as sunnis we have no problem with them they have the problem with us but at the same time we cannot in a sense say that we may coexist while they are slandering our parents and and and and righteous predecessors they're slandering and talking bad about our Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam this is unacceptable saying that they kufar this is a big mistake and we always say this and reiterate this it's all in our literature and websit and Shia are not alike we cannot say that sh aref Aban wrong regardless of who says this among them there are there are cfer definitely those who say that the Quran is distorted and the Quran of fa is the original one and the one that we have is this is a definitely 100% cfir you don't even have to think twice those who curse Abu Bakr Omar and say that they're cfir they themselves are cfir or slunder mother AA like this Infidel in uh uh London who talks ill about mother a and Slanders her he's a cfir you don't even pay attention to him but the majority of majority of the the Shia who are lay men who don't know what the mulas or these turban headed like uh Scholars of theirs say who who believe in five prayers who believe in uh the final prophet and messenger of Allah Muhammad Sall wasallam and who fast Ramadan and who eat our slaughtering they are Muslims like us but they may have few things that make them bad Sinners but they're still Muslim so to generalize and say sh are CF this is uh a very wrong thing to say"
