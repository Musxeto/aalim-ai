  "title": "How to deal with kafir schools that teach h*mos*xuality, Kufr & Shirk? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in school they in in CER schools um they often teach fi okay like homosexuality so on and math and and useful stuff now the thing is if they talk about very bad things like like kuf sh so um for example they talk about Romans and what they what they believed in and they had for example they say they had to so they they talk about such things can I participate can talk so long as so long as I only say what's in it of in of itself correct like uh they talk about Romans okay then I say they made this war because they wanted gold from the Persians and then know okay the teacher will definitely say and they believe uh the gods commanded them to to do this like if you talk about homosexuality and and I say um I don't think being black makes you a bad person I know I will directly cause the teacher to brainwash students and and in in class there are Muslims and so-called non-practicing Muslims and the letter one may be influenced hope it's clear no it's not clear but it's obviously clear to me that there is a problem and the problem lies in the process uh uh thinking the thinking process how you process things like this if you are in a cafir country and you are obliged to study in their schools and you know that a very important Concept in Islam is to weigh the consequences of whatever you're going to say so if the consequences are negative and the disadvantages outweigh you stop and if the advantages outweighs then you should proceed through this thought process you can evaluate weight things so if you know if you commented that your comment would result in negative uh comments actions maybe something that is bad maybe extending the kufur to other venues in this case you have to refrain and you have to study and answer in your exams according to the curriculum and the syllabus you're not obliged to go and say no this is wrong it's islamically this is the right thing to do they will give you a zero what's the point so you have to understand and weigh the pros and cons of your actions and of what you are going to say you don't have to be a superhero in every incident someone said something bad you have to stop them and be the religious police and tell them this is wrong and start a debate this is not logical you are in a cafir country and studying in a cafir school you have have to be diplomatic you have to be wise otherwise do homeschooling and relieve yourself from all this trouble and Allah Knows Best"
