  "title": "Hajj agency takes us sight seeing in Makkah, Madinah Is it permissible or part of hajj Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Ravi from South Korea when we go to Saudi Arabia for example we go through a agency so while staying in Mecca the agency sometimes take us to for example places other than Haram such as a cave of Hera and House of Abu jahil and also in case of Madina agency take us to other places such as Mercedes and maybe place where the kandak war happened and such places so my question is I mean when I am in Makkah or when I am in Madina I am there for a purpose so can I visit other places like this are okay or not okay first of all these sightseeings are not part of Islam or Hajj or your visit to Medina it's like going to have a buffet breakfast if I don't want to have a buffet breakfast and I go and eat a sandwich outside or I have a continental breakfast in my room is it related to hatch no so this is up to your preference sightseeing is permissible it is not prohibited but you have to identify whether such sites are legitimate or not so for example in Medina they have a tour of the seven masjids and they tell you this is Masjid number one this is this this is that this is this and this is mainly baseless there's nothing nothing to see there there's nothing sacred in visiting these messages only Masjid Koba and the Haram of Medina are the ones that you will be rewarded for the other sites whether you go to a better whether you go to the mount mount ocean these are sightseeings there's nothing related to your Hajj or to your reward it's beneficial it's educational it's fun entertainment there's nothing wrong in that go into the house of Abu jahl I don't know anything of of that sort I've this is I live an hour away from Mecca and this is the first time I hear something like that I don't think there is any tour to a The House of the enemy of Allah who in his right mind would go to this yes I remember when I went to uh Johannesburg they took us to visit uh Nelson Mandela's house and they showed us where he lived where he grew his old shoes it's yeah okay it's sightseeing it's a museum but nobody goes to Adolf Hitler's house the enemy of humanity and say oh wow what's a nice place to live this is insane let alone go to abujah this is totally unheard of so I think maybe it's a mistake yeah they may take you to the house of Khadijah and tell you that this is where the Prophet Islam though I doubt whether this is historically correct or not and there is no benefit of it going to our Hera there is no benefit of it and none of the companions used to do this and say oh yes I remember the prophet 10 years ago used to go here before the Revelation was sent this is where the Revelation was sent for the first time so we will go and take a tour there none of them did this so religiously it's not part of Islam part of entertainment and and just for the fun of it yeah but you have to be careful is it legitimate is it authentic a brother sent me an um an email a question uh today subhanallah on my website saying that he visited the house of the Prophet Islam during the Hajj in Mecca where they showed him the nails and the hair of the Prophet which was still growing give me a break is this Islam hair and nail growing had any body of the companions ever heard of this and they started doing haircut every month for the hair so that it would not grow to Eternity this is nonsense they said okay but there's a similar lyrics uh relics in in Top Copy in in Istanbul or here all of these are lies and to say that this is found in Mecca this is a blatant lion whoever said this was pulling your legs and getting your money and he made a profit definitely but he's a liar"
