  "title": "Posting different duas for each day of Ramadan - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "hashing says there has been tendency of people to post different doors for each day for Roma Bahn is this realistic for 29 or 30 days different draws each day this can be answered in one of two if you mean that these people say that dua for day day number 10 is specifically this door you have to say this you cannot say dua number 9 on the tenth day or the eleventh day on the tenth day and they prescribe a particular door for each and every day of Ramadan this is total innovation there is no such thing as a door and for a day of Ramadan but I don't think and I don't believe anyone would do this what they might be doing and you are misunderstanding it is that every day they post an ayah for people to the site and to ponder a pound or to recite a door which is a beautiful DRAM not related to today which is the fourteenth of Ramadan any to any random door I would do so they do this out of seeking the reward that we've shared a door something that is beneficial that people may use and say and this is permissible and there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah"
