  "transcript": "I like the way you said okay anyways my question is uh you've said some days before other in your new videos that it is a rule that everything is halal to it unless proven otherwise so what is the way uh is there any habit or any rule which governs this rule I would like to ask that I would uh please clear my digital I didn't I didn't understand your questions what is halal until proven otherwise ah everything so is there any Hadith which governs this rule the ruling is stemmed from the general rulings of the Quran and of the Sunnah that Allah azzawajal has given us everything that is halal from him as mentioned and the prophet said the whole of Earth was made for me a place of worship and a form of abolition of purity so this indicates that everything around us is pure what's the ruling on this pen what's the ruling on this pad what's ruining on this mug everything is pure until proven otherwise otherwise we would be living in doubt we would not be living because every time I come and say what if one of my grandchildren touched my head scarf with impure hands what if a cat urinated on my shoes and I could not smell it or find any traces of it what if what if what if and this is not life and Islam came with General um tendencies Scholars stemmed it from the verses of the Quran and they sent it from the authentic hadiths of the prophetu wasallam and this is why we say everything is halal so is this apple Halal or not oh yeah it looks Halal the default is highlight how do you know maybe it was irrigated with sewer water all year round he said probably but tastes good smells good it's halal so I would not allow doubts to cast any ambiguity on everything around me just because Satan is whispering in my head and I hope this answers your question"
