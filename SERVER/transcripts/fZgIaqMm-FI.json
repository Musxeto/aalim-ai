  "title": "A brother believes whoever misses one prayer is a kafir, should he divorce his wife? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh yeah this is a brother who says that he follows the opinion of four of these the the companions that is he mentioned i think allah and he says he follows that opinion which states that whoever misses one salat is a kafir and this is the opinion of ibm and he says his wife skips prayers every now and then so should he stay with her if you follow an opinion don't go follow a do fatwa shopping now you said that these four companions stated that who misses one salat is a kafir and this is not the most authentic opinion however let's assume it is do you have proof that they had said it because nowadays everybody coat everybody coach whoever he wishes someone comes said oh napoleon pono part said so and so and so prove it show me the chain of narrators show me documentation just because one scholar who died 300 years ago claimed that these companions 1100 years ago said such and such without bringing the chain of narrators the senate the book the reference those who heard it from them does not make it authentic and this is similar to one of the brothers who asked and said that imam ahmed said whoever says allah has a body unlike other bodies he's a kafir where did muhammad say this oh i don't know i heard someone say that he heard someone who heard it from a friend so subhanallah it's training men now how how is this possible how do you come and claim that said without verification without proving that this is from the book so and so uh um with a correct chain of narrators to imam ahmed this is unacceptable point two when you assume something who among the scholars you know personally that said this there is a quote that imam said that whoever abandons one prayer is a kafir according to some scholars this is not the opinion of imam ibn baz may allah have mercy on him but when you cherry pick when you just randomly check for fatwas and you collect what you like this is not proper way of doing it thirdly if you have the conviction and you are following that opinion why you ask me one plus one equals two if you believe that a person who misses one salat is a kafir then your wife is a kafir according to your analysis and hence you cannot be with her and the children that you bring from her are born out of wedlock and you cannot inherit her you have to divert immediately why disturb the things that need to be kept as they are why do you dig old graves and open old files when you know that the scholars say as long as a person prays on and off he's still a muslim no no no no i'm convinced of the extreme opinion okay that's your choice go ahead with it why ask me if you want my opinion i told you my opinion those who pray on and off they're still labeled as muslims until proven otherwise you guys want to jump the gun you want to prove them kafir until proven otherwise and this is the methodology of the khawarij"
