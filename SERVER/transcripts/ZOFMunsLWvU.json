  "transcript": "uh aziz are from the uk i wanna ask you something um if i pray uh married and then after married is not isha yet and then i went to the hospital for images and then i was there for a long time until five years time and i didn't have a time to pray in that because i was i was in there really imagines with my son in the hospital and then the fajr came i came back home and prayed fajr what about to that salah i've missed the isha salah how do i how do i do the qatar i i will answer inshallah so aziza from the uk says that if someone delays a prayer until the time is out what is the ruling on that well the prophet allah answered us with a hadith and this is the best answer any mufti can give you because he gives you the hadith or the verse of the quran and this is what you should hold on to clench to abide by as a muslim not go what does imam so-and-so say what does sheikh so and so say what do you say sheikh no the best thing is to go always back the quran to the sunnah this is the way of the salaf if you listen to sheikh bimbas lectures for example very concise very short but very straight to the point not like those who speak for a whole hour and a half and at the end of the lecture is a good uh big loaf of bread but where's the beef so to answer your question the very question the prophet said alayhi salatu sallam he who oversleeps or forgets a prayer must pray it as soon soon as he remembers it there is no expiation for the for it other than that two reasons forgetfulness and oversleep and both as we know a person is not accounted for he's not accountable for allah would not punish you if you oversleep because the pen has been uplifted allah would not hold you accountable and if you forget the last ayah of surah al-baqarah do not burden us if we forget allah would not burden you would not hold you accountable yet the prophet said that you must pray it as soon as you remember because there is no expiation i didn't do a sin to expiate scholars looked into this hadith and said aha so if a person deliberately abandons salat until the time is over there is no expiation he cannot make it up and nothing he could do to overcome this but how was an emergency well were you able to pray meaning even in the case of an emergency even if you were bedridden even if you were sick even if you were in pain you still can pray as in the hadith of hassan may be pleased with him the prophet said to me pray standing up this is a pillar if you can't pray sitting down if you can't pray lying on your side so all of this means that do not leave prayer at all because it is time bound in so you should have prayed your son is being treated by the doctor you're not the one treating him you're not putting bandages or measuring his temperature you're just afraid and scared you should have prayed now what is god is gone may allah forgive you and grant your son the best of health and make him healthy and strong and one of the imams of islam and of the muslim but next time never ever allow the time to exceed its limit and isha's limit is the middle of the night the islamic middle of the night midnight which is between sunset and the break of dawn divide them into two add it to the time of sunset you get the islamic midnight and allah azza knows best"
