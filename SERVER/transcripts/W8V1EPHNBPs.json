  "transcript": "from macedonia he says that nowadays we have a number of official daw organizations and they are fighting among one another and he says that some of them are known to be salafies and they are giving innovation to every part to every entity to every person who doesn't follow them i cannot judge unless i am on the ground looking at these organizations speaking to the scholars and the students of knowledge and identifying whether they are doing innovation or not most probably they can be especially those in macedonia who originated from the old guard so they're following albania or they're following turkey and they're following the same old teachings of the hanafi books that they don't know the quran they don't know the sunnah they don't know the tafsir all what they know is their traditional hanafi books even abdeen says etc says this is all what they know but they don't relate to quran sunnah so there are many many wrong practices so those who accuse them of doing innovation might be right also those who are accusing others of innovation might be extremist so if you don't follow my way then it's the highway anyone who does not believe in my three or four reputable etc then they're people of innovation and they try to make it like a mafia only those who follow us can lead prayers and can run masjid etc and everybody else is out of the fold of islam now these are extremists i cannot judge from a phone call or from an email and start to say yeah brush them off they're innovators and these are extremists no we have to look and be fair and judge people and try to reconcile between the different parties because this is what shaytan wants but at the end of the day if there is innovation if there is grave worshipping if there is a lot of shirk being involved we cannot turn a blind eye and not say that this is haram and shirk it would get the people out of the fall of islam we have to speak but speaking has to be done with wisdom it has to be done with knowledge it has to be done with weighing the pros and cons and the consequences that would follow allah knows best he has seen you have seen from a few"
