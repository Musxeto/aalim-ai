  "transcript": "how should we spend the last 10 nights of ramadan well the prophet alayhi salat wa salam had a major thing to do during the last 10 nights of ramadan and that is to pray all night long so whenever the 10 nights we do the prophetess turn would tighten his apron or waist wrapper and some say that this is a metaphor for not having intimacy with the wives and some say that this is a metaphor for doing a lot of effort and striving and doing what you want to do to the most at most level so he used to do that he used to wake up his women his wives and he used to revive his night meaning that he would make the night alive with prayers reciting the Quran and long long raucous so this is the vast majority of what a person has to do in the last 10 nights of ramadan most of us won't be able to do even half of that so you do whatever you can to the best of your ability engage in making duaa because mother aisha came to the Prophet I think his salat or sermon said o prophet of Allah teach me something to say if I were to notice lailatul cuddle so the Prophet said to her say allahumma in the car fall into Hebrew life of our honey Oh Allah you are forgiven and you love to pardon so pardon me so if you do this a bit this a bit recite the Quran a little bit do vicar a little bit so that the whole night is engaged in good deeds that would be excellent thing for you to do"
