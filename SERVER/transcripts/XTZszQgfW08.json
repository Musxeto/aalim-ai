  "transcript": "Oh peace and blessings of Allah be on beyond happy vlado nana rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen oh so la la vez el amor a la caja de basura hill ameen nabina muhammad in Wadi he was happy he H may embody brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh now we spoke yesterday in the day before about the hadith of Osama bin zaid may allah be pleased with him and how he killed a man after saying la illaha illallah and yesterday we spoke about the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to nullify a person's Islam to invalidate a person's Islam and to say that he had committed an act of apostasy and I promised you that we will speak a little bit about one of the most deviant and dangerous sects in Islam and that is al hajj and when researching the topic I was overwhelmed by the flow and by the so many hadiths authentic hadith that the Prophet Alice awesome described this sect with now to be a objective we have to study the text first of all and then analyze if it falls on what we see nowadays or not so without further ado the first hadith is narrated by IBN abdillah may allah be pleased with the man with his father a man came to the prophet at his salatu salam while the Prophet was distributing some of the booties of the war and he said this man Mohammed addressing the prophet or somebody by his bare name without Messenger of Allah prophet of allah he said o muhammad be fair logically this is a fair statement but this person was addressing the prophet of Allah The Messenger of Allah so the Prophet had a son got outraged and said woe be to you who will be fair if I am not fair by Allah I have lost and I'm doomed if I'm not fair so horribly hot tub stood up and said prophet of Allah let me kill this man let me kill this hypocrite so the Prophet said Alice am i seek refuge in allah azzawajal that people would talk and say that Muhammad is killing his companions and this is point one that the Prophet of Islam was paying attention to what people may say about him and about Islam and this is perfect Islamic PR public relations he is saving and protecting the image of Islam the other man is deserving to be killed yet he said no I seek refuge in Allah people would speak and say that Muhammad is killing his companions this would put people away from Islam turn them away from Islam and put them off Islam the Prophet said at some afterwards this man and his companions meaning that he has followers recite the Quran and it does not exceed their throats and they exit from Islam exactly as an arrow exits a prey when it is shot with one this hadith is agreed upon you say you're even armor said to saheli be haneef ahead even her name may allah be pleased with him a great companion of the prophet he said did you hear anything that the Prophet said that a missile awesome about the huarache suhail or Sahib her name says I heard him say the prophet of allah and he was pointing towards real aqua from there welcome people reciting the Quran it does not exceed their collar bones they exit Islam they will pass out of Islam as a narrow passes out of the prey a clear explanation and description also a similar incident to the first hadith but this one was narrated by abu sa'id ahould ree he said that Harley danilo elite alongside with Omar said to the prophet alayhi salatu salam allow me to kill this hypocrite the Prophet said Alan salatu salam from the offspring of this man will come a generation reciting the Quran does not exceed their throats they kill the Muslims and they leave in peace the idol worshippers they pass out of Islam as an arrow passes out of a prey by God if I were to see them i would i would kill them and annihilate them like the people of AD were annihilated as mentioned in the Quran and this is also reported in Bihari and Muslim agreed upon ago sir Eid also narrates a similar version where the prophet said allah√≠s alot was salaam that this associate says this man is one of the hypocrites so though he is from the how irish also adding to that he's a hypocrite because alonso josh says and of them are some who accuse you o muhammad in the matter of distribution of the arms and this is exactly what the man did I waseda Kadri may allah be pleased with him also mentions a hadith that was reported by i met in the Moose net and a Buddha would in the sunan and in hockey minimus Tedric and authenticated by Shia albani this is a beautiful hadith the Prophet said Alice am in my OMA there will be a time of separation and division and difference of opinion and there will rise a group of people that are eloquent in speech and are awful and evil in acts and deeds they recite the Quran but it does not pass or exceed their collar bones they exit Islam they pass out of Islam as an arrow passes out of a prey and they would never go back to it meaning to the to Islam until that arrow goes back to the bow after its being shocked there's no possibility of it coming back the Prophet says also Salam they are the most evil of a loss creation and paradise or tuba paradise is for those who kill them and paradise is for those who is killed by them they call to the Book of Allah they claim to be calling people to the Book of Allah and they are not from Allah in any means whoever fights them he is more worthy of being from allah azzawajal so the Prophet says what is their feature where is their mascot what is the thing that identifies them the symbol the Prophet said Alice asaram the shaving of the heads so this is their sign now scholars say and how are each are any rebellious group that renegades and gives the fear to people and fight the majority of Muslims these are the how Irish whether they're calling people to their innovation and finding them over it or not so you can also include the ruffler in this because they fight the people over there innovation and they give tech fear also to the majority of muslims so nowadays people have gone into extreme in the sense that the word how r h is being used as a weapon and it's aimed at anyone who abides by the Sunnah so if there is a faction of the Mujahideen freedom fighters who are fighting for the sake of the religion and against tyranny or against this belief or against the invader kafirs disbelievers who are invading that their country usually the media called them how are each and they're not how are you they're simply defending themselves anyone would defend his country if being attacked by aliens or by strangers let alone by disbelievers also it's been used by liberals in our country in the Muslim countries those who have nothing to do with Islam who are westernized they consider anyone who follows the Sunnah as how I rich as fundamentalist as terrorists so these are canned labels ready to be opened and distributed for free therefore it's extremely important to study this group thoroughly and this is not the right time to do it but we're at the end of the time of the program so we would like to utilize it as much as possible just to highlight the danger of this sect to the extent when the prophet said that is so som that seventy three divisions and sects of my ummah are all inhale except one and the Prophet did not elaborate he did not give us a description of the 72 sects in hell except for one sect that is the huarache why is that why is it so important to describe them in so many hadith tens literally tens of hadith the prophetess m described them for us why didn't he described the lava the Shia the caddy unease the Baha is the Druze nano series all these cafard groups why didn't he excluding xie xie are not careful until they say the coffered thing but in majority as long as it would testify that Allah is one and the Prophet is His Messenger etc then there are Muslims until proven otherwise as we spoke yesterday about the fear but the others are deviant sex why didn't the Prophet aslam explain and elaborate about the description for a very simple reason that the Huaraz people are fooled by them in the thousands they see long beards short hopes their enthusiasm in worshipping Allah reciting the Quran they look like good people they could look like righteous people but they go against the principles of Islam so because people would fall into into their trap as we see them now they're being recruited in the thousands from Germany from UK from chechnya from russia ignorant people don't have any knowledge about the how irish or what they hear is beautiful a hard drug nasheed of killing of slaughtering of doing this and Islam would prevail and the coup for would lose and they see people that look pious and look God feeding and they hear and Allah says Allah says Allah says so they're fooled by them they're lured by them and then they're recruited to be one of them this is why it is essential for you you're confused I know you have to be confused but how would you get out of this confusion by detonating a bomb by blowing yourself up in a mall no you have to go back to the or an and to the sooner and if allah wants good for you he will expand your heart and open it so that you can see the truth with your heart I've said some of the hadith I'll go on their description in the Sunnah first of all their young age the Prophet said Alice a lot was salaam and the hadith Aziz Al Bukhari so no doubt about it at the end of time there will come people who are young in age reckless in thought they coat from the best of the best so they coat the Quran and Sunnah they exit from Islam like an arrow exits from a pray there a man does not exceed their throats wherever you find them kill them because those who kill them will be rewarded on the day of judgment never ever I've seen hadith that authentic in that clear in killing this division in fighting them it's not enough to just debate with them you have to annihilate them and this is not from me it's from the prophet alayhi salatu salam so the first cat aesthetics characteristic is that they're young and look at them they're giving handguns and rifles to children in the 13 and 14 years of age to do their executions and they boast about it is this Islam does this have anything to do with Islam what like it doesn't this is barbaric this is politician call it whatever you want but this has nothing to do Islam second feature that they have their foolish their restless and their reckless they don't have sound minds and this is what they're doing at the moment and this is exactly how the Prophet explained it they do not go back to the elders they do not go back to the scholars and ask them they're impulsive should first ask questions later and this is Una's lamech totally and they think that they're doing good third characteristic they're arrogant and they look down at every single person so they're arrogantly both of what they've done they do evil things and they post it on their selfies or and under videos they slaughter innocent people they burn people they drown people and they claim that this is justice this is insane this has nothing to do with Islam and they think that by what they're doing their arrogance and boastfulness that this is part of Islam the Prophet said Alice salatu salam in an authentic hadith by jeff mcquillan hi der Luyden allah have mercy on his soul the Prophet says among you there will be people who worship Allah and strive hard in worshipping Allah until people are amazed by them and until they are amazed by themselves this is arrogance the prophecies they will leave Islam as an arrow leaves a praying so this arrogance of theirs calls them to slander scholars to speak ill about scholars to use vulgar language with people of knowledge while they themselves wallah they are unable to clean themselves after answering the call of nature they have no knowledge they don't have even knowledge of the basics like those who killed at hossain Denali may Allah be pleased with man with his father came to up the love grammar from the high ridge unhatched and they said share we have killed a mosquito the blood of the mosquito does it invalidate our alarm our state of pilgrimage and even hunger looked at those around look at these imbeciles they've shed the blood of the grandson of the prophetess unum one of the great companions of the prophet s and I'm one of the Masters of the youth in paradise and they asked me about the blood of a mosquito this is their arrogance accompanied by their ignorance characteristic number four they are extreme in worshipping Allah social and not wanting this dunya so they pray they fast they read the Quran the Prophet clearly said this and the hadith was reported by Lima Muslim that your recitation of the Quran is nothing compared to the recitation of the Quran your prayer is nothing to their prayer your fasting is nothing to your fasting to the extreme that they went really overboard but this is not accepted by Allah because they go against human nature and above all they go against the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet Arizona so you know more than a prophet that is salatu salam they go to extreme and that's why they leave the fold of Islam at some stage it was reported that even Ziad when he killed one of their leaders agua even heard a year he asked his servant after he killed this how Irish leader he said to him come tell me about his personal life so the servant said do you want me to elaborate ought to be to the point said no no no be to the point he said I never brought him food during day time and I never laid a bed for him during night time this means that this leader of the how our age was fasting every single day and every single night he used to pray night prayer the whole night never slept and this shows you how much they strive in worshipping allah azzawajal which causes the majority of ignorant Muslims to be impressed to be amazed and to think good of them to think well of them when they should not because this is a separate thing to separate from their actions and deeds of killing people of shedding blood number five their miss interpretation of the Quran though they recite a lot but without any knowledge without any comprehension they put the verses in other than it should be understood they take one verse and neglect ten others that can contradict their deviant ideology and that is why the Prophet said are salam if they decide the Quran thinking that it's on the side while it's against them the Prophet said Alice a lot of Salem it does not exceed their throats it does not exceed that collar bones all of this to emphasize to us that they do not have any relationship to the Quran the Prophet say that is awesome inside Halima Muslim these things just for us to understand their innovation and unfortunately it's a feature of making the how are each in the process when you come and say to the people i only read the quran and nothing else you cannot understand the Quran without the sooner you cannot fully understand the Quran without understanding the concept of authentic incorrect up either because this is what you will fall in the same methodology of the Hawaii who depend and rely only on the Quran one of the teachers once a sister sent me an email couple of days ago telling me that he is explaining surat al-kahf Yoon beautifully so I read quickly and scanned quickly the first thing he said that whoever makes a sin then he is not a habit of Allah he's not a slave of a large doujin because this is the interpretation of slavery being owned by Allah and worshiping Allah Sojin but then he said a very awkward thing which shows you that when you don't have the proper ikeda you bring catastrophes so he said that and any person who commits a sin he has disobeyed allah and when you disobey allah then you commit schilke I would we live in a analogy this is the same methodology of how r h when you disobey allah you commit shirk then when where where are the sins then everyone who's sinful is a mushrik this is preposterous but maybe it's a mistake but such mistakes from people of knowledge means that we have to be careful to whom we listen to because if a person is not qualified if he doesn't have the right Ikeda if he doesn't have the right knowledge then he is not preaching the converts he is teaching something that might include poison in the honey it's sweet but it's poisonous so one has to be really careful now the sixth characteristic mentioned about them is that they use eloquent of speech as the Prophet said a little Absalom they use eloquent of speech but they use evil and bad deeds and they sometimes say the word of truth but not intending it and this is a lot and when you read and listen to their rhetoric they usually use coats of the Quran coach of the hadith coats of the scholars but it goes against the principles of Islam so what is it are you going against Islam because you're misunderstanding of a verse 7 they are truthful in what they say the how are each do not lie unlike the Shia the Rafah the Hawaii have good intent and they are truthful in what they say but their deviant and were ordered to kill them because what they do an act and result to is far greater than anyone else so they never lie they're always truthful even against their leaders even against their high ranking people eh they give the clear and they believe that bloodshed is halal to spill and this is one of the greatest features of the Huaraz whoever opposes them he's against us and hence we should kill him and they go on a killing spree we see this in Boko Haram we see this in Shabaab we see this in Isis or dash or whatever you want to call them the easiest thing to recruit people and this is there a recruiting handbook 101 first of all show the enthusiastic youngsters bombs bombing children and women show them their blood in their scattered flash sheet in there and tell them do you approve of this second of all after you've charged them with anger and hatred direct and focus this hatred to any of the directions or the targets you want if they are fully loaded and they're willing to do this fill their mind with nasheed of killing it'sit's stereotyping and brainwashing and then fill their minds with few verses and few hadees about Jenna about the and the price of it is to give yourself in the cause of Allah and some of it is as stated eloquent speech and it's true and it's being quoted from the Quran and Sunnah as a prophet told told us as some but they are evil and bad in deeds after that they go on step by step to using and utilizing whatever they can so these features in the process of now it's common it's it's common sense it's logical I could recruit thousands of them in seconds because they're easily manipulated when they have no knowledge of the coronation but if you have knowledge in the Quran shin and you feel a lot and you supplicate to Allah you the right way you can tell that no this is bogus this is what the Prophet warned us of Alice awesome finally the mascot or their symbol is shaving but scholars say that they have a special symbol that varies from time to time so at the time of the Prophet it used to be shaving nowadays it's prolonging your hair some of them now have this sign of Allah Russell Muhammad which they claim that is was the seal of the prophets and by the way this is totally bogus you seen this flag the black one with the white writing on it Allah Russell Muhammad this is totally bogus there's nothing authentic about it in the books of history that the name of Allah comes first and then Russell messenger and then Muhammad the other way around is the most authentic mohammed rasoolallah but who cares who looks into details who verifies whether this is right or wrong know the 1 million euro question or dollar I think DNR is even more expensive so dinner it's good created in our the 1 million quoted in our question our Isis now considered to be part of the how Irish personally I believe they're not because the hawara CH are more gallant are more brave and are truthful these leaders of the ISIS are not anything close to that they are simply calling for rulership for being kings and leaders they're not as brave or gallant or even as truthful on the fifth of ramadan abu mohammed at nanny their official spokesman and one of their leaders issued a statement saying that whoever fights Isis he has committed an act of co for he's a kafir he has fallen into cover whether he knows it or not so now fighting them is an act of Cofer it nullifies Islam although Allah social tells us in the Quran if two Muslim factions fight against each other they are believers and you have to reconcile between them but Abu Muhammad Adnani goes overboard and says no we are Islam this makes it or breaks it and this is preposterous and it shows you that these guys are professional liars now among them there might be someone with good intent but this is not enough this good intent does not suffice Muslims must fight them Muslims must make think tanks Muslims must collaborate money there were scholars and activists to make websites to invade the internet the Facebook the Twitter we have to have volunteers coming and standing up in front of this devilish and evil weed before it corrupts your children before it goes into your houses before it corrupts your wives and let them migrate and be part of that deviant sect it is not me it is our prophet alayhi salatu salam if you believe in him who ordered us to kill them wherever we find them so we have to make a stand and we will make a difference with the grace of allah azzawajal we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back last week I asked one question but I did not get to play this is regarding Sara's philosopher avi when while the taraweeh prayer is in progress some people who come late and they make them out for isha prayer so doing like this is correct or what should they do ok there's a lot ok inshallah arshi from yesterday she says if someone recites the Koran and at the conclusion of it he decides to give it to a deceased person the reward is this permissible the answer is no this is an innovation so what about if someone dies and people visit to give their condolences and we give them parts of the parts of the Quran so that each one of them besides a portion of it and by the end of the gathering this would be a full Quran and we give it to the disease this is an innovation as well Rama from Kenya trauma I think we lost Rama okay third question is about shortening the prayer and combining if you're traveling from a city to another city and in the process in the way of traveling you may shorten and you may combine there's no problem in that the issue is if you reach that city if that's it is your hometown or if that's it is the place where you are residing in then you cannot shorten anymore nor combine because by the minute you enter the exceptions or the permissions or the Rojas for shortening and combining is over a share from Saudi Arabia assalamualaikum them at the library cenamos lavaca to you doc Alaska you're talking love head to you just open up to this Phoebe genin you know they're there should be some scholars some guys some good people righteous people who will open the eyes and the heart of the people really we are in the confusing we see something else and BM and it is something else yes I mean you have a given a very good view and open the eyes what are the people who were doing all the wrong things and just I really just have a love her for that and then hamdulillah it will surely help me and many other people also jessica long voyages of america logic sister hacia mohammed from nigeria yeah yes mohammed yeah I caught yesterday the question I asked before his other today that this and its owner Sheikh he liked the book and we preach about people are that we can put in Islam if we are living in an Islamic country so any coated so my peas and some references the pool while we can you know express our right but this brother cooked it is Delta free that the if somebody's say we should vote in a non islamic thing is supposed to be killed behalf of islamic food so I want you to hardy too deep my question that you okay I think is that is enough to give a clear and he's just people given that free because they talk about no use a spoon living like I you spoon and biometric reader pretty I understand your question and I will answer it insha Allah Yusuf from Australia Yusuf from Australia yes ash extra Moloch for her to learn sound Lovato check I'm asking one question if you if Adam and that leads you in prayer declare that is the shared and they put above you assuming difficult able for you to pretty hiding okay i will answer yo solo okay Hamid has a question about a group where he comes from in Nigeria that gift tag fear and they do a lot of teachings and they read from books and they go a little bit overboard should he report them that sir is yes if you are in a Muslim country and you feel that these people are going overboard report them and the authorities will look into their teachings is it authentic or are they part of Boko Haram and he gives an example he doesn't give example of the books that they teach but I have a sort of any an idea about it because he says that they say that anyone who votes in elections is a Katherine must be killed definitely these are from Hawaii we've stated yesterday if you remember a he and i hope that huda puts this program of yesterday on their archive because i gave you a in short in summary the conditions of giving tech fear and you cannot just simply go and give the clear to anyone and you have to be a panel of scholars and you cannot go and kill anyone because this is the area of the imam otherwise we don't have to have imams or muslim rulers or anything of this sort and voting we know that the voting process and democracy is prohibited it's haram but in some incidents your vote can make a difference in reducing the evil so by avoiding it this is a some of the scholars say you should avoid it even though this is respected but those other scholars lecture have been if they mean other scholars who agree that voting is haram but at some K in some cases when my vote has a weight and a difference and can reduce the evil then voting is halal I'm not doing this while I am pleased with it but I'm doing it out of necessity we have to to vote for one is a Muslim one is a kafir then I will choose a kafir the Muslim that is though the action process is wrong but to reduce the evil as much as possible Mohammed from Sudan mammut from Sudan sadak from Saudi sadak or so deep okay we've lost both ram is from Zambia says that if the Imam makes a mistakes makes a mistake in salat and I came late and he offered to Judas ah who if he offered to do the cell before salam this means that you have to also offers you to decide with him because you cannot conclude your prayer until he gives salam so if he offers to suit of Salaam you follow but what happens if he gives salam and I stand up for my third record and then the Imam says Allahu Akbar and prostrates twice for his sahu definitely i cannot follow him so should I myself do so do the sound after I conclude my third and fourth tracker and Tasha hood and offer salam we have to look if the mistake happened in the first and second raka which you did not pray with him the new are exempted you don't have to make that suit if the suit happened in his third and fourth rocker which is your first and second Rocca and you were there your present in this case you have to offer this sujood like he did it after the Sam as well Abdullah from saudi arabia LOL appear a sample la my question is I all talked about level cover ok just not people who don't come at all when the electric are they started and then they just jump in the mosque on that they are on the twenty-seventh only on the twenty-seventh to come and pray and then they will just go back again to the usual business however what the rule on our good people ok

going to my room if I see Sir if I see somebody sitting down without praying I feel so angry you need for care for me I feel so very angry that why did I am going to imagine a person is sitting down without training ok i will answer in sha allah was a caffee so dick from saudi yes yes Sophie but que la MOLLE who she say Allah but in Indian culture hello yes he the in Indian culture it is the common for women to not be any job in front of the husband's brothers especially the angel one how far is this permissible what is the sonic ruling over this ok i will inshallah what a rock oh yeah

am Hamid I'm not a lot bigger in my ass more four or five questions yeah make it quick a seat ok it's regarding v70 two groups which are regarded are non-muslims not problem although this can you expand or to get more about that when division who are going on some lines this one this one too what about a yob I will be so do cordova al google it is the a must or is it a erika just custom of some countries a what numbers number three I didn't get your second question and Europe is it a couple some or a Muslim from our God an ePub okay number three yes if our cause there it is fine if our close relatives weather is it father mother brothers going ahead following Trump exactly and if isolated many times and not agree what was the sort of Islam regarding quran and sunnah or very foolish following if you know the city's idea can I get away from the cycle car again can I do this okay i want the middle of August okay Islam I can follow number four I thank you okay oh yeah if you follow if it was a magician I'm really at least and it'll be three intoxicate and allow easy to cover all their double sixes enhance enough yes okay i will answer in charlotte since it Dean from Saudi Somali kuya shake Santa ma now so I want to apps question concerning the car to the fee tree yes because I'm over the I'm help somebody always give my jacket too but nowadays he now travel to Sri Lanka and he sent me his account number to send money to him so I want to ask is it permissible for me to send the money to him for this acapella Petrie that's the first question okay then the second question that given up the catalpa tree is it it does it go along with you in your region is it only people in your written where you stick and give to likely I'm from Nigeria now and I know that people that make this attitude which are more mature than in Saudi Arabia can i send money down home for them to purchase food for people to give people in Nigeria or sleep be within my locality in Saudi Arabia here okay i will answer in Shaba we have read lot from Saudi Reba okay so we we need time to answer these questions Aram is from zambia's second question what's the ruling on attending the wedding of a kafir if the wedding is in a church or it's a religious festival this is prohibited for you to attend if it's just a reception so it's just the food there and there's no contract and there's no priests and nothing it seems okay if there is no mixing between the agendas and there is no alcohol or prohibited food which is usually impossible Muhammad Ali from Saudi Arabia he says that he asked a question earlier and I remember this question if a person enters a message and that the Asia prayer is over so the Imam is praying to records of sunnah in a minute or two they were all pray taraweeh so a group of people come late and they perform raesha prayer in congregation this is wrong and this is not acceptable because the original mmm is there and he's going to pray taraweeh your prayer of Asia would contradict his being an imam and it would also distract Muslims he you pray you recite the Quran he's reciting quran and everyone is trying to make it as well as possible this is prohibited in harlem what to do join them in the taraweeh so the first two records you joined with them when he offers salaam you complete your third and fourth tracker individually Yusuf from Australia he says what's ruling on praying behind a Shia Imam a Muslim soon he must not pray behind any of those innovators however the ruling in Islam is whoever's his prayer is valid for himself then it's valid for those behind him so if this shiri is a Muslim and you don't know any ideas or conviction of his that nullifies Islam so you know that he's a shearing but you don't know if he curses asia abu bakr umar uthman or not you don't some would say oh this is by default no it's not by default not all she eyes are like this the sadies are not like this they don't curse and there are people laymen of shia who don't yes if there is their mullah or the one with the turbines definitely put them in the trash can because these guys are totally out of it the Ethne area or the enemy their scholars their leaders their mullahs they definitely out of the loop of Islam because it's part of their religion what they teach that the Quran is corrupt and the most half of Fatima is the original Quran what you have is false but if you don't know anything about this person except that he is a shitty you can pray behind him it's better to not to do it to do so and go to somewhere else or even pray on your own just to be safe abdallah from saudi arabia says that there are people who don't do anything during the last 10 nights of ramadan except on the night of the 27th so they go to the masjid in they pray and they do recite a shin of the quran and then afterwards they go back to normal ok why do you limit a las mercy we are instructed and recommended to offer as much as possible in the last 10 nights of ramadan and the majority of scholars say that the most likely night to be the night of other lela2 other is the night of the 27th though this is not a general rule it can be on the twenty-second even not days not necessarily even odd days or odd nights so why do you limit a las mercy by telling them listen don't come to my message on the twenty-seventh either you come to full 10 nights although I don't want to see your face Allah would not have forgiveness and mercy for you just for coming for this particular night stock for Allah who deprives people from Allah's mercy and forgiveness encourage them maybe this year they will pray one night next year maybe they will make it five nights hope who knows so this is not from your own pocket out for your own money this is Allah's mercy don't limit it and make it as wide as possible for the people do from Saudi Arabia says he wanted to give someone a gift but then he changed his mind and he gave it to someone else is there a sin on him no there isn't because the gift is not mandatory until the other person takes it so if I give you a pen and you take it I cannot call it back but if I say listen I'm going to give you a pen and he said ok the second law here and tomorrow's it I change my mind there's no problem in that he says that whenever someone enters a message and sits without praying to erica's I feel outraged and I feel very angry okey channel your anger into wisdom into love and care and compassion this brother go and talk to him and give him the hadith with a big smile if he does not accept it also have love and compassion in your heart because he's following a school of thought that tells him that it is not mandatory to pray 2 rakats and it is voluntary and he doesn't want to choose the voluntary thing so don't force people to believe and think what you believe as long as they have a legitimate reason not to do so so dick from saudi arabia says that in India we have the concept of women not wearing the hijab in front of their brothers in law this is unassuming those who do such thing are not following the teachings of the Prophet Alice of Sam they're following the culture and they're worshiping their desires the Prophet I so Sam and the hadith Asians are here he said do not enter upon women meaning that none muharram do not mix with them so one man stood up and said o prophet of Allah what about my hamill meaning the brother-in-law my uncle if he comes and visits my wife the Prophet said it into words and whammo el moat your hmoo your brother or your uncle who is the brother-in-law to that woman or the uncle in law of that woman is death meaning if you allow this then you're allowing death it is so awkward how p people who claim to be Muslim and Sunni and following the quran and sunnah and yet they forced their daughters-in-law to come and sit with their brothers in law who are at Muharram and to force them to take off the hijab or maybe only to hide and cover their hair but while exposing the face the makeup and the smiles and the grudges and Japan and the frowns etc subhanAllah this is unacceptable as usual guide the Muslims but I should said about his traveling I told him you cannot break your fast until you leave the borders of the city so even if you're in at the airport you haven't traveled yet don't break your fast as long as the sun is still up once you take off and you leave then you can break your fast if you wish Muhammad from Sudan says that the 72 excuse me the 72 deviant sex are there Muslims are not Muslim some of them are totally not Muslims and some of them are Muslims so those innovators are part of the 72 sects how would you define that because they're not on the footsteps of the Prophet Alice awesome those who dance and chant part of vicar those who perform innovations such as molded or they celebrate innovated night they are not part of additional jumeirah one hundred percent but they are not kafir so they will not be in hell forever so all deviant sex who are away from the Sunnah of the Prophet as salam they're considered to be part of them those who fight the neck up they're not covered and a cop is an issue of dispute among scholars and jurors the most authentic opinion is it is mandatory but those who see it otherwise they are not covered they have the choice to choose the parents such as the father and the husband or the mother who do not abide by the Sunnah should I be with them yeah give them down call them not they're not perfect your fingers are not alike one is longer than the other but you do need them all so as long as they're Muslims and they're not abusive just be kind to them be tolerant choose the right moment to give them down and impress them with your character as a Muslim a practicing Muslim not as a preacher or a scholar in your ivory tower dictating that this is Harold this is haram know people would not accept this so try your level best to be kind to them she said he says his final question that a father forces his daughter not to wear the new pup the daughter if she believes in the obligation of the niqab she should not follow or obey her father but if she has to be diplomatic if he will kick kick her out or if this would cause tension so she should pretend that she is abiding but with what he says and whenever she is away from him she should wear chunks of Dean says that he used to send his ax cut to a person who had gone on exit visa to Sri Lanka so can he send him money through his bank account if he's trustworthy and you know that he's poor and he knows poor people then this is permissible do i have to pay mais the cattle footer in Saudi i am from nigeria he says and we have lots and lots of poor people in nigeria much more poor than here in saudi arabia so can i send it no problem in sha allah the majority of scholars say that it's much better and it's best spent locally but if the need is dying and strong in your country and you are sure that they will give the grain or the dates or the rice before they eat here in saudi arabia then this is permissible and a large division knows best I think maybe today I'm not sure maybe tomorrow would be the last of our program of mercy for mankind of sallallaho salem but i'm not sure so if you don't see me tomorrow then you know that i'm lazy and i've called it a day and i pray to a large that we meet later on as good as usual between mother benicia every saturday on who the TV so until then I pray to Allah that he accepts your fasting Alonzo gel accepts your night prayer and I pray to Allah sol-gel that this Ramadan is proven to be the best Ramadan ever to pass on you and me with the grace of allah azzawajal until then I leave you feel Manila Pacelle American Birkin to LA he / cattle he said and blessings of Allah be on my bebo p 7 and blessings of Allah be on my solo beyond happy"
