academies where you will learn structured Islamic knowledge for free and to have tests and to check your levels with them as well as Sharla so now we begin insha'Allah with the first question and yeah yeah says what are the conditions if one wants to marry a girl he has committed zina with can he marry her or leave her for good first of all zina is a major sin and without any doubt it takes two to tango so we always hear them crying that a man betrayed us he promised me to marry me he did this he did that and after he got what he wanted he ran away so she portrays herself as the victim and the man to be the perpetrator without any doubt the man is a perpetrator and he's simple but she is not exempted she is as simple as he is because she's not a child she's a grown up woman and she took that sin the burden upon her shoulders so she is as sinful as he is and we're not condoning anyone and we're not pointing fingers at anyone they're both in the same boat and they are both sinful now yeah he says if a person committed zina with a woman can he marry her the answer can be technically and can be an advice so technically speaking if they both repent and this is a condition because Allah stated in Surat and nor zania to Lanka hahaha Alhassan in a mushrik an adulteress is not married to accept another adulterer or a Idol worshipper Mushnik a kafir so in order for the marriage contract to be valid both of them need to repent secondly she can't be married until we are certain that she is not pregnant meaning that she has to get her menses once to prove that she's not pregnant thirdly he has to propose to her father who is her guardian and if he accepts then they can get married this is the technical advice but is it advisable just because you made a mistake a heinous sin would we demand and require that you go and cover-up for this mistake with another mistake which is marriage this is not advisable you have to first look into the girl and to yourself to see if you are both compatible or not to see that whether she is worthy of getting married to or not you see a good woman would she be a good wife or is she someone who's foolish enough to maybe attempt to have another relationship and commit zina again and again and again so this is something that you have to look into and Allah knows best but there's no obligation on whatsoever on you to marry her Maryam Allah says what best deeds can one do in the last 10 days of Ramadan as for the days throughout the whole month of Ramadan charity is one of the best deeds you can offer Ramadan is the month of Quran so reciting a lot of the Quran is reward Abul pondering upon the Quran meaning reading it with great concentration and contemplation even if the quantity is little also is greatly rewarded Ramadan is the month of surah so when you make du'a you are also highly rewarded and if you offer night prayer this is one of the prominent things that decorates Ramadan so we have Tala we we have to hedge it and we have a lot of reciting the Quran in prayer all of these are good deeds that one should consider Farooq Abdullah says someone told me that if Jews and Christians only follow this meaning the ayah in Surat al-baqarah Allah says what translates to who believe in the unseen establish prayer and spend out what we have provided for them and who believe in what has been revealed to you O Muhammad and what was revealed before you and of the hereafter they are certain in faith those are upon right guidance from their Lord it is those who are the successful so the man told him that if they do not follow the Prophet Allah saw a peace be upon him though they are though they are saved as per these verses of the Quran is this true definitely that this is not true if you even Farouk read the ayahs the verses yourself you'll find that that is true not true the ayah is praising those who do these things and described them as successful and you just heard that Allah said and who believe in what has been revealed to you so someone does not believe in the Prophet Isis M does not believe in the Quran definitely is not among the successful and he's in hellfire the prophets anti-racism there is no Jew or Christian who hears about me and does not believe in me and follow me except he will be among the people of Hell so definitely this is a crystal clear indication that only the Muslims will enter Jannah and by Muslims we mean those who follow the Prophet al-assad's RAM or those at the time of Jesus who followed him or those at the time of Moses who followed him they are all considered to be Muslims until the following messenger came to them so I hope this answers your question thought it what yer says what is the view on quitting permanently a job due to the fact that this is a schedule does not allow the person to attend Friday salat it goes without saying that attending Friday prayer is a must a mandatory action upon all male Muslim adults however this ruling difference if you are a minority or if you're living in a non-muslim country where they do not force people to close down for prayer so if you're working in the UK for example Friday is a working day if you ask your boss for an hour or two of leave a lot of the non-muslims would allow this they have an amount of tolerance with the grace of Allah and they allow you but if for example your boss does not allow that and he tells you no you can't leave while working you have an option to leave and quit this job providing that you won't come after a couple of weeks begging saying chef I don't have a job I quit my job for Friday now I don't have any income so I'm begging you for money because the scholars say that skipping Friday if there is harm upon you whether physically or even financially is permissible and you can pray in the hall so we have to look into your case brother Talib if you tell us that alhamdulillah and a professional IT expert and I have so many proposals to work and I can leave this job and get another job maybe lesser pay or more pay but I know that I'll survive well off without needing to beg anyone the answer is yes you have to look for a job that allows you to pray but if you say no I am I've just arrived in the country and I'm barely its hands to mouth and I can barely live with the income I I have if I quit I'm going to go into debt and maybe have to compromise other things in this case we see no stay in your job until Allah makes and a way out for you manding drama says how can i correct my mistake when I'm in a silent salat and the Imam has finished the record and is down for the scheduled but I'm still on my record because I did not finish my suratul fatiha on time this is one of two cases either you're too slow or your Imam is too fast there is no third possibility so if you ask all those worshipers who pray in the masjid and they all share with you the concern that the Imam is too fast we're unable to recite the fatiha in this case such a delay would not impact your prayer recited as fast as you can if the Imam goes to record and he did not finish it try to finish it as fast as you can and catch up with a middle core if he somehow l-'alamin Hamidah and you haven't said subhanAllah be relieved you would say so handlebar limit least once and raise your head if he immediately went to stitute before you raising your head there is no problem on you follow him as quick as you can but if you are the one who's too slow and the congregation say no the guy's reciting the fatiha in a normal speed in this case it is your mistake and this record is invalid so once you offer Salam you give takbir and stand up and offer that missed raka and you have to rectify this because this would hamper your prayers every single time you pray you have to practice to recite it faster than you do and Allah knows best Rambla Han says I was not on call with my friend and during normal discussion about covered 19 she said I saw a dream about coffin 19 and it would end by September or so my question is by listening to her does it come under fortune-telling there is no fortune-telling is pretending that something in the future will happen and this because of some knowledge that I have so if I say your father will die in three days this is fortune-telling if I say that you will get a raise on the 21st of June and I don't have any sources that would give me such an tell I'm just pretending that I have jinn or I know the future this is fortune-telling seeing a dream and in the dream you see something that's happening in the future this can be a vision from Allah it can't be from the Shaitaan and it can be simply your sub-conscience telling you things that you were thinking about earlier so this is not part of fortune-telling and listening to your friend is not wrong so Allah for Xena says is it okay if I make duaa in my heart without moving my lips before the if part time or do I have to raise my hands and make duaa with the iftar near me the door has to be engaging your tongue and lips so I cannot keep my lips sealed and recite the Quran or make duaa no I have to make because also I have to say many Rahim Malachy AA meeting I have to move my lips and my tongue in order for my recitation for my daughter for my thicker from whatever I'm worshipping Allah by to be valid if I keep my lips sealed and this is a common mistake a lot of Doom's do so when I start this prayer I say my prayer is invalid I didn't say to me at the table but sure I said it in my mind I said Allah Akbar it doesn't work you have to say whether silently or audibly so when you make dua and they've taught is next to you you have to move your lips bye-bye making dua so that it would count and be answered in sha allah can sorry up says can we give the cattle photo on the 28th of ramadan even our may allah be pleased with him said that we used to give the cattle throttle a day or two before ramadan so it seems that if the month is 29th and ends then 28th is acceptable and inshallah 28 29 and 30 are suitable to give zakat Oh Alfred or Frida says conventional loans are RIBA and thatíll or river and Nasir or both well conventional loans have both in them because you receive a ten thousand euros for a month you're obliged to pay them back eleven thousand euros so the model they increased from 10 to 11 is there this is ruble family from the same type from the same kind and then the see the Nessie is also there which is the month delay so both are in their second question is it okay to pray 200 in the morning if I overslept it won't be called tahajud it would be making up for the not for the midnight prayer and mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her if I'm not mistaken tells us that when whatever the prophet sallallaahu anyway we'll have overslept due to illness or any other reason he would make up his night prayer by changing it from odd numbers which is 11 into even numbers which is 12 so if you have a habit of praying 7 records every night for Tahajjud and you overslept when you wake up in the morning you pray it at the time of boo ha so it is after sunrise by 10 minutes or 15 minutes till before the event of Lord by 10 minutes or 50 minutes and you pray instead of 7 you create 2 by 2 by 2 by 2 this is what the pseudonym stated Fatima says is this true about lailatul Qatar we can't multiply its true value is only known by Allah we just have to believe it's better than one and months the blessings and virtues of the night and work hard to gain the reward like the reward of fasting the month of Ramadan is only known by Allah the answer is yes the issue of multiplication is not found in the Sunnah or in the Quran Allah mentioned in the Quran that it is a night better than a thousand months he did not say multiplied or more than a thousand months it's better so what's being circulated that you should give money on that night or some of them deserve a number of dollars or reals or Durham's so every night he gives that the board hoping to be multiplied by eighty-three years although this is not from the Sunnah and it's not authentic Allah sheet says is a rabbinical hand mandatory after Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah if one forgets to pray forgets it the prayer is valid please enlighten me yes it is mandatory for the person praying alone and for the print person leading the prayer so a person praying alone or he's the imam he has to say both sentences sami allahu liman hamidah what bana well I could have or allahumma rabba now when I cut ham or ramen alikat ham or Allah whom are abandon a cat hunt for variations as for the Imam as for the moon the follower the worshiper praying behind any man he doesn't say Samuel of Liman Hamidah he responds to something a lot him and how many of the amount by saying a lot by now when I can Hampton that's that's it if he adds Hampton Cathy don't play even mobile mcafee that's good there is no problem in the but he you see a lot better weather could have or a lot more burner when I can hamd it is mandatory Islam or Islam Salam my wife is pregnant should she keep fasting she's a bit weakness it is this is up to her Allah so Jill gave her the concession to break her fast and make for the missed days later on when she has no obstacles preventing her from fasting so yes she has no problem in skipping fasting and making up for that days depending on her own preference maybe she says no I am strong I can't do that without any harm on me physically or on my child this is up to her lisa says what is the ruling for someone at the starting of ramadan she was seriously sick and she happened to die in the middle of ramadan how are you going to compensate that on behalf of the dead person first of all if a person falls sick and misses days of Ramadan and did not recover or get a chance to make up any of these days he continued to be 6 for 6 months for a year and then he died there is no expiration for that we don't have to feed anything we don't have to make up for these mistakes second situation is if a person falls sick and misses days of Ramadan but the scholars the doctors say that such an illness cannot be recovered or cured and this person will remain sick unable to fast until the day he dies whether it's a year five or ten years from now in this case we have to feed one poor person for every day mist so if the man dies after Ramadan by 3-4 months and he did not fast and he did not feel we will feed on his behalf third situation is if a person falls sick skips days of Ramadan and lives three or four months afterwards able to make up but he knows that he has the time limit till the following Rama not so he's postponing making it up because he has the right to do so and all of a sudden he dies this situation is where his heirs his relatives his wife his children and his brothers those who are relegated to him may make up for those missed days whether one of them carries them all or ten of them each carries a day or a day or two days etc there is no problem in that insha'Allah I hope this answers your question and the other says his rate prayer valid if I pray in congregation with my wife at home I heard some kind of fatwa from Saudi is it true this is an issue of dispute the majority of scholars say that this is permissible Imam Abu Hanifa Imam iemon tamiya and share even earth I mean may Allah have mercy on their souls say that this is not permissible because it was legislated to be prayed in the masala with the congregation in a special format which is prayer than hot but due to that fact if one misses it he cannot make it up in the masala or at home and this is the most authentic opinion if we miss Friday we cannot pray Friday home to records we have to prefer so these great congregational prayers that include a speech and a hot oba and congregation with Muslims they cannot be made up it has to be prayed as legislated or not at all I'm the father bérenger says el badi is or he's a very pijl bad maybe is it an obligation to share with the prospective groom deficiencies in the character of the bride since many aspects of the character of hidden marks and science no this is not at all wise none of us is exempted from having shortcomings and flaws in our character so imagine me going to a woman wanting to propose to her and in the presence of her father we start chit-chatting and she's liking what she sees and then I say listen I snore when I sleep and I get very angry when my wife does not do this or that and I don't like to lend people money and I also I'm not a very social person so I may not go to visit in-laws a lot if any and I don't like eating at restaurants what am i doing I'm trying to scare her away and I will definitely succeed in that this is not logical it's not logical for a woman to say listen that I'm not a very good cook I do this I do that and she tells me all about her shortcomings and these are not serious but these are not the things you wanna say in an interview as an former HR Human Resources Director when someone sits in an interview and he says I am a bit lazy I don't know how to type quickly sometimes I get agitated when someone jokes with me so in a team I may not be pretty immediately upset nice meeting you kiddo because this is what he's telling me he's telling me that he's no good no you have to pitch for yourself and try to show that you are a good person while trying to fix these shortcomings and being a better man than you look or a better woman that you look but to give up front all of your sins and mistakes and shortcomings this is another all advisable Abdullah Kukui or something like that shake the takbir of Salah tolerate has no test be like subhanAllah hamd allahu akbar in everything no it does not some schools of thought said that between each that beer you give a pause equivalent truth to speak so I see [Music] um so it's like saying 1,001 1,002 1,003 but this is not from the sooner you just say Allah Akbar and repeat that and Allah knows best cuz Cooper says if we pray it in our homes do we need to give sermon after the prayer the answer is no I've answered also whether it is permissible or not to give to pray eight in the homes Zara Khalil says if my relatives don't talk to me but I want to talk to them will I be sinful no of course not as long as they're your kinship it is your duty to try to talk to them but not to force yourself upon them send them a text message give them greetings on read and the likes this would ensure Allah add value to them I have a question one night this is from Boone or Hanna he says I have a question one night I didn't wake up in suhoor so I didn't take my food and I continued my fasting is it permissible yes yes yes so hope he's not a precondition for your fasting it is a highly recommended sooner but if you go to bed intending too fast waking up only after the Adhan there is no problem that your fasting is totally correct and valid Vicki nori Deen says can a woman read or an when menstruating either using the Koran or any electronic device the vast majority of scholars prohibit a woman in her menses to touch the Quran but reciting the Quran reading the Quran is totally permissible for a woman and her menses if you want to hold the Quran the book itself wear gloves or touch it with a piece of cloth but it's always best to read it from a mobile device or a PDA or a computer or even a book of tafseer you don't have to have anything on your hands to do that abalone as he says can you please talk about the saving bank accounts any riba based bank any conventional bank these people deal mainly and Reba so whatever you deposit your money with them they'll take the money and they lend it to somewhere else with percentage and they will confiscate their homes they were fourth closure they would do everything in their possibility they sell in mortgages they sell in short-term loans with profits or long-term there are tragedies bonds all based on the ax so when you have a saving bank account and they're putting interest on top of that this is RIBA and you're consuming liver and this is prohibited and not permissible for you to do faisal says i'm faisal from bangladesh and my question is i heard that there is a sahih hadith saying that before drinking wine was prohibited I live near leotarded may Allah be pleased with him leading the Jumeirah of a sir or motherland while we was drunk and mistakenly recite some wrong lines from surah to Catherine is this authentic sahih hadith that message no this is fabricated and it's not authentic that's the awesome says please what is the ruling on performing in Eid prayers at home we've answered the son Farid John says rather than buying a bag of rice for needy people can I instead just give money to a needy relative back home for them to have something to eat dancer is not the majority of scholars the school of thought of Maddy Keisha Feeney and Hanbury follow the hadith of the Prophet erase all cinema where I'm the love Omar may Allah be pleased with a man I would say ad hood they said that the prophet of Allah obligated there's a cattle fitter to be once our of food staple food so they clearly stated that the Prophet obligated Isis and once our of staple food whether it's dates barley wheat up--it etc and SAR is a container of wait let me rephrase that it's a container of size and not weight so it's like a leader not like a kilogram or a pound which means that if we bring a container that carries one Tsar and the Sun is composed of four wood this is one wood one two three four we have a song if we put in the Tsar this measurement tool if we put in it once our updates one song of wheat monza of barley the size is the same but the weight of each one is different hence the price of each item is different so we cannot say that we have to give it in cash because it differs from one item to the other the profit obligated analysis to be in food and it's negligible amount is 15 reals per person of rice which is equivalent to maybe four dollars for person and if I want to give a poor person four dollars it looks at it what is this the purpose of zakat to settle or subtotal filter is that the beggars the poor the needy don't have to go out on the day of Eid begging they have their food for the day that's more than enough what for what they want so that's actually a question no it's not permissible to give money however most of the Muslims when they give the rice to the poor they give cash alongside with it as a charity so this is light upon light no problem in doing that was a circle Ohio law abdullah Niazi says how much is the zakat in the United States it's not the value of he it is the cost of the food you're buying so if it is rice that the people eat there look for asar which is 2.25 kilogram of rice or something equivalent to that in what people eat such as macaroni such as pasta such as corn whatever they beans etc Afreen a-- says how much is it important for a girl not to marry a person who's earning is interest based there is a hadith which says if the husband's earning is Haram but it is halal for his wife I don't know of such a hadith that states this as you have mentioned the FINA but yes a person whose income is Haram and he proposes definitely it is not permissible for you to marry someone as such someone who's dealing in Haram his income is Haram then this is not permissible to marry him hustlin says is it permissible to pray if someone is lying in front of us I kept Sutra between me and the person who is sleeping before my prayer rug this is permissible even if you don't have a suit on even if the person is lying in front of you directly there's no problem the problem is in someone crossing in front of you while praying in the authentic hadith mother aisha tells us that the prophet sallallaahu assalam used to pray night prayer and our house was so small that there was no place for him to prostrate and me to sleep at the same time so she says that I used to sleep in front of him and whenever he wants to prostrate he used to pinch me so that I would pull away my legs after he finishes frustrating and stands up I would extend my legs back again so there's no problem in that inshallah freedom in a man says what happens to the non-muslims when Muslims conquer a land I don't know why the youth are so obsessed by these issues of reaching the last step of the ladder rather than walking the ladder step by step jihad and conquering countries and doing this and that is the last thing a person would do in the current current circumstances the Muslims are so weak are so vulnerable are so disunited that these issues are the last thing we ever think of besides it's not our problem it is way above our pay grade it is for the Muslim rulers to decide what to do generally speaking the Muslims go and when at times of power they negotiate with the country they are about to invade and they propose to them that they accept Islam and they will leave them alone simple as that if the people defy this say no we're not willing to accept Islam then the Muslims tell them in this case you have to pay as taxations known as easier so that we can protect protect you and let you be we will protect you no one can fight you or wage war against you we will be the one combating them and fighting them if the people say no we're not interested in this case we tell them in this case we will have to fight you and we will have to enslave those who fall under captivity and they will become slaves for the Muslims and we will be sold or distributed and if they still don't accept that then there is war Farid or Fareed Jan says rather than buying a bag okay I think we've gone through this as well the question number 30 Beverly Smith says what is or what if you have very very contract or written contract I don't know what your previous question Beverly is but a contract whether verbal or written is the same value so in marriage contract if someone says I give you my daughter in marriage and I say I accept and there are two male Muslim witnesses marriage is done this verbal in buying and selling if I say I'll give you this phone for five dollars and you say I accept and you take it and I you give me the five dollars that's it or we write a contract it's more binding more authentic and it's a proof because in verbal contracts if one of the partners dealing retreats or claims that he did not sell or buy there is no proof that I can provide and he has to his obligation to swear by saying well I am telling the truth because now I'm going to the judge and I say this man sold me his car and I gave him the money and now he says no I did not receive any money and I did not sell my car so the chef tells me do you have any proof like a wire transfer with the amount to the man's account said no should you have any witnesses I said no you have any written paper document he says no so I fail to present my proof this case the defendant the other share goes to the defendant the judge goes to the defendant says so and so claims that he sold you or he bought you both from you the car and gave you the money he said no he did not the sheriff tells them swear by Allah and this is okay I swear by Allah I did not take anything from him and I did not sell him my card end of case I failed to present the evidence to back my story he defended his reputation by swearing end of case it's over and on the day of judgment he will pay heavily for that oath he took Huma says can we pray for Jenna for parents who committed shirk this is problematic because this question to be answered we have to first of all get something out of the way which is your parents are dead correct yes they used to commit correct yes do you have any evidence that they knew that this was Czech did any eylem scholar a Muslim judge label them as mushrik no in this case we assume that they died on Islam because in order to label someone as a mushrik we have to fulfill the conditions and remove any obstacles preventing us from doing this otherwise I asthma Hakim would go and label the vast majority of all Muslims as mushrik because they go to dargas they ask peers they may deal in magic and many many of them don't know that this is Harlem so it's not easy just simply to say ah I remember my uncle and he used to say when a bee he used to swear by the Prophet as a son so this is if this means he is mushrik and hence I am NOT going to ask a lot of forgiveness no this is accusing someone condemn endemic him being the judge issuing the verdict being the executioner at the same time this is this doesn't work like this so if a person committed shirk while he was not knowing that it was we would not label him as a machine if a person abandoned Salah died without praying but not knowing that this is an act of Cofer and no one has told him this or established that he knew yet he still was defined and insisted on it it would not be labeled as cover but let's assume that someone is a blatant Muslim he knows that going to graves and worshipping them and sacrificing from them is we showed them their evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah he acknowledged but he said this is what my pet forefathers used to do and I don't care about your Islam this is my Islam and we've tried our level best and he died upon the artena of after fulfilling the conditions and preventing any obstacles in this case you cannot ask a lot for forgiveness for him Allah says in surah at-taubah what translates to it is not for the prophet sallallaahu and those who had believed it's not up to them to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire once a person is labeled as a mushrik or a kafir and a companion of hellfire you cannot pray funeral prayer over him you cannot ask love forgiveness for him I've been Majid as wa mmm says please regarding the current praying at home due to covered nineteen in my area people still observe congregational prayers in the Masjid I'm scared of joining big came people or because people go out to different places to work and coming together to pray when they returned appears to be risky but I still have fear regarding my own action of praying at home while others are praying in the message please what can I do I pray in congregation prior hour I used to pray in congregation prior to the pandemic saga if the Masjid the mosques are open and the authorities allow people to pray in the congregation you my friend must go and pray with them if you behave normally and you go to work and you go to school and you mix with people but if you are the type of a person who's afraid so you are actually confined to your home you don't go to work you don't go to school you don't mix with people you don't buy groceries or go to the market in this case due to your fear you can tree home but I'll tell you this copied 19 is the flu on steroids so it's not normal flu it is a bit more dangerous yet it is not the plague that kills tens of thousands every day and within 2 to 3 or 4 days no that's fatal this is an illness that 80% of those infected don't know that they are infected and they heal by themselves without any medical intervention at all 15% of those infected must get medical intervention whether it is the top ventilators or normal medications 5% as average died in Sweden for example all those who died were over 70 years of age in Italy the average of the deaths were 70 years of age so there are 80 90 100 so the deaths come to those who are susceptible to death due to their age like myself or due to their medical condition like mine those who have deficiencies in their immune system those can be quarantined but when you're young and healthy you have to go to the message you have to mix and if you get infected you will be healed insha'Allah with the grace of Allah but we have covered 19 tomorrow we will have covered 20 25 30 will we be in continuous lockdown till we die this is ridiculous so this is up to you you have to look into what suits you most depending that is illegal so you have to follow the laws of the country and you have to look into yourself if you are sick or having temperature high temperature no you must not go so that you would not harm others but if you're healthy and you're wearing a mask what more do you want to do sabah missile are i think my husband borrowed some money from his brother-in-law at the time of my daughter's wedding his brother-in-law gave it wholeheartedly and the next year he tried to take advantage of this and started overpowering and indirectly insulting him in front of other family members to show his superiority we immediately arranged for the very same amount and repaid it he has a habit of helping financially and then showing his son his kindness may allah azza forgive us what do you have to say about this his insult caused us a lot of pain I don't know those circumstances maybe he gave you the money for a month or two and you guys took a whole year to repay and after so many times he waited he had no other choice but to say these abusive things which is part of his right because the Prophet said that he has taught us a motto Lunar New Year yo hello allahu al pavetta the delay in payment of a rich man of a loan that he has would justify his punishment and for the one who gave him the money as alone to go and slander him and to talk ill about him not paying on time so this is an authentic hadith but maybe our most likely you guys were not giving given an ultimatum we're not giving a date to return it back if this is the case then he's definitely sinful and this is known as an men and it's mentioned in a number of ayahs in Surat al-baqarah at the very end illumiroom áliveá hyomezo akhaten yet by oh ha ha ha when you say something good oh Allah I apologize I wish I can help you I don't have money to contribute or to give you this is better than giving money and they say didn't I give you this in that last last week last month what did you do in return what did you do with the money I gave you however this is insult insulting and hurtful so he will be held a questionable and accountable for that on the day of judgement don't worry about it let it slide and know who you deal with in the future Sabrina says as it's recommended to create in congregations so we won't pray read salat this time if we're locked inside the home correct Amer Han Han says I know this might hurt you but it's good for you to take this advice which will be better for you have no fear of your creator the mighty and powerful maybe he means don't you have fear you have no fear that you will meet and stand before your sustainer the Almighty and merciful don't fool Muslims and tell them who you really are an iguana snake agent of corrupted and moderate Institute stopped receiving he means deceiving innocent ignorant Muslims well lie eyes I feel so sad for these people long ago when I started on Twitter I used to get attacked by two people the super selfies who hate anything that does not fall in line with their own man hatch so if you don't praise their ulema number one Samaha number two and a bill at the shift number three four five their five scholars if you don't praise them if you don't stand up whenever their names are mentioned then you are an away knee you are a hiss B you are this or that so they used to slander me for so many years with this and I used to reply to them yeah in my capacity the other party all other people are the nicest those who claim to be Mujahideen who are actually camouflaged terrorists and I used to call them the night the keyboard nights with a cape because they don't dare show their faces and they contribute to tarnishing the reputation of Islam by endorsing terrorism blowing up people listen that so subhanAllah both parties agreed on attacking me and Who am I what am i I'm a no one I'm just an old man from Saudi Arabia nobody even knows about me and I don't have any power no position no authority nothing I just give talks so I don't have any influence over them but with the grace of Allah I think a larger blessed me with having words like knives that cuts them off into small pieces so they used to be hurt whenever I speak I don't know why now adding to them even the wrath of God from here and there are also hating me so I'm I'm a hated person I'm Dylan love and the guy says I'm Anna Hawaii snake so I praise Allah Azza WA JAL for never being associated with the heroine and I have no affiliation with them I've never said anything good about them or anything bad because we have to be fair when we speak and we have to fear allah azzawajal so and then he says an agent of corrupted and moderate institute and with the grace of Allah never ever had any affiliation to a modern Institute not even given one single course and I have clear stance against a number of the instructors of Al Maghrib though I have a number a good relationship and friendship with other instructors but some instructors of Al Maghrib are clearly out of the way of the straight path and I've stood against them in its public and it's some of them it was mentioned and and broadcasted in peace TV in group discussions that I clearly made a point that this is not Islam these guys are preaching so circle a hair armor hand by but if you ever have the balls if you have her have the guts to come and meet me face to face I'm a very peaceful person I'm not a violent person I won't beat you up to the ground though I can physically with the grace of Allah so each other but I urge you to have the time and come and meet me in Jeddah I don't have guards I don't have spies with me I don't have special forces protecting me if you have the guts if you're man enough to come and say this to my face and show me what proves to the world that I'm a whiny snake or I'm affiliated with the corrupted and mother and Institute that would be really great from your side other than that keyboard Knights hide behind their screens they can be CIA they can be KGB they can be any kafir pretending to have a Muslim name trying to disunite the Muslims with what they do I have no problem with such people may Allah guide them all Shabana says can women lead her husband a woman lead her husband Intel we pray are standing behind him no of course this is not how can a man be standing at the at the back a woman can not at all even if they were perfect in reciting the Fatiha or thesaurus they cannot lead men not their fathers not the sons not their husbands if the man does not beside the Fatiha properly don't pray with him or at least teach him how to recite it pray on your own Sabrina's sanema says how do I determine when a child is going through puberty a male child has three signs one reaching the age of fifteen to one of these signs not all of them so if not he can ejaculate semen so a child of 12 or 13 he gets a nocturnal emission a wet dream this is a sign of his puberty 3 growing the harsh rough hair all over the pubic area these three signs for both boys and girls and girls have 1/4 sine which is monthly cycle and finally our last question of today number 40 and the other says if I lend people money do I have to pace the cat on that money this depends on the pattern the money is mine whether it's in the back under the mattress or I lend it to someone if I lend you money let's say ten thousand dollars my wealth has a particular day in the year let's assume it's the first of ramadan so when the first ramadan comes I have to call you I'm the harder the $10,000 I given you as a loan I need it back please if you say well I I don't have money at the moment it's it's difficult times with the lockdown and so and so so give me some time I think no problem I give you some time I don't have to pay the cash on the first of all Madonn because I'm unable to retrieve my money so every few months I check on you the second Ramadan comes Abdul Kadir said well I don't have money and it goes on for 10 years without him repaying my money I don't give zakat any of these years after 10 years he says here's your $10,000 cycle ahead for waiting I give to 2.5% which is $250 zakat for the whole duration but if I gave up the other $10,000 and when it is time for my zakat my wife says call him and asking for the money said well I'm too too embarrassed if he had it he would have given it back I'm shy of asking him in this case every single ear I have to give from my own pocket 250 dollars there's a cat money for that and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best so inshallah we've consumed an hour and seven minutes discussing 40 of your questions tomorrow is Thursday and we're supposed to begin with the marriage issue in our book but I think that I may deserve a holiday so we'll call it off tomorrow and Monday which is the second day or the first second deal of rate and we will resume next Thursday so a week from tomorrow we will resume our classes with Milazzo gel and we hope we have a good start and I pray to Allah that we start our classes after that lockdown has been uplifted and everything went back to normal may allah azzawajal benefit us from what we have said and of what we have heard and that allah makes it all sincere for his sake how double love item when it's better in meaning he sallallahu Salam o barik ala nabina muhammad was salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
