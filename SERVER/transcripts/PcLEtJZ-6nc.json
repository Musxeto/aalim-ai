  "transcript": "the question is I live in a western country and I don't have any family relatives with me I was looking to find a wife or get married however there's a lot of cultural cultural barriers here so I was wondering if using Muslim apps or websites to meet a potential spouse is a permissible although I saw one of your videos mentioning that it is not a permissible to upload photos or photographs however some women do I was wondering if that is still permissible otherwise if it's not um what would be the best ways to or steps to take to meet someone the issue of getting married is a very sensitive issue you cannot just pick any uh random woman who claims to be hijabi or a nekabi and committed to Islam and you buy whatever she's selling so websites that post photos of women are on Islamic and unfortunately I've heard this and and they say that this is prevailing in the West that they conduct like a workshop where women would sit on one side of the table and men would sit on the other side of the table and they meet and chit chat for like 15 20 minutes and then they change places with another man and what is this a blind date or this is totally unislamic and they conduct this in the message they say and it's all supervised this is all Haram and some of them conferences annual conferences where they get men and women sitting together and when you talk to the organizers they say oh doctor so-and-so approved the checks on so said it's okay and they're free mixing what are you doing is this really they have to see one another how are they going to get married how they how are they going to know one another okay take it for a test drive as well why don't you take her for a date a blind date maybe just have a dinner and my place or yours this is not Islam what are you doing you're not related to Islam you're so uh watering down your beliefs and religion you're not related to Quran and Sunnah anymore that's why this is not Islam that you're practicing or preaching or calling people to this is a new religion might as well get a woman to lead you for prayer and maybe get someone who's in an atheist or a Christian to give you a Friday sermon shifted to Thursday it's more convenient Friday we have a football match what is this so these places and websites stay away from them posting your picture as a man is no problem a woman posting her picture she is not a house she's not a wife material just don't go there you can approach the Imam of the Masjid if the Masjid is a message upon and follow the Hadith and the Quran you can go to them and try to portray your case to the Imam he may know people that share the same values and he will match make insha Allah you can go to websites that don't post women's photos and don't give you direct contact with the woman but rather with her guardian so you see different portfolios and CVS and maybe you'll find something you like you contact her brother or father and start pitching then and may Allah make things easy for you"
