  "transcript": "another a question regarding regarding taking psych uh psycho stimulants so if I take it's a weird question if I take medication for my ADHD would that lessen my why not like increasing my faith and doing more to like better my mental on my own this is not a easy question to answer because this depends entirely on your mental state and your medical requirements and needs some people unfortunately don't require such medications but due to the fact that a lot of the psychiatrists tend in the West in non-muslim countries due to their education due to their disbelief in Allah tend to prescribe such medications even when people don't actually need them because according to what they've studied everybody needs them and they to them nine out of 10 have some sort of a mental illness and they need therapy and they need to go to a shrink and they need to have antidepressants and the whole nine yards this is their business now I'm not doubting their credibility I'm just doubting whether this is needed or not when you say that one out of four are autistic this is not possible anything can be uh autistic anything can be a mental illness so people nowadays are addicted to such drugs and anti-depressants and going to the psychiatrist to fix something they think is busted when it's not busted so I cannot tell you what is possible or not before being diagnosed before we speak to you before we know exactly what kind of mental illness you have is it something related to Whispers to OCD that can be cured in few minutes sometimes just you need someone to talk to you and to open your eyes and to show you how Satan is messing up with your head and 95 98% alhamdulillah it's Al resolved and solved sometimes no there is a mental illness that requires attention and this is why we advise people to go to a Muslim a practicing Muslim psychiatrist who fears Allah knows Islam and can diagnose you correctly"
