  "transcript": "says a woman who's her husband is a hanafi and she follows hadith and her husband wants her son to study hanafi like him what would the wife do it is essential to know that there are pros and cons in every conflict and we have to weigh the pros and cons if by hanafi you mean that his ashari mataridi has a wrong concept of akida and serious errors in his beliefs of allah and he wants to teach that to the child you should oppose this and you should stand firm not allowing this but if he is a hanafi in the sense of a school of thought his akida is like allah azzawajal is above everything is above his throne allah azzawajal does not need his throne allah azza is not incubated or occupied by any of his creations subhana wa ta'ala that allah has all the beautiful attributes that we know of he believes all of this but he wants his son to study the hanafi putting the hands be below the navel not raising the hands uh for doing sujood sahu in a specific format uh having number of tech beer for a different than ours etc this is a trivial issue there's no problem in that let's let the the child study hanafi and you on your own can teach him the essence of hadith and how do we follow the quran and the authentic sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations and tell him that there are many schools of thought and they don't necessarily follow the this methodology due to their own preferences not because they are wrong or they are this or that but they didn't have the hadith etc you expand his horizons by teaching him bit by bit but when it comes to aqir no there is no compromise in akita there's no black there's only black or white there's no grey area arcade is a clear thing it has to follow and comply with the akhida of the prophet sam and his companions may allah be pleased with him so i hope this answers your question and any wise woman would use diplomacy would use her wits to not only solve such a conflict but rather to draw her husband to the way of the seraph aisha from"
