  "transcript": "from Pakistan he says that if I'm traveling for Imran and Ramadan is it permissible for me to not fast the answer is yes as long as you are travelling so you come in from Pakistan to Mecca this is traveling and you're staying there for a week or two and you would like to make ombres and it would be difficult for you and you have the permission from Allah not to fast answers yes you can skip the fasting and make it up later on is it advisable this depends on your condition I would not personally do it because fasting in Ramadan nothing is equivalent to it even fasting or making it up afterwards and fasting with the Muslims and breaking your fast in the Masjid with the Muslims and having this whole thing going on for you nothing beats that but if you feel tired if you feel weak and you would not be able to make your Ambra there's nothing wrong in skipping your fasting"
