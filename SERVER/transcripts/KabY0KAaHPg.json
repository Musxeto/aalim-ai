  "transcript": "a brother says chef is there any Rukia or advise against Swiss wasps he performs for dorsal and it takes him 45 minutes and photo takes him about five minutes while if it is a normal Russel it takes him 12 minutes and the wood oh honey he is spending so much time because he believes that he has to pour water over all parts three times in both hustle and boodle and he rubs them all many times and he is fed up with all of this so he's asking what to do well these whispers of Shaitaan and sometimes they are OCD obsessive compulsive disorder so a person turns to be an OCD patient because of the lack of knowledge knowledge evaporates all your doubts and whispers of Shaitaan if you have the proper knowledge those who have with wasps and I get tens of calls a day from such people if they acquire proper knowledge they will be in a better place but they fail or they don't want to making whistle for those in 45 minutes how many liters are you wasting my friend how much water is being thrown and wasted down the drain making woudl in five minutes if you knew the Sunna of the Prophet Elisha la tercera you would not have done this the amount of water used in performing ablution or woudl by the Prophet Elisha was approximately 700 milliliters give or take so approximately 3/4 of a liter you're talking about this amount of water huh about if you had knowledge then you would have noticed that turning on the tap and just washing and washing and washing that this is not from the Sunnah and that you are sinful for doing this the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to perform whistle by washing his hair and his entire body with water with asar and this is less than 3 liters of water you're using tons of water my friend so there is no way for you to reduce the amount of wash wash except by knowledge and to acknowledge that what you're doing is wrong not only that but sinful as well so you have to time yourself no one said that you have to rub rubbing is not essential for woudl or for Russell as long as the water has passed this is sufficient if you put little of water in your hand and you do this this does the job it's been washed you don't have to pour water and watch it fall and waste liters after liters so you have to acquire knowledge if you want to recite Rokia and there is no problem in that recite the fatty had three times to five times blowing on water after each time ayatul kursi same number the last two ayahs of surat al-baqara same number of times three to five and the last three pulls the glass phallic and the NASS and you drink from that water insha'Allah you'll be as good as new we"
