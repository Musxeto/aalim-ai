  "transcript": "sh my question is I do boxing and learn to fight for the for the sake of so that I can defend myself and be able to defend my future wife and family in but sometimes in training we do sparing which involves eating each other in the face if we use face protection like a helmet it is feel like in the face what it is not permissible to strike the face even if there's a face guard or a protection gear and you're wearing gloves again hitting or striking the face is totally prohibited you can pick up this sports or the MMA without doing anything Haram so striking the face is totally prohibited and Haram you may do whatever you want to do you may think whatever you want to think but this is backed up by authentic hadiths and the prohibition is not from me it's from the prophet himself so you suit yourself if it is a means of Defending your family your wife yourself alhamdulillah there are so many means of doing this you can pick up Judo you can pick uh different forms of martial arts but without with avoiding the face you can uh pick harness these two sticks very beautifully very effic efficient and effective or you can pick a Glock 9 mm that's even the least of your worries you don't have to shower every day after working out and it's very effective and safe and Allah Knows Best"
