  "title": "What is the first hour of Friday for getting reward of sacrificing a Camel? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is AR actually okay aric what can I do for you so there's aith that says that Prophet said that whoever goes in the first hour of Friday gets the reward of sacrificing a camel whoever goes in the second hour gets the reward of sacrificing a cow and the goes on in this Hadith sh what's the meaning of first hour or second hour or how do I determine that this this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion is that we divide the time between sunrise where we're allowed to pray Al is prayers or the DHA prayer starts which is approximately uh 15 minutes 10 to 15 minutes after Sunrise so from this time till the time of noon let's assume that there are five hours then each hour is designated for that Hadith if there are only four hours then you divide it by five if there are seven hours you divide it by five and you get the period of time mentioned and this was uh mentioned if I'm not mistaken in by may Allah have mercy on him where he said that these are called so this is one methodology of estimating it and Allah Knows Best"
