  "transcript": "she says that her mom says that her grandmother meaning her mother mother's mother usually has a bad habit of looking at the moon so if it's a rising moon she goes ahead with whatever she's doing and if it's a falling moon she refrains whether it's traveling whether it's going shopping whether it is to begin a project or a business transaction and this is totally prohibited a major sin and may mount to shirk because you're seeking guidance from other than allah it's like what the idol worshipers used to do they used to draw the lots so they had three arrows one of them had go the other one said don't go the third one said blank so they put it and they choose one if it says go they proceed with their endeavor if it says no they cancel it and if it's blank they repeat it again this is part of the major sins and part of the shirt that they used to do"
