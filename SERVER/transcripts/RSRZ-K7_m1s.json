  "transcript": "and um I I was like I wanted to make my presentation a simple but for the sake of clear understanding I'll pick it from where the person ask the person ask that someone is owing him and he has laid the depth off from his heart later on if the person return the money back can he take the money and then you explain further by saying that even if you make a promise to someone as a Muslim you are not obliged to fulfill that promise now the question is if it is so then what is the Hadith which St thatl I don't know how they authentic this had is so Muslim if you make a promise are you not obliged to fulfill that promise this what I want to know the Hadith you're referring to is and this has nothing to do with a promise this has to do with conditions in transaction or in marriages so when a person marries a woman and she stipulates a condition that he does not um take her to another city and somewhere down the line he changes his mind and he wants to go to another city we use this Hadith he said you cannot do this the prophet said that Muslims abide by their conditions and honor them as for a promise A promise is something that a Muslim is recommended to fulfill but it's a gesture of kindness and um helping a brother so if someone is getting married and I say I promise you that I'll give give you a refrigerator for your house and the guy gets married and then he comes and claims his gift and I say to him I don't have money or I changed my mind or I had some other beneficial use for the money so uh I'm sorry I'm not going to give you a gift he cannot take me to court while the wife can take her husband to court and say no I'm not relocating this is the condition this is my marriage contract I have all the right to go for divorce but the other brother cannot take me to court and said he promised me the judge would say yeah and he he went back in his promise there's nothing we can do about this and Allah knows best um"
