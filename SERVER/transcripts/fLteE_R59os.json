  "transcript": "foreign and I found out who will need it more in my country um I discovered that my mother's family who could make use of the money so I didn't know a lot of them but I found that I got numbers and things like that and I gave money to about six of them and then after I transferred the money to them and because I didn't really have any relationship with them so I called them and then one of them told me that she's not a Muslim even though I mean it's a planet name and I I thought you know almost and because you were born Muslim so she said I married this was saying that I'm a Christian now and one of them said I converted to a Christian but now um I don't go to church anymore but um I find it hard to pray but I don't go to church anymore and the third person told me uh she he just said that Jesus anytime we're talking so different but he said I'm a Muslim so do I need to give Saka again or what and the rest of them are Muslims so what do I need to do with the money that I already gave to them the money that has been already allocated and given to a non-muslim is considered a charity but it cannot be calculated from the zakat money so if you have a thousand dollars to pay in zakat and you gave these Christians or non-muslims uh uh two hundred dollars this is Charity you'll be rewarded for that but you still have to give two hundred dollars again to needy Muslims those say they are Muslims and we don't have any reason to doubt that we can take their word for it because you called me Amina and you said how did I know you're a Muslim you said salaam alaikum and your name is Amina and I'm thinking that you're calling this program because you're you're a Muslim so I have no reason to doubt that you may be a hypocrite or Pretender or a wannabe Muslim and instead I should have said hi said howdy no there's there's no reason to say any of this so likewise your relatives whom you think they are Muslims by default and you have no reason to suspect this you can give them there's a cat without any problem"
