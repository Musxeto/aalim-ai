  "transcript": "so my brother heard that I shouldn't acknowledge and said that when you're in Silence of God and you must hear your voice for your prayer to development and the evidence he presented mentioned of the Quran namely the Hadith by the prophet salallahu said and if something doesn't have a sound or an audible noise then I wouldn't meet the Arabic definition of what is considered collab that it is therefore so was what that student acknowledge said true no it's not true it's totally not true and unfortunately when people like this person come and make a bold statement and confuses the masses so to depend only on a particular Hadith of the linguistic meaning of a word to claim that it has to be with a sound this is totally not true what if a person who cannot speak someone who has no ability to have vocal cords or speak so when he recites the Quran and he doesn't make a sound is it his recitation valid what about the Hadith where the Prophet said your tongue should remain moist with remembering Allah so the tongue just moves without making a sound what about the tabirin when they ask the prophet the companions did the prophet Allah used to recite the Quran in silent rakas the companion said yes the tabiron said how do you know it's silent they didn't say we used to hear his whispering they said we used to see the trembling of his beard from behind his back meaning those standing behind his back would see his jaw moving and the trembling of his beard which indicated that he used to recite but they did not hear a sound and this is why it's called Silent prayer so no you don't have to make a sound is it permissible to make a sound so that only you can hear yourself that's highly recommended that's fine but you can't just walk in and say no your prayer is invalid even if you move your lips and tongue without making a sound it's invalid this is totally bogus"
