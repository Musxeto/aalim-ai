  "title": "Is editing the CV to make it appear like I've skills for the job, cheating? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh yes sh uh the question I had was uh I'm applying for jobs uh now and uh the trend I've seen is uh when we apply for jobs uh we have to edit our CV to suit that job so if it is minor corrections I think uh it is fine uh what what happened to me recently is that uh my friend was telling that uh you have to edit your CV uh to make it look like you have experience uh of the field which you don't have and he said this is just to get the interview since the CV is nowadays tracked automatically for keywords and all that um my question is uh is this considered like cheating what do you think what do you think U my instinct yes I think it's alhamdulillah you are upon nature and your heart is still pure and clean and following Islam because this is what any true Muslim would feel how would I write in my experience that I am uh fluent in French and German and in in uh other languages that I know how to use Excel which I definitely don't know how to use and that I am good in accounting and I'm good in uh forecasting the plans of 10 years and I've never done this in my whole life and then when they ask me through the interview mashallah so how to sum up a table in Excel how to do that reach me I just tell the secretary and he does it okay what about the forecast for five next five years what about the sales how do you make that plan I don't know I probably Google it this is not acceptable a Muslim does not lie the risk is in the hands of Allah be truthful say the truth beautify it but without lying and cheating and Trust Allah he will grant you the risk that you want inshallah"
