  "transcript": "can a man remove hair that grows on a mole that he has on his face or is it part of the beard well sad I think you've answered yourself it depends where the mole is so if a person has a mole outside the boundaries of the beard area if he has a mole on his underneath his eye on his forehead on his neck he can remove any hair that grows on that but if the mole is in the beard area itself then the hair would be considered part of the beard and he must not remove that"
