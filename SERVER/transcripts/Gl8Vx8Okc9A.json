  "transcript": "my question is regarding Islamic mortgage so to speak so there is a organization here in Canada that uh provides such mortgage loans um so after uh speaking with them doing research with them and I found out that uh the profit rate that they have is fixed and also the end amount the final amount is fixed however I have a like there is a you know contract that I must sign before they purchase the house because they said you know they don't want to give you know good loans out on good F so if they for example if they buy a house for 500,000 and I back out and they lose 10,000 when they try to resell it then I have to cover the 10,000 so uh no no no no this is totally prohibited as advance a little while ago in the question of brother um someone from India I I forgot I think the bank when they say that it's an Islamic mortgage if they negotiate with you over a property that they do not possess and you signed agreements committing yourself to buying it and they don't possess it yet this is totally Haram this is from their part selling what they do not possess and the prophet Sall wasallam prohibited this as per the theith ofam I personally ask and may Allah have mercy on them on this particular subject and both of them said that this is totally prohibited the bank has to take the risk how would it be selling and buying because actually if they take a guaranteed from you that you'll buy it and you'll commit and you will cover their losses if you back off this is actually not selling this is actually lending you the cash money and you taking this 500,000 you buy with it whatever you want a car a property a go to Vegas and have fun and come back and all what their interested is that they get their interest the 200,000 extra on top of that this is riba the actual selling is a transaction that involves risk I bought this mug for an x amount of money B now I'm going down to the market guys who will buy this mug from me $10 $10 nobody's buying it 9.5 nobody 98 s my capital is $6 I'll go to $6 nobody's buying it $5 okay I found a seller a buyer I'll sell it to him I lost a dollar so there is a problem this is selling and buying I could have sold it for $15 oh alhamdulillah I made the profits of $9 woo so this is selling and buying this is the beauty of Islamic transactions because this is a Halal risk it's calculated but what but when it's money versus money 500,000 I don't care what you do with it give me 700,000 and I'm fine this is clearcut RBA so this transaction you told me about is not valid"
