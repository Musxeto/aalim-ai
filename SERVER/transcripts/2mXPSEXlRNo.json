  "transcript": "ald I left my hotel room at 7:00 a.m. this morning and just arrived after 4H hour flight from Calgary I think and stayed for less than an hour refreshing in the hotel and came straight to an event so if I fall asleep Midway yeah do pardon my age and and my hardship traveling from one place to the other but what may keep the sleep away is this beautiful sight which Allah may not be seen in some of the Muslim countries let alone to be seen here in Canada anyhow um I as usual I'm I'm asked to speak about a topic and I don't usually prepare for these topics I just pick something from the old archive with the grace of Allah nobody remembers so even if I spoke about yesterday topic um the topic is each and every one of us is seeking the comfort of his mind seeking happiness even if this costs him everything he owns everything we do in this life is to attain What happiness we were work we study we get married we try to have a good time looking for what looking for Happiness and happiness is Allah's Paradise on Earth the big Paradise in the Hereafter we know but on Earth you are looking for happiness which is Allah's Paradise this is a common denominator that every Muslim and CA is looking for every rich and poor is looking for for every educated intellectual and ignorant imbecile Layman is looking for everyone strives to allocate where to find this happiness and attain it now no one on earth wants to be miserable willingly no one on earth wants to be depressed willingly however if you lose the route to happiness inevitably you're going to be what depressed miserable and sad on the day of judgment Allah divided Humanity into two types Allah says the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be The Wretched and the prosperous or the happy and in bukari and Muslim when the angel comes to the fetus that had reached 120 days in its mother's womb this is when the soul would be breathed in 120 days before that there's no Soul it's not a human being so the angel asks oh Allah wretched or happy sh I'm and no doubt the ultimate goal of happiness is to enter Paradise at the end of the day how long you going to live on Earth 80 years 90 years 950 years as no peace be upon him then what than death inevitably you're going to die but on the day of judgment it's eternity it's not counted by years or gazillions of years it's a NeverEnding everlasting life so the actual winners are those who are distant from Hell Fire and admitted to he is the winner the ultimate winner who enters J may Allah make you and I among those who enter Jenna so who is actually happy in this life in this world you see happiness is something that's relative because to a poor broke individual happiness is to have a filthy wealthy bank account is to live in mansions and to have fancy cars to that poor individual this is the definition of Happiness a heedless nerd would think that happiness is to live the life of a Playboy having girls and partying and women iing that is a happy individual to someone who's sick and Ill his definition of happiness is Health to be strong to be able to live without medication or the help and assistance of others to walk from one place to the other so whenever he sees someone with health coming out from his face he's a happy individual and to the vast majority of us happiness is Authority is power is Reign this is what makes a person happy actually none of this is true happiness this is limited happiness that has an impact and an effect for a specific period of time but it has its price Hefty heavy price and it is never lasting the moment the impact the effect goes depression sadness and misery come and you have to do it over and over and over again the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam pointed out pointed to us such limited happiness when he said there are four things that are considered to be part of Happiness temporary happiness on Earth number one a righteous good woman in English they say a good wife is a good life and I totally agree W if you're the richest man on earth and you are the healthiest man on Earth and you are the most influential man on Earth and you have a nagging wife you live in in misery but if you're poor and if you are sick and if you're not known to anyone but you have a good wife wah you're a king you have the whole world in your hand just when you have a righteous loving caring wife and the same goes for a wife who has a loving caring righteous man so the prophet says number one a righteous woman number two a spacious house sometimes you go and visit some Muslims and they live in a very tiny room and this gives you depression whenever you have a spacious house makes you happy as the prophet said a good neighbor number three when you have a Good Neighbor Next Door sending you food taking care of your lawn you don't have lawn in here you have i s yeah he you get the the point and trying to take care of your kids and advise them and be nice to them this is heaven on Earth and number four a comfortable ride a comfortable Mount when you have a reliable car preferably Toyota this is the excellent thing six 10 years Problem free rather than every five or six days you go to the garage to fix something here or there this is is problematic so this type of limited happiness happens if you have these four issues that the prophet mentioned and likewise temporary happiness happens or limited happiness happens when you indulge in Sin is Sin means of Happiness yes or no yes it's a means of limited happiness everybody likes to watch a beautiful movie you enjoy every moment of an hour and a half of a good movie lots of actions lots of shooting lots of um things that you like to watch what happens when the movie is over you become depressed sisters call me Sheikh I have a problem my son watches six movies a day when he's watching the first movie he's so happy he's so joyful the Moment the movie is over he's depressed and he says to mean in Arabic it means I'm bored so he puts another movie now he's off my case the moment it's over it's again it's the same thing when you smoke a joint is laughing what did I do okay when you smoke a Jo a joint you feel high you feel happy and you keep on laughing like the brothers just give them Doritos they're fine but the moment they impact or the effect goes they're depressed so they have to fix it with don't tell me it's time start no I have timers of time now look what we did we stopped the sh it's really bad the the and the K blocking people they want to leave people they want to leave it might be emergency move your car right now it's really bad to stop the no no it's not bad to stop me don't don't don't worry about don't care about the other people you don't want to go to jna do you the prophet s said how would you feel if you went into into the bank and I know this I'm from Arabia double parking and triple parking and whatever is the norm you go and do your errands in the bank you come out you find someone blocking you you wait w for half an hour I wait in my car for half an hour the man comes rides in his car and doesn't even say I'm sorry and sometimes they Sayes what do you mean I'm your servant I've been waiting for this precious time of my life just and some people have the audacity to say especially if they're double parking like outside for the Masid I was praying Subhan Allah you pray and I pay the the price don't pray go seriously don't pray if your prayer is going to drag harm upon others W if there was a police car outside giving you a fine of $300 you would never dare do this but whenever you are safe from repr punishment then you would misbehave fear Allah you are Muslims you under the spotlight everybody's judging you if you do something they won't say ohim did so and so they would say look at Islam he's a representative of Islam any cafir coming outside seeing a double parking look at the Muslims they're not organized that's why they fled their countries and came to our country and they want to make this country like their country come on fear Allah be the best representative of this umah so that the prophet would be proud with you on the day of judgment so coming back to the Joint no let's move on if you drink intoxicants and you're wasted you feel happy the moment The Hangover is gone what will happen headache wanting to throw up in depression what to do hit it again take a double shot so this is what's happening and this is exactly what Allah described in the Quran listen to this Ayah and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life and we will gather him on the day of Resurrection and blind to punishment in this life you ignore remembering Allah you indulge in sin you will have a depressed life this depressed life is what every sinner has TMZ go and watch any uh Hollywood or um gossip Outlets you will find celebr happy enjoying red carpet the whole nine yards you think hm life is beautiful but you don't know how many of them die of overdosing how many of them go to therapy how many of them are addicted to proac an opioid for what depressed life so every time you indulge in sin this is what you're going to get and I guarantee you and I challenge anyone of you who would say well I'm living a beautiful life I commit sins and I do this and W I'm doing great I challenge anyone who can come and say this even one to one they'll Stone you to death don't do it in public but look at the good guys look at the prophet his house was so tiny that mother and the companions say that we could not stand up straight because of the low ceiling whenever the prophet prayed in mother's house she used to sleep in front of him so whenever he wanted to prostrate to make sujud there was no space so he would touch and poke her legs so she would join her legs away from him he makes suud when he stands up she goes back to sleep but how was their feeding mother AA used to say we used to see the Crescent after the Crescent after the Cresent two months without food being cooked in their home without fire being lit for two months and what was your food mother she said water and dates for two months and this is the prophet can you live on like this for one week for one day where is the omelet where is the rice where is the beef where is this where is that you can't yet if you search you will find that all the messengers of Allah lived such a life n and lot peace be upon them their wives were cfir no's son died in the flood and was drowned look at a he was afflicted by an illness for eight years 18 and he's a prophet one of us gets Corona virus for a week Ya Allah what have I done why is this why is that get a a blister in his his finger he says I can't play tennis why me we have a tournament next week and 18 years he was afflicted by this illness yet he never complained and all of those were the happiest individuals on Earth how can you be happy when you don't have food when you live in a small house because they had content in their hearts they were pleased with whatever Allah pre-ordained upon them they're happy with whatever Allah puts the happiness my friends is not found in movies in concerts in music in a joint in a sniff of crack or meth or cocaine is not found in a shot of a tequila or a screwdriver or whatever you call them it's not found in relationships illicit Haram relationships a black book or a a blue book where you have names and numbers and mashallah you're very happy this is not the way of happiness happiness is not attained by collecting money gaining money from mortgages so many Muslims come to this country they buy a house in mortgage they finish it or they buy two and they rent it and they buy three and four and 10 and their relatives come mashallah brother so and so he's very lucky he's very fortunate he has 10 properties he's living off the rent all of these were from Haram RBA yes but he's mallah very rich Subhan Allah they will never ever taste the beauty and the sweetness of IM because real happiness is in authentic AA that is cemented by Good Deeds that follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat didn't the prophet sayat wasam he will taste the sweetness of Iman when you are satisfied with Allah to be your lord satisfied with Islam to be your religion satisfied with Muhammad s wasam to be your messenger you will find the sweetness of IM if you find this content and pleasure of acceptance but if you look at the vast majority of Muslims and you'll find them on social media doing what Instagram Snapchat following YouTube following Facebook oh this uh uh singer oh this actor oh this celebrity oh this uh influencer and they think that this is happiness Allah addressed his messenger he said to him and let not their wealth and their children impress you Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart at death while they are disbelievers the vast majority of us don't look at Scholars of Islam say I wish I could be like binas I wish I could be like me hell no I don't want to be like them they're poor they don't have money yeah but they have knowledge who cares of knowledge I want to drive a 911s with launch control this is the car I want to drive I don't want to be like these guys so this is exactly what the people of Musa said when they saw they said to themselves those who desired the worldly life said oh we wish we had like what was given to indeed he's one of great fortune tell me where is Kar where is he he's dead he's not even 6 feet under he's like few hundred feet under because Allah made the whole earth swallow him and his Entourage where is the Reign and the kingdom of of pharaoh who had the whole of Egypt where is AD where is samud where are all the rich and influential people where are all the hours you spent trying to build up an illicit Haram relationship who knows maybe you got lucky maybe you get late huh you've spent so much time and what happened it's all gone down the drain what remained sins that await you in your grave and punishment that awaits you in Hellfire on the day of judgment so what is happiness then this is what we all have to be aware of Salat is your most important aspect of Happiness what did the prophet say my satisfaction was placed in Salat whenever I'm sad or depressed or at yeah wor I go and pray what is the prayer in our calculations and priority list the last thing on the list even du even imams of Masjid even those who consider themselves practicing they have a priority list always Salat is at the bottom so prayers revolve around our work our habits our Hobbies our desires and this is not the way of the Muslim it's the other way around our habits our desires our work our families must revolve around Salat Salat comes first but unfortunately we work from 9: to 5: 2 hours to come to work 2 hours to leave work so we are in this Vicious Circle trying to make a buck trying to pay the rent trying to get a bigger screen for our TV uh uh Monitor and to have luxury in our lives thinking that this is the way of happiness and this is not here in this dun you are only here for a purpose and that is to be tested will you worship Allah or worship your whims and desires you are in a test nobody cares about you don't be fooled no one cares about you you go to the Masjid you pray Allah is not going to benefit from this it's for you you don't come to the Masjid you don't pray who cares everyone else will go to bed at 10:00 and sleep and wake up in the following morning not thinking of you it's you who's going to pay and this is why if you want happiness look for it in the Quran and in the Sunnah and in being a servant of Allah W if you look for happiness anywhere else you will never find it IM Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul was asked when would a man like me taste the sweetness of rest and comfort when will we find an easy life he said when you put your first foot in J when you put your first foot in Jenna that's it game over you will find the taste and the beauty of happiness that has no end before that you don't guarantee a thing if you don't put and place your foot in Jenna you may slip you may trip you may end up in Hell Fire 25 minutes alhamdulillah okay Q just before we start the Q&A we're going to there's a car blocking one of the brothers to leave I'm going to get my baseball bat and I'm going personally wait for the brother to out seriously this is maybe it's speaking Arabic he doesn't speak English I'll do both inshah right now and I'll do maybe another language Spanish or something but it's a Corolla uh license plate Cy D A1 123 it's white keep an eyes on the door maybe we'll see him sniper so please if you are the owner of this car inah we forgive you but somebody has to leave so don't be shyed you can go now don't look questions I don't read okay okay sure the question is is it smart to pray for a certain person to be your spouse or rather leave your Dua General and just pray for the God-fearing righteous St out of experience it's stupid to make Dua for a specific person and wait 6 seven years while this person has already got married and has three kids and thinking of a second wife he is not the last individual last man on earth move on don't be fixated on a specific individual making Dua thinking that he will look at you because this is one of the traps of shatan because he doesn't know of you so you make Dua for 6 months and you feel that Allah is accepting my Dua maybe I have to yeah go the extra mile maybe text him maybe throw him my number maybe you stalk him on his Instagram page I don't know so this is where Shan starts little by little introducing you to Haram no keep your distance make your Dua that Allah sends you someone who fears him and someone who Allah loves it would be much better for you and Allah knows best another question how does one keep themselves busy consistently with good and in the process stay away from sin this requires a change in lifestyle you have to audit your lifestyle your daily routine your weekends your Ledger time and you will find that there are so many loopholes where Shan penetrates and infiltrates your daily routine so that he would have a chunk of it for him and this is what's happening with all Muslims they may come to the Masjid they may do good deeds they may may do some but during the day or the night they have to have a chunk foran where they spend an hour maybe two doing Haram and nobody's watching except Allah and this is unfortunate so you have to audit your daily routine how many good companions do you have in your contact list how much time do you hang out with practicing Muslims how much time do you have in your system that I have to utilize my time if it's not in seeking knowledge memorizing the Quran learning doing something that's beneficial maybe going to an Islamic gym where there's no uh uh mixing of of the genders yeah sometimes you go to the gym and find someone big beard and the sister is in a sports bra what's happening sh you you know I'm lowering my gaze indeed you're lowering my gaze Can you spot me please definitely this is a nogo you're a practicing Muslim you cannot be in such a place it's Haram well have to work out well if you work out here you're going to work out in a very bad place in in in hell because you're sinning and you're doing something Haram no occupy yourself with something that's Halal do something that is halal not necessarily seeking knowledge something that's refreshing go shoot some hoops Hoops they call it yeah basketball do something Halal that's good but occupy yourself from being close to sin because Shan is waiting for you he'll drag your foot to little small sin two weeks later it's a little bigger couple of months later it's a lot a year later you're falling into major sins and the sad thing is that you're not feeling the deteriation that's happening in your life nobody's there next to you to say watch out you're in a dangerous Zone nobody's there to advise you and most likely you won't people you do not want people to advise you you are arrogant yeah don't judge me every time I speak to someone in America or in Canada so don't judge me you're the hell with you I'm going to judge you I don't care I'm from Saudi I'm an arrogant over 60 old man grumpy grandfather I'm going to judge you and judge your father as well if I see you do something wrong I'm going to judge you this is a defensive mechanism whenever someone gives you advice don't judge me I'm going to judge you so be careful because Allah is going to judge you you're going to be held accountable for everything you're doing so might as well get a good advice from someone who wants good for you doesn't have a hidden agenda doesn't want anything from you he tells a spade is Spade in your face so take it utilize it embrace it and get closer to Allah this is your only objective in life not to win an argument your objective is to go to Jenna and Allah knows rest the next question what is the best book to stud or books of to stud as well as good books there is isn't any such thing as the best she who's the best scholar in our times there is no ranking of the scholars okay we have the Billboards now for this week the best is number two on the list is with his latest hist we don't have this everyone has something in him every has something that stands out there isn't something that okay let's go into an MMA fight and see which sheh is stronger it's not like this likewise in books of when you talk about and you ask what's the best book in this means you don't know because what are we going to talk about this is a part of or are we going to take talk about the six pillars of Iman the belief in Allah the day of judgment Angels Messengers uh scriptures and the uh uh Divine decree or are we going to talk about this and that there are so many things it's it's a wide spectrum of Sciences and knowledges knowledge so the the question itself shows that you're not serious you want yeah fast food what's the biggest cheeseburger no hold the Mayo you don't do this you go and seek knowledge the best of all is the Quran without any doubt the then you learn the then you learn the books of whether of or depending on your level sometimes you have to start and this is what I always advise my uh uh friends with the first thing you should start with is the beautiful names of Allah before everything anything because you need to know who you're saying allahar and I always say this in my lectures if you ask people how many names does Allah have you say 99 Names mashallah masallah how many names do you memorize from them poers out so the best of them would say 1520 sh good for you how many of this 15 or 20 do you know that meaning of said whoops two or three everyone knows this Surah what's 99% of the Muslims said beats me yeah you recite it 20 times a day at least and you don't know what's a it's one of Allah's names I don't know I have no clue so we have a problem when you don't know Allah who you were worshiping and this is the the most important science in the world is the science of Allah's beautiful names and attributes because the importance of the science is related to the importance of what you're studying and you're studying the names of Allah so again I hope this answers your question the next question is more around Youth and marriage how do you approach a potential in University for marriage how do you approach potential uh brother or sister in University for marriage you don't this is called dating when you see a beautiful hij or in the University this girl is so cute so nice hij I love her for the sake of Allah you go and address her sis Mah I find that you are a very good hijabi and I'm interested in marrying you how about a a latte in Starbucks just to get to know one another fear Allah would you like someone to approach your sister your real sister sibling if she's aab like this no so if you see someone you like and you think that she's a potential uh um wife you call your mom or your sister to go and talk to her not you talking to her directly now it's even worse if the sister sees a brother and she says to him I think you're a practicing brother and I love you for the sake of Allah so well and I get this I get this frequently sisters come to me say sh W I love you for the sake of Allah don't you fear Allah what do you think I I I I come from uh I'm a transgender or you talking yeah this is unacceptable a woman who n goes to a man who's to her and says such things even if it's for the sake of Allah this is unacceptable it is totally Haram so to block means of Shan you find someone you like you talk to your Maham to speak to them so if you as a sister see a brother who's practicing his he's he's busy in the community mashallah and you think that he has good moral conduct and he fears Allah and he's looking you go to your brother or your father and tell them to speak to him and no one would Fe be feel ashamed and as a father if I see a potential brother who's good for my daughter I would speak to him if he accepts I'm a winner if he doesn't alhamdulillah one down two to go you never know and Allah knows Chef can you explain why Allah subhana tala has created us and allowed us to have free will when he has already destined everything Allah says in Allah is not questioned about what he does and they all of the creation are questioned no one can say why did Allah do this why Allah is doing that you are like a leave that fall falls from a tree and goes down and down and down and then lies on the ground only Allah knows the route it's going to take and where it's going to fall I was traveling from Calgary I think I don't know or ad well somewhere and I was passing over jungles and and forests and and I was you know mesmerized the h huge area so huge each and every single leaf Allah has its fate when it's going to fall how it's going to rotate in spiral where it's going to end up what's going to happen to it who's going to eat it how many insects under it how many bacteria the blood in the veins of the insects and the heartbeat of these trillions of insects every every single one is controlled by Allah how dare you ask why did Allah create us why did Allah test us why did Allah you have no authority to ask such questions you can complain you can um object but this is not going to help you the end result either Jenna or Hell Fire you choose you want to be among the people and the Dwellers of Jenna you have to submit your will to Allah accept whatever Allah pre-ordained obey Allah without any questions asked you'll end up in Jenna the moment you feel arrogant or don't judge me the moment you feel that I have a right to ask this is what Shan did you are one of his Advocates Satan was ordered prostrate to Adam said nope no can't do why he says I am better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay so it doesn't make any sense Allah is giving you a direct order and you're saying I'm not going to do it you know what had happened to him and what's his fate you don't want to share this fate submit your will to Allah and surrender it and do what you're told without any questions asked and Allah knows rest I believe this will be the final question question go we are blessed to have so many new converts to Islam or reers who stand here with us tonight what advice do you give them to help them prepare for the first Ramadan the difficulty is not in climbing mountains the difficulty is in maintaining the peak because Falling Down is very easy easy so to climb up this mountain and manage to accept Islam and leave everything you were born to do and leave your life behind you all of the things you like and love and your family and your friends for the sake of Allah that's a an achievement but what's more difficult is to maintain because lots of the those who are unfortunate May accept Islam and we're all happy in this mess allahar allahar and we give you hugs and kisses and the whole nine yards and after the prayer is over everyone goes to his home and you're left alone you go back to your room your roommate doesn't accept you maybe you had a partner and your partner doesn't accept you and your family wants you to come for Thanksgiving for uh uh Christmas to eat Haram drink Haram join them your sister has a boyfriend she wants you to go together to the nightclub and party and and all of this is Haram so you find yourself alone the Muslim community's role is to take care of this brother or this sister at least for 3 months hang out with them be with them give them the environment where their Iman is cemented and the foundation is set and now he can stand alone after 3 months without anyone he can go to any country now I'm strong in my IM but to accept Islam because of an impulsive decision and someone who gave him something that clicked in his mind and that's true that's reality and he accepts Islam and then everybody disappears this is very bad so my advice to the Muslim reverts AI look for any Muslims that you can hang on to and hang out with 24/7 even if they're not very strong in commitment but at least they drag you to the Masjid you'll break you're fasting with them in you'll maybe have meals you'll have few classes that would increase your knowledge and you would be in an Islamic environment this would strengthen your IM don't ever say to yourself I'm bored I'd like to have some uh quality time on my own no this is where Shan is going to kick in and this is what you do not want and we as Muslims anticipate the reward of having this brother becoming a practicing strong Muslim and W you will reap the fruits of such an achievement of three months for the rest of your life whatever he does goes into your credit he prays at night you're asleep you don't pray T he prays tud it goes into your credit suban Allah so many rewards that we just throw down the drain without anticipating and Allah knows best That's All She Wrote alhamdulillah for having me and apologize if I offended anyone who cares I'm going to judge you take this this who's this"
