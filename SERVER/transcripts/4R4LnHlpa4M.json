  "transcript": "there is a difference between a gift and what is needed as providing provision so a gift is when I come inid and I go to all of my children even to a one month old and the 20 years old one month old and 20 years old big difference in we give we give a gift so I give each one 1,000 R even the one month old this is a gift I have to be equal I come from travel I buy I once went to India to Dr Z and did some uh uh programs for his TV channel and he said you have to buy them gifts so I went to buy them garments traditional garments from from India I had to buy each and everyone exactly the same money not a rupe more it has to be the same to be equal this is gifts now when it comes to the elders goes to UNI and I have to give them money for the car for the fuel for the lunch and the youngest goes to kindergarten and I have to give them pocket money I give this one 100 and this when I give five this is not a gift one of them requires a surgery cost me 15,000 I pay the others don't come say hey he hey give us he said no no problem go and have a surgery I'll give you this is not a gift you see the difference so it's the same thing when you have two wives one has five kids she she lives in a villa the one doesn't have any kids she lives in an apartment of two bedrooms the one you give pocket money for groceries 5,000 the other one you give 500 because these are not gifts but if you're traveling and coming back and buying perfume bottles it has to be exactly to the real and if there is a difference I used to do this by the way it caused so many headaches I used to buy 300 real perfume bottle and 310 different type so I put 10 real and Stitch it to the bottle and I give it to them so this is the difference between gifts and provision and providing"
