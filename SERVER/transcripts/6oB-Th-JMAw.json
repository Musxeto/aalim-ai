  "transcript": "until we receive your first uh call there's a question from Tony he says that somebody from the his party has slandered and backbitten You by saying that you have said salaf differed in please explain in order to understand unfortunately people only hear what they want to hear and most of such people they are the victim and they are the judge and they are the one carrying out the punishment and they are the police force so they don't even do respect others by asking them about their opinion so that they can clarify thing all what they can do is launch websites and make video clips and slunder people left right and Center did the companions differ in issues of AA that answer is no they did not differ in issues of the a in the sense that in the belie being in the existence of Allah the heavens and uh hell about life after death about the pillars of IM about the names of Allah Asel and his beautiful attributes definitely they did not differ at all in such aspects and those who defend the AA they are rewarded those who protect the AA from anyone claiming that the companions differed in such that would justify for the or for the or for the J or for the different Cults and sects of uh uh people that are pretending to be Muslims or they're Muslims but they're misguided deviant they are rewarded when they defend the a in such aspects however you don't jump the gun just simply because a person said something without looking into what he had said now a matters that I've mentioned definitely they did not differ in but they differed in minut and minor aspects of the I'm not talking about issues for example the companions differed did the prophet Alam see Allah in the miraculous night Journey or not some said he did not see him some said he saw him with his heart and not with his eye and some said other than that so such a difference it does exist but it doesn't exist when we come to talk about the attributes of Allah for sure they differed and we all know that uh uh uh this difference that may Allah be pleased with her said that in the interpretation of the Hadith that the deceased is being tormented by the Weeping and crying of his family and she said no he is he he does not or he is not being tormented by such now this is something that is relating to it's something in the grave they the companions differed whether the punishment uh uh and the favoring and the in the um uh uh the grave is it on the body or in the soul they differed whether the dead he the living or not so these are very minor aspects of AA but to jump and say no they had never differed in anything at all that is not correct and to say that yeah they differed in issues of as if it's a normal thing no this is not correct so may Allah forgive all of those who had said uh bad things about me I am even worse than what they had said"
