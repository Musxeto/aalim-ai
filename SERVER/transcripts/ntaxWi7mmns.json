  "transcript": "Charlie the brother is asking about a situation that we are all faced with and that is we come we come back home from work those who work 9 hours 10 hours a day and they are shattered they are exhausted so they pray mother it and they go back home fine is the supper being served they eat and they filled their stomachs and once they do this they feel drowsy and they have this urge to sleep so he's asking is it permissible for me to pray in the house and the answer was by our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a blind man came to him and the hadith is the hadith is inside Muslim and he complained and said o prophet of Allah I'm a blind man my my house is far and I don't have anyone suitable for me to lead me to prayer is it permissible for me to pray home the Prophet said that is salat wa salam do you hear the van and the van said yes I do and the Prophet said I don't find any excuse for you you have to attend the prayer in the Masjid now remember this is a blind man so you're excused of feeling the fatigue and being exhausted this is not a cause that allows you to pray in the house besides a lot of the Muslims and if I say 90% of them I would not be exaggerating a lot of the Muslims would use the same excuse to skip Fajr prayer and if every one of us had a similar excuse you will find the messages the mosques deserted and if we desert the messages then Allah's wrath would fall upon us therefore the answer is no you have to fight your urge of sleep and drowsiness and you have to believe that whatever agility and strength you find in yourself it is not because of your six or eight or ten hours of asleep it is because of Allah as origin I know people who sleep 12 hours a day and they are among the laziest on earth but I also know people who sleep only literally four hours a day and Allah as Odell has blessed their health has blessed their work and has blessed them with a lot of health and agility and productivity in their work therefore trust Allah and do what you have to do and Allah Azza WA JAL would give you the health the wealth and the power to move on and progress in your life I believe we have a break so stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back"
