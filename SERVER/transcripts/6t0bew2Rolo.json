  "transcript": "brother and it's difficult to actually give they stop taking these kind of questions because these questions I think maybe about 40% of questions we get on a scooter sometimes and we do reply to these brothers and sisters and we give them a lot of advice but they keep coming back these kind of questions about chatting and having conversations with opposite sex meeting up with people people arguing that there's nothing wrong with this my sharecenter the local mosque this is allowed and self and this bother gives another one of these questions he says what's the problem why do you always speak about it on the TV and ask him that we're not allowed to speak to the opposite sex we've got nothing in mind we just want friendship friendship is nothing wrong so first please explain yourself so explain ourselves well this is quite difficult to explain yourself during a Q&A program because this needs a lot of elaboration claiming that all what we want is friendship between the opposite sex this means that you have a problem with your hormones you have a problem with your hormones because a boy cannot have a friendship with a girl unless he has a problem with hormones therefore don't be deceived by Satan's whispers you chat you enjoy chatting you have an objective and this may be long-term may be short-term wanna chat with the opposite sex when you have the same sex to chat with so there is something fishy besides you always make this okay for yourself but let's presume that someone wants to chat with your sister and you know that your sister is chatting with another boy is that okay with you if it's okay then you have a really serious problem and if it's not okay then definitely it's not okay for you chatting usually leads to something exchanging photographs and then maybe phone calls over the net to voice over IP or whatever and then it expands a little bit more maybe if you are in the same region or town maybe it needs to meet a meeting it's a friendly meeting it's just a date I'm not gonna do anything so you presume and hope but this is not the case if you are one of the 1% that really don't have a problem with this what about the 99% and who classifies you that you are one of those who will not fall into sin this is exactly what Elijah had warned us from and that is not to follow the footsteps of Satan when at the tabular hot water shake it on and this is exactly what you are doing and that is why it is completely forbidden chocolate has fake"
