  "transcript": "She I wanted to ask that uh here in my local mosque uh on Friday prayer they first give uh in our local language then followed by two Arabic ones and I read in a hadith that uh the angels stop taking uh attendance after before begins. So does it uh start with the two Arabic ones or the local one that they give? The angels fold their record books when the imam enters and says and sits down and the gives the adan and after the adan he stands up to give the two speeches. This is when the angels fold their record books. The firstb in Udo, he doesn't say this. He just comes in and gives. Then after he finishes his, he looks at his watch and says and he sits down and the then gives the adan. This is when the records are folded."
