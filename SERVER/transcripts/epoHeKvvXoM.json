  "title": "If a woman hates that a man can marry 4 wives, is it kufr? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign state that if a woman says everything is fine in Islam but the fact that there is an opportunity for men that they can get married multiple times I don't like that he said they're saying such thing as scuffer so I say search for Islamic and in the thought why it was said that if a person dislikes some things even though it is prescribed in Sharia that does not adversely affect him so long as he does not hate the fact that it is prescribed the woman who feels jealous does not hate the fact that Allah has allowed her husband to marry more than one woman but she has to have a co-wife there is an obvious difference between the two did not mention whether hating the fact that something is prescribed in Islam is go for or not can you please explain this and thus saying the first thing makes a woman hating something that leads to rejecting the ruling hating something because it's difficult it's disliked to you there's nothing wrong in that Allah mentioned in Surat al-baqara [Music] says it was prescribed and he ordered by Allah upon you to fight in war in Jihad and you dislike it and you may dislike something when it's good for you and you may like something when it's bad for you and Allah knows and you know not this is in the Quran Allah stated that Jihad is sometimes disliked nobody wants to be killed nobody wants to go out of his home not knowing if he's going to come back in one piece or maybe in pieces but they do it because Allah ordained it upon them so likewise a woman hates that her husband gets a second wife so the man says no no no if you hate this you're a disbeliever no that's not true I hate she hates that her husband takes another wife out of jealousy out of loving to possess him for her own not be shared with anyone else but does she reject the ruling and objects to it to Allah and says no this is not fair ya Allah why are you doing this this is not logical and she says such thing this is kufur not liking it is human nature without any problem in that Allah Knows Best"
