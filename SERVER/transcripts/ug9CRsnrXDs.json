  "transcript": "I have a question about that I recently read it's found in can be found in math number 4171 where the Prophet says or and give us give up hope for what other people have and I was wondering can you give some clarification of what what does that mean to give hope in what other people have it's human nature if I know you and ABD is a wealthy man and he has a lot of money so every time we meet I keep on hoping that maybe he's going to give me his mobile phone or maybe he's gonna say that okay I have an extra car take it or maybe he's going to say I'm going for how about if I invite to and I pay for your expenses so my heart is always yearning and looking for what you have or what he has or what others have in their hands what they possess this is a huge deficiency in a muslim's heart he should not hope and wish from other than Allah one brother came to me and says she every time I hear about people winning the lottery or the jackpot or winning a car or winning a free ticket I feel a little bit sad I wish I was that person This falls under the same category you why did the prophet sayam four categories of people would be Exempted from the 70,000 to enter Paradise without accountability or torment one of them is those who do not go to others and ask for because your heart is connected to them is looking to their abilities in healing and curing you with the grace of Allah I know it's Allah who cures but my heart is totally in the direction of those people and this takes you from the full trust and Reliance on Allah likewise if whenever I'm around a billionaire and I keep thinking that maybe he'll throw me a bone you're a dog with all due respect and excuse my French because you should have dignity and honor and be grateful to what Allah has given you look only at what Allah gives not at what people possess uh in their hands and I hope this answers your question"
