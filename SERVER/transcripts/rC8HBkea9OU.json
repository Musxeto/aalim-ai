  "transcript": "Um so I want to know um I want to ask sorry uh how can a young person attain wisdom and the ability ability to just fairly the ability to do what? To be able to just fairly in the situations that are not necessarily this this is this is wisdom is a gift from Allah. No matter how people try it's not something that you can read a lot or research. It's it's a gift. Wisdom is to know where to put the right thing in the right place and it is a gift from allahel. Now this may be enhanced developed with experience with a lot of Islamic knowledge to be fair and just requires that you have knowledge of the Quran the sunnah and to be internally capable of doing so. to be capable of confessing of being wrong or of doing the the wrong thing and apologizing to others. It's our self ego. It's our arrogance that prevents usually from such confessions. But when a person knows that he's accountable and that allahel would hold would make him stand in front of him on the day of judgment and question him for what he has said or done, he would be fair and just if he fears allahel. So there is no one size that fits all and Allah knows best."
