  "transcript": "Sena Novick says brothers and sisters post unlawful things online women and westernized clothes insults to others music etc is it an obligation to forbid this evil when one encounters it if yes can you explain how the only way of reaching out to them would be through sending them a message on social media like direct messaging them on Instagram but some might not take it in a positive way Sena Novick if you are a male and you would like to forbid evil to another male the sky's the limit this is no problem you do this privately through direct messaging them through contacting them but it is not permissible for the opposite gender to do this so you cannot forbid evil to a woman and a woman should not forbid evil to a man because this is one of the steps of Shaitaan to drag your feet bit by bit first of all second of all why were you there in the first place and this is a bit shocking because I hear a lot of good people practicing Muslims they talk about celebrities and they talk about a lot of evil they encounter when they are checking Instagram or snapchat or Facebook and you feel that they're hot blooded yet this is not an excuse what you're doing is sinful some of them even follow so and I was shocked to see some women who are hijabis who are new hobbies they follow such celebrities and actors and actresses are all to be laughs what kind of commitment to the religion do you have when you follow such samples of sinners this is totally prohibited for a Muslim to do you have to have dignity in honor you have to be proud of your religion so being there in the first place is an evil by itself you should leave also all similar platforms because this kills your heart slowly not only that you get accustomed and by time you get addicted to such news following where they went and what they what they what had they done what they have done etc our person long ago he used to be committed practicing and he used to follow sites of pornography so that he could take the you LR or URL whatever and report it to the authorities so that they can block it in his country this was a good deed because the youth would spend so much time on the Internet years back and would search for these porn sites to watch so this gentleman used to follow these sites cuttin a copy and paste to the authorities so that the internet providers would block it and he used to report like 5 10 15 20 a day it used to take time but he got there and he blocked a lot of the sites hundreds of them after a while he started complaining and people would say to him why are you complaining you're doing a good job his complaint was by opening these porn sites he got negative impact on his heart he started feeling his heart becoming darker and darker though he was not watching anything at hamdulillah yet just the look the first glance would cause a black spot in his heart and it was becoming overwhelming so the advice was stop whatever you doing and he used to say but I'm doing something for the Ummah I'm trying to save the youth I said don't do that simply because Oh what you should prioritize in your life is your own safety what is the benefit of corrupting my own heart in order to save the whole Ummah at the day of on the day of judgement I'll be thrown into hell because I've corrupted my own heart with my own hands besides if you close one porn site seconds later they'll open another hundred and it's it's like insects all over you so the essence of this all is that you have to preserve and protect your own heart rather than looking to forbid evil stay away from such places but if it's a man like you you can directly contact them and even if they take it in a negative way this is their problem you have done your due diligence you have done your duty that is and Eliza your knows best"
