  "title": "Father of the groom interviews the girl! Talking about her appearance backbiting? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says many people in my culture after the parents go and see a woman for their son they come back and discuss about that lady's features with almost all the family members like they say her nose is fat she is fat she is short etc is this back biting first of all this is a cultural error and a sin first of all because unfortunately i've talked to some of the people even to some of the guys from such cultures who insisted to meet the girl and i said to him who's getting married you are your son said no my son is getting married but i have to interview the girl subhan allah this is not from the sharia this is not definitely from the quran or from the sunnah nowhere ever this was found in islam where are you guys getting these things from either you're following sharia or you're following your whims and desires and without any doubt this is following the whims and desires in what religion is the father of the to be groom goes and meets the girl and sits with her and interviews her isn't he a male doesn't he have desires she's not his daughter-in-law yet what happens if he likes her what happened if she likes him why do we have hijab so people are drifting away from islam and they never ask themselves are we following sharia or our whims and desires because they know the answer it's going to be definitely whims and desires though if you ask everyone on earth among the muslims what do you want to follow shari our whims and desires definitely 100 would say sharia they don't have any other choice if they say otherwise this means that they don't want islam but when you implement this rule this question and cascade it to their lives you'll find that 90 of them are not practicing they're not implementing sharia in their lives they don't want it because it goes against their whims and desires and culture and traditions and the things they want this is point one point two when they come back home talking about the girl who's a muslim falls under back biting because the prophet said allah in definition of backbiting it is mentioning your muslim individual brother or sister with something he hates so when the mother talks to her daughters the daughters are not getting married the she talks to the her daughters and say oh she's short she's too tall she's too thinny she's fat she's white she's dark she's ugly she has pimples in her face she has this she has that all of this is back biting and she's sinful and all those sitting with her now if she's sitting with her son who's interested in marrying and she talks about him to describe her to him so that if he likes what he hears he goes and proposes that's not bad fighting this is totally halal but it has to be one to one not with her husband around not with other sons or daughters who are not involved in this selection issue it's the boy who's interested so she says to him she's fair she's beautiful but i don't like the way she speaks she's a little bit loud she her hair is too soft there are no curls in it this and that yes this is okay because the boy is buying so we have to market the product and the same thing happens when the father or the mother of the of the girl talk to her and say to her the boy has this the boy has that the boy doesn't have this the boy doesn't have that this is not back biting it's only to help her make her mind and allah azzawajal knows best"
