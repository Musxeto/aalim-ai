  "transcript": "zeyneb says i have heard that when you take your whistle after menses if the time of combining prayer is there you should combine prayers like if I get pure and take aa soul at 10 p.m. do I have to pray both Maghreb and prayers combined likewise if I get pure at the time of a sir do I have to pray over her and uh sir both what you say zina was said by some scholars they say that if a woman gets pure after Isha and she takes her ritual bath she must pray Risha but due to that mother it is in the same class or time of Asia she must pray Maghrib and Isha but this is baseless in the sense that though it sounds good it was never mentioned in the Quran or in the Sun now we ask a general question what is the ruling on praying while you are in your menses the consensus of scholars is that it's Haram it's prohibited and it's invalid so we ask another question at the time of mother when the Sun set until the time of Asia was due where you pure or were you on your menses the answer is no she was on her menses then what is rooh the ruling on praying mother so all of this is making it up what's the ruling on making up prayers that were mr. it commences it's Hara why not also make up for Lauren a certain failure of today which were like few hours ago might as well know this is totally wrong and not correct nor authentic and women should not do that you only pray the time when you became pure which is Asia or which is also whatever time that time is you"
