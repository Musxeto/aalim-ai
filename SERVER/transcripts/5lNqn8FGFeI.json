  "title": "Mucus or dry crust that appear at corner of eyes when you wake up impact wudu, ghusl?Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is uh when i wake up i have like a crust and mucus on the sides of my eyes so does this impact my word or okay this mucus or this crust at the sides of the eyes is an issue of dispute among scholars some consider it to be a barrier that prevents water from reaching the whole face and in my own opinion this causes a lot of hardship among people it opens the door for a huge case of ocd among people to the extent that they go into small details that were not mentioned in the sunnah so yes it is important to wash the limbs of wudu of abolution that were mentioned in the quran in the sunnah and it is important that the water reaches the skin without any barrier however such very tiny minute negligible amount of natural um [Music] things that are found on your body there are scholars that consider this to be negligible and not impacting the validity of the wudu and this is what i'm inclined to of course if you can remove it nobody would keep it intentionally but sometimes people are neglectful sometimes they don't have the ease and the facility of seeing that in a mirror so they just wash without seeing it and by feeling their faces everything looks okay so they don't remove it therefore the prayer or the wudu is valid insha allah"
