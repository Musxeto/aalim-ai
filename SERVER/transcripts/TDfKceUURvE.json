  "title": "My baby cries a lot while I'm praying, how should I pray with a crying baby? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fair DOS says I have a young baby and I'm alone at home during the day my child often cries when I'm offering my Salah how am I supposed to pray in such a situation a lot of the mothers give more attention to the child then the child deserves or let us rephrase that the child needs and this spoils the child whenever the child opens its mouth and you carry it then it will always be used to be carried and attended even if there is nothing else to do the child doesn't have any book to read or anything to watch sure so it's Christ it means attention and this is wrong you're spoiling your child this way and you're putting yourself in a prison cell because this prevents you from going out from socialising from visiting relatives from even eating out because you always have to carry the child it is healthy to leave the child to cry for a while it is healthy to condition and train your child to learn how to stay away from you for like five 10 15 minutes give the child its own space in the beginning it would cry for a while but then it would get used to it that ok um the child is used to being fed at these specific times for example at night time you have to train your child at a certain age that feeding is only done at 10 o'clock p.m. and then again at 4 o'clock p.m. a.m. 6 hours of good sleep for you for your husband and for your child so if you do this that would be good for the child's upbringing it would be good for your marriage and it's also good for your child's lungs keeping the child trying for a while it's it strengthens its lungs so when you pray leave the child and let it cry for 10 minutes what's what's gonna happen nothing at all so you have to be a little bit firm insha'Allah and hope for the best"
