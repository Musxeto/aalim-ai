  "title": "Washing hands, rinsing nose after waking up Satan urinates in your ears if you don't pray Fajr Assim",
  "transcript": "the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam told us and this is something that a lot of the Muslims don't do whenever you wake up what's the first thing you do you should according to Sunna actions not words you first of all you wash your hands because the Prophet has some says you don't know where your hand had spent the night so you might might have touched on something that was impure but even if you knew where your hands where you still have to wash them meaning that if I sleep said okay before I go to bed I'm gonna outdrink shape and I'm gonna put my hands in gloves and when I wake up I just take them off do I have to wash my hands yes you have to but I know where my hands were but still you're doing this because the Prophet ourselves I've told you to do so so you wash your hands three times and then you pull the water up your nostrils and take the water off again three times why the Prophet said that the devil sleeps on your nostrils I didn't see anybody bothering me or sleeping yeah well you don't see him so you have to believe in this and you and I do this you do the all of you of course do this because it's part of the Sunnah and we believe in the unseen we haven't seen our have we so we believe in Allah has said because it's overwhelming the evidence is around us no one is is food to say that except atheist of course to say that there is no God and some scholars say that the Asus atheists are close to us because they say there is no God so we have to complete except Allah so they're halfway with us in the Shahada they say there is no God and we say there's no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah so it's we're meeting halfway so the Shaitaan sleeps over our nostrils we have to do this when we wake up not only that the Prophet say that is awesome the hadith is in the Sahay that it's just like a little bouhanni and in the other books of prophesy as well the Prophet says are they slaughter Sam when they pointed out to him that this man overslept until it was daytime he did not pray father and some scholars say that he did not pray which it night prayer but let's give it to the benefit of the doubt and say that he did not pray father until the Sun rose what did the Prophet say that is a Salam he said that that was a man who the devil urinated in his ear this is so hard to accept when I skip the fetcher prayer Shaitaan urinates in my ear yes if you oversleep until the Sun has risen if it's by accident it's okay in sha allah because allah knows that this is not your habit but if you deliberately set your a long block to go off at 7 o'clock 7:30 now I think it's it's ok seven o'clock some of their budget is late but when it's really in summer and the fudge it is like 2:30 who wakes up for Fajr prayer who believes to begin with that Allah is the provider we believe that Barclays Bank Bacchus is the provider if you don't do it I gotta get a paycheck so people skip such a prayer for the work for the schools for anything because it's too early this is the person that Satan takes as his public loo he urinates every single morning in his ears and you cannot see his unit you cannot see this you cannot see his urine you cannot see him but you can definitely feel the impact on your heart so many times these people complain we have a dead heart we have hearts as hard as stone why can't we and the Koran why can't we feel so the passion to learn about Islam why don't we fear Allah when we pray or let me rephrase that why don't we pray to begin with well simply because of the blockage caused between your senses and your heart due to this urine of shaitan allah protect us all"
