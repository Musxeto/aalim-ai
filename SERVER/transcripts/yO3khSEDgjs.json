  "title": "Is it permissible to call a muslim Mawlana? & Concept of Adoption in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "allah azzawajal described himself at the end of surat al-baqarah that you are our supporter so the word mawlana comes as a supporter it also comes as someone who is in alliance with it comes also to describe someone who has been freed after being a slave like in the hadith of the prophet alaihis salat was salaam to zayd if not if i'm not mistaken when he came once we know that zaida niharitha was the adopted son of the prophet alison before adoption was banned so he was a slave given to haki to uh mother khadija by her nephew hakim and she gave this slave as a gift to the prophet who loved him dearly he freed him and then he said that this is the son of muhammad his name was muhammad until in chapter 33 allah banned adoption you can sponsor and support an orphan but you cannot adopt him or her calling him after you giving him your name or sharing the inheritance with your offspring this is prohibited so whenever the prophet used to see the haritha he used to say that he is our mawlana meaning the freed slave and he is close to me and also the prophet said al-islam about alibaba his supporter his ally then ali is his supporter and allah as well and this is to show the muslims the great uh place of ali may allah be pleased with him so using the word mawlana has nothing to do with akida in the sense that i'm using one of allah's names with the humans no this is permissible because this terminology or this word or this description is shared and there is nothing wrong with it insha'allah"
