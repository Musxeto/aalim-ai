  "title": "Is eating Pumpkin (Kaddu) from the sunnah? Will we be rewarded for eating it? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is eating gourd from the sunnah the imam in the friday khutbah said you will be rewarded for eating pumpkin is this true the prophet alaihistala to wasallam as in the hadith of anas may allah be pleased with him used to love eating which is the pumpkin and he used to search for it whenever food was presented to him and eat it and scientists say that it has many many benef benefits in it as food and it's secure for a lot of illnesses so yes this is part of what the prophet hassam used to love but is it a sunnah by definition is something that the prophet islam said or did or approved and there's a fourth type which is the physical description of the prophet saws this is the sunnah so did the prophet was salam ever recommended us to eat it did he ever say that if you do so then you will go to jannah or you will be rewarded as such no so it is a human thing part of the things that the prophet loves alice islam as a human being and not as a messenger like the fact that he used to ride on mule and camelback like the fact he used to wear a certain type of attire no one comes today and says no you have to wear exactly what the prophet hassam used to wear because this is what the arabs used to wear at the time so it's not related to islam likewise the prophet hassam did not like to eat the lizard the desert lizard what we call in arabic so not eating it is not part of the sunnah for us if someone wants to eat it he can do so and this is why when khalid will read melanie please with him ate from it in the presence of the prophet sallam after the prophet had refrained from it the prophet saw did not comment on that did not say you should not have done that no it's a permissible thing the prophet himself did not like it so he refrained from it so we have to differentiate but uh uh between what is considered to be part of the sunnah and what is cultural"
