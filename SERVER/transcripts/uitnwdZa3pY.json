  "transcript": "removal of anything that prevents skin contact with water such as the presence of wax or dough on some spots or nail varnish so it is requirement of Woodill that the organs mentioned which we will come to discuss inshaallah later let me check check the recommended part yes yes it we will comment and talk about it the organs of wood must have no barriers between them and water so if i have paint on my hand water is invalid because the layer of paint prevents the water from reaching my skin if i have nail polish the same thing happens i cannot consider myself in the state of wouldl because my the water did not reach my layer there was a layer and on top of it and this is a real physical layer that has a mass unlike if i have a pen and i draw a line you can see it's it's blue but this does not consist a layer so when i wash this is just a color when i apply henna or muhindi on my hands although men are not allowed to do this but hypothetically and then there is no residue there is nothing solid on it except the color this color does not prevent water from reaching the skin unlike when it has a mass and a layer preventing the water from reaching the skin"
