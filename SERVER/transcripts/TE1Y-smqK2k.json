  "transcript": "oh today's chapter is a new one which deals with evan and then means the call for prayer so we've studied the times of prayer we know when the time of a prayer starts and when it ends now how would we be able to answer the call for prayer unless some something or someone give us this uh uh declaration of prayer declares that it is time for us this is done by the adhan and we have a number of hadith so i believe that it's best that we start with hadith 144. narrated abdullah bin zayed bin abdulrahbihi a man appeared to me while i was asleep and told me to say allahu akbar allahu akbar meaning allah is the most great and he mentioned with allah with allahu akbar four times without tarji and the akama once except meaning the prayer stood ready to begin he repeated it twice he abdullah said when it was morning i went to allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he said it is a true vision ahmed added to the end of devour hadees the story of bilal's statement in the fajr adam meaning prayer is better than sleep okay this hadith we have a chunk of information and issues that we should deal with so i'd appreciated that inshallah that we try our best to focus concentrate and if you have any question there's no problem in in asking and if i have the answers i'll answer it if i don't i'll simply say half of the knowledge which is i do not know now a van is a form of notification it notifies a people that it's time to perform prayer and it is certain statements certain sentences that are said in a particular sequence whenever the time for prayer is due and the ruling on it it is called kifaya it's obligatory it's mandatory providing some of the muslims do it then the others will not be uh required to do it because then you don't expect every single person in the city to go and perform a van it's only a handful of people that perform a van and this is enough this is this suffice for the others not to do it but if there were to be a village or a city and none of them perform athan then all the muslims in that village or city will be sinful because they have abandoned an obligatory form of worship to allah now before going to the hadith of abdullah ibn zaid scholars have different opinions i'd like to share these opinions with you in regard of which is better the position of the thin the person who calls for the adan or the position of imam the person that leads the prayer so mustafa what do you think well i don't know an exact yeah well this is that this is not a fatwa or a verdict i'm just asking you for an opinion what's your gut feeling i always thought that the person who makes that then was better than the amen why prophet muhammed said in a hadith that people who make then have long necks on yes they have long necks on the day of judgment and this is uh true but i'm afraid that we have to explain what we mean by long necks because some people say maybe a giraffe has a longer neck so that would qualify her to to be then no this in arabic it means that on the day of judgment the people that call for the adhan are put forward and they are more honorable than anybody else but let's see other people's uh let them share their opinions with us fadi i think also the mueller because the prophet saws said in hadith we should struggle or battle for the then and not to lead the prayer well it's not struggle or battle because we this is a form of worship but the prophet said i saw that if you knew the reward in it you would probably make a qura you know draw straws to know which one to do it you know it's like lottery or something like of this uh sword flip a coin to know to decide i want to do it no you want to do it he wants to do it let's flip a coin that decides who does it from us uh abu malik you had something to say yes uh i'm sure that then he's one you know he's uh better than the imam because the imam he gets the you know he gets good deeds for the people that came and pray only okay and uh he said that everybody that hears the then witnesses that he gave then on judgement day that's true so that's you know anyone else any other okay then what would you guys say if i say to you that the prophet allah never ever called the adhan in his life neither did abu bakr nor umar nor rathman nor ali and if it was a better position then they should have done it so what do you have to say to this uh fadi them for instance they wanted other people to benefit more than them it's true but they wouldn't leave something that was best and and and and allow people to take it from them abu malik well first of all it depends on whatever is capable to do and everybody else you know everybody has a different position in the muslim um like we had a strong voice powerful voice maybe the prophet you know didn't have as you know as high well your first statement was more correct than the other one because the prophet saws had a good voice has had a nicer and better voice and it would have reached everybody but the first statement is the correct answer which is that though the mu'avin which i agree with you all the mu'adin's role is better than the imam because as abu malik pointed out anyone that hears the adhan and comes to the mosque he will have a portion of his reward so whoever calls people to good things you share with them whatever good deeds they do for example if i teach you how to pray whenever you pray it's credited to me it goes into my account so you take your own deeds for your prayer but because i instructed you i taught you i get this reward which means that the prophets get the highest reward of all because all their followers give them credit to whatever they learned from them so the muad then whoever comes and answers his call and prays in the mosque whoever hears his evan and repeats after him he will get the reward although he's not doing anything else so it's it's far greater role than any other role but the reason that the prophet sallam did not call for the for the salah called for prayer did not assume the role of because he already had the role of imam he had to lead the prayer and it wouldn't be acceptable for him to spend all his time the mosque making call for uh calling the call of salah prayer and not to free his time for his family or for those who ask him because he had the role of a teacher a leader imam and so on so scholars say that the caliph the four caliph and before them the prophet allah had more important business to attend than to call for the adhan though they all agree that the adhan role is very important and essential one and this is the choice of islamic he said that the only thing that prevented them from calling the evan was that they had more important things to look after now once we know the importance of adan it is very strange to find muslims being ashamed or embarrassed of calling that then and i think you know this you know there are a lot of time when we are out in the open or we enter a mosque and the imam or the other are absent for one reason or the other and it's time for salah we asked the people to go and call for the adhan you find lots of them not willing to do that and when you ask them some of them say um i don't know the words you don't know the words these are anyone would any muslim has to know them by heart others say i'm ashamed or um i'm shy i'm not ashamed he's uh honored to to to call for that but he is shy of doing it and why is that because it has to do with religion but if you ask them to come uh on a talk show or to sing a song or to to to uh audit for uh uh idol star or superstar whatever you would find them jumping immediately to contribute and and this is something that one should try to review it you have to call for the adhan because you will gain so much reward from allah azza so it's it's a matter of you coming forward not people asking you and as we've mentioned a while ago if it was to the people they would have fought and tried to flip a coin to decide which one to call for the adhan rather than someone else taking it now the adhan is in islam as a notification for what for any form of prayer or for particular set of prayers nor for obligatory prayer only for the five obligatory prayer so we don't call for uh adhan when example if we are in festivals eat we don't call for the in funerals prayer only for the five obligatory a prayer and yes sir what about uh alvin before we bury the somebody at that sometimes uh we we see this what can you give me an example before burying a person or in the mosque no no no well if sometimes if you see the barrier we listen some some words like ada no no this this is also one of the innovations we have hundreds and thousands of innovative things when they're carrying the the the dead person they say which means this is innovation and and even the word meaning that say he is one so why do you do this because you want people to say this is innovative this is not accepted also when they put them in the grave and i'm afraid that we have to pose not to bury people but for a short break so we'll be right back inshallah back to the prophet join sheikh ahmad in the program back to the prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the holy quran the muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few muslims had to leave arabia and migrate to africa to live among christian people who followed the gospel of christ just before the break you're saying that people call the adhan when they are doing the burial and this is not authentic it's an innovation and remember some scholars say that the prayer for funeral itself has no adhan and they justify this by saying that a person when a person is born the sunnah that you go to the baby and make a van in his right ear this is an hour a five or ten minutes old baby you the sunnah is you make a van in his right ear so that the first thing he would hear is the name of allah azzawajal and that there is no god but allah worthy of being worshipped and he has no partners and that the prophet of muhammad his messenger now by saying this if you have a newborn baby don't go and say allahu akbar and shout his ear off the sunnah is to repeat the adhan by whispering don't the the boy is a couple of minutes old you go you get these uh horns and loud speakers no no you just say in a very nice soft sound so that the first thing he hears is the name of allah and that is why when we when this boy grows up and becomes an adult and a father grandfather and he dies when we uh pray the funeral prayer we do not make that because we have already made adhan at the very beginning this is one of the things that the scholars say but it has no evidence so we cannot say that we don't do this because of that no the sunnah is to make advan when the new a child is born and the sunnah is not to make a dan when we bury children now there are thousands of things that are innovative and they are not in accordance with islam regarding burials regarding dying people and how we wash them how we carry them how we bury them but this is not our the appropriate time to go into this uh go any question or should i move on okay going on uh going back to our subject hadith abdullah ibn zaid now advan is a form of worship which means that we it has to be done by a person who who is eligible to do it this means that if i bring a non-muslim and i ask him to call for the salat for prayer to make that would this be acceptable fadi no no why because he has to be a muslim he has to be a muslim if i get a cassette you know a cassette player and i turn it on and put it through the loudspeakers would this be acceptable abu malik no not it would not be acceptable because he's not a particular individual he is not present it's a form of worship so he has to be present why do i say this because i know that in some countries they're trying to make it a as form of legislation that all the mosque will be connected with one uh then and they say why hire one and pay money let's get a cassette player and just put it on and that's it this is not permissible it's a form of worship it has to be performed by a muslim adult who knows what he is doing likewise i had a couple of questions from brothers in indonesia and in india they have this great love to come to mecca and pray and perform umbra but they don't have the ability they cannot afford it so they're asking me during the month of ramadan they can see the imam performing prayer and they join taraweeh prayer through their tv screens and they say it's a voluntary prayer so we can't go there so the least we could do is be with them through the satellite channels and i don't know what they do during commercials but let's assume that they are praying the full tarawih behind the imam is this acceptable the answer is no because you have to be in the same area this is a form of worship you cannot pray through mobile phones if you're in on an island and then you just put on the speaker and say okay start prayer and we pray behind a mobile phone or behind an internet and these are all unacceptable you have to be in the same location the same masjid the same area for you to be able to join the congregation and so on uh going back to the hadith it talks about a dream is that right mustafa yes it talks about the dream and what do we have to do with dreams the reason behind this hadith was that the companions when they were in medina before the adhan they didn't know how to call people to the adhan to to the prayer so some of them said okay let's take bells and told these bells like the christians have in their churches it's nice ding dong everybody could hear this others said no let's use the horn which is was used by the jews at the time and they had disputes a dispute among them and everyone's saying let's do this let's do that and they didn't come to a conclusion so they went home abdullah bin zayed was one of them so he slept and he saw a dream and in this dream he was about to buy a bell from a christian and he met a man and this man asked him what are you gonna do see i'm gonna buy this belt to call for prayer so the man told him don't i'll teach you something that is bet that is better than this and he taught him the adhan and there are different versions whether it is 15 sentences or more and we will come to that inshallah later on now in the hadith we we are told that it is not permissible to use the bell is that correct fatty yeah i guess so because we're supposed to not copy or imitate the the christians but there is a hadith specific hadith that states that the prophet allah says that the angels will not accompany any people traveling if they have a bell with them now it's not any bell so your doorbell is not like the bell in your mobile it's not like the bell in your phone it's not like any other bell the bell that it is forbidden for us to use is the same bell that is used in churches this is forbidden for us to use and if you have a butler in your house and you call the butler with this bell then you should change the bell and take something electronic that would be better because using this belt is forbidden the angels do not come in in the presence of this bell and the angels call allah and ask allah for forgiveness for uh you so taking the bells is not acceptable in islam now going back to dreams is it possible that we take our verdicts and islamic issues from dreams no no no fadi a person okay in islam don't we have any uh uh uh wait don't don't we give any way to dreams in islam fadi i think it's only it's ahead it's ishta had doing effort mustafa i think in this hadith we would take consideration the dream because prophet muhammad actually told him that this dream okay this is at the time of the prophet isaiah what about if it's in our recent times no it has no significance none whatsoever not not in making new forms of worship or introducing any things in religion okay abu malik you have anything just to add i agree with both stuff on that okay this is true religion is complete islam is complete so there is no room to add or take out anything from it which means that if you go to bed and you see the prophet salla in your dream and he tells you that mustafa you have been a good muslim and i believe that from now on you may not pray fajr it's okay you're exempted from praying fajr prayer so you wake up see alhamdulillah i've got it made the prophet gave me 20 discount i have only four prayers to pray no this is unacceptable but i saw the prophet even if you have seen the prophet alaihis this doesn't mean that you can do it you have to refrain from believing the dreams but it is a good sign to see a good dream for example if you see someone that has been doing a lot of good in his life and you see him in your dreams uh in in in gardens of of yeah you know nice gardens and rivers and water and nice setting then you give him the good tiding that i've seen you and inshallah you are in jannah which is a good tiding now what about this dream this stream is a different one because the prophet is approved it and also another companion of the prophet alice islam has seen it and that is so now you have two that have seen the same dream you have the prophet allah approving it this means that it has a form of authentication and that is it the prophet has approved now coming back to dreams people are engaging themselves in dreams to a large extent they're obsessed with dreams so you always find people calling in oh sheikh i've seen so and so so what do you want me to do explain it for me and i have lots of lots of callers calling regarding dreams and the easiest answer that i know of would be don't eat a lot before you go to bed because then you're going to see a lot of weird things and the prophet told us that if you see bad things spit three times on your left say i seek refuge in allah from the shaitaan regime and do not tell anyone about it why it will not harm you but if you see a good dream what should i do father you spit on my right no just tell the one the ones that are close to the ones you love that's the one if you see something that you like yes mustafa so how would you spit like you actually like spit well the spitting itself is not you know getting it full in your mouth and bang especially if your wife is on your left then you should change your place no spitting is just blowing air this matter nothing comes out and if things were to come out with just you know some moist but it's not the actual spitting or or dipping you know tobacco depends no this is not the thing if you see something that you like you tell those who you love because they will interpret it in a nice manner instead of reversing it to you and as i said we don't have to rely on dreams because we have the facts we have the quran we have the sunnah it tells us exactly what we are supposed uh to do our hadith here was conveyed to the prophet and he explained it and i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah we'll go through this hadith again next time we meet to imanillah wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi"
