  "title": "Islamic Fiqh questions Oct 1st, 2020 - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and as you know we have with the grace of allah azzawajal finished the book on islamic and covered in a very elementary and simple way rulings that were made into this concise and beneficial book that i highly recommend that people download it study it they can always watch the 73 or 72 episodes on the website islamicf.net and i think if you manage to pass all the tests that the website is providing you will be able to get a certificate insha allah signed in regards of um passing this course uh hopefully it will be signed by me and by the board uh the head of the board of this the soul group and it would be something any nice to have um hopefully in the coming week or so we will maybe try to investigate the possibility of continuing these blessed lessons but through studying a concise summary and book on akida so that we would have a clearer understanding of athletic beginners as for now we have these questions that we would like to go through inshallah and see [Music] what you guys had sent us so in the beginning this is muhammad um aslam says i have a question if a person passes away how to share or how the inheritance would be distributed muhammad aslam this is not a specific question there are many variables to go into such a questions such a question such as does the disease have a living father or mother does he have a wife or not does he have children and are his children males and females males only or females only and if he has females only does he have siblings and what are or what is the gender of his siblings so all of these variables contribute to answering your question and this is why when anyone asks a question about inheritance he he should first say what gender the deceased was so he says a man died okay a woman died and then he would say leaving behind a spouse three sons four daughters a mother a father two brothers from his mother's side three siblings one brother full brother and two full sisters this is how a sheikh or a mufti can answer such a question because by the presence of some of the heirs others are deprived so whenever there's a sun or more to the deceased immediately his siblings are blocked automatically even if it's what was only one son but if they were females that's a different story if there were only daughters no sons and likewise in the presence of the father the siblings are totally blocked and so on so you have to be more specific in your question tawfiq says can you please explain what is meant by the right hand possession mentioned in the quran examples and those who guard their private parts for state 30 okay the right hand possession is referring to concubines possessed through islamic war against the disbelievers so when we have prisoners of war men and women these are sold as slaves and a slave woman who is a concubine is what is mentioned in the ayah the right hand possession which a man a muslim man can have sexual intercourse with without the need of marriage because he possesses her he bought her and this is something that we talked about in detail in the past zade zubair says i'm asking about the delil the evidence of the phrase i know a group of people who claim that such phrases are innovations thank you and may allah preserve you and unite me and you in general such groups who claim such claims usually if you try to ask them anything in arabic most likely they will fail to respond to you and i remember in one of the peace conferences in mumbai in 2007 or 2009 maybe a man stood and asked the lecturer the speaker so it was the q a time the man student said i am al-mahdi my name is muhammad abdullah and i come here to proclaim what is mine etc everybody was laughing and the sheikh was shocked at the time and he asked him do you know arabic and the man said yes alhamdulillah do you know how to speak the language the arabic language and the man said no so said to him well tough luck because the mahdi has to be an arab fluent in arabic you cannot be a scholar without knowing arabic and likewise this a group that claims that sallallahu which is used by every single scholar on earth since the time of the prophet till date uses they don't know arabic and they just claim things and say that it is not permissible to be said and there are innovations saying masha allah which we recite every friday so don't waste your time with such imbeciles and individuals who do not even speak the language of the quran and then have the audacity to come and claim that this is right and this is wrong ibrahim abdul qader says i seek your prayer may allah make you and i steadfast on islam till the day we die what is the rule of creating another jamaa in the same masjid after imam completes salah may allah protect you from all evil amin the issue of the second congregation in the masjid is an issue of dispute the vast majority of scholars permit it and their proof is the instruction of the prophet alaihis after he had concluded fajr prayer with his companions a late comer entered the masjid so the prophet said to his companions who among you would give charity to this man and pray with him so one of the companions stood up and he offered with him a congregational prayer and this is crystal clear that this is something permissible without any doubt insha allah adel jabbar says you said that the masjid is a must before friday prayer and after fault you can offer four sunnah or two i have two questions one are these sunnah mandatory the answer is if you're referring to before raqqa or after friday the answer is no they are not mandatory if you're referring to tahiti the answer is yes it is mandatory you must not sit until you offer it his second uh question is if we are offering jummah while traveling do we have to offer tahiti masjid and these after sunnah as well first of all if you are traveler and you want to pray friday prayer while traveling with other travelers this is not permissible because friday prayer is only for residing people in a city so if you reach a city and the people of that city are offering juma prayer in the masjid you may join them but to make your own jummah with a hundred travelers with you while you are traveling this is not permissible so if it's the first scenario which is entering a city and finding people praying in the masjid and joining them of course you have to pray the two raka of the masjid before you sit down as for the sunnah afterwards no you'd exempt it from it because a traveler does not pray the sunnah prayers of the prophet sam used to not offer these prayers and allah knows best mujida says how best can a daughter make sure that her 90 year old father keeps his trousers clean from urine especially for salat for prayer the man cannot perceive odor or something like that i don't for orders i don't know what she meant if he's 90 years of age and he is senile he's so old that he has alzheimer he doesn't know day from night he doesn't know your his daughter or a stranger or even his son so he's he has lost it in this case salat is not mandatory upon him because when allah takes away a person's sanity then allah also takes away his obligations so he's not obliged anymore to fast or to pray but if he is still sane and accountable and knows what's going on you should simply speak to him his daughter should tell him that if you have traces of urine on your trousers or your underpants then you have to change them and wash yourself and if he washes himself and designate a special uh um trousers for prayer so that he is certain that the these are always pure and then he can soil if he has urine incontinence the other trousers this is also okay insha allah and allah knows best ibrahim says can i skip salah to see if my menses is over if your menses is not over if you still have menses there's no salat on you but if you're meaning that you're approaching the time of purity let us read the rest of the question like i want to be sure before taking my hustle because sometimes i take russell many times yet we'll see brownish color still coming what to do first of all the brownish color can be before menses or after menses before menses is when a woman is pure she prays she fasts she goes to school she goes to work she stays home she has 21 to 23 days of purity and then all of a sudden she starts seeing brownish discharge which usually comes a day two three or maybe four days before the actual flow of blood these brown discharges that come before that come prior to the menses are nagis but they are not hermanses so every evan she goes and changes her nappies washes herself performs udu and prays and she is intact in wudo until the time runs out and then she has to offer another wudu for the following fart prayer this is one option when it comes before the actual menstruation if it comes after the menstruation and what do we mean by after meaning that the six or seven days of menses the blood stops to flow then she sees and recognizes her purity and her purity is recognized by one of two number one the white thread like discharge which when she wipes it shows no colors but this white thread like discharge this is a clear sign of her pure of her purity or when the blood the flow of the blood stops she wipes and it comes clean no discharges no colors nothing this is another clear sign of her purity she can now perform if she were to see after five minutes one hour five hours a day brown discharges these are nothing she is pure she has to take her hustle once and no matter how many times she sees this brown discharges she should ignore it after every event she cleans herself makes cleaning herself meaning that changing the underwear and washing her private part affected by this brown discharge and makes wado and praise as normal so i hope this answers your question uh rashid al blushi says there is a family dispute of two parties one accused the other of trying to break into their house they called the police and they were detained for four hours this dispute happened during the month of ramadan after investigation both by the police and the family it was found out that a case was fabricated against the accused so they were detained for four hours without any legitimate reason we have asked the accuser who accused them of trying to break into his house we asked him to apologize and exonerate the accused but the accuser has refused to do so still insisting that the accused did attempt to break in some members of the family do believe the accuser because of their refusal to apologize being defiant and determined what shall we do with arrogant accusers we have abstained from visiting him except when there is some kind of emergency we are maintaining barely minimum contact with him need your advice for the way forward well it seems to me russia that you are one of two either you were the accused so you are offended by this relative who accused you unfairly and injustly or you're a third party you have nothing to do with the accuser nor the accused they're just relatives of yours if you are the first meaning that it is you who was harmed and your reputation was tarnished by his lies you have all the right to keep your distance and not to see them except in occasions and to reply to their salaam if they give salam and if they don't you give salam that's it but if you are a third party meaning that you have nothing to do with the accuser or the accused you are not harmed personally you cannot take a stance in an a disputable issue like this where you don't know where the truth is so by boycotting and severing your kinship with the accuser you would be doing a major sin because he did not harm you he did not do anything to you so what to do i believe that you should not take sides maintain your kinship maybe from a distance but at least you have to show him that you're still his relative and his kinship and hope that allah would reveal the truth one day angel aisha or aisha uh cher thanks much to give us your okay what about ladies who are in dilemma marriage problem in life suffering in silence the husband drives them to love someone else love is blind but the other person the other man does not know aisha this is a complicated question and it is the result of compiling sins over sins if the husband is negligent this is a problem a serious problem and the husband is held accountable by allah if the husband does not fulfill his wife's rights we have to address this but at the same time if the wife herself is negligent of her husband's rights she's not putting an effort to get close to him to tempt him to seduce him the man would look elsewhere and if she is not practicing to the extent that she doesn't lower her gaze she chit chats with nan maharam this would lead her to fall in love with someone who is other than her husband which is by itself a betrayal over a betrayal so claiming that love is blind and that her husband drove her to this this is totally unacceptable if you wish you could have always opted for color and divorce your husband but not to live with him and at the same time betray his name tarnishes and your reputation and insult your parents by what you are doing maybe you need a counseling session just to get things off your chest and at the same time get proper advice accordingly and allah knows best hassan khan says i have two questions one i married a girl through video call at the presence of my two friends we four people the bride myself and the two friends met together by zoom meeting for four places or from four places is the marriage valid the answer is no it is not valid because the prophet said clearly there is no marriage without the approval of the guardian the father his second question is if the parents of the girl become satisfied with it then will be the marriage valid the answer is still no you two are living in zina even if the whole world agreed to it the marriage contract was not conducted you need to marry again and repeat the marriage [Music] once again with the consent of the father with the two witnesses prior to that with you and her repenting to allah expressing remorse and asking him for forgiveness for living in zina all that time sayyid for him says i run a cut posting page where i post photos of cats but in these posts male and female mention opposite genders and the audience has variety of religious beliefs should i delete the whole page because it might help free mixing or should i disable comments and continue to post cats on the page i would definitely mute the comments and continue doing whatever you were doing before posting photos of cats is permissible there's nothing wrong in that insha allah taz reen says is it permissible to buy and sell stationaries that have images of animate uh beings on them no if these stationaries have pictures of mickey mouse of avengers of anything that is alive cartoons etc you're not allowed to buy or sell these but if there is a need to buying such stationaries and there's no other alternative which is very difficult to imagine you want to buy a pen and it has the pictures of um animals or drawings of cartoon and there is no other pens you can buy in the whole market without such images then this is permissible only and allah knows best says what is the ruling on divorce if the word uttered but intention in the heart if the the word divorce was uttered this is a divorce if someone says to his wife i divorce you and he intends to intimidate her not to divorce her or he intends to joke with her not to divorce her the divorce takes place because the wordings are clear and not ambiguous enhanced divorce takes place immediately farah says is it allowed to share a drink with a non-muslim like if they are friends things like these usually happen at schools please so if you're talking about sharing a coke or a soft drink or a juice there's no problem with that sharing it with the non-muslim is permissible and there's no problem in that and allah knows best latifah says what part of the face consists of the beard i think that she is asking about what are the borders of the beard so the beard is the hair that grows on the lower jaw this is called leha and the beard is called so this is the lower jaw i have rotten teeth so i hope nothing comes out um h so this is the beard from here from here and on the cheek where beard is grown now if it's here it's underneath the eye this is not the beard so you can shave this you can shave this until this limit this is your cheek bone beneath it on your cheeks this is your beard you cannot shave it underneath which is the neck itself this is also not from the beard so if somebody looks at the face and cuts from here this is the face this is your jaw now i'm underneath the jaw i can cut and shave the whole area here up down to the neck because this is not part of the beard and allah knows west says i want to know about prophet muhammed's parents results on the day of resurrection well the prophet himself told us about their fate when a man and the hadith the most authentic hadith book after the bukhari we all know bukhari and muslim are all authentic and accepted by the whole um of islam a man came to the prophet saws and said oh prophet of allah where is my father his father was deceased so he said your father is in hell so the man a little bit was taken so the prophet alaihi sosam comforted him by saying your father and my father are in hell now the prophet isaiah would not definitely lie to the man telling him that his father is in hell just to comfort him therefore we have to accept this as a revelation from allah what is the reason we were not told we know that they followed the religion of ibrahim of monetism worshipping only allah and 50 or 100 years earlier introduced to makkah to the arabs the worshipping of idols so they abandoned monetism and and associated others with allah azza so his father might have been we don't know we what we know is that the prophet said that his father is in hell and there there's another hadith also also authentic islam a muslim when the prophet assam was traveling and passed by the area where his mother was buried and he cried so the companions asked them why are you crying or prophet why are you weeping he said i requested my lord to visit to ask for forgiveness for my mother and allah denied denied me that which means that she was not from among the people of paradise and this is why it was prohibited to ask for her forgiveness and i asked allah to visit her grave and allah granted me that so this is what the prophet told us and this is what muslims believe now do you think that any muslim on earth would not do everything in his possession just to please the prophet by making his father and mother in paradise of course not we would rather the prophets own father and mother be in paradise than our own parents because we love the prophet assad when we love what he loves but this is a decree in the ruling of allah azzawajal that as muslims we cannot transgress and try to defy or to object to and allah azza knows best in han says i heard anyone who would have a little bit of attitude that is boasting he will not enter paradise so as a muslim should we be proud to be muslims or feel superior to other than uh muslims to non-muslims boasting differs so you can boast with your beautiful car with your wealth with your strength and these are worldly things boasting about them is not a feature of a good muslim but the this is nothing compared to arrogance which is kibra the prophet said alaihissalam of arrogance would never enter paradise would not enter paradise so one man stood up and said oh prophet of allah each one of us would like to have his dress to be neat and beautiful and his shoes to be neat and beautiful the prophet said no allah is beautiful and loves beauty this is not arrogance arrogance is when you reject the truth when someone comes to you and says listen that about you which is true and you reject it you don't accept it and you look down at people you resent others this is arrogance so now when we come to the issue of being proud what's the ruling of being proud of being a muslim of course this is the highest level of pride that you are a muslim you enjoy being a muslim you are proud and honored to be a muslim when others are not there's nothing wrong in that but when you look down at non-muslims and treating them as insects resenting them humiliating them disrespecting them this is arrogance that will put you in hell why aren't we a superior people to them you superior to them because of your islam not because of the color of your hair or of your lineage you superior to them because of your islam if you're not walking the talk and you are humiliating them insulting them resenting them thinking of yourself as a super species next to them then you have a problem and allah knows best rama farooq says what's the ruling on praying to masjid at a non-masjid it doesn't matter the most important thing that it is a full-fledged masjid whether jumu'ah is conducted or not what does that mean there are many messages there are full-fledged messages but juma is not conducted there because the size is not sufficient the size is in a nearer masjid which is a grand masjid so people pray there only the five prayers but not the jummah and it's a full-fledged masjid it is a masjid that was built by the owner the land and the building was given to allah azzawajal so it's an endowment walk so here yes you must pray two raka's before sitting down but if the masjid is a prayer hall as our cousins in malaysia say surao so it's not a full-fledged masjid i go into a mall and there is this prayer hall i sit without praying to raka's someone says this is a message you have to pray to iraq and says no this is not a masjid the administration of the mall tomorrow might change it and put it into a showroom and relocate the masjid elsewhere a message has to be a full-fledged message that is owned by allah azza no one has the authority to sell it to change it to do anything to it but a temporary message at your workplace in the company or in your residential building that can be transformed into anything else later on this is not a message that you're obliged to pray to raka's ahmed says should we raise our hands when we stand up from another for another after each because we may have to or more depending on which raqqa we joined the imam in salat so i'll tell you the reason of bansi's confusion the hadith of him may allah be pleased with him that tells us that whenever the prophet stood up from the first the shahood to the third rakah he used to raise his hand saying allah and this happens once in the salat which is when standing from the first to the third now if a person misses so he is joining the imam in the imam's second rakah so he sits by default in the first shahad with the imam though it is my first rakah but it is imam's second rakah so i have to follow him once the imam stands up do i raise my hands to take or not that is yes why because this is the place of rising or raising your hand this is the imam standing up from the first the shahood to the third rakah this is where you follow and you do it what about when i stand up from my second rakah which is the imam's third to my third rakah which is the imam's fourth there is no raising of the hands for you as a follower because you did not sit for to shahood so the main thing is that if you're following the imam and the imam's position requires raising the hands as per the sunnah you raise your hands elsewhere in the prayer if you are in your first standing up to the third and this can be only imagined uh if you join the imam in the third raka of maghrib or if you join the imam in the third rakah of so i pray with the imam his third rakah which is mine my first then the imam prays the fourth raka which is my second and we both sit for the final the shahada of the imam and the first of mine we offer salaam i stand up for my third raka i raise my hands why because this is my third rakah and i am standing from the shahood so there's no problem with that and i hope this answers your question muhammad yusuf says what is the ruling on forex trading as in trading in islam the halal way we answered this question so many times i said forex trading is prohibited when dealing with gold silver or cash money totally prohibited because this is online there is no reality none whatsoever to the presence of gold and there is no simultaneousness in handling give or take physically so this is totally prohibited when it comes to other stocks it is like any other commodity or stock exchange the rulings is that you have to be certain that they possess it that it is not financed by riba like most companies that they don't don't deposit their savings in banks and uh take river on that and the vast majority of companies unfortunately uh do this and hence you should not be dealing with that farzana bent factor okay who are the saiyads and where are they this is the first part the saiyans are the descendants of the prophet in my country we have some families who claim to be the descendants of the prophet salam how can the descendants of the prophet sallam end up in unknown villages of a third world country in a period of 15 centuries we have arabs that have traveled as far as indonesia and there are saiyan families thousands of miles away from arabia so there's nothing wrong in that they've traveled they've settled down and they have children the daughter's children do not take the name of her father's tribe why then the descendants of fatima allah take the name of our prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam because the prophet is not like any father the prophet islam lineage is the strongest of all and he himself called his children to be that is his grandchildren to be his own sons he talked about hassan and said this the son of mine is a sayyid and this is where the word say it comes from so the prophet called him a sayyid and he also called him a son my son so there is no descendants to the prophet existing today except from the children of fatima yes zainab had a child or two umami bint abila was the grandchild of the prophetess islam and uh also earth man ibn afan had a son by nima but they did not have offspring like the children of fatima allah be pleased with her and allah knows best md nephes says i watch a video of yourself where you said there are recommended surahs for witcher 3 uh prayers or three rakaas can you tell me again and why are those recommended the prophet maintained reciting allah in the first raka roon in the second raka and why i have no idea the prophet loved these three surahs and repeatedly recited them every single night in with your prayer and allah knows best don says i have a question regarding tahajud i used to wake up every night and perform my night prayer but unfortunately i don't have a fixed raka some people say that it's not the appropriate way to perform to hatred what's the ruling on that what they're saying is not entirely accurate but it has some sense to it the prophet said alaihis are the most frequent even if they're little and mother aisha tells us that whenever the prophet assad did something he maintained doing it made it accustomed would not let go from these two hadiths and others some scholars say that it is highly recommended that you maintain a particular number throughout your life so that even if you miss a night or two you will be still rewarded for it but if you pray one night three raka's another night five another night eleven when you miss will you be rewarded with the highest or with the lowest scholars say that you did not maintain 11 throughout your life and hence you will not be rewarded with 11. so you maintained three because sometimes you would pray three sometimes you'd pray five sometimes you'd go back to three sometimes you go to eleven and you go back to three so the three is constantly repeated or added to so this is what we will get so are you sinful no not at all there's no sin on you at all if you maintain to pray a few fewer numbers but if you want the highest amount of reward you should maintain a specific number when you're fit you pray long as when you're tired or sleepy you pray short raka so the duration varies but the number of rakaas is a constant hassan says what is the part of inheritance for grandsons in his grandpa property while grandpa is alive and the father of his grandson is dead with reference from the quran again your question is similar to the first question of today's session is not accurate there are many variables first of all the grandson does he have any paternal uncles so if the father the grandfather whose son died leaving behind children if the grandfather dies and he has one single son or more these sons block any grandchildren from inheriting anything even if they say okay but where is my father's share your father has no share because he died before his own father so he how can he inherit from his own father while his father is still alive and he's dead so again your question needs more clarification fida says can you discuss on the purity of small creatures like ants roaches house lizards that are alive and also is their faces pure the scholars say that insects that has no running blood are negligible such as flies mosquitoes scorpions roaches so these insects and their thesis are negligible and pure when an insect has running blood they call it enough such as a lizard then this lizard or a mouse is nudges and the blood of it is nudges and its thesis is nudges as well however the most authentic opinion is and this is the school of abu hanifa and the selection and choice of sheikh lester even that negligible amount of impurity is pardoned which means that if we see faces of lizards or rats that are dried these are nudges but we can simply swipe them away if they're wet we have to wash the area so why do we neglect it when it's dry because when the prophet salallahu salaam saw a cat and gave that cat some water the companions were amazed so the prophet explained to them that this cat is from among those that dwell upon you males and females what is the meaning of dwell meaning that our contact with them is frequent and it's too difficult to avoid such contact if not impossible so nature's animals due to being among those who dwell upon us we can pardon a lot of the najasa that may be caused by that dogs are an exception because this was clearly stated that their najasa is highly impure and needs to be washed seven times and once with soil but when you come to donkeys for example we know that the dung of donkeys is rich and we're not allowed to eat it and it's the prophet described as being impure however the saliva and the sweat of donkeys due to the fact that we use them so often are exempted they are forgiven likewise with the thesis of rats and lizards in allah knows best fatima bint rasool ya sheikh what is the the rule of moving finger during the shahood during the shoot this movement of the finger is highly recommended sunnah if you leave your hand like this and you don't move your prayer is valid if you want more reward and follow the sunnah you wiggle it in its place not up and down just in his place shake it a little bit like this and this is a highly recommended sunnah allah knows says i found a way to contact for marriage but my parents are not responding in this regard they say get a job and get married then i did this tihara should i stop contacting dawali if you are unable to provide for your wife if you are not financially independent how are you going to get married so if your parents are not approving and you don't have a job you don't earn how would you propose so definitely you should delay and postpone this until you can stand on your own two feet or you get the green light from your father that he will help you financially it was narrated by the ban may allah be pleased with them that the prophet said i certainly know people of my nation who will come on the day of resurrection with good deeds like the mountains of tihamah but allah will make them like scattered dust can you please sir explain this hadith it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that this hadith is referring to hypocrites full-fledged hypocrites who look like us who speak like us and who may pray with us in the masjid and fast with us ramadan yet they're full-fledged hypocrites they hate the religion they hate the muslims in islam and they pretend to be muslims these are the ones who would never ever benefit from their good deeds and allah knows best aisha sadika says i want to know about salat of travelers as there are many opinions want to know from the hamburi we don't follow a particular school of thought we follow the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors the three favorite generations and when you look at all the evidences combined you will find that a person has the right to take concessions of traveling as long as he did not settle down so if you're traveling and moving from one place to the other not settling down yet you may shorten prayer and you may combine when needed but if you go for three weeks two weeks and you settled immediately you run an apartment it's furnished you're living there and you're settling for a one-year course or a four-year bachelor degree or for [Music] work they're sending you to work there for a period of time and you've settled down then you should immediately once you settled and feel settled that you um you you should start to complete your prayer and pray on time says if the woman divorced and her husband lives in another country and they did not meet for two to three years so how can she count her edda and if he divorced her one time after three months can she marry another man if a woman was divorced her edda starts after the divorce and her edda is usually three monthly cycles if she's not pregnant if she's too old to have menses like she's over 60 in this case it's three months period only even if she did not see him for 10 years she must remain the period of redda if this is the first or the second divorce and this is three monthly cycles now how can she count her edda okay we we mentioned this if he divorced her one time after three months um yeah can she marry another man if he divorced her once and she got three cycles not necessarily three months because sometimes women get three cycles in two months and sometimes women do not get three cycles except in sixth or seventh seven months depending on the regul regular timing of her menses so if a man divorces a woman and she gets her three menses and he does not reconcile with her she can immediately consider herself a stranger to him and she can get married with the approval of her father and guardian this is all the time we have until we meet next time uh hopefully next uh thursday monday next monday i'll leave you for a minute allah"
