  "transcript": "before we begin um I got a comment from one of the sisters or from the sisters that we did not go through um washing the sisters and shrouding the sisters I'm old but not to that extent did I not elaborate on how the sisters should be washed and and and shrouded we said this so it's exactly the same with the exception of the issue of whether to shroud them in three or in five and we gave an an example and we did so I don't know what where the confusion came if you have any questions ask inshallah at the end of the session now we have little time but the remaining is almost the same we spoke about um when you burn incense by your dead do it three times we we spoke about this and that this is a Sunnah you it is recommended that you sprinkle it with some water so that the scent itself would stick to it uh do not exaggerate uh in the cff in kaffen is the Shroud itself the pieces of cloth so do do not exaggerate in the sense that you don't go and buy something expensive and this is exactly what Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him said when they brought him new shrouds and he said no no no no take it away the living are more worthy of of it than the dead just wrap me in my my own clothes which which are shrouds again and they are to be worn out and and gone men and women are the same carrying the funeral it's also as in theith now following a funeral is divided into this is point number 45 it's divided into two types how do we follow a funeral either you follow it from the house where or the place it was washed until you reach the place where it was to be prayed upon and you pray upon it this is one or you even make it longer by going until it is buried in this process Allah is giving the reward to uh the the person by giving him the weight of uh carrot in Gold not in Gold sorry in rewards and the companions asked the prophet Alam when he said that if you witness a funeral until it's been prayed upon you will get one Kat which is a carrot and if you follow it until it's buried and they are through with the burial then you have two Kats so the companion said what is the meaning ofat oh prophet of Allah the prophet saidat the equivalent of great and big mountains as in the Hadith it says they are equivalent to two huge mountains in another narration the prophet said each is like mount of reward so it's a great reward for those who follow uh the funeral until it's been prayed upon and then follow it until it's uh buried and they are through of burial is this equivalent to men and women it's an issue of dispute thei of may Allah be pleased with her where the Prophet said where the Prophet s wasallam forbade us from following the funeral but did not demand that we obey the translation is not that uh uh accurate it should have been the prophet forbade us from following the funeral but he did not insist on it so it's different than he did not demand that we obey and he did not insist when you insist you repeat it twice or three times and therefore Scholars differed because of this Hadith some of them said as long as he did not insist this means it's okay the others say no this is the understanding of what she narrated is what we should follow what did she narrate she said the prophet forbade us women from following the funeral this is his instruction now what she understood this is her problem it might be right it might be wrong as Muslims we're commanded to follow the companions the Prophet The Prophet therefore he forbade women from following the funeral do not follow it simple as that you don't have to be a rocket science scientist to know this now how do we follow a funeral with uh trumpets violins guitars or with drums or in cars or in people shouting or with uh fire and B incense and so on all of this is not part of the of the Sunnah how do we follow it then then do not follow the funeral with shouting or fire so these are to completely forbidden the prophet Alam is telling us that this is not permissible at all okay what about putting it in a a motorcade five six big cars and slow music or sad music this is not part of the Muslim uh practice this is not part of the prophet's teachings so you do not shout you do not say and everybody's shouting is not a demonstration the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam as says that the companions of the Prophet Alam us us to despise the raising of voice near the funeral why because you want to contemplate on death you are taking your brother your loved one your friend your Muslim brother to his uh uh burial ground so this today you're carrying him tomorrow someone is going to carry you today we washed our brother tomorrow someone's going to wash exactly what we've you've seen it's going to happen to you but you're not going to feel it he's going to twist you flip you wash you do things unimaginable if one tells you let me wash you now you crazy if your W wife tells you let me wash you now you see you're crazy there are so private things in my life I don't want people to look at when you're when you're dead it's over plus you have no control things that you could not imagine now will happen so it is when you're following a funeral it is not a time of raising the the The Voice or speaking and I've seen it w when following a funeral or when the funeral is being buried people on their Blackberry two other laughing yeah I yesterday I did this and that oh mallah tomorrow there is a football match and and the is being buried They're laughing they're talking they have no fear of death yes but they are ignorant the amount of neglect in our hearts and brains are so much we see things and we are unable to react and and and and and uh uh behave accordingly so when you follow a funeral you do not shout you do not speak just follow it and try your best to uh reach your destination um do we walk slowly Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall Humpty Dumpty had a great fall or do we rush and run and do the 100 meter race the hurdle race what do we do in between but you do not walk like dead people why because the prophet Alam said hasten with the funeral for it is or for if the deceased was righteous if he's a good man a good practicing man then what are you taking him to is better and it's good for him and in another narration the funeral itself is talking and stating come on come on faster because what's you're what you're taking it to is a grave that looks to you as a grave to the deceased it's a window of paradise open to him and Allah expands his grave as far as as he can see so you're definitely taking him to somewhere better than here and the prophet says and if he was not then you are removing evil from your necks if he's not a righteous person then what do you want to carry this evil person let me get rid of him so you should hasten to the graveyard but the the the scholars say you do not run because if you run you jeopardize the funeral and there is a possibility that it would tumble and fall and this is even worse than what you are doing those who follow a funeral where do they walk front back right or left huh back anywhere okay those who write they should be always at the back when they're horseback um mules or camel they should be at the back but those walking can be back front and on the sides now this is what the Sunnah is about however when you're walking it is best to be behind because this is following though you can walk in front but it is better for your heart for remembering the Hereafter that you walk behind it and this is why we say following a funeral some Scholars say nowadays nobody ride over a mule or a camel or a horse nowadays they drive so if you're driving do I follow a funeral while driving this would be intimidating to those in front because they know that there's a car in behind them and it's scary so some Scholars say no in this case it's best for you when you are in a car to be upfront you can go faster if you wish and you would make those behind you feel more at ease and the prophet Alat wasam did both as in the Hadith of uh anas in number 52 the prophet sallam Abu Bakr and Omar all used to walk in front of the funeral and behind it so this is the sunah whever you walk this is no problem against this 53 okay 54 um the prophet refused sallallahu alaihi wasallam to mount his ride behind the funeral and he decided to walk but if you ride it's permissible and afterwards you can ride without any problem because this also is uh the action of the Prophet Alat wasam now as I said uh following a funeral or putting a funeral over in a motor Cade and going to the graveyard in such a fashion is not part of the Sunnah and it is imitating the kufar but if we are praying in this Masjid and the few and and the graveyard is five kilos uh uh kilometers away do you expect us to walk all this distance we will have three or four dead people with us in this heat scholar say no no no if this is the case then you can transport the body by car but usually usually the majority of Muslim countries you have the mosque where you pray next to the graveyard so it's about 2 300 M away you carry it and you get the reward inshallah uh in this now the ruling that's number 57 do we stand for a deceased person or not when a funeral come do we stand or not this was at the very beginning and the prophet himself stood for a Jew funeral when they passed because he said this is a a human Soul so out of respect he used to stand upat and then this was obligated and it did not uh uh become mandatory so if a a funeral passes by if you sit down there's nothing wrong in that the Sunnah is that when it's being buried that you stand up if you sit down again there's nothing wrong in that because the prophet did thatat the funeral prayer it's not I'm I'm I'm trying to wrap things up because we have like about 240 points of Innovations and definitely we need a whole day to go through each and every one of them and explain them but the rest as I said before it's not that difficult how do we pray on a funeral as stated you pray over a funeral in a certain way offering four t five T six t until how many the maximum number of t nine okay all of this is part of the sun of the Prophet Alam however four and five is the one that people do nowadays and the majority restrict themselves to four but if you do five again this is part of the Sunnah so you teach people that don't think that only four is correct no you can also add number five to that and what's the ruling on praying over a deceased what's the ruling it's Comm uh communal obligation and you have the Hadith of the man the companion of the Prophet who died but the prophet refused to pray uh upon him or over him the funeral prayer because he took something that was not lawful for him though he died as a martyr but he took something uh that was not loveful for him so the prophet asked them to pray upon him okay uh 59 Sheikh says that there are two people that you do not have to pray upon them and if you pray it's okay but you do not have to first one a child who did not reach the age of puberty because the prophet Alam when his son ibraim died he did not pray the funeral prayer over him but others did but no one would think that nobody did pray at all no we've met mentioned this that a child is to be prayed upon but is it mandatory or is it a must upon all no and the ruler the prophet Alam did not do this secondly the Martyr and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars albani and as you will see in his uh Hadith he says in all of them that it is part of the Sunnah to pray funeral prayer upon the martyrs and among the evidences he mentions is that the prophet on the day of prayed over Hamza nine times and he prayed over other Martyrs on the battlefield now this Hadith is Hassan meaning that it is not extremely authentic but it is authentic however the same in incident was reported in bukari and Muslim which is the highest grade of authenticity and in the Hadith the companion of the Prophet said that he did not pray funeral prayer on the martyrs of so now we have a problem one says that you pray and one says that you do not pray what do we do we have to evaluate it is can we say that we have to combine two contradicting evidences together can can it be combined he did not pray he prayed we cannot can we say that one is obligating the other we can't because it's the same battle it's what do we do we have to evaluate and see which is stronger and take it so if it's Quran and Sunnah what do we take Quran if it's BK and we take alari in this case BK and Muslim said they did not the prophet did not pray funeral prayer and we stick to that so what do we do when we come to other hadiths when the prophet saysat TOA in in number what number number I think number four five I don't know one number where when when when an incident AA was sleeping but she was awake and the prophet Alam left the house she thought out of her jealousy that he's going somewhere in the middle of the night so she put her ab and she left behind him until he reached the is the graveyard which is close to the Medina Masjid and he supplicated for them and all of a sudden he turned his back and he went back home so he's coming towards her so she started moving and the prophet started to see me run so she ran and immediately she went into the home and covered herself but she was out of breath so the prophet entered the house said why are you out of breath she said nothing nothing and and she sat down she sat up and the prophet Alat wasam asked her and she said well if I don't tell you Allah will tell you I followed you to the so the prophet said you're the that person who was in front of me while I was coming back and she said yes so the prophet Hadith says the prophet hit me in my chest not huh don't do that with your wife it's you huh no no it's just like this and she says that it hurt but this is not beating it's it's sometimes you may hurt people out of love but this and she and he said the prophet did you think I'm going to cheat on you AA she didn't reply so he said no it was jiel who came to me he called me out and you were asleep that's why I sneaked out and he told me go to the and pray for the deceased so I went there and then AA says okay prophet of Allah what should I say if I was there and the scholars say ah look the prophet is teaching her Dua and she's asking about the graves this means that it is permissible for women to visit the graves or to visit this is another issue and the prophet Alam gave her the Dua I mixed up the issue of martyr we did not reach the issue of women visiting the graves right age okay uh we go on we will come to that inshallah so we do not pray over the martyrs how do we combine it's very easy there is another Hadith that the prophet alham before he died he went to and he offered funeral prayer to them so is this another evidence the scholars say no mentioned this in also he expanded on that saying that when the prophet went five or six or seven years after this was not funeral prayer this was just bidding them farewell in the sense that he is approaching his death and he is giving them prayer and bding them forwell as if he's saying I'm coming Etc uh number two okay we said that the child and the Martyr number three who dies in an execution due to a major sin that he's committed you can pray and you cannot pray this is up to the Imam up to the ruler and the Sheikh brings the Hadith of the woman who committed adultery and was pregnant and then after delivery she was executed by stoning and then the prophet Alam prayed the funeral prayer over her and Omar objected may Allah please with him he said she made a major sin and you pray over her and the prophet saidat wasam she has repented one great repentance that if 70 household of Medina repented like her Allah would forgive them and the amount in one individual the amount of repentance and this is great why we sin and we ask Allah for forgiveness and repent this woman was not like that she came to the prophet Alam nobody saw her no religious police they as they call our in in the m in Saudi Arabia there was no religious police she herself came oh prophet of Allah Purify Me I have committed adultery so the prophet looked around as he did withb Malik the man who came before four times oh prophet of Allah Purify Me Oh prophet of Allah Purify Me and the prophet four times looking the other way and the man is insisting so she did the same when the prophet looked the other way around she wanted to make a long story short she said do you want to do with me like you did with M no I'm pregnant so the prophet said go until you deliver and come so she went five months 6 months there is no electronic bracelet no mobile mobile mobile phones no GPS if she got if she has gone nobody would come and say where is that woman yet after giving birth to a baby boy she came carrying the boy oh prophet of Allah Purify Me The Prophet said go suckle the child until he does not need your milk and then come so the woman goes for a year a year and a half and still her heart is burning with remorse she wants to be purified she comes with a child and the child is holding a piece of bread meaning that now he can eat so the prophet after all this time had had her stoned to death so Omar was objecting and the prophet said Omar the amount of repentance in her heart if distributed to 70 houses in Medina Allah would forgive all of them so how do you want me not to pray on such a person number of course this is the ruler but in other hadiths when the prophet Alat wasam was brought with a funeral he asks how is this man if they say he's good he prays if they said he's an evil person he does not pray so this means that it is not a must for the ruler to pray on every funeral that comes if it's someone that is known to be evil it's okay for him not to pray number five any person who is in debt the prophet Alam did not pray and this was in the beginning because that is a serious thing but at the end this was abrogated and the prophet used to pray why in the beginning the prophet says Whoever has a debt on him he will not pray later on when Allah Asel granted his Prophet Victory all over Arabia and money started coming he said the prophet Alat wasam Whoever has money to pay off his debt he must do this but if someone is broke and he dies and he's unable to to pay his debt then the prophet says then I am his guardian and I will pay off his debt from the treasury of the Muslims of B Mal and this is what should be practiced worldwide in quote unquote Muslim world if someone dies in debt and he cannot pay off it is the government the Muslim government that should pay off the debtors this is the Islamic concept but unfortunately it is not practiced anywhere to my knowledge okay we go on to we move the debt issue number six who who else can we uh pray funeral prayer if we wish to do this person who did not or we did not pray funeral prayer for him for example I go back to jida they tell me your neighbor has died and we washed him and we buried him he's a dear neighbor to me I asked them where did you bury him they say in this particular graveyard I go to his grave and I offer funeral prayer is this a must on me no People Prayed but I want to do this so is this permissible the answer is yes it is permissible the prophet did thisat wasam with one of uh the companions who was buried at night and they did not notify the prophet alhat wasam with he woke up he was angry he said why did you notify me they said you were asleep we didn't want to bother you so he asked where his grave was and then he led the prayer and prayed uh funeral prayer seventhly those who die in a country that no Muslims prayed funeral prayer for him and this is known as the prayer of the the person who's absent and Scholars have different opinions some say this is not permissible at all others say that this is permissible only on people who has great contribution to Islam so if there's an Imam or a scholar or a great ruler if possible or any uh uh such who died in a particular area we here after praying M oh The Scholar so and so died let's offer why because he is one of the great Scholars of Islam who contributed in the spread of Islam so this is opinion number two the third opinion is no it is not permissible to do this except for a person who died and there was no Muslims to offer funeral prayer for him as in the case of neus or anashi when he died in ABIA the prophet said he's a Muslim and you know the story of Ja Talib and uh those who migrated to ABIA when he they spoke to him and he confessed that this is the right religion and he is the right messengers of Allah when he died the prophet took the companions to the place of prayer upon the funerals and he led them in prayer uh because anashi did not have anyone to pray for him so how do we respond to the second opinion which says that anyone who contributes to Islam greatly it is permissible to offer funeral prayer it's simple when Abu Bakr died did anyone in the other countries pray funeral prayer omaran Ali no so the practice of the Muslims is not to offer"
