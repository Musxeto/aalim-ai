  "transcript": "uh so I know that like you have to make a Dua for like Palestine in the in the so like if I don't concentrate or Focus while making Dua am I still going to be sinful am I going to be thankful first of all Dua is highly recommended for all Muslims whether in Palestine or in any devastated region so we have to make Dua as part of our Brotherhood so that when may Allah forbid we are in the same position as theirs people would make Dua for us and that's why we give them all the aid and assistance we can that is in our possession so that Allah would assist us if we were to be in their position one day may Allah forbid secondly the Dua is answered by Allah when your heart is attentive and you know what you're saying and you are positively thinking of Allah that he will answer your Dua and respond to you the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith supplicate and invoke Allah while you are certain of Allah answering you you don't make Dua oh Allah grant our brothers in Palestine Victory maybe maybe not they just throw it no you make Dua being certain that they will be victorious eventually and Allah asael would grant them Victory and Allah asael would make their enemies suffer on their hands and become captive and prisoners of War for them and to pay for all the atrocities they have committed we believe that this is happening no matter what the whole world says but you have to believe when you make Dua not it's difficult yeah I'm making Dua but deep down it it doesn't seem very positive no be positive of Allah's victory that it is coming inevitably and be or do not be absent minded because Allah does not answer Dua when a person person's heart is absent minded or negligent and Allah Knows Best"
