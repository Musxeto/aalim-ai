  "transcript": "is what's the ruling on lying on your stomach is this permissible or not it's an issue of dispute and the reason there is such a dispute is whether the Hadith is authentic or not some Scholars think and believe that the Hadith of the prohibition of lying on your stomach is not authentic it's weak the one where the Prophet says that this is a way of lying down that Allah hates and in another Hadith that this is the way that the people of Hell lie down and he kicked someone who was asleep in the mid because he was lying on his stomach a lot of Scholars say that this is not authentic Hadith and some Scholars say that that these hadiths are authentic such as Al albani and those who follow him so it's an issue of dispute depending on the science of Hadith now if you're not a you're not a doctor and I'm not a doctor and we go to two different doctors one say that you have to operate because you have an illness in your stomach and the other one says you don't have to operate because you don't have any their interpretation is different both of them are good doctors but the way they diagnose the illness the way they look at the x-rays and uh uh the lab reports they differ so what to do take a third opinion my uh conclusion my personal conclusion is that you should avoid lying on your back that is let me rephrase that you should avoid lying on your stomach if you don't have a legitimate reason as your spouse massaging you uh or an illness Etc and better to be safe than sorry you have three other sides to sleep you can sleep on your back on your right which is a Sunnah or on your left side and this is permissible not forbidden so as long as alhamdulillah the alternatives are there uh it's better safe than to be sorry right"
