  "transcript": "the few times you meet your relatives yeah correct and now you know and meet your relatives in Indonesia they also inform you about the genealogy yeah but your father about your grandfather and also you meet all of your cousins I believe correct alhamdulillah so we can call means back to the Village of course of course I'm back to my roots as they said 100 yes alhamdulillah okay uh some of the viewers they are Christians when they see you come to Indonesia they said I believe they also see your videos before and they see and they say ah this is to say who hates Christians have you ever said something like that maybe in a different context the issue of Love and Hate is different from one person to the other from one level to the other and it's looked upon from different angles so it is very unfair to say that I hate or I love without understanding what is meant by that so what is meant by that in Islam we are ordered to love for the sake of Allah and to hate for the sake of Allah what does this mean it means that if someone is in accordance to the teachings of Allah the almighty God and he's complying to his law we love that individual whether he's Muslim or not Muslim yes and if there is a Muslim who is doing all the good things avoiding all the Haram things we give him our full love loyalty and devotion likewise if there is someone who disbelieves in Allah and who also insults our religion I cannot love this person I According to Islamic law the Quran and the Sunnah I'm obliged to hate him but hating him does not mean I should be violent or I should do him wrong or I should oppress him this is all unacceptable in my Deen My Religion so what does it mean by hating him meaning I hate his disbelief I hate the sins he's doing even if he's a Muslim and he is sinful and he is oppressing people I hate in him this oppression and this Injustice but I love in him that he's kind that he's generous that he is courageous Etc so to say that I hate Christians just because they are Christians this is unrealistic I have a lot of Christian friends I see and they know me and they visit me they invite me I invite them are we best of friends of course not okay do I love them and try my level best to help them and go out of my way no mm-hmm I do this with my Muslim Brothers but hating their disbelief hating their kuffer is what every single Muslim has towards everyone who's a disbeliever not because of their color of their eyes or the fairness of their skin rather because of their actions the moment they become Muslims they become our brothers and beloved one to us yes thank you"
