  "transcript": "sh I I ask you a questions and you responds me like that I will tell you the question and then yes I was praying and then a man came in front of me before I did the prostration I was thinking about stopping my prayer because I don't know if this invited my prayer and then I did the frustration and after the procession I stopped my prayer and you you says to me this is stupid what I did and my question is is it yet kufur or because no no listen listen AR on Whispers of shatan surrounds us from everywhere left right and center the objective get you out of the straight path to join him in Hellfire now if you have knowledge you would have easily gone through this someone passes in front of you and you're making or r question are you worshiping this person no she I don't even know him if you knew him would you be worshiping him no she he doesn't give life and death he doesn't give me provision I I don't fear him when I'm alone there is nothing that makes me glorify him or rever him or worship him in this case your prayer is valid continue why interrupt it the prophet himself used to pray night prayer while mother Aisha was asleep in front of him she didn't pass she was asleep and whenever he wanted to make sujud he used to pinch her feet so that she would make room for him he makes sujud when he stands up she uh extends them again there's no problem in that at all and your prayer is valid don't ever break your prayer for just a mere thought without evidence what started right and correct cannot be broken unless we have proof and evidence that is is broken"
