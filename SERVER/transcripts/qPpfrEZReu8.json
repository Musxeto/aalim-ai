  "transcript": "share from uk says what are the etiquettes of repentance and how do we know that it was accepted the etiquettes of repentance are usually summoned or summarized that is in the conditions of repentance and some scholars make these conditions free some make them five some make them six so let's mention six to be on the safe side number one sincerity part of the etiquettes and the conditions of repentance that you do it for the sake of allah someone who is addicted to smoking he never leaves it he knows it's harambes he doesn't want to leave it the doctor says that you have one month to live you have a lung cancer and you have to stop or you will die in the coming few days so he quits and kicks the habit not because he is repenting rather because he doesn't want to die that soon his repentance is not accepted it has to be for the sincere sake of allah number two remorse and this is a big issue that a lot of the muslims don't pay attention to so when you commit a sin and repent you have to have this burning feeling in your heart feeling sad feeling remorse feeling depressed over that sin so you don't enjoy remembering it rather you are remorseful for it now most muslims when they repent they don't find this remorse they actually feel that wow that was a good ride that was a good period of our times the 80s whoa we did we did so many heinous things i wish we could do it again but alhamdulillah allah guided us where's the remorse i don't have any don't you feel bad about doing these sins no it was a stage of our lives and it's okay this is a breach of repentance you have to be remorseful because the prophet said that remorse repentance is remorse meaning that the vast majority of repentance lies on remorse number three you have to quit immediately most people when they repent said oh yeah smoking is bad but listen i have a box probably in a couple of weeks i would finish it so after i finish it i will repent no this is not acceptable it has to be immediate number i don't know how many maybe four or five you i lost sincerity remorse quitting number four the firm intention not to do it this is different than falling weak and doing it no you have to have the fourth uh the the firm intention not to fall into sin again and this happens when you repent remorse quit and intend not to do it unlike someone who comes from uh the caribbean islands for after he spent so many wild nights and then he calls he says i'm repenting he goes for umrah makes tawaf makes sa alhamdulillah everything is clear and then he calls his travel agent said listen man the hotel you put us in did not have a casino you know that we like to play blackjack and and roulette so next time next august if we can travel you should book us in a better hotel and he hangs up his repentance is not accepted because he's intending to do it again number five it has to be at a time when allah accept repentance because there are two times that allah does not accept repentance one is a general time which is when the sun rises from the west that's it end of the story no repentance would be accepted after that time and the second time is for individuals for each one of us and that is when the soul reaches the throat on his dying bed this is the end of it and his history his repentance will not be accepted the sixth and final etiquette is if the sin is related to someone else taking his money back biting him slaundering him falsely testifying against him i have to clarify these rights here in dunya and get his forgiveness and return what is lawfully his or the repentance is not accepted and allah knows best how do we know that it is accepted you don't and this is the fun of it because you always have to live being afraid that allah did not accept your repentance so you do good deeds and you refrain from doing haram all the time"
