  "title": "She refuses to take furniture (dowry) from her father in her wedding, is she correct assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh check my sister is gonna get married soon and my father wants to give her some gifts like clothes gold and Furniture her in-laws don't have any demand but my sister don't want to take furniture she says she will only take things that she will use otherwise it's against Dignity of her husband and since her husband cannot use his wife property without her permission and since it's his responsibility to provide for her life my father is also hot patients already got two strokes he wants to avoid people don't wage he says he already feel them his behavior of my sister valid in terms of Islam or or should she accept those gifts in this situation it seems that as long as the husband is not demanding anything or anticipating any such Dowry from the bride's family notice the norm and they're not requesting anything I believe that there is no problem in the father giving gifts to his own daughter so clothes jewelry all of these are normal things but when it comes to Furniture this is a bit awkward because this is the responsibility of the husband if I were to get married and my father-in-law says okay the bedroom and the living room is on me I'd be offended why I'm a man I earn you want to give a gift to your daughter give her jewelry give her cash give her clothes this is your daughter it's her own property but usually the house and whatever is in it belongs to me the husband so in a sense I know and I feel where your sister is coming from especially when she doesn't want her husband to be to get used to having a father-in-law providing and giving unconditionally he would become a sugar daddy to them so yes limit such gifts to your own daughter not to the house not by her husband the car or the likes because this would be like the Hindus Dowry and this is not from Islam"
