  "title": "Is it mandatory to cover our vessels & water container after maghrib (during night)? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is my question is um is it mandatory to cover our container of water during the night and day because of the Hadith narrated from jabir ABD Abdullah may Allah pleased with him that Prophet peace and blessings of Allah be upon him said when the wings of the night spread or when evening comes keep your children in for Devils come out at that time then when of the night has passed let them go and close doors and mention name of Allah for the sh does not open a closed door and tie up your water skins and mention name of Allah and cover your vessels and mention name of Allah even if you only put something over them andish your LS and also because of the wasag lizard the default is any instruction or order from the prophet Alat is to be taken literally as mandatory this is a default unless there's another piece of evidence that lowers it from mandatory into highly recommended so the Hadith among other hadiths where the Prophet said Alam when it's nightfall do not leave your vessels uncovered even if you put something as thin as a miswak on it because there's a night in the whole year where an illness descends and would enter any such vessels so the scholars said that this is highly recommended and some say it's mandatory and I'm inclined to say that it is mandatory because the prophet order it some Scholars say if it's not a logical obligation then it is highly recommended parts of the adab but I'm inclined to follow what is safe rather than being sorry so yes you have to put something even if it is as thin as a miswak On Your Vessel or utensils or your glass or your pot now the question is not this the question is if I have a glass of water next to me and I forgot and I walk up in the middle of the night should I drink from it or spill it out the answer is no you can't drink from it and you're not sinful for that and Allah Knows Best"
