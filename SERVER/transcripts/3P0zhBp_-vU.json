  "title": "Equality in time spent between wives and injustice towards the second wife",
  "transcript": "says and she's very angry and she has all the right to be angry if someone is married to two women and one of them does not have children so is he entitled or allowed to spend more time with the woman with the children or not we have to see if he does if he takes from her time and from her day every single day and stays with the first wife with the kids and he claims that he has to spend time with them this is not permissible he has to be fair a day here and a day there I have to sit with my first wives uh children from Asar until 10 o'clock in the evening in her house with my wife just to take care of them and to look into their homework no this is not permissible bring your kids to your second to spend more time with the First Wives house and justifying this with the children this is not permissible and then she says that if she doesn't have children and her in-laws neglect her they always and this is this happens usually when a person takes a second wife the family of the husband usually are conservative they are reserved they don't want to be equal in love to both wives because they have this affection towards the first wife she's the mother of the children and he's been married to her for 10 15 years and all of a sudden we devote the same love to the second wife who's new and she's the traitor she betrayed her trust and she got married to a married woman as if she had committed a felony or a crime no this is not right you love your son you have to be fair to both of his wives because they are also being loved by him so she says that unfortunately some ignorant in-laws would not come to visit me would not invite me on read or on weddings because of the first wife so I feel neglected is it permissible for me to neglect them as well if you mean by neglecting them that you do not call them and you do not invite them this is permissible your in-laws are not your next stepkin see your cousin you cannot or your brother or your sister you cannot neglect them for a month not calling them or saying that I'm not going to invite them this is severing the next of kin your in-laws are not their normal people it's like my friend from high school if I don't call him in couple of years I'm not sinful if I don't call him in 20 years I'm not sinful I'm Only Sinful if he invites me and I do not attend I'm Only Sinful if he meets me and says assalamu alaikum and I look the other way and I pretend I did not see him then I'm sinful whether he's a stranger or in my in-laws so for you if you don't invite them home if you don't uh call them every week or so or every month or so you have no sin none whatsoever you should be diplomatic you should win the hearts of people rather than exchange hatred and holding grudges against one another if they don't call drop them a call drop them an email drop them an SMS and after a while they'll be ashamed of their acts of you reaching out and they are not doing the same and by this you will win their hearts inshallah"
