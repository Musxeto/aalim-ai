  "title": "Exaggerating the Udhiya/Qurbani ok? Slaughtering more than what is required - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay now abusers question is crystal-clear there is an exaggeration of up here especially in the subcontinent so you have a house a family of seven some are working some are not all of a sudden in need you find them slaughtering a cow each one takes a share and they consider that this is an obligation even if they're needy or poor this is totally not from the Sunnah the Prophet Alice of Sam had nine wives and he had slaughtered one sheep on behalf of himself and all of his family those are living under his roof so the Sunnah is to slaughter one now if someone says I'd like to include my parents in the old hair so I'm slaughtering two more ramps for my father and mother who are deceased we say that this is not from the Sunnah include them in your own sacrifice with your family so one sheep does it or one goat does it he says no no but I have a lot of money I'd like to do this the sky's the limit go ahead no problem but to think that it is mandatory or it's highly recommended the answer is no it is not the Prophet only did one for himself and his family I serve and one for his Ummah those who are unable to slaughter will have their share in sha allah azzawajal but it is wrong to go all the way and saying that this is prohibited no this is halal what is prohibited and an innovation is to slaughter something specifically for the Prophet al-assad sana this is totally prohibited none of the Companions had ever done in this nor the tambourine or tablet Abilene and this is foolish because anything that you do among the good deeds the profit will be automatically accredited for it insha Allah"
