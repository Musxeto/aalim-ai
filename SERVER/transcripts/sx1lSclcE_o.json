  "transcript": "his second question was about his wife a lot of the boys in the gents faced a similar problem when they got married they were easygoing in a sense they were not practicing they were not committed to Islam so they chose like everyone else would do they chose the beauty not knowing that this beauty would turn out to be the Beast unfortunately this is what the Prophet said Alice a lot of sin that a woman is proposed is sought after people marry a woman and they seek her for marriage for her beauty for her wealth for her lineage and for her religion religious commitment and the Prophet said as-salaam choose the one with the religious commitment otherwise your hand would be dusted meaning that you would grab nothing you would have nothing and in Egypt because we are here in Egypt they have a beautiful saying it translates roughly as following they say o you who take a monkey for its wealth the wealth will go and the monkey would stay as it is this is what happens when you take someone for her wealth or for her beauty or her for her lineage without being a practicing Muslim well if you can get all the four in one that's excellent but usually this applies only for the Elaine in paradise therefore you made the mistake that everyone else made which is marrying someone who's not practicing simply because you were not practicing yourself now after Allah has guided you and you started learning the Quran and the Sunna and seeing how beautiful our religion is and how easy you try to call your wife to embark on the Ark of Noah and you tell her come onboard before you drown and she refuses and she says no I will pick a high mountain and I'll be saved from the flood she refuses what to do what are your choices one divorce this is the easiest choice why is it easiest because I'm still young and life is still ahead of me and supply far exceeds the demand I can pick and choose so many women are willing to marry me in my age I'm young so this is option one the problem with option one is that you have children and breaking a marriage and splitting the house this is bad news option two is to try to be patient to give her dower give her incentives see we are good in forbidding things but we're not good in giving alternatives this is Hara this is Haram and this is Haram okay what can I do it's none of my business everything is Haram this is not Dawa you are repelling people away from Islam so your wife is a Muslim try to look at the good things in her and and bank on that try to give her Dawa by telling her that Allah Azza WA JAL beautiful names attributes Allah favours and blessings upon her tried to open her eyes to appreciate what Allah has given her and wherever she complains try to make her look at others who wish that they would have 1% of what she has and to look at those who have calamities to appreciate what Allah has given her bit by bit try to give incentives try to encourage instead instead of just complaining and whining and pointing fingers at her maybe inshallah zojja Allah would guide her"
