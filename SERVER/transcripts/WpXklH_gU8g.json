  "transcript": "[Music] should I focus on reading more Koran or praying more nephal prayers or helping more people during Ramadan this question usually comes in different forms what is best to make vicar to recite the Quran or to pray what is best to feed the hungry to dig Oh a water well or to run a madrasah to teach people we don't have a measurement tool that would allow us to know which is more preferred to allah azzawajal but every time or each period of time has a benefit more than the other each form of worship has benefits more than the other so it depends on the situation what do you mean or an isn't it the word of Allah is neat isn't it the best thing one can recite yes indeed vicar is less in degree than Quran true of course it is but if I am in sujood or in ruk or can I recite the Quran no you can't it's totally prohibited hmm so can I make vicar of course you have to make the cut in this case vicar Institute or record is better than the Quran but Quran while in the standing position nothing beats it it's the best of all so you have to know the situation the person offering it and the reward accordingly your question was related to reciting the Quran nephal prayer or helping people if there's someone who's starving to death and needs my immediate help or he'll die and I'm saying no I have to finish al-baqarah first definitely I'm doing the wrong thing close your Quran and go and help if it is time for Fez your prayer and I'm reciting the Quran I I'd like to finish couple of pages the prayer is ongoing close and go and pray if I'm praying Fechter and someone had has an heart attack next to me any fault and I said may Allah make him better in sha Allah I'll finish the prayer no cut your prayer and help him each situation dictates what becomes better or best it depends on the situation so likewise should I recite the Quran 24/7 during Ramadan or should I engage in Vicar or should I engage in salutation to the Prophet a list a lot of Salaam or should I pray this depends on what's closer to your heart sometimes I pray for couple of hours and I'm tired so I sit down and I engage in offering salutation to the Prophet as some for 10 minutes and then I start to pray again good sometimes I decide to Quran for 3 hours and then I don't feel like being fed up but I'm tired of reading the Quran exchange this for reciting the see reading the seer of the Prophet lacerum or reading something beneficial or engaging in Vicar so always do what is best for your heart and you feel that is good for you inshallah [Music] you [Applause]"
