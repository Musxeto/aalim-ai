  "transcript": "even your ledger is for the sake of Allah Sorcha even going to bed when you sleep why didn't Joe Bell may allah be pleased with him said this to abu musa lashari when they were both sent to yemen abu musa visited his brother math and he said how do you recite the Quran he said I recite the Quran walking riding sitting down lying on my side all the time I decided to hold on this is a Musa why the macabre said I'm not like that I decided my Quran when I'm awake and when I go to bed I have the intention of sleeping and resting so that I can wake up and recite the Quran so because of his intention Allah reward is him more than the other one so your intention is is extremely important in your life when I go to the office what is my intention make more money no my intention is to do my job as a la approves of it to get my paycheck to feed my children to support myself so that I would not beg people for money and to give charity and in my job if I see something wrong I would say hey this is wrong each with your right don't eat with your left it's haram the prophets its own son so with a non-muslim I would also give him dower in a very nice and diplomatic way not embrace Islam okay I'm just here to get this check signed embrace Islam I'm not going to sign your check no this is not the right way of doing it you have to live Islam which means that i cannot lie because if I lie people would consider Islam to be a lying religion I cannot cheat I cannot look down at people I have to be humble I have to be peaceful i have to be cautious i have to be a generous why because I'm representing Islam if you live Islam this is what's happened what happens to you so the Prophet visited as you serve do we love shoes mmm it was can we say that okay well I'm not asking you to answer do you love Jews the Prophet is allah salam indicated to us how to treat juice call them to islam give downward to them now what muslims think that any non-muslim is an insect and i have to step on him this is wrong this is not what the prophetess am used to treat how the prophet used to treat people the prophet used to treat the Christians in the Jews in a very honorable way because he was calling them to Islam and this is what we or how we should treat the people can we announce the death of a person in a mosque so people can attend the janata it's a common practice back in issue no no you cannot this is part of what the Prophet forbade salalah Allie Allison the announcement is two types type one is this one that is taking place in the masjid or over the minarets or through TV stations and the person has died and so and so and so this is not permissible the second type is for information or for a declaration reason because of financial issues so if someone dies and we bury him and we announce to the people that so-and-so has died if you have any financial claims please come forward so this is yani to clarify not to clarify to clear the conscious as we say in arabic or to clear the financial obligation of the disease not to announce his death as is done through the minarets or through different forms of announcements just to praise or to condole this deceased what is the ruling of using a life-support system example when two liters for a dying person a ventilator yeah when the death of a person or let me rephrase that whatever is needed to maintain the life of a sick or a dying person this is mandatory if he's alive so if someone is alive is well and he needs a ventilator or he needs a machine that operates his heart or the cleans his kidney dialysis or whatever this we have to have this because he's alive this is his conscious but if a person is in a vegetative I don't know the word is right I'm making my doctor vegetative state he is like a vegetable his Daddy's brain dead and we're just plugging him to keep the vital organs running but he's dead the brain is completely dead and they say he is like a vegetable in this case he's a dead person the plugs should be unplugged but if he's if he's alive he talks to us but he needs a ventilator if we unplug the ventilator he dies this is killing him because he's still alive this extension with the same question they had it had how should one deal with dying person who is in a coma again if he is in a coma in the sense that his brain is still active and he's alive but he's not in a coma he could be in a coma for two or three years but the doctor says is alive everything is normal he should be on these machines and he should be taken care of it's expensive it's hard but he's alive but if he's in a coma and the brain is that and the doctor say that there's no way he's going to be revived again or he's going to come to consciousness because he's brain-dead no this is a dead person he should be unplugged and he dies on his own and then we take the proceedings from there it is related to the previous question it says that announcing that is forbidden what about informing family and friends no you have to inform family and friends and this is to call them to come and pray and to ask them to mourn the dead if they are part of the family but with the announcement that is enough imagine my my son dies and I don't tell his mother what he tell me the morning the data Haram I don't announce it it no what's meant by the prohibition of announcement announcing the death of a person is to go on the minarets is to publicly announce it and to make it as if I'm calling people for a wedding this is haram but announcing it calling people smsing people my friends so that they would have so many people to join the funeral prayer and we will find the reward of this this is perma solution can you explain briefly the sacral mode what exactly it is or Sakura is similar or it is derived from the word of intoxication when someone drinks wine hummer he becomes sacra an intoxicated sick ran a suker intoxication so Sakura total mouth it is a state of being disoriented your ear you're dying on your dying bit if someone tells you five times five let me think it takes time it is in a state that he is being prepared to die so he is not that conscious and he's not a way so the pains that people get at their dying moments as the prophet used to safari salatu salam are great and and this is what is known as sacra tell more I don't know how to describe it I haven't been there yet I know I know I'm going to be the it but this is how i can imagine it if you are in pain I suffered once and injured in my knee while playing squash and it something cracked inside I don't know what I but I felt so much pain that I blacked out I couldn't see I was a conscious but I I couldn't see it's all black and I was awakened but because of the pain it this is a mini simulation of secretin mode I would presume it you'll be in pain will in agony will be disoriented you know don't know what's happening and only those whom Allah favor and bless would be able to keep their conscious and sail I'll a lot before they die questions regarding the will we spoke if someone made a will that states to bury him to a place it's a specific place or after a specific time like after 48 hours or whatever he's put in now is it ok we will come to that in the burial but again I should I answer it maybe the will part ok the will part if he says something in the wheel that is unassuming you don't uh execute it for example if he says keep my body for three days on display immediately cross this out because islamically we have to prepare the body as soon as possible a a friend of mine another friend of mine this was a question I think tonight's ask Huda at ten o'clock i think in dubai it's pre-recorded so it's not life there was a question about a sister who had a calamity she says that my mother was involved in a car accident in maghrib and isha we buried her how much time two hours masha'Allah they washed her shrouded her and prepare them they prayed asia and they buried her masha'Allah so this is one of the signs of a good death that it's it's very quick it's very II z so this is part of the Sunnah to get the the body ready and to bury it as soon as possible to postpone it for a day 243 without any legitimate reason this is not to be performed the question here again was the prophet salallahu salons dead announced not to my knowledge no it was not announced at old people knew by words of mouth but it was not announced in the sense that people came and said the Prophet died the Prophet diagonal this questions you got in the will is it obligatory for a child to write or have a will or at what age a will is mandatory or at least highly recommended over those who are or who have reached the age of puberty so is it mandatory for a child to pray is it mandatory for a child to fast is it mandatory for a child to perform Hajj no they did not reach the age of puberty and likewise for the will they themselves don't have their own free will to do or to execute Yanni if a child inherits his father and he inherits a million dirham can he buy a Ferrari with that he doesn't have a free will financially he has to be under the custody of a guardian until he reaches the age of puberty and is financially capable of handling this the questions come true says I have a depth of money I don't know where the person is residing now I desperately want to pay him back if I don't meet him can I paid to charity some amount ok if you have rights to people and you cannot find them you have to look hard and if you're unable to locate them you have to give the money immediately to charity on their intention so I have a thousand dirhams for you I cannot educate you you're not to be found I've asked everywhere all those you who know you and they don't know anything of you I will give this 1000 dirham to the poor to the charity to dower organizations to TV channels Islamic TV channels to building a message it to distributing leaflets to feeding the poor but the intention is on behalf of you not on my behalf I'm doing this on your behalf so on the day of judgment when you come and say Allah Allah this man took 1000 deer hunts for me and he did not pay them back then you will get this in your a good deeds record you mentioned it according to Islam accident is considered a sudden death and a punishment from Allah can you please elaborate on that did I say that did I say it's a punishment from Allah I said it might be a punishment from allah azzawajal because the hadith says that the sudden death is a punishment from someone who's avenging that is alonzo who's taking his revenge but not all the people are considered to be punished by this there are scholars there are companions who died with such a death and this was not a punishment from Allah soja but I stated that when you compared Apple to Apple when you compare sudden death to a death that is taking its time and the person is able to repent it's to seek forgiveness from Allah is to pay his dues to the people of course this is much better than the sudden death but it's not always a punishment at all you said that the the question basically is coming from Tobi's made during the sacral mode we can answer this surely but will they be heard accepted by Allah Subhan Allah Tala the Prophet told us a laser auto salam that the Toba is accepted except in two times one is the general time for all humanity and one is a time for individuals the time for Humanity is when the one ceases to rise from the east and it rises from the West every day the Sun rises from the East hamdillah this morning whoops there's no Sun it's coming from the West oh now i'm going to repent too late game over hamas Allah would not accept any dependence when the Sun comes from the West individually when the soul is about to leave the body and it's called Hara Hara when it reaches the throat and the diet that person's house is now is dying no illogical does not accept his repentance but if he is dying over like three days four days he's on his dying bed he's in pain of course if he repents in the first second day third day his soul is still in his body yes his repentance is except except in ashalla for most of the expatriates living in dubai when our close relatives are dying or on the debt that is it better for us to visit them attend their their funeral there or stay where we are and pray for that all stay where you are and pray for that because such traveling is not recommended you just pray for those who are dying of course if they are too close to you like a father like a mother if you are able to go there and seek their forgiveness and ask them to forgive you and try to extend yourself because these are the last moments in one of the gates of paradise yes but if it's not possible or if they're already dead then going to their funeral two or three days just to take the condolences from the people is not is not part of the sooner remember your parents they are a gate of paradise if they die the gate is closed if you have a father go and kiss his his foot if you have a mother kiss her foot whatever she wants you do it as long as within any the boundaries of Sharia go out of your way to please your father and mother now if you have and this I got I get a lot of emails about this problem from sisters that my husband takes care of his father and mother he takes his a care of his family he neglects me this is wrong but at the same time if you listen to the husband he said they would say that no my wife is nagging she is disrespectful to my mother she says bad things to my father and no hockey you have only one mother you can marry as many women as you want and you have one father you can marry as many women as you want you have one husband can you marry as many husbands as you want yes no the Prophet tells you a little up some that your husband after being married he becomes your prime concern so if your father and mother tells you to do something and your husband says no you have to obey if he tells you do not visit them he's sinful and he's going to be questioned at the side of Allah day of judgment but you have to obey so don't get things confused you have to take care of your parents for the men's for the gents and go out of your way to please them for the sisters you have to take care of your parents if you're part of your husband is is cooperating I know a lot of the brothers masha'Allah their wives spent half of the month if not more with their with her parents taking care of them and when I say your wife is always not in the house she says she's serving her mother her mother is ill and she needs attention and I think that this is one of the good deeds i can offer and believe me the wife almost almost kisses the feet of her husband because of his kindness of his allowing her to do this so you captivate your wife's heart by being kind to her parents by being kind to your in-laws and this is not the time to say this I had a course in UK last few months ago it called quest for love about obligations and rights of both spouses maybe you can check it out it's an extension I think the brothers just sex extended the question he said that you said that if I can't find that person I have to go again give the money to charity whatever is a cover what what if he is a non-muslim is a cover yeah Oh freebies give it to the share no no no even the ahi the money you cannot keep it whether he's a Muslim or a kafir it's not yours so also called kafir collect as much as you can and enjoy it no you have to dispose of it because this would be a burden to you on the day of judgment so if the money you own for a kafir or he did something work for you construction in your house and he left and you could not find him this doesn't mean hamdillah I keep the money in my pocket you have to give it to charity again this is regarding organ donation I donation or a part of body donation which is somebody's put it in the will or is it allowed or not this is an issue of this vid among scholars I personally think that it is not permissible this is not your body whose bodies it is not your body this is ullas gift to you so you ya need no I'll tell you this is my body right all right I don't need this hand bring the knife please let this do can this be is it my body can I take up one finger and cut it off No so the Prophet says the breaking and so solemn of the bone of a dis of a dead person is like the breaking of the bone of a living person so even after your death your body is not your body so how can you mutilate a body by taking an eye off or by taking a kidney or by taking a heart or a liver I do not support or approve this is my personal opinion lots of scholars who approve this but I personally do not approve of organ donations after death while you're alive it depends on the organ of course I which is not renewable brick cheers and it goes back again no but the things that would not endanger your a livelihood it's permissible I'm not a doctor but if someone tells me that listen if i donate part of my liver it goes back again and somebody who's sick who needs liver transplant and it goes back again to normal in my is ok if you have two or three kidneys and you can donate one you can have three I think doctors any doctors in the house can you have three kidneys yeah but I don't know but if you have three and you can donate one and you can live with two without any problems scum scholars say that this is a permissible short lunch but for the deceased no I believe that it is not permissible questions regarding a misconception says please advise if it is allowed in islam to prepare the janazah of his wife or does the wife become na muharram after that we will come put this any other Q&A when we come to this section each other this is questions regarding the prompting to a person when he's dying if a person is speechless or paralyzed on the deathbed it is okay for him to say the Kolyma within the heart or he must pronounce it what if he can't how can ii if someone is nughty cannot speak say let Allah say it you cannot have this so okay you have to understand when you ask a question you have to be specific when you say is it ok or s/t is he able go back to the first part of the question he's not able allah azzawajal would not hold you accountable except for the things that you are able someone who is unable to stand up yes you have to pray standing up yep i relized know you have to stand up now you can leave Allahu enough Sun in nowish on this is one of the greatest a display of allah's mercy that allah azza does not ask you to do something you are unable to do is it obligatory to have a will it's an issue of dispute among scholars the hadith is clear about this that it is not lawful for anyone who has something to declare not in the customs yeah I need to do to his relatives that he spends two nights without his will written next to his head so it is mandatory so worried parent here says after being fair with the kids brothers sisters in regards to idea and the gift could you elaborate further like we give more to the elder son than the younger ones again there is a difference between a gift and of support if I have two children or more I give the eldest when they go to school University i buy clothes to the eldest much more expensive than the youngest and for example if I have sons too to make them folks the amount of meters differ this one is six foot tall and this one is maybe two foot tall so watch what should I do it's different when you support them this child is asthmatic every month I have to give inhaler money and medication and doctors and this one Marshall is as strong as a bull they never get sick so do I have to compensate no support is different than gift gift is completely they have to be all equal this boy is the first on his class and this boy always fails school do I give this boy more than the other one known as a gift did the same but when it comes to supporting them there they differ this has more needs his school requires more money he has a car this one doesn't it's a different thing this is regarding reading the Quran when the person is dying is it permissible or two will if to benefit the dying person to decide the Quran out loud near him so he can hear you no no no it is not permissible to benefit him in the sense of the reward but if he's dying and he says he will I would I wish to listen to some quran we don't say more bidder yeah he's requesting it he wants to decide the karate he wants to listen to the Quran this is okay what is not okay to recite a particular solar such as see a scene or to recite and give him the reward in so many p countries and this is a new trend now in Saudi but I know it's it's found in Jordan and Syria and maybe Egypt when you go to mourn someone or to give your condolences they have the Quran divided into 32 0 and they put it on the table so each one takes a juicer in like 20 minutes and hamd allah we made hot man ok give it to the disease this is all innovation it's not permitted we'll have the last question for this session what is the verdict in Islam about the people shifting the dead body to their home countries the same question as transferring the body from one country to other we will have it inshallah when we come to the burial in general you"
