  "transcript": "asking about and this question we've answered so many times U and with all our love and respect to the brothers who are members of the yet our love to the Quran and to the Sunnah is far greater than anyone else so the truth is they are the kindest people they are the most generous they are the forthcoming in helping others they abide by the sun some of the sunnas extremely well such as short thobes the miswak attending the prayer in uh the Masjid and U Circles of knowledge which is excellent and great however unfortunately they have a number of Innovations and they depend on books that include fabricated hadiths weak hadiths and some incidents it also indicate shik and going to grave yards and and and seeking the blessings of the deceased in their graves and there are two types of those who are Arabs and they depend entirely on the book composed by Al IM may Allah have mercy on his soul and it's a excellent book so generally speaking they don't have any shik those Arabs because they've brought up oned and they're following this authentic book in a sense their a is okay they have a lot of Innovations such as the such as the six pillar it that they follow such as restricting the days of travel 3 to 10 or 40 days such as uh uh not speaking entirely about Jihad when you talk to them about one of the pillars of Islam which is Jihad Jihad they would shun you would stop you and would shut you up because this is a taboo they don't speak about issues of knowledge because they say that this increases the difference of opinion among the Muslims so we don't talk about whether you put your hand on your chest or under your belly or whether you pray like this or fast like that Etc we they don't speak about this so they've limited the their religion their Islam in a number of particular things which these things are good and the wearing the uh growing the beard is part of the mandatory Sun however segregating the umah from the greatest pillar which is Jihad segregating the umah from getting involved in issues of knowledge this is not permissible now the non-muslims let me rephrase that the non-arabs they depend on the book or and this is based on lots of fabricated hadiths and and weak hadiths and it's also uh as Scholars say have an incident or two where uh in a vision a man gets the prophet telling him to go to the grave of a person who cherished and bought one hair of the Prophet Alam with all of his wealth rather than his brother who chose to take the inheritance of the father now going to the grave and seeking the blessing of a deceased this is all an incident that would lead to sh so I highly recommend that no one Associates with these Jama with this group unless he has knowledge so if you're a student of knowledge and you're going with them with the intention of teaching them and correcting the wrong things they have yes go ahead but if not if you're a Layman you will be fooled and deceived by some of the innovations that they have and this is not recommended"
