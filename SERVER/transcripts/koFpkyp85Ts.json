  "transcript": "[Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of the signs of the hour yesterday we were talking about a beautiful Hadith where the Prophet Alat wasam gathered to us five signs of the hour and we spoke about some of them ANB Malik the companion the servant of the Prophet may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet Sall alai wasallam said a Hadith and I would be the only one to tell you about it and he said that the prophet said that among the signs of the hour one that knowledge would be uplifted and we spoke about this sign and we said that among the signs of the hour that the knowledge would be extracted from Earth not that it is extracted from the chest of men so that they would not become Scholars anymore but Allah asael would extract knowledge by taking the souls of the scholars and when the schol when the people don't have any Scholars to teach them and give them the proper knowledge they will take false leaders ignorant leaders who would they considered them as Scholars and then they would give fatwa and they would go astray and Lead others astray as well secondly when knowledge is extracted and uplifted then there will appear only ignorance and we are alhamdulillah not there yet yet but the signs are flowing and we can tell that ignorance is prevailing and knowledge is getting uh little and uh uh lesser and lesser thirdly the prophet saidat wasam fornication would appear and would be widely spread and this we said that we're not talking about the non-muslim countries we're talking about the Muslim countries because the prophet is telling us that this would happen in our times in our uh uh communities and this is apparent what leads to it is what the prophet Alam forbade us from which is known as blocking the means so the prophet tells you don't shake hands with nah and this is a grave sin don't wear perfume if you're a female and come out so that men would not find your scent do not uh uh uh glamour yourself and wear fancy clothes that would attract ATT attention to you if you a female uh Allah mandated the hijab Allah Asel forbade free mixing Allah Asel forbade the excl seclusion the seclusion of a man and a woman alone whether in an elevator or in a car or in an office all of this is blocking the means because this if not followed it would lead to fornication as uh it is visible to all those who can see fourthly and this is what we stopped at the prophet said that among the signs of the hour that wine would be drunk now he's again referring to the Muslims we don't we're not concerned with the non-muslims in what what happens to them because they are non-muslims and there's nothing worse than disbelief so if there is a cfir he had done the ultimate in sin and there is disbelieving in Allah or attributing a son to Allah or a wife or believing in Allah's words the Holy Quran the noble Quran that is or in the prophet's sayings and teachings the Sunnah so there's nothing worse than disbelief if someone reaches that level then he had done all that can be done we're talking about the Muslims so the prophet is telling us that there will come a time and this is a sign of the hour when Muslims would drink wine now wine is what is mentioned in the Quran and the companions the well before that the prophet Alam and the Companions and all the scholars said that it is not only wine that is forbidden so even at the time of the companions there were people who thought that they were smart and said Allah Asel forbid only wine and wine is made from grapes so we can make wine from dates we can make wine wine from uh barley we can make wine from wheat and this is permissible and the companions said that when the Quran was revealed there was not a single piece of grape in Arabia where people would make wine of so they used to make wine from everything except grapes and by saying this they would explain to us that the wine that is mentioned in the qu Quran is not made of grape only any kind of intoxicant and this is what the prophet saidat he said that whatever intoxicates in large quantities then little of it is Haram so one would not take a glass of champagne and says that if I drink it I'm not intoxicated so it is halal this is the wrong uh uh uh conception this is unacceptable we ask this individual if you drink a bottle of or if any normal person drinks a bottle would he be intoxicated he said definitely it would be wasted and in this case one drop of it is is Haram is forbidden and this is what the prophet himself warned us from he told us that there will come a time when a group of my umah would make intoxicants would make intoxicant Halal permissible how the prophet says by changing its name so there will come a group of so-called Muslims and they think that or he thinks that he's a smart alic and he says that in the Quran Allah says Al in this in the books of uh uh uh in the dictionaries it says that it is wine so if I don't drink wine if I drink whiskey if I drink they call it Black Label Jack Daniels bourbon vodka tequila whatever you call it you give it beer whatever you call it as long as it intoxicates it makes you in a state of highness and and and feeling high and happy and unable to make the right decisions this is an intoxicant that it is completely prohibited and Scholars Of All Times said that drugs fall under the same category whether it's crack or uh uh meth or heroin cocaine hash marijuana whatever you call it it has the same effect then it takes the same ruling and it is not a minor sin that people think that well it's okay to have a glass or two or I'm not a heavy drinker I'm a I'm a a social drinker I just may uh drink a toast or uh just a half a glass nothing much I'm I'm never wasted I'm never drunk this is one of the major sins in Islam the prophet Alat wasam cursed 10 in Hadith where he says sallallahu alaihi wasallam may Allah curse wine and those who drink it and those who serve it and those who sell it and those who buy it and those who make it the juice or when you get the grape and and put in vineries Vineyard Vineyards Etc this is the person that was cursed and the person who requests this to be done to him and those who carry it and those who they carry it for and those who sell it or they consume its uh um profit maybe they're not the one who sell it but they they make profit out of it like those who grow grapes so that they would sell it to Vineyards this is also considered to be part of those who are cursed 10 the prophet cursed in wine or intoxicants in general some people nowadays and I've heard this a lot and I've seen this I've worked in the private sector and I've seen this in meetings and I've met people who say w I know it's Haram but what can I do I I have a board member and I heard this from one of the CEOs I have board members when they go to Turkey or when they go outside of the Kingdom they drink intoxicants they drink wine openly we have foreigners we have Austrian Germans with us who are non-muslims who refrain from drinking because they respect our feelings but when they saw these so-called Muslims drink it and abuse it they said well we can be more Roman than the Romans Subhan Allah so this or these people usually say well we know it's Haram but what can we do it's a business lunch it's a business dinner it's a business meeting and they serve alcohol well the prophet told youat in an authentic Hadith it is not permissible for a man to who believes in Allah and the day of judgment so again the prophet is relating your belief of the day of judgment to what you do on Earth in this life before the day of judgment arrives and comes so the prophet say it is not permissible for a man who believes in in Allah in the day of judgment to sit on a table where drinks are being uh uh poured meaning intoxicants even if you don't drink worse than that I know a lot of people who don't drink yet they have no problem people drinking on the table and they pay the bill and this also falls under the same curse of the that the prophet Alam told us about so so this is a very serious issue that as Muslims we have to take a stand and we have to object to it look at the Muslim countries nowadays so-called Muslim countries they sell in toxicant openly I'm not sure but I don't know about the countries that do not sell intoxicant I know that Saudi Arabia alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah does not do this I know I think Yemen does not sell it as well and uh I don't know about Kuwait but the rest they sell it openly and if they don't sell it openly they claim to sell it only for expats in hotels so it's for selling it for expats Halal definitely not they claim that they are Muslims but they allow this to happen under their rule nobody's forcing them why are you doing this they say well we are afraid that if we don't do this then we will not have tourists it's bad for the business you know Subhan Allah why do you want tourists why do you want business he said we want Provisions from Allah we want money and I asked them who provides for you Allah or Shan said definitely Allah you sure of that yes definitely without any question you're lying because if you believe that Allah is the one who provides for you you would take means of Halal provision but when you when I go to a prostitute and speak to her about this and she said says I have no other uh means of income and this is the only way of risk you're seeking Allah's RK through Haram a burglar breaks into houses and he says this is risk from Allah an actress or a billy dancer and she goes into nightclubs and she said Allah blessed me in Ramadan with three concerts Subhan Allah blessed you Allah cursed you with what you're doing you are sinning you are openly going against Allah commands and you claim that Allah is giving you risk through this Allah provides Halal risk to those who believe in him so all these countries who claim that we are doing this Haram thing we are selling alcohol on our planes you are 40,000 ft above Earth above sea level you're so close yet you are serving Haram uh uh uh hostesses serving Haram pilots flying aircraft craft selling and serving Haram and you believe that Allah is the one who provides for you if you do if you believe if you have fulled and full conviction that Allah is the one who provides for you you should not do that and if you still continue to do that then your claim of believing in Allah Asel of being a Muslim of being a true Hot Blooded Arab who cares about Islam is uh uh uh needs to be reviewed the fifth um uh sign of the hour that the prophet mentioned to us is that men would go and women would remain until there is one Guardian one male Guardian for every 50 women now this is understandable nowadays we can see that men I believe believe that the fatalities in Men In in males are far greater than females and doctors approve of this and the senses also uh uh prove this worldwide and I would probably hear some men saying yes fatalities in us are so many because of the women because of their nagging because of their problems because of them making our blood pressure go Sky High then we get Strokes we get heart attacks we get Etc this is yeah not the fact but it may have some uh uh truth to it Scholars say that this would come at the end of time because as there are so many wars who dies in Wars most men who fight that is why the more time progresses the more we would find more Wars men will become less women and females would become more and more and some Scholars say that this is an indication that there will be a lot of conquest of countries and we will have a lot of concubines and this would increase the level of females and haar may Allah have mercy on his soul the great scholar of Islam and the and the author of fat Ali one of the Great books in uh uh uh commenting and uh over alari he says that this is not a fact whether it's Wars the spread of concubines he says that this is a mere sign from Allah at the end of the time when women would give birth to more females than males and this is obvious we we can see this in so many families around us we can see that the birth rate of females is high higher and greater than the birth rate of males and we can see that but to the extent that 50 women would have only one guardian we did not see that level yet and may Allah make it easy on all of us now as we've stated in Hadith of among the signs of the hour that knowledge would be extracted and uplifted and ignorance would Prevail and it would be widely spread what happens when this takes place well when you have ignorant people all around you you will see by default that ignorant people are positioned and they are given Authority to do things that they are not good in doing and you will find people following them though they know that they are people of ignorance in theah a man came to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah when is the hour everyone asks it's an important question when is the hour so the prophet wasam told him about one one of its signs and he said when trust is lost then anticipate the hour so the man ask the prophet again and how is trust lost how is the trust lost give me another example or a clarification so that I would anticipate the hour the prophet saidat wasam when positions are being given to people who are not worthy of it then anticipate the hour and this is exactly what is happening in the Arab world in the Muslim world look at the positions all around you in government offices in Ministries in uh uh uh public affairs all those who assume a public position are they worthy of that position are they doing their job and most of the Muslim countries would tell you definitely not so how were they appointed in the first place well they were appointed because they're from the same tribe or they went to the same school or they are from the same neighborhood or because a cousin knows an uncle who knows a nephew who knows a janitor and he got the position through who he knows so as they say it is not what you know it is who you know that counts and unfortunately this is so visible you can see it everywhere and nobody talks about it on the contrary if I have something I would make a phone call or two just to facilitate things so that we can have the same situation why is that because trust is gone when I'm trustworthy and I'm assuming a government position or a a a position in a company and someone comes to me and says listen let's bend the rules not break them I need a favor here or there I need you to appoint my cousin as a manager or as a supervisor or as an employee and I look into the credential and he's not even uh worthy of being a janitor yet I appoint him and I give him a salary and why so that I would have a favor with that other person that I may need some someday in the future this is what is corrupting the Muslim world this is what actually is destroying the Muslim World unfortunately because trust is gone when people do things for their own benefits When you find people in a company using the company's car the company's driver to go and get their shoppings and to take the kids here and there and they use the car and the driver as as if it's their own property and there's no accountability and this is just the tip of an iceberg there is no accountability there is no check and balance no every you do whatever you want and if they you you're caught red-handed if someone catch you with your hand in the uh cookie jar then just apologize and they'll kiss and make up no no harm done there is no true accountability and this is one of the signs of the hour and that is why the prophet Alat wasam told us in uh an authentic Hadith that the Nations all the non-muslim nations around you are soon to collapse on you to jump on you to attack you as the hungry people attack a plate when they're extremely hungry look how they attack the plate to eat so the companions asked oh prophet of Allah are we little at that time when the nations would attack us are we so little the prophet said you are a lot you there are so many of you look at us today we're 1.6 billion what what is that it's rubbish it's nothing it's worthless why the prophet says you are a lot but you are like the foam that comes on top of the flood water when there is flood waters and it's going all over you find this foam coming on top nobody pays a penny for this foam it's worthless the Muslims are like this the prophet saysat wasam your quantity your magnitude the amount of people you are nothing Allah will extract the fear of you from the chest of your enemies meaning the enemies would have no fear none whatsoever from us and Allah would throw in your heart that is the hearts of the Muslims alah so the prop the companion said what is alahan oh prophet of Allah and the prophet said alahan is the love of living and the hatred and the and and and and the fear of dying so when people live and love to live and they're afraid to die to stand up for their beliefs to fight for the cause of Allah this is when you will find all the nations attacking and collapsing on the Muslim umah does it ring a bell does it sound familiar to you yes it is it is quite familiar because this is what's happening in the Muslim World Palestine is gone 70 80 years who cares the the AA mosque is gone you're un aable to go and pray there who cares as long as I have my paycheck at the end of the day as long as my car is polished and and and and new as long as my children are okay and around me the hell with everyone else and this is not the doings of a Muslim this is not the belief or the attitude of a Muslim it was said and reported in the Hadith whoever does not care for the Muslims is not among them and that is one of the beauties of being a Muslim and part of the Muslim umah when someone in arakan in BMA is being tortured or killed or even attacked or injured we here in Sou Arabia we feel for them and we act and we send whatever we can uh financial means and and AIDS and and whatever we can we help them if we hear the same happening in Chia in Afghanistan in Iraq in Lebanon in palestin in Thailand fatani in uh uh uh menau in in the Philippines whenever Muslims are attacked or being abused or being oppressed the Muslims all shiver and tremble for them because the Muslim umah is a United one it's one and they do not have any barriers that se separate them they do not believe in a color or in in landscape or an ethnic uh origin we believe in Allah Asel and those who believe in Allah subhana wa tala and share our belief with us they are our brothers we have a short break and after that we will take your questions so stay tuned inshallah we'll we'll be right backfill our in and there is an American sister who's very active in da in Egypt told me personally that uh she traveled between Buddhism Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left F she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quran so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word it's the word of Allah goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah SP it and forgiveness Ramadan Ramadan [Music] Ramadan can't do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guid to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad Salli wasallam to follow our Prophet wasam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of the sa of the [Music] companion oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life alikum and welcome back uh we have sister Nadia from Saudi Arabia on the phone hello uh yeah she I have two questions regarding this program um in the F the first question you asked you told about the wine so that it is in according to Hadith that it is not permitted even to sit on that table where the wine is served right true so I want to ask like my brother here from the office there sometimes he goes to non-muslim countries and um for the conferences or for the trainings so of course he is not drinking but what about the ruling because they are serving to the different people and they're asking that um you want wine or any other drink so he refused of course but what about this ruling for this Hadi that it's not permitted even to sit on that T So how he can avoid that because he's in the conflict from the office second question and my second question is about that as you told just now that the people love to live and they will fear from Death so uh then why we are um not allowed to I mean when the sick people are there so why we have to pray for their help and even the sick people by himself and also the other people they have to pray for their health so what is the I mean the difference in these two I mean can you relate these two things I will inshah okay okay thank you very much you're welcome uh s from Saudi say from Saudi hellum how are you sir I'm fine what's your question I want to ask regarding the wgmc gold company the what vgmc gold company what is that is it uh this is a gold company investment uh like uh they investing their the money and they are giving every month profit fixed profit is it h to invest in this company I wanted to ask this do they sell and buy gold or they uh a mining company what what kind of a company is it it's Mining Company yeah okay the the the profit they give monthly is it fixed uh no no it's not fixed every month they give according to profits they gain from the uh like people all over the world yeah okay I will answer your question inshallah brother y from Saudi Arabia H how you doing I'm fine um I have two questions the first one is um you know the small duas that we read for example uh before sleeping or after waking up uh so these small Daws like is it uh is it okay to just read them in your heart or do you have to actually like move and greet them okay second question and my second question is regarding that uh if you're praying behind an IM and nor prays two raats and then last ra separately with her uh and you're praying behind the the IM and your intention your KN was you were thinking that he's going to pray three raat like that but then uh in the end he ended up praying all three together at once okay like without doing the Salam after the two raats so is your with counted okay okay we will answer these questions SOA from Saudi Arabia we all we have all local mallah callers all from Saudi Arabia it's cheaper uh yeah I would like to ask two questions the first question is whether a husband does he have a right uh to um boycott uh the wife's parents from meeting them from meeting each other meeting him or meeting her meeting her meeting uh his wife okay yeah I mean his in-laws for meeting his wife okay and second question and uh the second question is like um is is it possible if uh we sneeze in Salah we can say alhamdulillah at that point or uh no okay I will answer your question inshallah yeah thank you so much and we have um Muhammad from Saudi hello yes how are you I'm fine to you as well sh I have two questions okay the first one is can we make Mia to make up our M fast of Ramadan along with the sunna fast like you know the fast of shaal ashur or the fast of Mondays and ands can we make and take the part so that we can get the reward for both or we can make up the M of the Ramadan also during the sun first okay second question this is my first question and the second question uh sh when we go to makah for umra we see some people you know like supplicating and making du by placing their hands on the ca or sometimes holding the covering sheet of the CA and making supplication and and weeping and so on uh so is it permissible or is it a kind of b or something like that okay I will answer your questions insh that's shei okay first question Nadia from Saudi Arabia she is saying that her brother travels and sometimes he is invited to conferences and they serve alcohol so what should he do well simply either he should make a condition that he would not attend unless alcohol is not served or he should not attend I I worked in a a private companies and I used to travel a lot and I used to be invited to such business meetings and we had to do this it's it's the company's work but I would always make a condition listen nothing Haram to be served on the table that I'm sitting on if you like it I'm going to attend if you don't tough luck make our meetings in an office and alhamdulillah they all complied and nothing was served wherever I went so this is not because I'm a I'm a sheh or a or whatever they don't care who I am I'm just an employee and and a company and there's a meeting once you abide by your Dean by your religion and you draw the red line that you cannot cross whoever is angry whoever is upset I could care less what concerns me most is Allah pleasure and what pleases Allah so if I know that this pleases Allah and dis pleases everyone else I could care less I would do whatever that Allah is pleased with and what would this help me when I'm thrown in hell if I pleased everyone else by displeasing Allah they will not have any benefit for me on the day of judgment so your brother should take a stand secondly she's saying that if you're saying that the Hadith of the Prophet that you would love living and you'd hate dying so why do we visit sick people and wish them well why why wouldn't we when we visit someone who's in hospital say may Allah make it fast and easy and you may die no one says this the Hadith is pointing out a fact of life when we love living more than loving to meet Allah more than loving to enter Paradise then we start to do everything that is Haram because we believe that this life is the only stage that we're living in after we die it's power off it's gone end of story this is not the case if it were the case I wouldn't be sitting here I would have been been partying and having fun and doing everything that I want because after I die it's gone it's over end of the chapter but it's not after you die it's the beginning of a new life that it is ET etal either in Paradise or in hell so when people love living to the extent that they do Haram and care less about doing it and they could care less about worshiping Allah as Allah wants them then this is what the prophet is criticizing and telling us that it is a time when all the nations would attack us abuse us curse us step on us use us as a door mat this is what's happening Muslim World Arab world do you think that they are respected world white definitely not they just need their money they just need their them they're using them they're just like puppets they're playing with them so we love to live because life is our Gateway To Paradise so we live in it we live in this life we offer a lot of good deeds we teach people we learn we recite the Quran we pray we're kind to others everything we do is for the sake of Allah because this is our Gateway To Paradise but when it comes to the extent that we're seeing Palestine is gone we're seeing Muslim are being fought all over the place and we are sitting back and relaxing and crossing our legs and saying alhamdulillah uh uh everything is fine the food is fine the water is fine and the hell with everyone else then this is the problem because this kind of loving life and hating death is the one that makes us bad Muslims and I hope that this answers your question s from Saudi Arabia she's saying that there's a company a mining company that it is uh uh a gold mining and they we're investing money with them and they're telling us that this is uh um a monthly profit that we're making you have to look into the whole process whether actually they have this uh a gold mine or not I'm talking about an ideal situation where there is a mining company and they have a mine in Zimbabwe and a mine in Tanzania and a mine in uh uh Indonesia for example and I know and I've seen that and and everyone knows that this is a reality and it's a standing and and working uh company and I invest with them they have no interests in the sense that they don't take my money and put it in the bank and they take riba uh interest on that they're working hard they're making a profit sometimes it goes up sometimes it goes down sometime they uh uh incur losses is this permissible it is 100% permissible but unfortunately it's not always the ideal State uh picture I've come across uh uh uh investment companies in gold mines I think it was in Indonesia that it was not there they claimed that they have a mine but they did do not have a a gold mine they don't have any operations they just collect money and it's a pyramid scheme so those on the on the bottom when they give money they take the money and give the prophet to the one on top of them and the layer on top and the layer on top and the layer on top until they on top get the richest so you have to look into it uh Aisha from Saudi hell hello what's your question sister uh actually my friend hasband uh like like she always complains me that uh her husband you know he he doesn't practice uh much of Muslim uh like he always uh ask like she he sees Other Woman and he Praises other woman and she always ask me how to you know treat him how to uh give him a good message so that he can be a good Muslim like that and my second question is like like in the last round of the TA you have to do the Isam like you have to because I heard that uh when we do slam the last round then uh it's our eighth round then if we uh do it again and then my third question is like um in the in the say we have to see when we um when we cross our sa you have to see youra like it's important to see Thea or we can recite or we can recite from there only okay I will answer your question inshallah um Muhammad from Saudi Arabia mammad from Saudi Arabia I think we've lost brother Muhammad so y from sa Arabia is asking the supplications we say and he said small supplications is there any difference between small and long or big it's the same do we have to move our tongues so for example if I want to say do I have to say or can I say it in my heart the majority if not all Scholars this was a problem I had I used to recite the Quran without moving my lips and I used to say the Dua without moving my lips I just scan things with my eyes and someone brought this to my attention long ago so I search all the books that I have all the scholars different schools of thought here and there I just wanted to find someone who would say it's it's okay I couldn't so the consensus to my uh uh uh knowledge to the best of my knowledge the consensus of Scholars is that you have to move your lips when you are reciting whether it's a Dua or the Quran and this is extremely important in Salah you see a lot of people saying allahar and then their seals are lips their lips are sealed from the beginning of the Salah till the end Subhan Allah they don't even say alhamdulillah by moving their tongue and their prayer is invalid they're not praying they have to pray it over again and this is a very serious issue that I love that the Muslims are not paying attention to uh so the answer is yes you have to move your tongue uh Khadijah from Saudi Arabia hello asalam alaykum I have four questions okay the first one is do we need should pay zaka for the jewelry that we wear regularly okay the second one like yesterday in Haram there was a in the so I was in my uh Ru I was in my Salah when there was a s SJ I didn't understand that I had to go for a uh SJ and I went into Ru and I got back into the Salah so what is the exact ruling I need to follow whether after the ru I go for sujud or I get back into the or I have to do a okay I need to know the third one in the mid where I go for my prayer in my area after Adan immediately there is the prayer start the and the Imam there do not give us time to perform the Sunnah so can I do my Sunnah prayer before the aan of is when I see the time that it's time for Isha prayer okay or I have to finish my T and do my sunnat prayers okay the fourth question is my nephew and my his wife are working here and her family is uh very poor but he doesn't allow her to support her family indeed he expects his wife to support his own family and she's working your your your nie both of them my nephew and his wife are working okay and my nephew's wife some Mother's family is very poor indeed they take zaka so what happens here is my nephew doesn't allow his wife to send across her earnings to the family so I would like to know is it advisable for us to advice to them or do we keep quite after knowing this what is the exact ruling of a women's earning individually I would like to know so that accordingly we can talk to them or we keep quiet we get to know about it regarding your third question um the the the the far is immediately
