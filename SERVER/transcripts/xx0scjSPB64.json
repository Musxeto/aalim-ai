  "transcript": "the Sheikh is it permissible to use the word mercum before the deceased person's name for example the word home has two meanings one that he is already forgiven and Allah has Mercy over him so you're giving your testimony like Allah they use this word the one who has been forgiven means the one Allah has mercy upon so to testify that this deceased has been forgiven or Allah has his mercy upon him is wrong and usually no one at all intends this the second meaning is that he is that Allah has mercy upon him we wish lahu that Allah has forgiven his sins we wish so we say this adjective or description as a form of Dua meaning may Allah have mercy upon Him may Allah forgive his Sins Not that we testify that he has been forgiven as this is something that nobody ever thinks of and Allah knows best so is it permissible to say it the answer is yes no problem in saying that yeah"
