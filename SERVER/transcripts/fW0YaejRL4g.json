  "transcript": "mamasa sent us this email and she says that I want to ask if it is Haram for a sister to go to the hospital for checkup to see what problems her private parts might be having this is because she believes that something is not right so it is permissible uh to go to a doctor to have her check on her uh and look at her uh uh for such a reason well the answer is if she feels that there is something wrong though it is not painful though there is nothing um that can be um disturbing but she feels that there is something wrong it is permissible for her to go to the doctor and ask the doctor to check her and fix what needs to be fixed or at least to give her the uh uh answer that she has nothing wrong with her inshallah"
