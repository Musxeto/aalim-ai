  "transcript": "brother Randy from Egypt first of all he's saying that there are a number of the graves of the prophets known and as we know that Earth does not eat does not consume the bodies of the prophets and The Messengers in the sense that their graves are intact their bodies are intact as they have died minutes ago so he's saying why don't we x-ray it and prove to the world as a form of a miracle that this is true first of all there isn't any grave of any messenger or Prophet known to mankind except the grave of the Prophet was prophet which is buried uh he's buried in Medina as we all know other Messengers and Prophets it's all hearsay there's no proof and there is no concrete evidence that this is taking place second of all it is a form of humiliation to go and x-ray a deceased person let alone to x-ray the prophet of Allah azzawajal you would not like it you would not approve of it if someone told you can we take a picture of your father while he's asleep Not Dead definitely not third of all if we have the greatest Miracle ever which is the Quran and it's still intact we have it when we can read it and people can also study it thoroughly yet they are not willing to do so do you think by x-raying the grave of a prophet and finding his body intact that they will Masha Allah immediately believe and prostrate to Allah azzawajal and pray definitely not if their hearts are not open to the Quran to the Miracles of the Quran to the Miracles of the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah do you think that seeing someone in his grave lying dead that this would all right do you think that this would uh increase in their belief or their it would call them the Islam or to Iman definitely I believe that it won't they would say that this is a gimmick this is photoshopped this is not the actual thing and it would go on endlessly until they would claim to open the whole grave let's see it physically okay this is how the prophets and messengers of Allah should not be dealt in such a fashion"
