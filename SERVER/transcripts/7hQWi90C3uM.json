  "transcript": "during the month of Ramadan of 1444 Hijra one of the greatest forms of worship that a lot of us don't know of is pondering and contemplation and working your mind and heart thinking about what's beneficial for you in this life and in the Hereafter this is what energizes your heart it gives it its energy the power and and the strength to go on Allah praised such form of thinking in the Quran in so many places Allah says if we had sent down this Quran upon a mountain you would have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of Allah and these examples we present to the people that perhaps they will give thought the prophet Allah as we all know lived his forty his first 40 Years of his life in Mecca before becoming a prophet and a messenger and receiving the revelation in the beginning few years before that he used to sit in seclusion in the cave of Hera in the Mount of Nur doing what spending days and nights there contemplating pondering and worshiping Allah azzawajal without a Sharia without any direction but only following his Instinct and his nature and if you go and look at Mount and at this the cave of Hera you will find that it's about couple of miles outside of Mecca surrounded by huge mountains and a clear sky and this by itself gives you great opportunities to ponder and think and this by the way was done before the prophet received the Revelation because after he was made a prophet and a messenger he never went back to that cave by the way ever neither did any of his companions or the tabirin no one would go and visit that place let alone take it as a shrine to to pray to raqqa is there like so many ignorant people do nowadays though this form of seclusion would relieve the prophet Allah from the bad environment Makkah inhabitants used to live in yet the prophet only did this for a short period throughout the year and that was in the month of Ramadan and the rest of the year he would spend among these people living like every other person and after he was revealed to and became a prophet and a messenger the prophet salallahu reduce these days into only 10 nights every year and that was vastly on the last 10 nights of Ramadan where he used to perform eriticaf is done in the Masjid where it's total seclusion and this is where the Muslim especially there is who mix with people and meet them and maybe affected by such meetings they need to cleanse their souls every now and then and to re-energize and this shows you the importance of quality over quantity it's not what you do throughout the year how many Muslims accept how many people accepted Islam or what are the things you've done it's your heart that counts because this is what Allah looks at how pure it is how clean it is how filled with Iman and tranquility and Trust and all these good things that Allah loves this is all the result of what of pondering contemplating thinking about and his magnificent creations about what's around you about the Quran about the whole world and how things are taking place and how they will materialize in the Hereafter and what will happen foreign used to ponder a lot so he used to be silent most of the time prolonging his thinking and contemplation even at night he used to offer night prayer he used to offer to hajajid he used to also contemplate may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet Allah prayed night prayer once and in that prayer he only recited one single Ayah the whole night and again quality versus quantity the whole night you only recite one Ayah yes he used to just recite it and repeat it and then make Ruku and sujud and complete his prayer and then do that over and over again what is but what was this Ayah Allah says what translates to if you should punish them indeed they are your servants but if you forgive them indeed it is you who is the exalted in might and wise so the prophet kept on praying to Allah complementing him and praising him the Almighty urging him to forgive and to Pardon his servants says and this was the routine of the salaf that they would repeat one single Ayah until the break of dawn and now he says a lot of the salaf used to do this repeating one Ayah till the break of dawn not only that sometimes the prophet salallahu got emotional when reciting some verses of the Quran unlike us we just parrot and repeat the eyes without contemplating or pondering the prophet sallallahu sallam read the verses of the Quran with his heart and it had a profound impact upon him may Allah be pleased with him once said that the prophet came to me and said Abdullah read the Quran so I can hear it even Mr UT said o prophet of Allah you want me to read it when it was revealed to you you know it better than me the prophet said yes I like to hear it from someone else so even miss out and he was one of the greatest reciters of the companions of the Quran we were ordered by the prophet to take the Quran from four Etc so he says I started to recite from the beginning of chapter four Surah until I reached the 41st Ayah of the Surah so I kept on reading until I reached where Allah says so how will it be when we bring from every nation a witness and we bring you o Muhammad against these people as a witness and that is on the day of judgment how would it be so the prophet saws said to Abdullah stop there so I looked at him in his eyes were filled of tears and he was weeping reported by buhari and Muslim this is the reaction we need when we read and recite and hear the verses of the Quran we needed to penetrate our hearts and leave an impact on us when we Ponder upon it such pondering and contemplation gets you closer and draws you nearer to Allah because this is what Allah loves some chapters of the Quran made a huge impact on the prophet Allah to the extent that he said once Hood Surah al-watya [Music] um these surahs have made my hair turn gray such surahs included the description the detailed descriptions of the day of judgment and it was frightening still is to those who Ponder and contemplate so the prophet said that such description of the day of judgment made my hair turn gray because of my reaction to such surahs not only that the prophet saws used to threaten and warn those who recite the Quran and fail to contemplate and Ponder upon it mother Aisha was asked once may Allah be pleased with her to recall some of the things she remembers most of the prophet she gave it some thought and then she said one night the prophet Allah while lying next to me said leave me so that I can worship Allah azzawajal a little said to him o prophet of Allah you know how much I love to be next to you yet I also know how much you love to worship Allah and I'm not going to stand in your way so you can go and worship Allah so the prophets left the bed made a perfect evolution and stood up in prayer and he kept on weeping and his tears were running while in his prayer until it wet his lap then it wet his beard then it wept it it made the Earth the ground Underneath Him wet from such huge amounts of Tears then it was time for Fajr prayer Bilal came and saw the prophet saws weeping and said prophet of Allah why do You Weep when Allah has forgiven your previous sins and the upcoming sins so the prophet said obilal shouldn't I be a grateful servant of Allah when he has given me such blessing and favor tonight verses were revealed to me and these verses whoa and destruction might befall upon those who read them and not contemplate upon them not give them thought so the prophet is warning us if we do read these verses and not contemplate upon them what are they these verses are the last verses of Surat Imran the last 10 verses beginning with indeed in the creation of the heavens and the Earth and the alteration of the night and the day are signs for those who or are signs for those of understanding who remember Allah while standing or sitting or lying on their sides and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the Earth saying our Lord you did not create this aimlessly exalted are you above such a thing then protect us from the punishment of Fire what a beautiful set of ayat the prophet sallallahu reacted to such verses and his reaction was illustrated by his weeping his fear of Allah his appreciation to such huge and great creation of Allah azzawajal that the creator of all of this Majesty and greatness is the creator of me and I have so many sins I have so many shortcomings and flaws yet I still have this arrogance in me I still think of myself as something worthwhile it means that I'm not comparing myself to the environment to my country to my continent to Earth to this solar system we're in or this Galaxy which contains millions of other solar sisters so solar systems or these millions of galaxies around the world who am I to have this arrogance and to refuse to worship Allah to refuse to pray on time who am I to indulge in such filth and sins which Allah abhors and resents yet I continue to do them knowing that Allah is watching me is Allah listening to what I'm listening to if I don't contemplate upon these things what will I contemplate upon we"
