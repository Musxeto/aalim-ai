  "transcript": "uh um so uh I want to know about the ruling uh where you join a person who is probably praying a Sunnah for example uh today and yesterday I touched tapped behind someone's shoulder who was praying and I joined them but what happened is uh they didn't say the or loudly so I checked in Islam Q&A they said if even if they don't my prayer is but I also saw in that same answer of Islam QA that Shin said that if they don't form if the uh person who is praying don't form uh the intention for uh leading the prayer my prayer is invalid so what is the right opinion no the prayer is valid inshallah if you joined someone and they failed to recite and the likes loudly the prayer is uh valid because you do not know their intention inshallah but this brings the question two days you're late for Salat of congregation and you come late this is unacceptable you have to come early you have to pray in the first row if you can you have to attend the First with the IM if you can but to do this twice consecutively over a day or two there's something wrong and Allah knows best this"
