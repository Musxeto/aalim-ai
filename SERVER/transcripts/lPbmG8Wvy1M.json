  "title": "Is dua made between Dhuhr & Asr on Wednesday accepted? (Hadith) #Assim #dua assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh some people says says the Dua in Wednesday between and get accepted is this authentic or not can you explain in details please this is not an authentic Hadith this Hadith is narrated byah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father if I correct recall correctly that the prophet Sall wasallam asked Allah for a particular thing on Monday and then on Tuesday and then on Wednesday between and I think and then Allah answered his Dua so this Hadith is not authentic to begin with and even if it were were to be authentic it has no clue or evidence that between and on a Wednesday is guaranteed to answer your call maybe Allah delayed the answering of the Dua on to Wednesday maybe Allah uh uh um answered it on Monday or Tuesday and then it came to reality on Wednesday so the Hadith is not authentic and it is not true and Allah Knows Best"
