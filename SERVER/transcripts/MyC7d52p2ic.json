  "transcript": "uh so I have a question I have a company and I'm trying to export goods from Europe to Vietnam and at the border of Vietnam they charge me a customs fee around 300 per box if I do not pay the fee maybe they will seize the goods or make the import difficult for me so should I pay the customer fee and is my business allow okay first of all islamically it is not permissible to charge taxes and custom fees because this is my money if I import a car if I import furniture and I bought a thousand dollars for this who gives you the right to charge me ten percent fifteen percent call it whatever you want to call it this is my god-given right this is my heart earned money and this goes for everyone Muslims and non-muslims now I won't go into details or talk about things that are way above above my pay grade some say that if these foreign countries take tariffs we should treat them as well I would not go into this I'll go to our level as poor people so if I am a merchant and I produce or manufacture pens and I ship it to another country in order for me to clear it from the Customs I have to be I have to pay taxes or I have to pay custom fees and this is for everyone therefore for me as a normal person there's no problem in that because I am obliged to do it by law you can pay this amount of money and this is totally Halal for you insha Allah"
