  "title": "YouTube shows wudu using spray water bottle but they omit rinsing mouth & nose, valid? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "i have a question about spray bottle udo so there is a video in youtube that how to perform udu with a spray bottle and in this this technique is really problematic because i see that in the first step they say that wash your head so that means just they wash their face and they say that in quran it was written that wash your face and this washing your face is enough you don't need to rinse your mouth or nose and then in the next step they just wash their hands and wash their feet and other steps but in the first step is just only washing face not rinsing so if this bottle is valid first of all you must not learn your religion except from people who are trustworthy you do not go to a witch doctor and ask him to help you with your stomachache because he's a witch doctor he's not a qualified surgeon or a physician that would know what to do if you refuse and go to the switch doctor and he gives you cockroaches fried with a rooster's head and this and that and tells you to drink it you should bear the consequences you don't learn your religion from such people now having said that allah azzawajal mentioned in surat al-maidah chapter 5 the four pillars directly clearly for people to see of wudu which is washing the face washing the hands to the elbows wiping the head and washing the feet up to the ankles and there is a fifth pillar hidden which is the order face arms head feet you can't swap between these four because allah inserted something to be wiped between two organs to be washed and this indicates that the order is mandatory so this is a pillar and the sixth pillar is that you do not leave a gap because the process of wudu has to be simultaneously done now what you're saying is allah did not mention renzing the mouth and the nose in the quran and this is true but scholars say not mentioning it does not mean it is not mandatory because the prophet himself alahead had never in his life abandoned rinsing his mouth and nose when performing wudu and this is included in washing the faces as per the quran so washing the faces includes rinsing your mouth and nose though it was not mentioned but it is included likewise wiping over your head it includes wiping your ears though it was not mentioned in the quran how do we know sheikh well if it's obvious muslims learn and take their knowledge from the quran through the explanation of the prophet otherwise a smart jack or whatever would come and say in the quran fajr is not mentioned to be to raqqa married and isha to be four rakah and that's true so why do we pray it in this fashion the answer is because the prophet salallahu taught us how to pray it in this fashion so the sunna is an essential part and source of realm of knowledge of legislation in sharia without the sunnah you cannot be a muslim and this is an issue which secularists among those called muslims liberals living in the arab and muslim world are fighting tooth and nail they want to abolish the sunnah so when anyone says that quran is enough we don't want the sunnah disregard the sunnah what's the ruling on that every tom dick and harry knows that whoever claims that the quran is sufficient and we have to disregard the sunnay zakafir it's very simple because the quran itself says you have to depend on the sunnah and the teachings of the prophet these liberals and secularists fight tooth and nail for muslims to be confused and to abandon sunnah by abandoning the sunnah they've managed to demolish the structure of islam so once again do not learn from such people and take your knowledge from the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the favorite generations of the seraph of the sahaba taberin and taberet tabing"
