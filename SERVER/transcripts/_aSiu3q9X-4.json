  "transcript": "is there a historical record or evidence supporting the splitting of the Moon 1400 years ago to my best of knowledge the best evidence is the Quran so we believe in it and we believe in the authentic Hadith whether scientists prove this or not however the fourth highest ranking geologist in the world is do Z andar and I heard him State and I personally called him and I asked him about an interview that took place with him years ago where I heard this from him and he confirmed this and he said to me yes this is true I remember seeing in the world service Broadcasting Service the the BBC of of UK an interview with one of the scientists of geologists in NASA and he confirmed that through the studies to the Moon they found that there was a split on the surface of the Moon of Earth which they do not understand and they do not know the cause of and he told me that he heard this on this information except from Dr Z and I trust Dr Z he is mAh one of the greatest Muslim Scholars when it comes to science and Islam and I take his word for it but it doesn't matter much to me because I believe in what Allah has stated in the Quran that the moon was split and also what was mentioned in the where the Prophet challenged the pagans and the the people of Mecca when he said that if I split the moon into two halves would you believe me and he did this with the grace of Allah and Allah knows"
