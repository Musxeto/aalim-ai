  "transcript": "is from Hamid and Hamid says that he heard that on the day of judgment Sinners will be put in boxes and thrown in hell so that they would not see how the others are being punished and he's referring toah so he says is this true I've never ever heard such a thing in my life I I don't know of any such thing on the contrary the Quran and the Sunnah tells us that the people of hell they watch one another being punished and they exchange queries and questions and blame one another so what you have mentioned my friend Hamid I do not know any authentic source for it being put in a box and thrown into hell because being punished on your own can be a relief when you're punished publicly in front of everyone this adds to your humiliation and to your pain and Agony and this is all what hell is about and I would advise you as I would advise all of my brothers and sisters not to believe any such claims that come baseless without any evidence from the Quran or from the authentic Sunnah with the grace of Allah now you have knowledge at your fingertips the problem is that the enemies of Allah have used this useful tool to infiltrate the Muslims by inserting their fabricated and baseless lies to be part of our our Dean Islam is a very relig easy religion to learn and to acquire and the sources available for individuals to know what is right and what is wrong are alhamdulillah readily available everywhere but you have to know how to surf and how to investigate asking she Google doesn't do you any good there is a website in Arabic called it has great amount of information but it's in Arabic if you want something a little bit uh um suitable for your own there is this great website ww. Islam qa. info and you have questions and answers related to so many Islamic topics that would qualify this site in my opinion to be the best Islamic site available at the moment I use it I benefit from it and I get a lot of my translations through it if has an Arabic uh uh site and there are translations in English in Turkish in uru in like 18 or 19 different languages and the questions and answers are all authentic inshallah most authentic that you you can ever find so I advise you to visit such a site support it and uh see how you can benefit from it"
