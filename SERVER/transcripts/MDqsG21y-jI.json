  "title": "The referring of Allah as 'we' in the Quran",
  "transcript": "no this is not true this is a known way in arabic of glorifying a person so an individual could refer to himself as me and it is like a king or the queen of england when she writes a decline says that we the queen of england have uh ruled that so and so be so and so or that this person becomes a sir or to be knighted or whatever so she refers to herself as we in the sense that she is glorifying herself and allah of course without no doubt is the one who is to be glorified and this is why allah glorifies himself by saying we uh to himself and allah"
