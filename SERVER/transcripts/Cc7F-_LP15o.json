  "transcript": "he's asking about if a country rules with democracy or man-made laws and this country rules a muslim country is it is it a kafir con a government what is the reason behind asking such a questions admin one of two either to know or to act and 99.9 percent of people asking such a question usually are looking for a labeling concept so that they would act upon it so when someone says a government or a ruler is a kafir this ignites the idea of and overthrowing rebellions chaos killing and this is definitely not permitted in islam so first of all every country has scholars of its own real scholars not paid for scholars not scholars that work for the government i'm talking about real independent scholars your scholars have to be asked because they know the situation on the ground secondly the issue of ruling with man-made law is an issue of dispute now in the quran where you go to verse 44 45 and 47 of surat al-maidah chapter 5 you will find that allah azzawajal tells us that whoever does not rule with what allah has legislated or allah has revealed then those are the kaffiron disbelievers of ali moon transgressors the sinners so people usually take only the first description cafe roon and they neglect the transgressors and the sinners although it's in the same context and why is that because they want to follow their whims and desires by their concept everybody should rebel and start to fight and bloodshed and chaos and killing just to end like iraq like yemen like syria like libya and other countries this is what they want they don't see beyond the tip of their noses they're short-sighted this is not what islam preaches now theoretically those who implement other than sharia law are they kafir or valim or this depends on their intention and this is something only allah knows because if someone legislates something that goes against islam and says islam is not true not correct prescribing amputations for the thief and a flogging of the person who drinks intoxicants and become drunks drunk or flogging a person who slaunders or commits adultery or fornication or stoning for someone who came and said this is all not valid nowadays anyone who says this and legislates something else believing that what he's legislating it is better he's a kafir he's a tarot there's no doubt in the mind of any muslim now if someone says no it's not better but it's equivalent he's a tahoot when someone says i fully adhere to the islamic ruling and i believe sharia prevails and rules over but i fear for my throne i fear from the disbeliever countries i feel that my people would rebel against me blah blah blah but i believe in islam in sharia then he is a valim or a facebook she's a muslim so you have to look into things but and i say but with capital letter bold red underlined but you as a layman have no right to come and ask uh is the government kafir or not is the ruler kafir or not because this is a treat of the khawarij this is a tendency to slander to back by to curse to work underground in order to undermine the government or whatever and this is a formula of destruction fueled by the foreign intelligence agencies and fueled by shaytan so abide by the quran abide by the sunnah abide by the true real scholars in your country who call you for unity who ask you to be part of the community not to destroy your community and allah knows best ali from the uk you"
