  "transcript": "I'm a student when I am praying in my Academy I have to pray outside for there are only females but sometimes male attendants you know it's an academy and people walk around sometimes males might there is a chance that males might come in that area so since there is a doubt can I keep my nikab on while praying this is permissible if you fear that men will see your face due to the fact that you're praying outside and any given moment a man who's a non-mahram can pass by then there's no problem inshallah in you wearing the nakab for this reason but if you're inside the Masjid or if you are in a room that's closed and there is no possibility of men to see you it is mandatory for you to uncover your face Knows Best"
