  "title": "Etiquette of going to bed & adkhar before sleeping - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "one of the etiquettes that the prophet used to do and teach us teaches us to do is that whenever you want to go to bed the Sunnah is that you sweep your bed with the inside of your garment because you don't know what came after you on it whether it's bed bugs or the gin or the Devils so you sweep it with your the inside of your garment to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and once you're on your beted you start to say thear of bed time among them is cupping your hands blowing then reciting the last three then you wipe your entire body as you can then you cup it again you blow and then you recite the set again and you wipe and then you cup blow recite and third time you wipe and sallallah alaih wasallam used to often order his companions relatives and loved ones to observe thear of going to bed like in the previous Hadith we mentioned of likewise in the Hadith of Fatima and Ali may Allah be peace with them when he instructed them to say Subhan 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times Allah abbar 34 times before going to bed and he told them that this would give you energy better than having a servant in your home and the prophet himself used to recite Surah tabarak mul and we know we know that these 30 verses of the Quran will intercede for you will prevent you from being tormented in your grave with the grace of Allah and he used to recite and sometimes he used to recite is and and these take a lot of time but it shows you that going to bed is not a normal thing rather it is a form of worship that our Prophet used to doat now if we were to compare Apple to Apple how do we go to bed every single night do we follow these rituals do we perform W do we lie on our right hand side do we face the do we say thear do we cup our hands and blow and then wipe our bodies three times do we recite aat do we recite the last two verses of Surah Bak as instructed by the prophet Alam so many things that we fail miserably to follow the Sunnah of our model and this shows you the distance between us and him if we were to enter Paradise I know the vast majority of you hearing this would say is it mandatory she is it waj of course not the answer is no so a lot of you would their shoulders and say okay it's it's not mandat I'm not going to do it and in reply we would say okay if you're not interested in going to the highest level of paradise then don't do it it's all depending on how enthusiastic you are how interested how serious you are the more effort you put in a business most likely the more income you will get and the less effort the most likely your business will fail and be ruined don't do this with your Hereafter he's your role model he was sent to us for a purpose and that is to follow his footsteps so do your level best to follow him to follow him and when you go to bed tonight try your level best to follow these steps and inshallah Allah will make me and you among those to be resurrected under his flag"
