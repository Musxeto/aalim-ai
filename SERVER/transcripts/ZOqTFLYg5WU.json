  "title": "Buying a piece of land and hiding this from my husband",
  "transcript": "my sister has bought a piece of land from her earned income but she wants to hide it from her husband and from her in-laws till she builds it is this okay modly speaking if your husband is okay with that it's okay you're not lying you're hiding but I would consider it not to be a good thing to do with your husband because because I believe if if your husband did the same you would consider this to be cheating and life cannot go on in a perfect way between the spouses if they are hiding things over uh each other as for your in-laws yes you have all the right not tell anyone but if you were asked a straightforward question it would be a little bit difficult to beat around the bush you must not lie but you can say something that is probable but not considered to be lying and Allah Knows Best"
