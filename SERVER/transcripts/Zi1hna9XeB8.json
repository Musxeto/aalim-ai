  "title": "Have difficulty saying bismillah before wudu (OCD) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that he has a problem with saying bismillah before performing budo now anyone would relate to this question to be not normal there's something wrong with you you read the whole question without stuttering so you don't have a problem of saying bismillah no you can say in you said it bismillah bismillah three times in your question what's the problem the problem is shaytan is messing up with your head and the bigger problem is that you're believing him imagine someone comes to me in the morning and says ho how somebody look pale are you sick do you feel any tiresome do you have any pains and i say no but yeah i'm not that agile said oh you look really sick lots of the people when they're approached by others in such a manner they feel uh sick and false sick and this is their illusion lots of the people come to me in counseling sessions saying to me sheikh i have severe ocd sheikh i am sick sheikh i can't do this because i can i i'm telling them are you telling me this are you convincing me with it you don't have to repeat it ten times i've heard you the first time repeating it ten times mean that you are convincing yourself and this is the biggest illness you're not ill you have nothing you have no ocd but some of us feel happy when people show their sympathy and pity over them oh the poor sheikh he has ocd he's he has mental issues he cannot do this he cannot do that and when i feel that they're talking about me in such a yeah sympathetic way i feel good i'm getting attention and this is sick your subconscious is playing things on you and so many people with the grace of allah when counseling them in one session they're done they're they're done they're cute i don't cure them i'm not a psychiatrist i have no knowledge in it they need someone to open their eyes and tell them what's happening and to show them the truth in their face and they've never heard this before so most likely you have a big problem and you're convincing yourself of this problem sit in your room don't do and say bismillah bismillah bismillah you have no problem go to the uh uh basin and try to make udon say bismillah i can't look in the mirror and say you can't say it don't be a chicken go ahead say it make my day and you'll find that bismillah yeah i have no problem why was it so big a problem for the past six seven months because shaytan was messing up with your head and you were giving him headway okay please yeah go ahead yeah i'll follow so now there's no problem coming back to the core of your question the vast majority of muslims say that this hadith is not mandatory to say bismillah and it's not authentic and this is not authentic so there is no problem in doing a rudolph without saying bismillah your wudu is valid because the hadith is not authentic and even if it's authentic it is a recommendation not as something that is mandatory and allah knows best"
