  "transcript": "is with their mandatory it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion and the majority of Muslims they say according to a hadith of Arab Adam know Psalm 8 may Allah be pleased with him that it is not mandatory the only thing that is mandated in the five daily prayers which the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam has stated in hadith Hamza Salah what five mandatory prayers that Allah has obligated upon his servants whoever performs them on time and perfects their wool and their Recor and their sujood he has a pledge with allah azza wajal to forgive his sins and whoever doesn't then it is up to Allah whether to forgive or to punish so Abadan Islamic said this hadith when he heard that there were other companions stating that whitter is watching so he got angry and he said no this is not true and the evidence is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so I hope this answers your question"
