  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] Al dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to Mercy to the world sallallah alai the prophet sallallahu Al wasam it was time for him after spending 13 years in Mecca under the tyranny of the kishis under the oppression migrate with his companions to a safe haven to a place where the Nation of Islam the Muslims would have their own sovereign country to be able to practice Islam to be able to worship Allah to be able to protect those who were interested and Keen in embracing Islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam migrated to Ahmed the prophet migrated to Medina Medina now the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when going to Medina it wasn't easy and he had to pass a lot of difficulties to reach there and one may ask why do the messengers of Allah have to face such difficulties the answer would be that this is part of the training that Allah asael gives his Messengers and it's also part of their process of elevating their levels in paradise and granting them lots and lots of good deeds for their patience if you recall the messenger of of Allah Noah had also difficulties with his people if you also recall the messenger of Abraham message of Allah Abraham also had to migrate and leave his country his homeland because of the oppression of his father and his people his grandson Jacob and you all know that the father of Jacob was you have Abraham who had two sons Isaac Isaac and ishma and Isaac had a son who is Jacob and Jacob had a son who was Yousef Yousef Joseph so the prophet was once asked sallallahu alaihi wasallam who is the son of the generous or or or or noble people so he told them it is Joseph the son of Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Abraham all prophets of Allah so even Jacob had to migrate and go to Egypt and then the people of Egypt oppressed those the sons of Israel B Isel and they themselves had to flee the hardship and tyranny of uh pharaoh and it goes on and on and on and the last messenger before our Prophet Alam Jesus Christ may peace and blessing of Allah be upon him and upon all Messengers of Allah also faced difficulties with the Jews when they did not accept him and when they slandered him and did so uh awful things to him that is why it's the same practice with our Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam the final messenger of Allah he had to migrate to Medina and he had to fool the people of Mecca because they would not leave him and he migrated when he knew that they were going to assassinate him so he put his cousin alib AB Talib in his bed so that they would be deceived by that and they would think that this was the prophet himself Alam and he set on his journey With His companion Abu Bakr sik may Allah be pleased with him what we can learn from this point that Ali he sacrificed by himself and sleep in the bed of prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that mean that sacrificed by himself so what we can learn from this point of course nowadays it's not as clear as it was in the old days at the time of the Prophet each and every individual would be W more than happy would be willing to sacrifice his life for the life of the Prophet Alat wasam and in an Arabic there is a a statement that most of the companions would usually say that we give our mothers and fathers in your sacrifice oh prophet of Allah we're willing to sacrifice our own flesh and blood for your safety and for your life the prophet of Allah now the Talib was the cousin of the prophet he was about 16 17 years of age so he was a young man a little bit older than or less and he willingly did this knowing that there's a possibility that they may assassinate him instead but he did this from his own self he took the initiative and he would consider to be he would consider himself to be doing a great thing for Islam and for his cousin the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam and of course it's it's a well-known fact to all Muslims that alib AB Talib was one of the bravest soldiers of Islam and we will get to know a little bit more and more about this great companion of our messenger sallahu alaihi wasallam we spoke about the journey itself from meca to Medina and we have to know that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam entered Medina on Monday and he stayed inba well he it there wasn't a Masid at the time so he stayed at the outskirts of Medina for a number of days he came on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday so he stayed there for five days and the minute he came to Kuba he instructed them to establish or to build the Masjid ofba and the Masjid ofba exists until this very moment and the prophet told us that whoever prays two raas in that particular mid M this would be equivalent to one so it's a great reward for those who visit Med to go and pray in that Masid the prophet Alat as reported by Al IM alkari in theah had the habit of going to Kuba every single Saturday to pray in that Masjid throughout his life or the remaining life of his in Medina 10 years and it's about five miles away from uh uh Medina where he lived and he used to walk that distance or right every single Saturday so it is a place worthy of us visiting and praying in whenever inshallah Allah grants us this chance few days after the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam migrated his wife caught up with him and if you recall that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married after the death of his wife Khadijah and he married an old woman Muslim woman that's called No Khadijah was his first wife when she passed away he married another one her name was SA B zum so this was his second wife and he also married AA which was the do the daughter of His companion Abu Bakr sik few days later they caught up with him uh SAA his daughter um Kum his daughter Fatima and also us Z and and his mother uman they all caught up with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in Medina now the prophet stayed there inba for 5 days and then he sent to benar and they are his uncles from his mother's side and they came to protect the prophet Alat wasam they sent 100 of their armed men to accompany the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he enters Medina they came and they went with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in a convoy that was very nice to look at 100 men in their arms protecting this man and His companion Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him they set off on Friday but Friday prayer caught up with them in the middle of the way so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prayed with those who were with him in an area where they have now a Masjid called Masid aladi the the the the mosque of the valley and then they went on to Medina now the minute the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam entered Medina anas Malik may Allah be pleased with him the the servant of the Prophet Alam said that everything lit literally when the prophet came to Medina the first day and everything the whole world turned into darkness when he passed away so he gives a comparison of when he came in and when he died the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this was in the hearts of the Believers because they've anticipated this moment all of their lives he was the man that Allah Almighty guided them with to this beautiful religion it was he who took them with the grace of Allah from the darkness into the light so the minute he walked in to Medina every single house was praying was wishing and was hoping that the prophet would come and stay with them cuz it's an honor Second To None So the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam whenever some of his companions took the Rope of the camel he was riding on to guide that to his house he would say leave the camel because Allah ordered that Camel to do what it was told to do so they left the camel and it's a habit it's a Sunnah that the Muslims used to call their ride with names so the prophet used to call his sword the prophet used to to call S wasallam his camel and and the name of the camel was Alas and which means it's a name it's just a name so if someone's name is uh Ali for example it might have a meaning but some names are just names you call a city jeda or Cairo or London it's a name and also he had a mule that's called juljul so and and some dresses he used to name so there are names and and and different uh uh uh names to things that he used to uh uh use sallallahu alhi wasallam I believe that we have a short break so inshallah stay tuned and inshallah we will be right [Music] back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or

TV so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for [Music] you and welcome back back before the break we were talking about the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam entering Medina so everyone of the companions wanted to have the honor of hosting the prophet Alat wasam in his house and the prophet told them leave it leave the camel because it knows where to stay it was ordered by Allah so the camel went to the current location of the mosque it went a little bit forward and then it went back again and the camel stayed there so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam knew that this was the location and this was the place one of the companions sallallah wasallam was Abu anari and because his house was a bit close to the area so without asking anyone he took the luggage of the prophet alham and took it inside his house he didn't consult anyone because you have to seize the opportunity if you wait you're going to lose it so the minute he went in the people of the the companions around the prophet each sallallahu alaihi wasallam requested that they have the honor of Hosting him because their house is closer so he said well a man follows his luggage so Abu a took the luggage I have to follow him so he went and stayed with Abu a alansari may Allah be pleased with him Abu a had a house that had two floors so he insisted that the prophet Alat wasam stays in the Upper Floor and the prophet told him sallallahu alaihi wasallam that it is more convenient for my companions and myself that I stay at the uh uh ground floor so that would be accessing me would be much easier than if I were to be in the second floor and Abu a had to agree at the beginning and in one incident when the prophet stayed at the ground floor and he was with his family on the top they spelled some water on the floor and they started putting all the clothes they had on that spot of water so that it would not leak on the prophet Alat they were afraid that a single drop would irritate the prophet alham dropping from the ceiling and you just can imagine the love they had to the prophet Alat to the extent that not even one single drop they wanted to fall on him sh I want to I want you to tell us about the story because I heard the story that the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam how he make the the companes uh feel uh familiar which which with each other when they come to Medina I heard a story about comp ABD rman and and said to ABD rman come and you can have a look to one of my two wives and you can take one of them and you can share my money yeah this this this was mentioned earlier and we spoke that the prophet when he went to Medina he had a problem because all of the companions that migrated from Mecca they've left or they were forced to leave all their possessions so they did not take any of their wealth they did not have the chance to sell any of their property so they came without nothing without anything they were literally broke so the only way for them to share a decent life was to be compensated by the people of Medina having said that the people of Medina themselves were not stingy people they were generous Believers so they came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and told him oh prophet of Allah our Farms our palm trees half of it to you and to your companions imagine giving half of what you ow to strangers yeah yet the prophet did not approve of that so they told him okay how about if our brothers work in our Farms as farmers and we split the fruit the the harvest between us so he agreed to that so so Medina was kind of a a rich country Rich Town iture yes it was an oasis so it was in the middle of the desert surrounded by mountains and it was the the land was so rich that it was filled with Farms palm trees and so on and all the Caravans going to the North had to pass through Medina to get water and to get to do trading their own trading going back to your question Ahmed the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he arrived in Medina immediately he established a bondage between those who migrated and those who were actually the people of Medina who were famous be called the ansar the ansar the supporters so he made a bondage between every muhajer every immigrant and one of the the ansar by making them brothers so he said abdb You Who Came From Mecca and who is from Medina are brothers and hamd the uncle of the Prophet is the brother of so and so Abu Bakr is the brother of so and so Ali is the brother of so and so and they had this bondage between them to the extent that if anyone died his brother would inherit him ABD was a rich Merchant but he came to Medina and he had nothing so told him this is my wealth I'm one of the most richest people in Medina Medina take half of it and I have two wives I'll show you one of them I'll show them to you and you have the right to choose whomever you want yeah this to the extent that literally half of what I have is yours it's hard to imagine the the feeling it is it's extremely hard unless you don't like your wives but this was not the case you have to imagine and remember that the Arabs at that time were extremely jealous people they love their wives and they could not allow anyone to talk at them or to say bad things about them in Islam if a person says a bad word against a woman who's a Muslim woman if he does not bring four Witnesses he is punished by being lashed 80 times yeah on his back because of this word that he said so if he says that this woman is is has a bad uh Behavior she's not clean she's not honest she's not uh chased this is his punishment unless he has four Witnesses so they were jealous people but this shows you the extent of the faith in their hearts that enables them to get rid of half of the what they own to as complete stranger they've just come to know a couple of weeks ago it's the bondage of Faith Iman and Islam that connected them uh going on to uh uh the prophet Sall wasallam stay now they've located allocated this area where the Camel had sat and it was obvious that this would be the place for a Masjid so he asked the prophet alai wasam about this area and he was told that it belonged to two orphans with the companion as z may Allah be pleased with him so he started bargaining with the orphans to to buy it from them and they refused they said no this is for Allah and for his messenger and the prophet Sall wasallam insisted because it is for to Allah it has to be bought so he bought the piece of land he started cleaning the piece of land there were a few palm trees there were a few uh uh Graves for polytheists so he dug all of this out he cut the trees he fixed the land and and he used the trunks of these trees to build the walls and the ceiling which was not a fancy Masid as you may uh uh uh think it was a very basic Masid very simple very simple but the consequences that would come out of this mid were unbelievable he instructed his companions to start building the walls with stones with uh clay and they built this Masjid that would protect them from the heat of the Sun from the wind and from the rain though rain still fell in and you can recall hadiths uh from the prophet Sall wasallam prostrating in mud so it wasn't just a Masjid well it wasn't as we may call a Masjid a place for uh uh worship and prayer but it was more than that and we will come to this point inshallah ahead uh in time also the prophet had two rooms built for him and his wives so he had a room for SAA and he has a room had a room for and at the time the was in the direction of masida in Jerusalem MH so when he was in Mecca they used to pray to the north and that was not a very difficult thing to do because they had ala in between so they could always pray in the direction of Kaa and direction also of Jerusalem and we also have to know that the prophet sallallah wasam when he went to Medina though he spent only s days he built three masjids the Masjid of Kuba the Masjid of alwadi and the Masjid of Medina Masjid nawi which indicates to us that the role of Masjid is not only a place of worship it is far more than that and we will get into this inshallah uh uh on a later stage now it was time as we we have a Masjid to call the people to come and pray and at the time of the Prophet they did not have means of fast communication so what was the logical thing to call how how was it easy for us to call people to pray the companions has had their different opinions some said why not have a bell like the Christians do so whenever it's time for prayer we ring the bell others say why not have a horn like the Jews so that whenever it's time for prayer we blow the horn and people come and the prophet Sall wasallam did not like both uh uh uh ways because it was unlam my cameraman unfortunately tells me that this is all the time we have for today's program but inshallah when we meet next time we're going to elaborate a little bit more more about how thean started in Islam and until [Music] then [Music] [Music] h [Music] oh"
