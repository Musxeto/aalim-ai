  "transcript": "second question is between backbiting and complaining complaining is part of backbiting but it is like giving it another name it's like when you bribe someone and you say that this is not a bribe this is a gift this is there's just two a token of appreciation and gratitude it's a bribe at the end of the day so it is backbiting however scholars say that if this complaint has a legitimate reason such as I'm complaining to the judge of someone who stole my money this is legitimate reason I'm complaining to my boss for someone who is abusing his time or the company's assets in something Haram this is legitimate and it's not backbiting because you are saving the company's assets etc but if someone is paying money for his aunt or so and people are complaining to him and accusing her of being stingy saving her pension not doing this this is not permissible this is back-biting most likely"
