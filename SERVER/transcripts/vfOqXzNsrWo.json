  "transcript": "you're welcome Musa from Saudi Arabia uh is asking about a female who is a Muslim and she works in a hotel I'm not going to go into the ruling on working in hotels or dealing with non Maham this is all known to you we have a specific uh uh situation in this hotel there was a resident for a long time a non-muslim who was impressed by her kindness and devotion and probably she helped him so many times being old ill Etc so what he died and he committed suicide or he died naturally doesn't matter leaving a will behind giving her a share of his property or of his wealth making her the beneficiary or one of the beneficiary of uh this will so so does Islam allow her to accept this the answer is yes whenever a non-muslim dies and he writes a will this is permissible to take from that will but if he dies without keeping a will and his son his wife his daughter they are Muslims they cannot inherit because the prophet said the Muslim does not inherit a cafir and a cafir does not inherit a Muslim it shows the separation due to religion the will is a different Pro uh uh um issue because a will is actually a gift to materialize after the death of the person unlike inheritance which is god-given and it's something that is mentioned in the scriptures or in the uh books so there is no problem insh in accepting that will"
