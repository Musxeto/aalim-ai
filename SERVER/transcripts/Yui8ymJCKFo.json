  "title": "Will we be rewarded for giving dawah & someone follows it? (Chain of goodness) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay for example um one person was listening to you yes yes and after listening you an emotion arises in this person okay and like he he tries to increase in goodness yes so will you write it the theme for his duties of course why do you think i'm doing this program if i understand your question is whenever i give an advice whenever i give a reminder if the viewers or one of them is reacting to that positively and he may go and say the vicar i just repeated or pray the namaz or the prayers i've just instructed him to do or refrain from haram which i have warned him from would i be rewarded most certainly yes and this is why allah says in the quran woman there is no one better than those there is no one better in rhetoric than those who call others for allah and do righteous deeds and proclaim i am among the muslims there is no one better than them so if you do this to your family then you get the same reward if you share a lecture that's beneficial or a description of how to pray or a warning from a sin a link with others and you manage whether you know it or not succeed in making these people comply you will be automatically rewarded of course i will be rewarded because i've initiated that and my teachers will be rewarded because they taught me this and the prophet saws at the end of the day he's the highly the most highly rewarded person on earth because all goodness goes accredited to him so definitely there's nothing that beats giving da'wah and correcting people's akida and calling them to to heed and to the quran and to the sunnah muhammad"
