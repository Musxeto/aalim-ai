  "transcript": "this fourth question is why are the parents of the prophet alison in hell this question you do not ask me about this question is something that the prophet himself is told us about and the hadith is muslim his father a man came to him and said o prophet of allah where's my father so the prophet said your father is in hell how did the prophet know allah because allah told him so the man did not feel well about the answer the prophet said to him your father and my father are in hell and another hadith the prophet wept one day so they asked him why are you weeping he said i sought permission from allah to seek forgiveness for my mother and he denied me from seeking forgiveness for her which means that in accordance to the ayah in surat that the prophet and the believers are not permitted to seek forgiveness for those who died on idol worshipping even if they were next of kin end of story now this was the prophet's fatwa not mine not sheikh xyz it was from the prophet himself islam and it's not in a dubious book it's in sahih al-imam muslim the most authentic book alongside with the bukhari after the quran so why this is not our issue or problem because this is from allah azzawajal it's a revelation you can say that maybe because the people of mecca had the religion of ibrahim this is why they were performing hajj they were doing tawaf and they had the original religion of ibrahim of worshipping allah until he and his son ismail was their forefather and there was the religion of judaism and christianity which they had could have adopted anyone so these religion of monetism were there but they failed to choose it so those who fail to choose it would end up in hell this might be a reason i don't know what i know is what the prophet said to us we have to believe and comply and allah knows best you"
