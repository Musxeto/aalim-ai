  "transcript": "wiping on the socks and I could not understand uh what kind of socks but usually people ask about socks that are thin or seethrough or made of uh u nylon or whatever anything that you wear on your foot regardless of how transparent it is, how thin it is, what fabric it is made, it's not necessarily to be made only from leather. No, it can be made from any fabric and it can be see-through. There is no problem in that. Any fabric that it is made of as long as it fits on your foot and you wear it in the first place while you were in the state of original purity after washing your feet and everything and you put it on after you break your woodoo and you want to perform woodoo, you can wipe over that without any problem.
