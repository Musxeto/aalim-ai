  "transcript": "in alhamdulillah um Muslim [Music] [Music] come on [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] foreign [Music] it's the most honorable form of worship where you submit your will to Allah and express your humility your humbleness and your poverty to your lord Allah says in the Quran what translates to and when my servant [Music] concerning me indeed I am near I respond to the invocation of the supplement when he calls upon me however Dura in our perspective in what the vast majority of us think is related to one aspect when it is actually related to you so no is divided in our times the first time of praising Allah the almighty glorifying Allah without us asking or demanding anything the prophet said the best is foreign what did you ask for the prophet also said the prayer of the known is their money they do in his passenger Euros for the one who was swallowed by the whale the prayer of the Lord when he was in the belly of the fish there is no God worthy of being worshiped except you glory to you verily ours one of the wrong doers the prophet says a Muslim never calls upon his Lord with these words concerning any matter but his prayer is answered what did he ask for nothing he just praised the glorified Allah and this is at the top of all types of Torah So when you say this is when you say alhamdulillah the Almighty the second type of Dua is what we all know is when you want something from Allah and you do not praise him like you asked Allah to pay off your debts to cure your ill loved ones anything from this Dunya or from the national and the most authentic opinion is that both types of drunk are interleaved because when you ask about to pay off your debt you're actually worshiping Allah expressing your humility and poverty to him and praising him thus far also when you only say that is [Music] what about the people regarding to him as YouTube people are divided into extremes and middle path when it comes to Europe a lot of the people are happy with their level of Elan they don't supplicate to Allah to uplift the sins that exist in their homes that angers a lot of Almighty they do not call up Allah day and night to rectify their Affairs to guide their minds their stances and their offspring they do not ask Allah to help them and support them in observing and maintaining time rarely you will find someone making to happen that Allah makes his heart steadfast on Islam and that he dies upon Islam though this was the vast majority of Dua of the Prophet is so this is type number one of his teams those who do not make it to harm how many times have you entered the Masjid early and did we have had any problem look around rarely seen some seeing someone raising his hand making your maybe someone will be reading the Quran maybe someone will be looking at the chandeliers and the decorations and looking around at people here and there rarely you'll find someone engaging and insisting upon Allah for whatever reason he has in mind so the one extreme is those who do not make you up why number one because they're elegant I personally know people who refuse to make your own in calamities and when you ask them because why don't you do do I am your son is in the hospital they Dora raise your hands they said I don't make you out when I am healthy and wealthy foreign [Music] this arrogance this Pride takes you straight to Hell Fire Allah says in the Quran and your Lord says call upon me I will respond to you indeed those who this say My Worship will enter Heaven render contemplative subhanallah those who have been them and they refuse to worship Allah and to make your hand from Allah this is what would happen to the family some of these extremists don't make Dua except tell them and if they do make you up they allergic outcomes a habit like most people they have this habit after finishing for prayer they raise their hands and they start mumbling words looking around and they've been neglect from if you ask them what did you say they will failure because they used to say it has of a habit not as of a meeting and this is not part of the student their mind is not attentive what they think you are but they make it because everybody is making it what is a habit the prophet says and invoke Allah while you are certain that he will answer you and acknowledge Allah does not answer a heart or a love that's not your answer and invocation that comes from a heedless neglectful heart therefore you have to be aware the less the further away from my heart this is 16. the other type of extremistness when it comes to God are those who transgress in Europe yes that you may God but they transgress Allah says in the Quran call upon your lord in humility and privately indeed he does not like transgressors how can a person transvestiture when you ask Allah something that you know that Allah would not make it happen so you say oh Allah deprive me from the need of food and drinks until I die so you want to live without leaving and drinking allow me to fly without wings or to walk on water give me the beauty of yourself or the reign of prophet Solomon and you know that this is not possible because rather than hate not to be possible this is all part of transgression part of transgression into one is to make Joy against your wife your spouse your children may Allah destroy you may Allah do this may Allah do that make me die you lose all my money why are you doing this or asking Allah to assist you on harm I can become rich may Allah facilitate them I date beautiful women and women who are you calling and who are you seeking his assistance this is part of transgression in Europe also part of transgression is raising your voice when supplicating to Allah and we see this and come when people make power of inside and they shout and everybody is annoyed who are you shouting for the prophet said when he heard his companions raising their voices he said all people take it easy foreign [Music] [Music] though he is upon his throne over the heavens he is with us with his healing we see with visibility which is control with his power subhanallah and this is the understanding of the companions may I look at least with them students he heard one of his sons making Durham and he this son says o Allah grant me the White House over the right side to the people who enter Jannah [Music] that's it and do not transgress because I heard the prophets people who transgress in Moodle and in making Dua and part of transgressing in your Quran is what some people who think oh Allah when I enter agenda I don't want to go ready I just want my wife this is transgression and you are this is nothing to you Allah Allah commanding Allah this will be in Jannah and you are coming to say I want this and I want that this is translation oh foreign [Music] [Music] raise your hands Facebook though this is not mandatory neither Grace in your hands it is highly recommended that you praise Allah and it's shameful when we want to praise Allah we just saying that's it I praise the Lord actually you have to praise Allah with his beautiful names beautiful names of Allah if you calculate them memorize them know that feeling Implement them you will entertain them how many names do you know 15. well you are way shortly so you have to work on that praise Allah glorify Allah with words with attributes with names that he loves then offers salutation upon the prophet Allah in humility in submissiveness in expressing your need to your lord in the morning and the evening because we cannot take a breath without his permission the blood does not run in our veins without his permission we are in need of him and he is not in need of anyone of us and this is why the prophet said the weakest of all people is the one who cannot make you up we tell people go to cover sit in front of the copper raise your hands and bring you up and he says after 20 seconds I'm done what is this people spend hours begging online he said I ask everything I wanted 20 seconds then you don't know what you want and you don't know who Allah is what I says ask Allah for everything even for your shoelace ask alarm for everything now be aware that when you raise your hands as modernity the prophet says Allah the almighty is back full and these generous and he is possible to return his servant's hands when he raises them to him empty-handed he will not do that and if we know that we know that a lot of the Muslims ask I have asked a lot of soldier for three or four five years and he's not responding what's the problem have I done something wrong and this is not right the prophet that is that Allah answers all to us but the manifestation of his answering differs so you can ask Allah for a thousand KBs who am I used to Allah number two you can ask Allah for a thousand KD Allah pray ordained that you will be involved in a car accident or one of your children you will fall sick or a Calamity would be fall upon you that's worth a thousand KD from your pocket away from you so you don't do the compass how many times have you said to your spouse or to your friends yesterday I was this close to make an accident I avoided it because I'm a good driver because I know how to do this it is because of your job you've been asking a lot for so many things about answering and manifest [Music] [Music] and you look around and says I think this is not mine and you to be told no it is yours you used to make a lot of Torah and now it is paid time Allah how many times have made neglected making love there are times that Allah answers your Dua if you were just where to meet them but it's your hard part it's your sealed tongue that prevents you from begging from expressing your humility to Allah what are the times there are so many times for you to make Dua between at the last third of the night this is a blessed time before future by half an hour or an hour you pray to help you you make your hands usual you make God before the heaven this is what the setup needs to do all the time nobody Sleeps at this time they need the Quran they deliver they ask Allah for forgiveness also the last hour of Friday you enter the Massachusetts and so many Muslim countries and how do you learn and you are so pleased to find the youth and a lot of the Muslims sitting half an hour before Mother raising their hands engaging it throughout all life increases you we have Allah this time others are neglectful that heatless they're watching harm they're listening to how long they're engaged and how long these guys are making drama be one of them also when you're traveling the prophet says look in the airplane when you find everybody who's on their headphones watching movies rarely you'll find someone leading up a copy of the Quran or raising his hands engaging in God and some of us unfortunate people have compromised their beliefs [Music] people will laugh people will think I'm crazy subhanallah do what pleases Allah don't care about these people few years and there will be six feet under turning into dust and it won't matter whether they praise you or criticize you okay only about what Allah from you also when it's rainfall this is and there are so many times and you have to make sure that there are there aren't anything blocking your door because there are blockers your door is not going to be accepted what this country if I don't believe work I don't eat and then we have do you deal in favor do you take price do you cheat in invoices do you deal under the table do you consume your partner's wealth without him knowing do you take wealth from your spouse without he she or he knowing about it consumption of harm has many many ways and forms and unfortunately a lot of those things are falling into it you have to be sure that there are no lovers like oh Allah I have called you day and night for three nights and you haven't answered me I'm not going to make your eye anymore this would lock your gun from being accepted if you maybe you are your kids Allah will block this and will not accept it therefore I encourage myself and you to engage in making God in suffocating to Allah we need Allah he doesn't need us never ever have this wrong attitude of thinking that Allah is appeal to us a colleague or a subordinate Allah is the Supreme owner of this universe if he throws everything in his Universe in Hell Fire no one can object or ask a question so these creations are his when you supplicate and invoke to him do that with Humanity and acknowledge that you're a servant you're a slave you're nothing and you're begging him and myself enemy aware and careful not to put yourself in the face of the supplication of someone who was wrong dumb don't transgress against people don't consume people's rights don't oppress those who are under you who work for you and think that I have the power that I am an open I am this or that one gallon from someone who's oppressed has nothing between it and Allah and it will reach and Allah would stay to it I will honor him and I will answer you after a while you know I find them whatever the video"
