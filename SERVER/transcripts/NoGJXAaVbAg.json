  "title": "Should we send salutations upon our Prophet when we hear the athan & Iqama? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now I think we will conclude with this last last question we have like three minutes Shahab says do we have to send blessing that is salutation to the prophet Aslam when we hear his name in the van Annie Palmer the short answer is no the Prophet is awesome whenever his name is mentioned in a shadow and the mohammed ur rasoolallah you do not say allahumma salli wa sallim ala muhammad because neither the Prophet did it so some know the Companions know the Abilene and beside if we say that it's obligatory then the more other than himself when he's calling the Adhan he has to stop and pause for it and this is not true and it is not from the Sunnah and hence one should refrain from doing this yes we offer salutation to the Prophet as Salam 24/7 but not with such specific earth car because the F car is mandated by Allah so John and given to us by the Prophet is awesome we cannot reinvent the wheel so if someone sneezes and says I'll help doodler a llama salli wa sallim ala muhammad say dope what are you doing he said I'm offering salutation to the Prophet what's wrong in that said ah hey the Prophet told us to say alhamdulillah full stop adding anything else would be an innovation is not permissible"
