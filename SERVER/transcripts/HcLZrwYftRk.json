affection and mercy now we go to the machines the mouse is filled but we have to make a distinction or conflict you may disagree but we are talking about even a very very long time so why these differences and I was happy and what are the ways and one other ways to solve them so first of all they were time but we remember what we teach them it is not we resolve them and you have rules of engagement we have to get things started first of all the conflict between the spouses have many has many reasons for it it can be natural illumination so my nozzle she is calm you are wise she's mice or both of you can be without either baby she comes from a background different than yours so it's human issue exam reasons might be related to social factors his family her family and the friends and the pressure and the media ignorance of the publications and of their own rights so of the reasons for example if you look into America and you find problems one of the prominent reasons for such a problem is ye the man eyes this might be nice to him why would be after my first elimination the woman is intimidated by the man why do you do this he's intimidated by the woman why did you do this and you miss my mobile sites so they lie behind their own shortcoming small fear of confrontation that led the field of competition so many people have it in them that they cannot confront us so even
