  "transcript": "sufyan says if i miss fajr prayer and i wake up and the sun is just about to rise or it's halfway rising we know that we're not permitted to pray at these prohibited times so what to do you're not allowed to pray at these prohibited times if it is voluntary prayers but mandatory prayers followed prayers or prayers that you overslept and you're doing it because you just woke up such as the sunnah and the fajr prayer itself there's nothing wrong even if the sun is rising to pray it at all insha'allah"
