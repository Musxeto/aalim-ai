  "transcript": "uh was about what they call the breathable uh nail polish so about a couple of years ago there's this company that says that we've produced uh a special form of material that allows water to go inside um its small particles and this would permit a woman uh uh to do wo while wearing her special uh nail polish and some of them they call it Islamic nail polish and the word Islamic is now a pre uh U it's a word that is attached to anything you want so you have Islamic banking you have Islamic food halal food which is halal definitely Islamic banking exist but not to the extent to have this as a cheap label and just put Islamic on whatever you want so you will have tomorrow Islamic nashed Islamic songs you have a an artist Nashid artist on the piano or playing the violin or his guitar and he's saying this Islamic Nashid and then you have Islamic dancing and who knows uh uh what will the future hold for us you see on uh um these got talents countries got talents in in Southeast Asia I've seen Muslim women with hijab dance Ing and playing the music and this is Islam you kidding me this is the new liberal Islam that they're promoting in the in the region when you have such people who are so far away from Islam and they would like to justify their sins by claiming that it's Islamic this is nonsense so there is nothing as Islamic nail polish now this particular company or brand that claims that it makes woodo permissible this is not true because as it sticks to your finger and there's a layer it's not a color if it's a color like H there's no problem but when there's a layer even if you claim that water goes through it making it wet does not suffice the water has to run making it moist does not suffice likewise if I put my hands over a steamer and the steam is coming out and I just do this and i' I've Comm I've performed wo because it's moist no this does not work this way and Allah Knows Best"
