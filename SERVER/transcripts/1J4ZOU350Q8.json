  "title": "My husband's father died, my husband's sister died, my husband died",
  "transcript": "I'm sorry I emailed you twice but still the answer is not clear to me what I want to know is there is a widow her husband's father died first leaving a property of worth Â£12,000 then her husband's sister died then her husband died and at the last her husband's mother died all of this time the property was not distributed now the Widow is left with nine children and her sister-in-law left two sons who are well off who will get how much and can the W ask the two sons to leave their share I've answered this uh sister in the email and I said that no she is not supposed to ask the two sons to leave their share because it's their share it would be like begging for it as for the property that was not distributed you should follow the sequence so so the first one to die is the father who is the grand father of the children living now who is your father-in-law so you should distribute what he had left up uh upon those who inherited him so if your husband was one of them and he had only one sister in this case he gets 2/3 and the sister gets 1/3 now after that uh uh okay then her husband's sister died when the sister died your husband does not get anything because she left two sons so the sons take her share from her father's inheritance when your husband uh uh [Music] died his share in his father's inheritance would be distributed upon you you your nine children and his mother and the mother would get one six of his inheritance from his father and when his mother died then we have to look at those who she left behind and give them this uh share this is the only way of doing it and there is nothing I can do more to clarify this I don't know uh uh about your situation or about uh the two sons of your sister-in-law but if they from their own side donate and give this share alhamdulillah to go and ask them this would be like begging it's like saying is it possible is it permissible for me to go to my neighbor and beg him for food or beg him for the rent of next month and the answer would be no it is not because begging is not permissible in Islam and Allah [Music] knows"
