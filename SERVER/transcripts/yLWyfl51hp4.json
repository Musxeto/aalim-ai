  "title": "Ruling on being an Agent / Middlemen & making profit on products you don't possess - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "number two being a an agent or a middle man as he explains this all revolves on selling and making a profit of something that you do not risk what do you mean by risking when i buy this pen and i possess it now there is a risk that no one will buy it off me and i lose so if i bought it for a single dollar i want a dollar and a half and i wait for a couple of weeks nobody's interested i have to go down and say okay it's a dollar 20 cents a dollar and five cents nobody's interested i have time versus cost because i have a shop i have this i have that i have to pay and the money that i have invested is not revolving it's stagnant so i said i'll buy i'll sell it for a dollar this is the cost nobody's buying it i'll go to 75 cents now i'm selling with loss so this is halal because i can make profit and i also can make loss so this is halal transaction now when i sell something i do i do not possess and there is no danger on me and there is no risk on me this is for this falls under the hadith of hakeem may allah be pleased with him when he said that the prophet said i said do not sell what you do not possess so someone comes to me and says i'm interested in a pen like this and i don't have the pen and i said okay no problem i'll sell it for you for a dollar and a half he said okay i agree a done deal we shake hands the the deal is done i sold and he bought whether he gave me the money or not whether i gave him the merchandise or not this is beside the point the transaction is final it's verbal i go and look for a pen and come back and give it to him and he gives it gives me the money this is haram because i sold what i do not possess and i'm not talking about a selem transaction this is a different ball game altogether the mistake that commonly is done nowadays is when i go to a car mechanic and i say my car is broke i need you to fix it so he looks into it said okay should i fix it i said yeah fix it and if you need buy the spare parts and i'll pay you for them so he goes and he buys the spare parts and he tops his profit on the spare parts and he charges me for his labor by topping his profit on the spare parts he actually sold me what he did not possess and i'm not fine with that likewise if you're doing a job for a company and you go buy the raw material they think that it costs x and you put profit on that you cannot do this without their consent or you're telling them that i'm having a 10 or 15 percent on top of the spare parts that i'd buy or you guys go and buy it yourself and provide me with it i'll charge you for my labor but to make profit on the spare parts which you did not possess and on this a labor of yours without them knowing this is not a permissible allah"
