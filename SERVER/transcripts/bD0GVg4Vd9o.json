  "transcript": "so shake my question is that I am totally depressed and lost my strength about this issue that I have read a book uh nullifiers of Islam and the third nullify that not considering policest polytheist makes you a character Sheikh I for example like see a Muslim so-called namely Muslim on the TV and he as some Idols in his house or uh he is married to a Hindu wife or I see someone join politician like in a cafe country namely Muslim and I see someone like bareilly Imam to Sheikh so Sheikh the issue of what to do in this because if I refrain uh these comes to my mind like the third elephant and if I make the hadees comes that if you call Our Cafe brother if you call a brother kafir either he is or it will come back to you so what to do shaykham these these 10 nullifiers of Islam are they Quran or Sunnah or they are ishtihad from Scholars is that from Scholars so how would you justify taking them as sacred as Quran and making your life so miserable like it is at the moment doesn't make any sense so it's an honored scholar who spent his life studying Islam comes up with these 10 nullifiers and he puts it in a book hoping that Scholars and students of knowledge would know it and understand it and explain it you as a Layman cannot come in pick and choose what you want it's like a professor in medicine putting an article in a medical journal stating some of the procedures how to how to cure spinal injuries or the spinal cord procedure surgeries and you read this and you want to implement it you're not qualified and this is the biggest problem that lots and lots of the youngsters are facing when they don't acquire knowledge properly so instead of walking a 20-step ladder from step one till step 20 they jump to step seven and eight they bypass these beginning steps which means that there is a huge possibility of them falling and breaking their necks you don't know Arabic you don't memorize the Quran you don't know the fafsir of the Quran if you memorize it all you don't know proper books of Akida you don't know the Sunnah you don't know Phil yet you come to an article or a booklet you read here and there and you totally destroy your life and confuse yourself and the funny part is that Satan is well done you doing a good job you're pleasing Satan Satan is Happy the bad news is Allah is angry with you why Sheikh I'm trying to please Allah not by what you're doing because you're not qualified if you're pleasing Allah look at your prayer are you finding the sweetness of your prayer no Sheikh I'm not even praying on time sometimes I skip prayer because I'm so depressed and I leave prayer for three four days oh masha'allah so you're getting out of the fold of Islam don't read such articles unless you're supervised by a mentor a Sheikh who would sit with you and explain each one of you of them to you takfir is not for me and you and look what shaytan is making you do oh this Bollywood actor he has over 200 movies he's married to a Hindu and he has Idol in his home and he says I don't care if my children become Muslim or Hindu so I should give him Tech fear but I'm hesitant because he might be a Muslim brother how can I give him did Allah send us to label people around us so hmm he's a comfort He's a hypocrite he's a monophic he's a facet he is um well I don't know I'm I still have to make up my mind what is this this has nothing to do with Islam look in the murder and be concerned of yourself has conditions to be fulfilled and obstacles to be eliminated and it's not for you and me it's for the scholars for the judges for The rulers Muslim rulers to give their verdict on such an individual after interrogating them not to shoot from the hip so I hope this answers your question and removes your confusion"
