  "transcript": "can we talk about someone who passed away when we have forgiven them in this world it seems like there was some bridges he already forgiven them should we bring this back up again no it is not permissible and it is a sign of cowardness to mention negative things about dead people if you have the guts say it into their faces while they're alive but it is not manly to hit someone when he's down and the prophet prophet said was you should mention the good things of those who were deceased meaning don't say anything bad and the prophet prohibited in some narrations that we insult the dead even if they were mushriks no because their offspring who are muslims would be harmed and uh uh alarmed and annoyed by that jazakallahu"
