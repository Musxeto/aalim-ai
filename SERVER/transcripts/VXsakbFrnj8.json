  "transcript": "she hubs question is very generic is Dawa compulsory what is the meaning of Dawa that was calling people to Islam so is it compulsory for me when I'm walking down the shuns Alizee or if I'm working in Regent Park or whatever when whomever I see I stop and give them leaflets and accept Islam Allah would put you in hell if you don't if you accept Islam you will get so many wives if you get Islam illogical will make your husband so and so is this compulsory upon me there's no but Dawa is a far broader term what I'm doing now is Dawa if I go to the gym and work out and I see someone and we just talk casually I would probably put a word here or there that highlights the beauty of Islam if I take a cab to take me to from point A to point B and he's non-muslim I would use anything to just highlight that the beauty of my religion once I was traveling in some country and I was with an associate who's an Arab and the driver was done not an atom so we were talking about something and then I stopped him and I said to the driver excuse me we are talking about so-and-so but we are using Arabic so do you permit us to continue and the driver was shocked said of course why are you asking me I said because in our religion it is prohibited for to to speak in seclusion while the third is there with them they have to either join him in or take his permission this is what the Prophet of Islam taught us so the guy was in by this is Dawa being truthful being kind being brave being generous this is Dawa allah azza wajal says woman accent : women die in allah there is no one better in rhetoric then he who calls others to allah does righteous righteous deeds and proclaims i am among the muslims you're proclaiming that being a Muslim and doing righteous deeds never lying never cheating never doing something negative this is the best form of Dawa not only limited to a lecture or a TV program or a leaflet that you give Street Dawa etc these are all signs but not the actual Dawa and I hope this answers your question"
