  "title": "Did the Companions / Sahaba go through Iman Slumps? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question which is related to if we go back to the time of the sahab in the time of the Prophet s wasallam we had the we had the companions who are the best of people who walk the face of the Earth right and they also went through IM slumps were they free were they free from this were they was they man high all the time and were they always uh you know uh ready to pray T and fast the Sunnah fast and all of this or were were there times in their lives where their Iman was down they were struggling um you know maybe you could share with us some examples of some companions who actually went through these uh Iman slumps so without any doubt the companions are the cream of the cream may Allah be pleased with them they are the best generation to ever to walk on earth after the prophets and The Messengers no doubt how do I know tell me show meith uh Quran um the best of generations is my generation the prophet is saying who's his generation sahaba so he himself is identifying them to be the best of generations ever may Allah be pleased with them now when we try to compare Apple to Apple there is no comparison none whatsoever they are of a different species yet they are human and they're not uh um infallible they make mistakes but be careful even the best of us cannot be compared to the worst of them even the best of them cannot be compared to the 10 heavenbound and the sad story is the very sad story of the Muslims they don't know their history Ronaldo cristino where is he everybody from Saudi Arabia they know and if I were to tell you who memorizes the 10 Heaven bound the 10 not nine not four who memorizes the whole 10 who knows them please raise your hand I'm the only one this is a problem isn't it isn't it shameful and I always give this example but people sometimes are offended by it if I were to take you to paradise inshallah and excuse me I have to do this for my knees and from my back and and you lookah who's this uh this is who one of the great Companions of the prophet he is the best athlete never to know to be known to history never heard of this name who's this oh this is is the name of a man I thought it was a name of a woman who's this this is uh uh come on guys I don't know any of those in Paradise uh can we take a tour to hell so okay when we go to hell yeah I know these guys here they're all celebrities yes this actor this actress this singer this rapper man yeah this is the place to be in isn't this a sad reality the 10 Heaven bound the best people who were beloved to the prophet he stood once on ja and he says Abu Bakr J Abu Bakr in Jenna Omar in Jen in in ABD in in in is in J these are the 10 Heaven bound if you don't know them their stories who they were married to how they lived how they died how they accompanied the prophet Alam what do you know I know Hitler Sheik that he died in be my guest so we have a problem now when we acknowledge that they are the best of generations and we say that didn't they have slums compare their slums to our slums we can't there is no comparison none whatsoever but I'll give you one story in Muslim which means the highest degree of AU autic it whenever you see you hear inar or Muslim take it for granted this is 100 false proof oh is it authentic Sheik you don't ask about bukari and Muslim these are authentic by default so the Hadith narrates Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him see did number two in this um met D companion so hamah what's cooking goodlook I'm trying I'm rephrasing huh so hamah said I have become a hypocrite this is something you don't play you don't mess around with hypocrisy Abu Bakr was shocked why he said I have a problem slumps when I am with the proph I feel that I am flying in Heavens my IM is topnotch I don't care about anything in this life the moment I leave the prophet and go back home and mix with the wives with the children with the Farms with the Commerce and trade I don't recognize my heart Abu Bakr so hm well I I'm feeling the same ah Houston we have a problem let's go to the prophet Alam he has to solve our problems so they go to the prophet and the prophet says so what's happening repeats his statement what did the prophet sayam he said hamah are you out of your mind if you were at your house with your kids and wives like you are with me here the Angels would descend from the heavens and you will see them walking in the streets with your own eyes and you will shake hands with them you will reach a level of Iman that Allah would uplift the veil and you can see the angels in broad daylight and this is not possible no one can see the angels in broad daylight but this is the prophet commenting meaning one hour for your Lord that you have to strive to reach the highest levels of im as a human being you need another hour to earn to mix with your wife and your children and your Commerce and attend your daily routine you you're a human being you're not an angel so faced this fluctuation of Iman Abu Bakr faced the same fluctuation and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam confirmed it yet comforted us that this is totally normal so don't ever think that you can maintain this high level of Iman forever but you strive to make the best of it so once it goes down you uplift it so that when your call comes when the angel of death comes you're in good hands now the companions may Allah be pleased with them and this again when you want to compare Apple to Apple this is too much there are two stories in the bukari and Muslim different companions all together but the same conclusion one story was about Abu may Allah be pleased with him and Salman Al fari in the beginning how much time do I have for each question no see when I'm happy which I am ald because you I haven't seen anyone sleep yet this means I'm okay I'm I'm I'm captivating the audience I like to speak but as an old grandfather I sometimes become boring I can speak and speak and speak but I don't want to bore people if we're time limited so I have to know exactly when to stop so um you can you can share in everyone is enjoying he's the captain so I'm I'm just just the co-pilot so in in the beginning when the prophet migrated to Medina the migrants from Mecca where Stone broke so in order to make a social blend the prophet made the Brethren between a migrant and the ansar he choose one from here one from here okay you Brothers one of you dies he inherits the other that was in the beginning but then it was abrogated and only your heirs can inherit youas the Brotherhood remains but no inherit an so among those Brethren was Salman Al phy and Abu D Abu D was from Medina ansar Salman was not from meca but he came all the way from Persia Iraq Syria and was sold as a slave to Jews and you know his story I don't think so but assume assume yeah give them the benefit of the doubt so they became brethren one day Salman Al fari visited his brother's house and he wasn't there and this was before the hijab was mandated so he saw his wife but he saw that she wasn't properly dressed taking care of her self you know any women sometimes glow even if they're wearing the hijab you know taking care of their skin and the body lotion their hair their makeup it he saw that this woman was not interested so he asked what what's wrong she said your brother Sal Abu D has no interest in women he he prays all night long and he fasts every single day not missing skipping one day so when will he have time for hky puny no time because he's either sle uh praying or fasting there's no time so he said hm okay when Salman when Abu D came back home he saw his brother he embraced him he invited him to eat so Salman said okay you eat first he said no I'm fasting said break your fast said I'm fasting break your fast he's my guest he's my brother brother he's my elder brother so he broke his fast volunt fast and he at after they prayed Isa AB all hey wait wait wait wait wait what are you doing praying night prayer from only eight hours so he said no no no sleep said but I want to pray said no no sleep so he went to sleep half an hour woke up and sleep sleep sleep until it was the last third of the night you know like an hour before F said now you go and pray so he prayed after he finished prayer he said Abu D your lord has rights over you and your body has rights over you your wife has rights over you and your relatives and your guests have rights over you so give each one its du right Abu what is this hu jumo so he prayed F in the Masjid then he went to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah my brother Salman visited me and he did this and this and this and he said this and this and this the prophet said Salman said the truth The Identical story in theah happened withd was one of the companions accepted Islam in the eth year of Hijra one of the smartest Arabs ever known to the Arabs so he got his son and they say that his son was 14 maybe 15 years younger than him than his father so he got him married to a very reputable beautiful woman from quray couple of weeks later he goes and visits his s his daughter-in-law so he asks how's my son with you she says oh Uncle he is the best of men he prays all night and he fasts all dayas I got the message he's smart he doesn't he doesn't need any clarification immediately he went to the prophet Alat wasam and complained the prophet summoned Abdullah Abdullah came he said how much do you finish the Quran in meaning during prayer said once every night he completes from cover to cover once every night he said don't do that finish the Quran once a month this is the minimum if you don't do this you're a bad Muslim she yeah normal Muslims finish the Quran once every month new hij month they you see them in bak and end of the month and they that's why they finished the Quran 12 at least 12 times a year usually in Ramadan they do five or six more so but let's go for the average so Abdullah says no no no I can do more than that the prophet said finish the Quran every 20 days he said no I can do more than that finish the Quran once every 10 days every day every night you only read three J he said I can do more than that he said do it in one week he said I can do it more than that he said no don't do it in another narration he said in 3 days but you will not be able to comprehend it in less than three days so 10 every night how many days do you fast he said every single day I don't skip a day from f to Sunset I'm fasting and I eat at night and then I fast the whole month said no fast three days every month and this is the minimum you should do otherwise you are not a good Muslim it's not mandatory don't get me wrong but you're coming here to avoid slums you want to avoid slums I'm showing you sh three days every month it's too much no it's not too much normal Muslims by the way fast Mondays and Thursdays and three days every white days normal Muslims but okay let's not go into details so he said no I can't fast more than three he say fast uh uh 10 days fast this fast this fast until the prophet said fast one day and Skip One Day meaning 15 days every month he said I can do better than that he said nothing is better than that this is the best fasting the fasting of prophet dud peace be upon him then the prophet said to him exact statements that he heard from Salman to Abu D he said Abdullah your body has rights your wife has rights your uh uh um guests have rights and your uh Lord has rights so give each its due right this is the slums when they have slums to us we would love to have some of their slums that means that we are the best of the best in our generation and I hope this answers your question"
