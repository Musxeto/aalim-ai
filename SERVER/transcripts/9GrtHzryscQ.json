  "transcript": "is loving and admiring Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him important for youth oh assalamualaikum and welcome to a new episode of Youth talk I would like to welcome our guest in the studio today we have awesome it's a pleasure having with us same here I would also like to welcome my three participants to my left I have Mahmoud as an English translator Sami also a translator and on my right I have usem who is an English teacher in today's episode of Youth talk we want to talk about loving and admiring Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I'll let you start off with with those very simple words as Muslims We Believe that the best creature of Allah's creatures is the Prophet Muhammad to us he is more important than our children that our wives that our own Souls for us he is the idol that we look up in every single thing we do and from him we obtain the knowledge that makes us know our Lord makes us know who we are and makes us know where we're headed to and these are the most important questions that a lot of the people all over the world may fail to find answers to if you look at societies and communities you find everyone is working as hard as possible to gain money to live to prosper without any a destination while our Prophet Allah lived and died teaching us how to reach the satisfaction level of every one of us and how to reach what pleases Allah azzawajal so throughout our lives we have his biography we have his teachings to follow and this would lead us to prosperity in this life and in the hereafter yes um as a teacher I touched a lot of administrations I don't know anything about Prophet Muhammad actually even the higher grade of like grade 11 12 like 17 adolescent age you know how could we how how is our role to to judge him and saturate the feeling of loving Prophet Muhammad in their soul this is very easy because the more you talk about the prophet Muhammad the more people love him now it is essential to be equipped with knowledge because you cannot teach people without the proper curriculum and the proper knowledge to convey to them so first of all you yourself have to know the biography of the Prophet what he taught how he lived how he communicated and the things that people should know about him and one of the things that make us admire the prophet Allah more than any other Messengers though we respect and love all the prophets and messages of Allah one of the things is that if you look at the biography of previous Messengers you would not find any you would not find any detailed or even any short biography of The Messengers before the prophet you don't know the their wives names or how he behaved with them you don't know anything about their upbringing and uh what the people thought of them with our Prophet Allah we know every single detail that took place when his father married his mother until the day he died we know his wife's names we know his children names we know his companions who was responsible to do this and who was responsible to do that we can read in the Quran the things that Allah uh in a sense reprimanded him though it was not a reprimanded it was simple um talked to him that he did something that was inappropriate and if it was not from Allah azzawajal the prophet would not have said that to us yet he told us that this is a revelation of Allah and Allah is blaming him for not attending the question and the queries of the blind man and rather he is choosing to sit with the pagans who were the head of their tribes so Allah blamed him in the Surah called or named and in so many instances so we love the prophet Allah because we know he's a human being he never claimed to be a God he never asked people to worship Him and at the same time we admire the honesty and integrity that he had before the Revelation because the pagans used to call him by the amine the trust trustworthy the honest one and before Revelation he never prostrated to an idol he never slaughtered an animal as a sacrifice to them he always worshiped Allah though he was not revealed to he only knew that one Creator created this universe and this one created is whom we're supposed to worship importance of loving the prophet peace be upon him I mean for for a youth for for teenagers as Osama was just mentioning a moment ago I mean what's how can you tell them it's important to love him without loving the prophet Allah you cannot complete the level of Faith you cannot become a complete believer and movement the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that none of you will reach the level of Iman of Faith until I there is a prophet that Islam uh until I am more precious to him than his family than his a property and then his soul that is within so you cannot reach the level of belief and and Iman and Faith until you love the prophet Allah more than anything else now he's dead so how can you love him to that extent by simple feeling of love and wanting to see him and wanting to be with him and learning his teachings and applying them into yourself so is it enough to say that I love the Hamas Allah is it enough to say that I love him or how how how can I love him how how can I put this way of showing it as well it well it's a claim you say that you love the prophet and it's awesome it's a claim and all claims have to be proven so what is the proof be in this situation how can you prove your love to the prophet Allah it is simple it's your actions and deeds and the level of Love increases the more you follow the prophet sallam and decreases if you do not follow him completely the love of the Prophet Muhammad must come first before the love of myself and as even being affected I find it difficult but I should have I should strive to to to reach this degree what what should you advise me to reach this degree to to reach this level of to to have the rottenham in front of myself of my property of my children bearing in mind that of course you can't see him you you you never have seen him as well there is natural love that no one can dispute about this and there is the rational love now you're supposed to have the rational love to the prophet Allah and this overwhelms all other kinds of love natural love is the love you have towards your children towards your wife towards your parents towards yourself but rational love means that if there's a conflict of interest between what the prophet preaches and teaches and between what my family needs or what my desires require who do you put front would it be the love of the prophet and his teachings or your own desires and the family then this is the love we're talking about as long as the prophet's love comes untasked then this is Islam doesn't tell you to sacrifice sacrifice your children but it tell you to put up up front the love of the Prophet saws and that is why when the prophet said the Hadith that I have mentioned a bit earlier said oh prophet of Allah you are more precious to me than my family than my kids than my property then my parents but myself my soul so the prophet said you will not become a faithful and a Believer until you complete this so he contemplated a little bit he thought about it he said yeah that's that's true if I were to choose between my life and the life of the prophet what would I do I would sacrifice my own soul in life for the life of the Prophet saws said okay prophet of Allah you are now more precious to me than my family my parents my property and my soul so the prophet told him now Omar you have completed and gathered all the aspects of Iman so this is what I well what we mean by the love of the Prophet saws to be on top and of all meaning that you should always give the priority to following the instructions of prophet Allah if there is a conflict between it and your desires or your family requirements what would you do what would you choose if if you choose the love of the prophet and his teachings then you are a believer other ways of finding this love is it through reading about the prophet or is it through reading the Quran for example how can one be more loving of the Prophet program by far reading the Holy Quran and knowing the status of the Prophet sallam at the side of Allah increases your Iman just to know that the messages of the messenger of Allah was the chosen one was the one who Allah loved most and preferred over all the other Messengers and gives him a special position in your heart going through his biography watching and observing how he treated his enemies his loved ones how he was kind to those who abused him attacked him slaughtered his companions and even killed his own beloved Uncle Hamza yet he forgive them see the amount of love and forgiveness in with the prophet salallahu all of these by no doubt increase the level of a man and increase your love to the prophet um Sammy there was a point you wanted to mention okay talking about the love and admiration of our Prophet Muhammad I remember the situation or the beautiful story of uh they were teenagers and the market weather the battlefield I am keen on hearing this beautiful sir from Russia you're testing me that's very embarrassing well these two uh came to abdulrahman now may Allah be pleased with him who is one of the ten that the prophet sallam gave him the Glad Tiding of being in Paradise and he said that each one of them came to his side trying not to let his friend hear what he says before the Battle of battle where the companions were one-third of the number of their enemies and the enemies were you know full in armor while the Muslims did not have anything except their swords not even Shields because they did not anticipate that they were going to fight they just you know going for a short ride and coming back and each one of these two companions teenage companions was whispering in abrahamas ears telling him do you know abujah the the head of of the pagans who who we consider as the Pharaoh of uh that era so he told him yes what do you want of him so each one of them told adrahman that I'd like to see this man in battle so I can chop his head off because I heard that he insulted our prophet sallallahu so they wanted one thing in their life and that is to kill the person that insulted our messengers of course that was in the battlefield so this of course indicates the amount of love in these teenagers that they're willing to sacrifice the love their lives for the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam now going back to the present times nowadays we do not ask at all any of our youth to sacrifice themselves or to kill anyone for the love and sake of the Prophet salallahu because that was a battlefield nowadays we don't have any battlefields at the moment so if someone insults the prophet saws you have to be furious about it you have to be extremely angry but you have to measure your actions so that you would not harm Islam and you would not do something that would displease our prophet sallallahu that's a not only Companions of the Prophet loved him but also the the trunk of palm tree when he was in the mosque and left this trunk and this trunk crying there are so many hadiths about the Miracles of the Prophet Allah that even objects used to sense his presence the prophet says I know a particular Stone in Mecca where before being revealed to I used to pass and this Stone used to greet me this that's weird Stone talking but there are so many things that took place the prophet salallahu used to deliver the Friday speech next to a trunk of a tree and it's not alive it's it's dead it's an object it's a tree and it's not even a tree with with roots it's a trunk that has been chopped off and when the prophet saws was given new steps to a stand on instead of that trunk they heard the Cry of the trunk because the prophet saws did not use it there are so many things that prove the love of the companions of objects of the whole universe to the prophet sallallahu alaihi it is enough that the angels of Allah all respect and know him that the messengers of Allah in Heavens know our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this love is interpreted in many different ways some may limit their love to the prophet sallam and seeing him in their dreams and what significance is there behind this the prophet says Allah who he whoever sees me in his dream then he has seen me as as if he wasn't present really yes and this is an honor to see the prophet in your dreams what providing it is in the same description as he is so if you see the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam in your dreams as a a a five-foot tall man then this is not the prophet saws because he was not that short and if you see a a seven foot uh about a man or a will shaven man then this is not the prophet sallam if you see someone that is ugly this is this is not the prophet his description is well known we it's well documented we know him as if we can see him and unfortunately some sects of Islam and uh they go out of their way in loving the prophet more than he instructed and we again have extremes and we have the middle uh Nation or the middle ummah the extremers are on the shoes are on on both sides one think that Muhammad al-islam was a normal guy he's just a man he has nothing of importance he's dead he's over he did his message and that's it and they go up to the extent of saying or calling him by name they say Muhammad did this Muhammad went to Medina Muhammad sat with his companions without saying without saying Prophet Muhammad or messenger Muhammad and and of course this is complete ignorance of his right on the far end you find people loving Muhammad to the extent that they give him attributes only possible to Allah by saying that he knows the Unseen he can tell or foresee the future the prophet salallahu can intercede at the moment for us so when you pray ask him directly say o Muhammad do this for me do that for me and this is all associating others with Allah and people do this with other than Muhammad Ali the prophet of Allah they do it with those who they think are Alia Pious people who died they go to their graves like in many places you find mosques with Graves in them but you're asking what's wrong in loving the prophet to that extent then what's strong is that the prophet himself told us not to do so he told us that do not go to extreme and flattering me like the Christians did with Jesus Christ who was and still is a messenger messenger of Allah and they've elevated him to a level that he never claimed to have which is the son of Allah the Son of God and Allah does not have a wife and he does not have a son does not beget and is not begotten told us that he's a messenger and a slave and unfortunately nowadays we have sex in Islam that pretend and claim to be loving the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam yet they are out of his way they're not following the Sunnah they're not following his Sharia they claim through chanting in songs and dancing and in a sense gathering together and calling his names in in a number of ways they think that this is the way they portray their love to the prophet sallallahu I once read a book to one of their Scholars who said that if you say Allah Muhammad if you pray on the prophet salallahu if you praise him in the sense 500 times a day you will not die until you see him alive in front of you now this is real funny because if he said you will not die until you see him in your dreams I would have comprehended that I would okay maybe now this guy says you will not die until you see him face to face and how's that going to happen he's dead and some of them say that we've visited the grave of the Prophet saws when he loved him so much to the extent that all of a sudden a hand came out from the grave and and we shook hands with the prophet saws this is nonsense and they say no we love the prophet salallahu I tell you if the prophet is alive in his grave as you say and you can shake hands with him then the least you could do is dig him out why are you leaving him live in his grave he's alive so this extreme takes the people away from Islam it puts them in a mythical environment that they only a chance sing and pretend that this love is sufficient and there is no need for them to do anything else okay we'll take this break now and then return with some questions da da da da da da da da da da da da do and welcome back Osama had something you wanted to say yeah I think so far we have successfully reached and discussed our goal about health club and admire Prophet Muhammad but how to pretend and how to protect Prophet Muhammad in his absence like by mother cutting some sometimes or we have all read about and hear about the things that have been happening outside the Western world how to how to protect him in his absence of loving him is there something that should be done when when you see that somebody insults yeah the prophet or the slandering reputation or something well you have to defend him exactly as you defend your own parents so if someone slander is a parent your father or talks about him in a wrong manner you defend your reputation and your father by talking back to him well I'm sorry to interrupt I just want to find out something um what would you do if somebody did that to your father if somebody slanted your father insulted your father don't kill him slow to him okay now okay now that type of response of course with the difference if that's of that your father and the prophet peace be one um was that the type of response it would be called for well his initial response is wrong in Islam you have to react in the grievance or in the degree of the the sin itself so if someone slaps you on the face you may slap him in the face but you may not kill him so if someone talks bad about your father you should defend the reputation of your father but not by attacking his father but if you do you have all the right to do so that is why the prophet salallahu once told his companions do not curse your own parent do not curse your father so the companions you know were astonished and Prophet how can one curse his own father he said simple by you cursing someone's else father and he in return curses your father so the curse goes back to your father because you initiated attacking others if someone Slanders or tax your father you may not kill him you may not punish him except with the same manner that he punished you I know this is this the emotion yes it's not true because people insult us every day unfortunately indirectly indirectly or even directly and we try to you know communicate and and try to explain to them and maybe try to punish them but we never kill anyone otherwise we would end up with people you know dead left right and center but when someone insults our Prophet sallallahu we have to know a few things one no matter what they do Allah Allah Almighty has exalted his name by saying and we have exalted your mentioning so no matter what they do again and again and again he will always remain on top people will always look up to him and it will be a cause for others to revert to Islam and this would happen when this campaign to defend the reputation of a prophet saws began lots of the Europeans and the non-muslims wanted to know who is this Muhammad so they serve the internet they started buying books and once they encountered The Majestic character of the Prophet salallahu they Embrace Islam they reverse Islam simple so you have to always put this in your mind that he will always be on top secondly whatever you do is going to reflect on Islam so it's like a Public Relation campaign so whatever you do you always have to put in your mind that I am defending Islam if I make the wrong mistake this is going to be interpreted in a wrong fashion and that is why when rioting took place and embassies were attacked instead of being the victims we became the oppressors and people forgot everything about our Prophet salallahu the good things he did and and how we were trying to defend him and they took this minority and magnify it to portray Islam and Muslims and this is of course the role of the media Islam does not at all approve or support this is completely forbidden to do such acts okay Prophet Muhammad is the best creations of Allah for something in the name of prophet Muhammad sallam can I seek him as a mediation to in order my life be accepted this is a very good question in the Quran Allah is blaming those who worship idols and he's condemning this and Allah tells us there justification they claim that the only worship these Idols so that they would grow closer to Allah and in Islam we do not get closer to Allah except by worshiping him alone the prophet tried his best during his lifetime to protect Allah's uh uh uh uh sanctuary he tried his best to uh not to allow others to associate others with Allah by telling people you have to segregate this is Allah this is the creator he is the uh provider he is the one that gives life and death now you cannot associate me with him and that is why when people used to come to the prophet and say you are our master and your father is our Master he used to tell them the master is Allah don't you ever dare and let Satan get you out of your way the master is Allah say it although it's it's a normal terminology and he says that I am the master of the sons of Adam the prophet saws he talks about himself but when he was afraid that people would associate him with Allah he told he he closed the the subject and blocked the road in front of them telling them that the master is Allah this means that you may not ask the prophet Allah unless he's alive and that is why companions you should go to the prophet Allah and tell him o prophet of Allah we have this problem can you ask Allah can you pray to Allah azzawajal because you are present and you're closer to Allah than we are this is acceptable after the death of the Prophet if you go and call him or pray to him then you are associating him with Allah because he is dead and he does not hear what you say to him and he does not answer your prayer it's only Allah we don't have anyone to inter as an intermediate between us not like other religions you have a problem go to the source go and talk and communicate with Allah are there certain types of um that one can make when he's praying for example and concerning the the prophet the best Dua would be to pray on the prophet salallahu which is Muhammad and the followers and family of Muhammad Allah's prayer is to exalt his mentioning among the angels to raise and Elevate his status in in Paradise because Allah it's not prayer that we pray to Allah no Allah's prayer is to exalt his mentioning and to elevate his status in Paradise so this is the highest and the best format which is called the prayer on the prophet sallam Ibrahim the shortened version is may peace and praise of Allah so Salat is not blessing it's praise praise of Allah and salaam which is peace so may peace and praise of Allah be upon him and this is uh you do that this is the shortened version shorted uh version of it now are there certain locations to pray on the prophet Allah yes of course in prayer while you're praying the five daily prayer or voluntary prayers is not accepted unless you pray on the prophet sallam at the final uh raqqa when you sit before you conclude the prayer also it is highly recommended that you pray on the prophet Allah ten times uh in the morning and 10 times in the evening and the prophet told us whoever does this will get the right of intercession that means that the prophet will intercede for him on the day of judgment by asking Allah to forgive his sins and and so on um and praying on the prophet saws in the night of Friday and the day of Friday which means Thursday sunsets then this is called Friday night immediately after the sunset of Thursday this is called Friday night until the sunset of Friday this is the day and night of Friday so the prophet says pray on me as much as possible on the day of Friday and at the night of Friday because your prayer will be revealed to me I will be told by the angels that your nation is praying to you and the prophet says who has a praise on me once Allah will prey on him ten times which means Allah will elevate your status in Paradise if you pray on the prophet Allah and will mention you among his angels so this indeed is a great honor and privilege is it is it recommended as we hear from sheikhs to put supplication between two prayers upon the Prophet Muhammad after praising God Allah it's it's uh it's not the two supplications the maybe the prophet Allah said that every supplication or prayer you make to Allah azzawajal is blocked until you pray on the prophet Allah which means if you want to ask Allah to give you money or to make marrying a particular woman easier for you and you're proposing to her so you say oh Allah let me marry sister so and so and let things go easy and smooth this is blocked it will not go and reach the heavens until you pray on The Prophet salallahu by saying first of all you have to and these are the the manners of of of uh praying to Allah first of all you have to praise Allah by saying alhamdulillah you know praise Allah and uh give him what is not nothing is sufficient for Allah but you try to praise him as much as possible yes and then you pray on the prophet saws and then you say oh Allah this particular woman I'm interested in marrying oh Allah make that easy for me then your prayer will be accepted but if you do not pray on the prophet and you immediately jump to saying oh Allah pay my dues I have debts and so on Allah will not answer your prayer send me those uh points you are going to mention about okay it's a question in my mind why do the Western world think wrongly about the prophet Muhammad why don't they love him okay yeah I believe that a great deal lies on the media because if they only knew who are Prophet sallallahu was they would indeed love him but when the media fails to convince people or they fail to show the people who the prophet saws really is then all the misconceptions all the bad ideas and all the tales you hear would be the prevailing uh thoughts in their mind a lot of westerners who were not here or there they did not know anything about about our Prophet Allah except what heard in the media but they were reluctant to believe the media themselves because they think that if the media talks about the prophet saws then they definitely have a hidden agenda but once we talk to them and and and explain to them his attributes and and how he lived they immediately admired the prophet Allah lots of celebrities talked about the prophet Allah of classifying him on the top of the 100 most influential men over history and they were Christians by the way that who compiled these books lots of uh intellectual people people in power think highly of our Prophet salallahu but we want the majority the whole Community the whole uh uh uh non-muslim societies to know about a prophet Allah not necessarily to convert or revert to Islam this is up to them but the least they could do is to read about our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam how he communicated with the others and how he uh lived his life we do not expect them to do so unless they are encouraged by their Media or by those who devote themselves to teaching others about the prophet salallahu's life and and and and message I think that I think that's the role of the um the Muslim people and non-islamic countries like in America I was around four years that I heard about Muslim people try to preach the role of prophet Muhammad to try to make people in other cultures loving him more because he said like if they are relaxing or hesitant to believe the media the worldwide media so I think it's going to be more profitable to hear from a person who are living in their countries I think that it's very easy to relieve ourselves from responsibility so by saying that well this is not my responsibility it's the responsibility of the Muslims living in the west and the Muslims in the west saying well this is not our responsibility because we lack knowledge so it's a responsibility of the Muslims living in the Muslim World who's responsibility so I I this is this is what I was getting to that everyone tends to throw through someone else to someone else and whenever we Face a problem the the easiest thing for us to do this problem is the doing of those who came before us and those who will come after us are going to solve it so where is your responsibility I'm just going to live this problem I believe that it's a collateral effort we have to work together we have to provide our brothers in the west with the knowledge with the printing printed materials and whatever answers and solutions through the queries they have and they themselves as they know the society and their environment they have more Liberty and freedom to move and act and and and and try to spread the message of the Prophet Allah you're mentioning the about the role that the media could play or should play that sometimes the media only looks at it from one aspect or depicts people's reaction for example to the insults of the Prophet that this is Islam okay how can the media I mean when I'm talking about media I'm talking about TV and not press I'm going to assume that TV is more influential I'm just going to assume that myself and say that majority of people have the TV is more penetrative than press um how can you actually show the characteristics of the Prophet peace be upon them in the in the media when most of the time he's only depicted from the religious perspective of being the messenger of God how can you show the normal things of his reaction with his friends with his family and so on unfortunately this cannot be done in non-muslim media because they have to have a documentary that goes on forever trying to talk about the prophet that is let's assume it's it's Muslim media then and not in the sense that we have somebody who's just sitting and telling a story I mean if you want it in a sense of a documentary like you just mentioned not a not an Imam or a Sheikh with all due respect of course who's sitting and explaining what he was like I mean people when they tend to see at least some examples they tend to believe or to acquire to want to look for more knowledge about this person well first of all we have to yeah if I understand you correctly we have to say that it is completely forbidden to act the role of the Prophet salallahu or to act the role of the companions may Allah be pleased with them so in this sense you cannot dramatize his biography and I'd like to point out that uh the Mel Gibson's movie um though watched by lots of of of of Muslims this is by itself a major sin it is a major sin to watch a messenger of Allah being acted um The Ten Commandments as well Jesus Christ Superstar whatever all of this is not allowed for a Muslim to watch because we highly think of our The Messengers of Allah and we respect them and we do not accept anyone to come and act them as is this would be an insult it therefore we cannot dramatize the biography of the Prophet saws and his companions so the only way we have to show the world our prophets life and uh uh um biography what these companies is to lecture to them to give them situations and compare these situations with what we're living at the moment and give the best solution to our problems through his Sunnah through his biography and I believe that this is the only way of doing it now if there's another way that does not contradict or conflict with the Sharia and respecting the prophet saws we are are all the way with that way but we have to look into it so that we can uh judge its appropriity or not if it's appropriate or not then following his footsteps and following his traditions and the teachings is a must and it's a condition to say I am truth or true lover of Muhammad to an extent yes it is because usually and I'm I'm saying that so that I would not let the door open to those who judge people you can end up with people coming listening to your comment and say okay then this means that those who do not follow to the letter his teachings and instructions are not people that love the prophet saws which leads you to that they're not good Muslims which leads you to they're not Muslims and then this means I can kill them and this is the Crooked way of thinking of those who bomb people or kill people no as Muslims we believe that the more you follow the prophet saws the more love you have and if you don't have this fellowship if you say uh to the prophet sallam to the extent to its extent or to the its limit this does not mean you do not love the prophet it means that your love is a little bit lesser than it should be and I'll give you an example one of the companions of the Prophet salallahu was plagued by loving to drink and he used to drink and they used to catch him and whip his back as uh uh no it's not it wasn't that it was called uh was one of the great Companions of the Prophet Salomon Warriors yeah um it was called the one with the humor so the prophet used to like him because he was humorous he was do things to the prophet sallam for example he would go to the market and see something that he likes so he brings it and he tells a man to follow him to to pay him so he goes to the prophet and tells him oh Prophet this is a present to you I liked it and I think it's it suits you well and he gives it to the prophet a while later the guy comes in and wants his money so he doesn't take it from the prophet you know laughs at him now you give me something and you asked me to pay for it this guy came to the prophet saws so many times because he was drunk and they used to whip his back uh with 40 Lashes at the time uh because of drinking and once a man said look at this guy he is brought here like a donkey or like a dog being whipped so the prophet saws told them do not do this do not say bad things about him because I testify that he loves Allah and he loves the prophet sallallahu so yes the love is not as much as you think but still there is a room of love to the prophet in the hearts of all sinners okay I think I'm going to have to wrap up the episode thank you of course it's been a pleasure having you with us on youth talk I'd also like to thank my three participants that's um and of course of SEMA thank you all for joining us that's it for this edition of
