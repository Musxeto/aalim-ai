  "transcript": "I have one question for you today my father died 2020 my father passed away some time ago he left behind a piece of property but at during his life he had several marriages where he had several children so at the time of his death he was with my mother but the property he said was not to be used for inheritance he strictly said he would give it to one of my brothers but the other but the other mothers and the other kids don't know but at the time I was married only my mother the other children don't know will that property be used to for inheritance or solely for him now when your father died this property whose name was it registered to it was registered in his name to to his name to his name yes this means that all his heirs must inherit it which includes your mother who was the only wife at that time and all of his offspring from his current wife and previous wives they are bearing his name they have his name so they are his children they have to inherit no one can prevent them from inheriting say oh they don't know about itah this is what you mean right yes imagine if your ex-mother-in-law had six properties you did not know of and she did the same with her children what how how would you feel bad you would feel bad said where is my right you didn't know about it so this is something only Allah will hold you and your mother accountable for you have to share it with the other heirs but there are witnesses during when he was saying that there are witnesses of what when he was saying he doesn't want the property to be used for inheritance he has no right to put a Will I Am the owner of this iPad it's not for sale it's not any endorsing H so I have this iPad now I say to ibraim ibraim when I die distribute this only to three of my daughters the others don't give them anything is this will valid no because the prophet said no one of the hirs can have a will I cannot have a will when I die my house will be given to my wife immediately it's invalid you they tear the whe and throw it in the dust pin because the moment I die my wife gets 1/8 and the rest goes to the other heirs she says okay but he said I should have the house no you are one of the hirs you can't inherit through a will so whatever your father said before dying if he before death went to the authorities and changed the Deeds of the land to his current wife the whole thing the property gave it to his wife now it's in her name while he was alive then he dies no one can can claim itas it's his it's hers it was a gift I hope this answers your question okay thank"
