  "transcript": "Bassel elf Ozan says is there any guidance on coronavirus and remind the people to return to allah and ask forgiveness for them of course Allah Azza WA JAL as mentioned in surat al-alaq chapter 17 and we do not send these great signs except to intimidate people when the Sun eclipses when the moon eclipses these are signs great signs of allah azza wajal so why does Allah send these signs to intimidate people and remind them who Allah is Subhan Allah Ta'ala we have been delusional we think that we're strong we think that we can challenge allah azza wajal atheists think and believe that it is okay to claim that there is no God in this universe everything was created by chance and they have the audacity to think that we are the strongest in this universe look what Allah has done to them and to everyone else Allah has sent a creature that cannot be seen or detected by sight it is so small you need huge electronic microscopes to see it and this little negligible creature is killing people like crazy it killed over 3000 people in China daily basis the average in Italy is 500 dying of course it targets the elderly because the average age of those who had died who are now increasing over I think 5,000 or more in Italy the average age is 80 meaning that there aren't ninety and hundred and there are 70 maybe 65 but the average age is 80 so this virus had forced people to lock down everything isolate themselves in homes fearing the virus which Allah has sent to remind them who the creator of the viruses who's the creator of the heavens and the earth who is the creator of the jinn and the humans so that they worship Him Allah did not create us to have fun to play around to eat drink and mate Allah created us to worship Him and he had set a time for each and every one of us on this earth average of 60 to 70 years and then it is eternity in hell or eternity in paradise up to you so this is our testing ground and allah azzawajal is testing us allah subhanaw taala is reminding us bringing bringing us back to him those who continue to wear face masks use sanitizers isolate themselves yet still being neglectful of Allah they have not passed the test those who have gone back to Allah asked for his forgiveness expressed their sincere and deep remorse did or engaged in a lot of good deeds such as night prayer fasting Mondays and Thursdays reading the Quran memorizing it doing good deeds to the best of their ability only so that Allah would pardon them and uplift what is happening to them those Isha Allah would have passed the test with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL"
