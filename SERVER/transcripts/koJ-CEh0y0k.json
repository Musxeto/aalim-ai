  "transcript": "Salam alaikum and welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Colman our Vieira host for today's episode as we look at the subject of the poor the underprivileged persons around us and of course this show is about looking at how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with the poor in this particular case our guest sheikh osman al Hakim assalamualaikum and welcome why do you come sit on a hunt online hello cat thank you as always for being with us I'd like to start out by asking you about the tribe of Moo daughter is that correct correct what was that try why are they significant in our discussion about the poor some mana vehemently behind I mean sallallahu Salaam Baalak arrived you were also gonna be you know muhammad aleyhi wa sahbihi ajma'in when it comes to noble tribes tribes of prestige and heritage and history when you see some of them in a poor condition this makes your blood boil because a while ago they had the wealth and they were generous and they were among the elite men look what had happened to them so it was the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam to try and fix things that are broken and prevent them from getting broken in the first place mhm the authentic hadith states Jayden Abdul LBJ Allah be pleased with him tells us that men from the tribe of model who are known to be to come from this noble tribe entered the Masjid one day and they were wearing worn off and torn garments and clothes this is a clear sign of poverty the minute the prophet saw this Helene salatu salam his face changed why such noble people so poor so he went to the pulpit and he addressed the whole Ummah in the Masjid and encouraged them to give in charity immediately one man none of them moved and a few moments later a man came with a sack filled with clothes and food that his arms barely can carry them and he placed it in front of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the moment the companions saw this they understood so each one went to his home and in moments they gathered a big pile of food and clothes to this tribe the prophet's face changed and it lit salah salem with joy and happiness and he addressed the companions telling them that the first man who brought the this big sack he gets the same reward of everyone who followed him the point is that the Prophet Harrison did not overlook what was this stripe suffering from and that is poverty and it shows you that this is how we should feel towards other Muslims it's not only their plight it is ours as well it is reported and this is ya need something out of the context that a man was in the Masjid when a guy came and said the whole market is set aflame and was ruined to the ground except your shop so the guy said alhamdulillah and then it came back to him and he said I've been seeking Allah's forgiveness for saying alhamdulillah for remembering myself and neglecting the brothers whose shops were burnt to the ground so he thinks that saying alhamdulillah in that particular situation you know is sinful because I only care about myself this is what's happening now we care about what goes in our pockets and if people are starving if people are dying if people are in poverty it's their mistake tough luck they couldn't do what I did it's all me and this is very dangerous yeah because we take the position that it's by our effort in our effort alone and we are the ones that determines our success or failure and financial economic means it's not not the case correct the number of factors that go into that I'd like to ask you about the Prophet peace be upon him he was a very simple man very humble man and he lived a humble life he I'd like to ask about how that impacted his ability to care for and provide for feed the poor we know that he himself was not a heavy eater like we are you know we have been taught and indoctrinated some would argue by the influence of agribusiness that we have to we have this pyramid that we have to follow and we have to consume lots of meat and all this the Prophet didn't eat like like we do peace be upon him he was a very humble simple frugal man how did his humility his humbleness his simple lifestyle impact his ability to care for provide for feed the poor first of all the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam had all the means to become rich he was the head of state so one visit to the treasury would ya make everything easy not only that the Prophet a son was given the choice by arc angel jibreel peace be upon him he told him that Allah tells you if you wish I can turn the whole pebbles in Mecca into gold for you he said no he was given the choice to be like Solomon prophet of Allah a king and a prophet or to be a servant of Allah and a messenger and he chose to be a servant of Allah and a messenger he had money it never stayed with him more than a few minutes in the authentic hadith he prayed once in congregation and the moment he finished the prayer he crushed the lines of the worshipers to one of his homes and after like few minutes he came back and the companion said o prophet of Allah you scared us you've never done this before what why did you rush to your home he said while I was in salat I remember that I had few coins of silver under my pillow and I did not want to pass a moment without it being given to the poor so whatever he had immediately he would get rid of by disposing it and giving it to the poor nevertheless whenever he was encountered by poor people he would share with them whatever he had so even when they came to him and he had nothing he would tell them I have nothing but he might redirect them to someone else but if he had something he would share it with them Abu Huraira tells us this beautiful story where he says I was starving and I had nothing to eat to the extent that I was tying a stone to my stomach tying it well press the hunger pain yes so I saw Abu Bakr so I stopped him and I asked him about the meaning of a verse in the Quran I know the meaning of the verse of the Quran but I just wanted him to look at me and maybe invite me to lunch so he told me the answer and he left I met Omar he told me the answer and he left none of them figured it out then he is hungry and then came the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he looked at me and he figured it out without me asking him and he said follow me and he went to one of his homes and he sent to his wives do we have anything to eat so they sent him with a pot with a glass of milk that's all what they have in the whole house no fridge I didn't start pile over start hissing the pantry nah not even a single date so Abu Huraira was happy at least now I'm gonna put something into my stomach the Prophet told him go and invite the poor people living in the Masjid I have a sofa and they were like 60 to 70 people and Abu Huraira was depressed he said if I invite these 60 to 70 people what would this glass of milk do but he said it's an order from the Prophet as some have to comply he calls them and they come to the Masjid and the Prophet tells a Baretta give them the glass of milk and they start to drink one by one and the glass never seems to get empty until the 70 people were totally full then and Herrera was shocked and then the Prophet said about Herrera drink so a Baretta started drinking and he was through the Prophet said drink more drink more drink more until he said by Allah there is no place or prophet of allah except for breathing I'm so full here we learn that the Prophet is awesome would share even this small amount with the poor and with the needy oftentimes it's a charity our mercy our charity is measured by not how much but how much from what we have okay so we would like to break here and come back to continue our discussion with the Sheikh on the poor assalamu alaikum welcome back to with the Prophet shake I failed to ask you an important question each of us may have a slightly different understanding of what it means to be poor or needy depending on you know our background and where we're coming from islamically how should we look at this what's the criteria from an Islamic perspective about who is poor and who is needy okay first of all verse 60 in chapter 9 Allah says in Nevada ato little folk Allah will miss a king that verily charity or zakat is to be given to for Allah and Misaki and in Arabic they are so close in meaning mm-hmm so what is a fakir and what is a miskeen when each word is used alone it incorporates both meanings so if I say he's poor it's like if I say he's mesquite mmm but if I say he is poor and miskeen this cannot come because they when you join them and they have different meanings when you use each one separately they have the same meaning so what is the difference scholars had given a number of definitions and the best might be is that the poor who does not have enough at all so he might have lunch but there's no dinner so this guy is Stone broke while a miskeen is someone who is better off than that fakir mmm-hmm yet he doesn't have what is sufficient so he has food he has a house to live in but he doesn't have money to whet his daughter he doesn't have money for medicine he's alive he doesn't have money for his kids tuition fees etc so he is not poor in the sense that he's stoned broke but he is needy and perhaps a modern equivalent in the English language might be we cuz we use the term indigent somebody who does not have the financial means to care for themselves and they're dependent on the government or the family or whatever as opposed to the working poor they have jobs they have income they have a home and they pay the bills but like you said they can't if some Lord forbid something happened to the car it might be but at the same time a lot of those living on benefits of the government are well-off so if you look and check it on them they say we don't need anything but sometimes you get someone who has a salary of seven or ten thousand dollars a month yet he is among the people you can give the catch because in the middle of the month with all the expenses of the rain yes then he is broke yeah so we give him from that's that's most of the middle class by the way yeah we're living one or two months away from park so when you come to look at who can be called poor it's relative in Islam it's not it we know who is a purist but you can come to a businessman and he says yeah I'm I'm poor so why said I have only two cars but my neighbor has five cars I have only one plane jet plane and my neighbor has a triple seven Boeing so this is not poverty a man came to her beloved no Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and said o companion of the prophet sallallaahu Selim am I one of those deserving to receive zakat money okay so he said are you married he said yes said no you you rich he said what are you talking about I am married and I have a servant as well saving me in my home even Amma said by Allah you are one of the kings so the definition of it when Omar is this guy is not worthy of getting zakat because he's married and he's fulfilled then he has a servant so again when we talk about poor people we are mentioning those who were like at the time of the Prophet I do not have anything to eat nowadays if you don't have a credit card you're poor even if you have dollars in your wallet you still you're not rich no this is not the right thing to describe them about you the Prophet discourage the poor from begging from soliciting from asking whatever means they do it I mean even the wealthy and the most wealthy and persons that we admire the most our politicians in the US election process they're going around asking people to give them money and many of them like the current US president is a wealthy man but he's going around asking for money it's a very different kind of money that the needy are asking for did the Prophet peace be upon him discourage the needy from asking for money for begging the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prohibited a Muslim from humiliating himself and asked others hmm companions say that we gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet Allah so Salaam to obey him and not to ask anyone for anything the Companions say that a man would be riding on his camel or his right and his whip falls from his hand he would not ask though the pedestrians to hand him that whip he would dismount take it himself and get back on his right the Prophet said that a his salat was cinnamon that it is best for one of you to take a rope and collect wood for fire firewood mm-hmm from the junk from the four s from the outskirts and put it in a pile on his back and sell it rather than begging people may they may give they may not I I appreciate you making that clarification you said the Prophet peace be upon him prohibited indeed the in the other hadith which is scary the Prophet said a lesser Sam one of you may continue to beg people until on the day of judgment he would come without meat in his face so in the day of resurrection when you can see one another and you see someone without meat without flesh on his face because he had spilled all his dignity and our honor in this life by begging people this is how we would recognize him on the day of judgment so definitely this is sinful this is Haram and it's in dignifying to a person to beg and extend his hand in the Quran Allah tells us that the upper hand is better than the lower hand so the giving hand is far greater than the lower which what kind of guidelines should we follow in terms of interacting with people on who are needy who approach us and ask us for money some are very clever and are they recognized this guidance from the Prophet peace be upon him in they have done the equivalent of collecting wood and selling it maybe it's a packet of Kleenex tissue maybe it's meant to put in the tea maybe it's whatever if they're not doing that and they're just asking for money which should be the correct which should be our response see people differ sometimes we tend to be judges we tend to be Sherlock Holmes or Columbo or whatever investigating you want money why well how much do you own show me your bank account where do you live and this scrutiny may spoil your charity and others may give without even thinking now those who give will be rewarded no doubt in that even if the recipient is not needy so participating in something prohibited by the Prophet by giving money Prophet says don't beg but if they come to me and I give you are awarded without any doubt however it is like telling you I have an investment that if you invest ten dollars it will generate a hundred and I have another investment if you invest ten dollars it will generate a million which one will you choose hire the million and this is exactly when it comes to people begging from you I said I'm gonna give because I'm going to be rewarded so here is 50 pounds yes but if you kept this 50 pound and looked for real needy people a widow and orphan someone who people do not recognize and give it to him would this would be equivalent to the million rather than the hundred all right we are running out of time we got about two and a half minutes left let's see what to get to the Prophet peace be upon him in terms of following the attitude that we should have we're talking about having compassion for people who approach us asking for money the Prophet asked Allah Sprott Allah to make him love the needy correct that's a pretty strong sentiment that he had peace be upon him would you like to address that see the Prophet as I said I'm also sought refuge in Allah from poverty so this is something that is not advocated and one would say which is best to be poor and patient or to be wealthy and grateful you get the point yeah which is best because there is a hadith or number of hadith where the Prophet tells us that the majority of the people of paradise would enter would be poor and the rich would be 500 year being held accountable upon its gait not admitted to it so one would say okay then what you want me to do is it best to be poor and patient or to be rich and grateful it's an issue of dispute even L AM has written a book beautifully named I read that of Sabine whether here are two Shack in one book where he discusses this issue and this topic now having said that when the Prophet seeks refuge in Allah from poverty because it humiliates a person when you have something that does not make you ask for provision this gives you dignity and pride but at the same time when you have what it's sufficient yet you feel arrogant and better than those who are in need then this is a defect in your heart so the Prophet used to ask Allah to grant him the love of the poor but he used to seek refuge in Allah from being poor himself we will leave it there thank you very much Shaikh Barak illogical that concludes our discussion on the poor we appreciate you being with us and hope it was beneficial may Allah support Allah except until our next episode assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah"
