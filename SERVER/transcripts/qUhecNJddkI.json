  "title": "Watch debates on Islam between muslims & non muslims Atheists? How 2 overcome doubts assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is and this be in these uh they uh we get exposed to a lot of debates uh uh so like with non-muslims and Muslims like they debate each other about topics of Islam so sometimes we get exposed to topics which are uncommon or not usual and sometimes we uh there's extensive topics right so and then when we get exposed to these topics we get infected with like doubts and a lot of we find a lot of not a lot of shares it can address this topics either so how can we overcome these thousand uh about this delicate topics of Islam office first of all a rule of thumb it is totally prohibited to watch debates or to engage in debates engaging in debates might might be acceptable if you had proper knowledge but it must not be public regardless of what people do yes it's interesting whoa it's it's like a boxing match and he this was a low blow oh the shirt is I don't know who's going to do this and no no he's retaliating this is not a matching a boxing match this is something related to Islam those involved in debates about atheism about this and that they get exposure they get attention but they're sinful for what they're engaging in publicly why when people debate the intention is to divert as many Muslims as possible not to reach the truth I'm talking about public debates so when did that may Allah have mercy on his soul had a debate with James Swaggart he literally knocked him out with a KO James Swaggart could not do anything because he wasn't prepared he did not have any knowledge neither in Christianity nor in Islam so he was totally knocked out couple of years later there was another debate with a missionary called Anis sharush Palestinian evangelist came with the purpose of throwing misconceptions and doubts in the hearts of Muslims not to reach the truth so he came prepared and he bombarded in half an hour with like 50 doubtful things of Islam and every Muslim was huh these things are yeah I never thought of that why is Islam is like that why Islam is like this so 50 throwing them bombarding the Sheikh when the Sheikh came to rebuttal he had only 30 minutes and that would suffice to respond to one or two issues what about the rest it's all down the drain it's all in the hearts of the Muslims who watch these debates and caused many of them to doubt their Islam because there was not enough time to respond every single doubtful matter could have been addressed but the time was not sufficient this is why refuse strongly to debate the people of innovation or to meet them for the fear that Allah May or for the fear that this may be causing confusion to the Muslims and for the fear of their hearts for their hearts that shaytan may throw something that would corrupt their hearts so you have to definitely stop watching I was just before I I came here with a brother from America in a counseling session and he was telling me Sheikh I'm practicing I pray on time but I was so addicted to watching debates now my Iman is not the same now I'm thinking anytime the Sheikh says Hadith I criticize the Hadith in my head and I say maybe it's not true maybe it's this maybe it's that and this is the end result which would most likely lead the person to hypocrisy doubting his own religion so definitely you have to stop this and if you have any doubts about something you heard in a debate never go and address the close ones to you your siblings your friends your relatives because you'll confuse them and lead them to doubting Islam go to a Sheikh and state to him your doubt to relieve you from your confusion and insha Allah he will do that for you I mean"
