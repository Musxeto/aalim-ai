  "transcript": "uh shef I invested 15,000 in a business I am a 15% partner in that business the business is of buying and selling TI 10 products like cooker mixer grinder Etc do I pay zaka on the business stock like the kitchen product if yes is it 15% of the stock value for me as a 15% shareholder if not do I only pay the money I invested 15,000 from the year I uned plus profit you have to ask those investing your money after one year from your investment how much is your 15% is equivalent to before you enter a business the business is evaluated for x amount of money so your money invested in it would have a 15% of that Capital after one year your 15% value has either gone up or gone down depending on the evaluation of the business capital in total so those running the investment should know what's a price value of the company today and hence what is your 15% value and then you in addition to the profit you receive give 2.5% of the total and Allah Knows Best"
