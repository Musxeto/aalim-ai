  "transcript": "my question is is missing an act of abortion has a hadith in it where the prophet said allah whoever skips over sleeps after prayer then his deeds are null or nullified so this made some people who read the hadith think that skipping asar prayer is an act of apostasy and this is why some scholars just explained this hadith some say that no if he skipped it believing that it is not mandatory this is an act of apostasy well skipping fajr would be the same skipping rishi would be the same any prayer of the five daily prayers if you skip them thinking that it is not mandatory it's not egypt it's not rook and it's not fart is an act of apostasy so this doesn't work here and other people said that the the deeds that are nullified or counted as void are of that day of that day others give other explanations after all these explanations we end up with the conclusion that no skipping assad prayer is not an act of apostasy it does not take a person out of the fold of islam if a person oversleeps or intentionally skips asar we would not say your marriage is void your wife is divorced and your children cannot inherit you etc because you're a kafir you're an apostate no we don't say this but we don't water it down and say oh no it's okay after skipping it is okay you're not a kafir so can i do it no of course not it's one of the heinous crimes in islam to skip a father prayer or to fall into such a sin but it is not an act of apostasy and allah knows best"
