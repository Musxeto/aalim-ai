  "title": "Is prayer invalid if I don't move my lips or tongue when reciting surah, dhikr, dua? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "now one thing that we need to pay attention to and 90 of muslims are doing unfortunately it is a mandatory act of reciting the quran of making dhikr of making dua is to move your lips what do you mean sir if you pray the fatiha like this i just said i mean in my head i did not move my lips i did not move my tongue your prayer is invalid whatever goes in my mind there is no sin likewise if i just simply recite the quran in my mind without moving my lips with it it does not count it's just scanning things in my head i have to say gonna stay i have to move my lips and my tongue and this is why when some of the companions of the prophet salallahu came to him he said to him your tongue must remain moist with the remembrance of allah which means that you have to move your tongue when reciting the quran saying allahu akbar the people they do like this and they keep on their prayer without moving the lips and this is totally wrong"
