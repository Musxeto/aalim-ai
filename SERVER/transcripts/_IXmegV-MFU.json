  "title": "Iqamah called while praying Tahiyatul masjid or Sunnah prayer, should we break it to join the Imam?",
  "transcript": "the law says if we enter the Masjid and the prayer has not been established yet we begin to pray to Hareton Masjid or do we pray the Sunnah but what do we do if the Akama is being called shall we complete our salat or break it to join the congregation well first of all we have to understand that when we look at the Sunnah there is an instruction of the Prophet allosaurus not to sit in a masjid until we pre toric eyes and the other instruction is that whenever the Akama is given then there is no prayer valid now let's look at these two instructions first whenever you enter a message you must not sit down until you pray 2 rakaats these two rakahs we're named and labeled by the jurors with the Hetal masjid never you will find in the quran or in the sunnah the word the hidden message this is a phrase a description that the jurors made up so this led the people to think that this is a specific prayer that we should pray other than the sunnah of the salat itself which is wrong whenever you enter the Masjid pray the Sunnah to request before fajar for records before the hall before sitting down and this suffice is for the written message because you did exactly what the Prophet said that Islam which is praying to records before sitting down part 2 of the question is that ok I started to pray and more then gave the Akama for the for prayer what should I do well scholars differed and some of them said that you have to immediately Exeter's your salat and some said no you have to complete your salat till the end and the middle path is the most authentic opinion which is that if I joined if I started my my sunnah prayer and i'm in the first record if the a comma is given to finish my first record and then stand up and finish my second raka the Imam would definitely begin his salat in this case I have to finish and break my salat not continue so I'm in the first record I immediately walk and join the raw and joined the congregation giving Salam or not doesn't matter I just intended to break my Salah if I'm in the second raka and then the Akama is given I have to estimate hmm if I make Roco if I only recite the Fatiha no Sura and then make record say subhanAllah BRM once semi-long Hamza Rabia or ahem Allah Subhan Allah Allah once and repel fairly once somehow EE at once and I sit down and make that a jihad and the salutation of a Salam and there is time for me to join before the Imam gives the first stack beer then continue with your prayer if you estimate and sin nope I'm not gonna make it I'm gonna be 5 or 10 minutes at 10 seconds late and the Imam would give the takbir before I joined the row in this case break your prayer so you have to be the judge some of the moai's then make the a comma in a couple of minutes he takes his time many the comma some do it in like 10 to 15 seconds faster than a Tesla P 100 s so you have to estimate if you think that you're not gonna make it to reach the takbir with the Imam the first tech beer then break your salat and go ahead"
