  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord 93 returning this application of one who says may Allah bless you when someone says to you in Arabic Barak Allah what should you say in return in Arabic you say and in you may Allah bless or may Allah bless you so it's the same thing when someone says when someone you reciprocate by returning that and making the same Dua for them again the following chapter forbidance of ascribing things to Omens the prohibition from ascribing things to Omens what is meant by Omens Omens are things that you believe may impact your future so if I leave home and I see a dead cat I say today the my day is not going to be good if I hear an accident and I think that today is going to be a lousy day this is believing in bad Omens and this is form of shirk depending on how you believe in it unlike believing in good Omens good Omens is when you hear a word and you feel optimistic that things are going to be fine because this is thinking well of Allah rather than in the previous you're thinking negatively of Allah without any proper evidence to prove this so what is the Dua the prophet Allah used to say Allah oh Allah there is no omen but there is reliance on you there is no good except your good and none has the right to be worshiped except you now this is what you say when you fear something so as you're driving to an errand and you find an accident you feel like bad things gonna happen to you you say this Dua and this words of shirk from your heart and words of the belief in bad Omens because these accidents a dead cat a black crawl and these things don't have any impact on your life let alone your future so you say this Dua with belief and conviction and inshallah you'll be Exempted from any types of now the following chapter is chapter number 95 when mounting an animal or any means of transportation is there in a Dua so we usually use our cars so is there any Dua there is a famous Dua we all know of and there is this Dua that a lot of us may not know of you say Bismillah alhamdulillah [Music] alhamdulillah alhamdulillah alhamdulillah Akbar so foreign in the name of Allah and our praise is for Allah how perfect he is glorify be he the one who has placed this transport at our disposal and we ourselves would not have been capable of that and to our Lord is our final destiny so you're relating this right that I'm taking for a journey and I'm remembering that this life is similar to that and I am returning to Allah to my final destiny then you all go on to say all praise is for Allah all praise is for Allah all praise for Allah Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest how perfect you are glory be to Allah o Allah verily I have wronged my soul so forgive me for surely none can forgive sins except you beautiful Dua to be said and rarely you will find people mentioning this Dua because they often just want to go ahead and move with their transportation now what about if I'm traveling to a different city I'm leaving my Town borders to another area in a travel well there is a long drive that all of us know usually inshallah because we travel a lot and this Dua goes as follows foreign [Music] foreign foreign Allah is the greatest three times then you go on to say or subhanallah how perfect he is glory be to Allah the one who has placed this transport at our disposal at our service and we ourselves would not have been capable of that and to our Lord is our final Destiny the same as the previous Dua then we move on to ask Allah by saying O Allah we ask you for Alberta we ask you for whatever is righteous and pious anything that facilitates good deeds for us in this journey of ours and we ask you for Deeds which please you so we are seeking Allah's help persistence and guidance in our journey by asking these things we don't want our journey to be for the sake of Dunya we want it to be for the sake of the pleasure of Allah oh Allah facilitate our journey and let us cover its distance quickly some Journeys may take days so if Allah puts Baraka and we manage to cover the distance quickly that would be a win-win oh Allah you are the companion on the journey what does that mean meaning that without your guidance without your protection in my journey we will be doomed so you are the companion and the successor over the family so when we left our families we left our children and spouses who will take care of them you so you are the successor over the family oh Allah I take refuge with you from the difficulties of travel from having a change of hearts and being in a bad predicament and I take refuge in you from an ill-fated outcome with wealth and family beautiful Dua expressing my poverty expressing the fear to come back with a change of heart or to see something that does not please me such losing a loved one or the illness or the the the sickness of a relative or the likes and Upon returning the same supplication is recited with the following Edition this is when you go but when you come back home I'm coming back home I say the Dua in the beginning and as I am just about to enter my city I say hey boon which means we return and we repent and we worship and praise our Lords this is how we are we are returning and we are repenting frequently worshiping Allah all the time and we're praising our Lord this is all the time we have until we meet next time foreign [Music]"
