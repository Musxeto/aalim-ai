  "title": "Should I accept proposal of a man who works in a mixed school? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is a recording I have some issues with speech my question is I had gotten a potential s he's from a good Muslim family but there is some doubt in his religious commitment because he works in a mixed School Mi boys and girls so I don't know if I can compromise this and if I find out that he's someone that is not advisable to leave the job can I call it of keeping in mind that I also have some issues with me like five main issues uh okay I'm I'm mentally ill I have some signs of cancer and uh some other issues so what should I do first of all if he is a practicing Muslim and the only thing that worries you is that he works in a mixed school where he has to teach U um boys and girls this is not an issue he's the bread winner and he's obliged to provide for his family and this is what he knows and this is the norm in the country where he lives therefore as long as he's a good Muslim and he checks all boxes you have no right to reject him especially when you have all these issues that you've disclosed and rarely you will find someone who would accept you with what you have so say Bismillah and move on with this uh proposal"
