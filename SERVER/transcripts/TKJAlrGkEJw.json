  "title": "Person's reputation in dunya benefit him in hereafter? Don't talk bad about dead as we are witnesses",
  "transcript": "i'd like to know if a person's reputation in the dunya benefits him at all like when a person is known among relatives or people to be pious of good character but deep down he's a sinner he's not perfect and he's trying to be a good muslim does this benefit him at all well first of all the norm is that we are the witnesses of allah on earth in an authentic hadith a group of people passed by the prophet islam carrying a dead person so they're carrying him to the graveyard so the people said masha allah this is so and so individual this person he was good he was this he was that the prophet said was your butt it is done and then a another corpse came carried by men and the audience with the prophet sam started slaundering and cursing him out evil person he's misery he's this he doesn't pray he's a hypocrite and the prophet said so the companion said what do you mean by wajabet he said you testified for the first one of doing good things so jannah is deserved for him and the other one you testified that he's an evil person so hellfire he deserves hellfire because of your testimony you the prophet said islam are the witnesses of allah on earth so generally speaking yes this has value for people on the day of judgment what people think of you counts the problem is what's inside of your heart this is what only allah knows and we pray to allah that he never exposes us neither in this life or in the hereafter yet the general trend is that the people will testify for you and allah would accept their testimony allah knows best"
