  "title": "What to do if one makes a mistake while reciting Surah Fateha during prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says i made a mistake in reciting the fatiha should i repeat the whole raka'ah or the surah or my prayer is invalid this depends on the mistake you make if the mistake does not change the meaning of the fatiha so this is not a big problem because it was a mistake if you can repeat the same word so if you made a mistake in a particular word and you figured it out immediately just repeat the ayah from the beginning which is a couple of words or three words and move on but if it changes the meaning the majority of scholars say that this is not permissible and the whole prayer is invalid so instead of saying i'm talking to allah azzam you're favored if i say and i'm too meaning i'm the one who is favoring this is definitely a no-go and you have to repeat the whole thing"
