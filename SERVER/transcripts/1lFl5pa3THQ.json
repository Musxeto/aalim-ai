  "transcript": "how are you doing today doing great with the grace of Allah alhamdulillah alhamdulillah so Shake um is it true that praying two rakas right before leaving your home will protect you from harm and evil while outside by the grace of Allah and that praying two Ras immediately when coming back home will safeguard and protect you from the harm and evil of whatever is inside your home by the grace of Allah what uh first of all we have based our life practice upon following the Quran and Sunnah as you all know with the grace of Allah so if there is something that may get us closer to Allah we try our level best to research it authenticate it and present it to the umah so that we can all get closer to Allah if not then we cannot take such a responsibility by teaching people something that is not authentic now having said that praying is a good thing but to have this as a consequence before leaving home you have to pray two raas and after you come from home you have to pray two rakas for 1 2 3 4 benefits to happen for you this has to be backed up by a real authentic Hadith and to my knowledge there is no such Hadith that backs this up one would say but there's no harm sheh why not do it I said it may seem that there is no harm but the Hadith of the Prophet shows us that there is great harm in introducing to religion what's not part of it mother AA narrates may Allah be pleased with her that our Prophet said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it is rejected this is rejected and it's not accepted by Allah so what more harm would anyone introduce to the religion that would be rejected and thrown back to his face and Allah knows best fad"
