  "transcript": "I didn't pray in my non-practicing days should one do other for those missed prayers what's the right way the most authentic opinion is that you do not make up for the missed prayers that were intentionally missed what do you mean a Maharaja says in the Quran in NASA data cannot be negative and makuta verily prayer was prescribed on specific times over the believers which means that when Allah gives us intervals and state to us that time of Maghrib is from sunset till the disappearance of the redness of in the Twilight this is the time of mother if I intentionally and deliberately not pray it until the Twilight disappears I cannot pray it anymore oh can I create other no you cannot make it up no you cannot do you have a legitimate reason why should I have a legitimate reason because the Prophet said in that authentic hadith sallallahu alaihi wasallam when one of you sleeps or over sleeps a prayer or forgets it he must pray it as soon as he remembers there is no expiation for it other than that underline no expiation that's patient for what I didn't do a sin I overslept and you told us a prophet of Allah that the pen is uplifted while a person is asleep until he wakes up he's not held accountable not only that I forgot and Allah says Rob banana two are hidden in a sea no hana do not burden us if we forget or earth so I did not do any sin yet the Prophet said and I saw son there is no expiation other than that which is praying it as soon as you wake up or as soon as you remember scholars say and this is the opinion of anemia and opinion of chef's members they mean all the whole nine yards they say this hadith indicates that if a person deliberately postpones and delays a prayer until the time is over he cannot create Colossus gone I'll offer for raka no use a thousand raka no use it's going on us it is like exactly a person coming for Hajj so he comes on the fifth of the Hodja wearing his harm happy immigration people say way way way will be your visa is not correct they put him in detention they correspond with the embassy in his country off and on after one week when it's the 12th of the hedger they release him so he immediately he goes to alpha he goes to Aleph at nobody's there and he stays there until the her prayer as a prayer Maghreb after sunset he goes to Mena what are you doing said they did not allow me to come so now this is only Tomica aji Arafah is on the 9th of the nature it is bound by this time beginning an end you're coming three days later today I am making it up what can I do so no it's not accepted so likewise the prescribed robada that Allah has a soldier gave a specific time you must perform it in that specific time or it is not accepted"
