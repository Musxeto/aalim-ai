  "transcript": "She I wanted to know if there's anything significant about those people who go to Omrah. Y they see people say uh that you know like there's something significant Allah chose them to go there and so forth and I don't know if I believe that Yi I don't know because Yi I saw people with my own eyes there uh you know that uh were in a group with us to do umrah and yi they were missing prayers even in the haram they were smoking and you know so forth so like yi are they really chosen or can anyone go to omrah first of all we are not judges Allah did not send us to judge people and to label h this one is chosen this one is cursed this one is this this one is that this is not our job secondly when we spend time looking and scrutinizing others will make us forget our own selves and our own sins and this is a catastrophe this is a big big problem thirdly no doubt that allahel is the most generous the most merciful and the most kind. He may guide people to go for Omrah. Yet such people are openly sinners. They sin openly and they do a lot of heinous and bad things. Does it mean that Allah has chosen them to be the chosen ones? Of course not. Yet Allah has blessed them as Allah subhana ta blesses disbelievers. Don't we have disbelievers who are multi-billionaires? Yes. Why would Allah give them so much wealth when they're evil? This is Allah's wisdom. But when Allah blesses them in this category, it doesn't mean that they're the chosen ones. Because Allah gives the dunya, gives the health, gives the wealth to those whom he loves and those whom he does not love. Yet he only gives iman. He only gives Islam to those whom he has selected and whom he loves. So something that is beyond our paycheck and pray great. Allah selects these people and they make them come to the holy lands and they perform omrah. They skip prayers. They smoke. They watch movies in their hotel rooms. Do I condemn them and label them as hypocrites or this or it's none of my business. Yet Allah has favored them when he selected them to come for Omrah. Does this mean that everything is gone and they have a a cart blanch to do whatever they want? Of course not. Yet again, this is something between them and allahel. We pray for them to be guided. So many people went and came back and to us we don't see any benefit or value but they've benefited or they will benefit in couple of years time when Allah opens their heart and throws the light of guidance in it. We never know how allahel guides people. So again, we have two concepts or two perspectives. Judging people and neglecting ourselves. We should not judge people. We judge people according to what we see. We don't say like the Americans do, hey, don't judge me. No, I'm going to judge you. If you smoke pot, I'm going to judge you. If you fornicate, I'm going to judge you. If you don't pray on time, I'm going to judge you because when someone asks me, I'm going to say he does this. these things. This is what I see. What I don't judge is your intention. What's in your heart, what will happen to you on the day of judgment. And putting this aside, I have to focus on myself. Shayan is messing up with my head all the time. Judge people, look at his uh garment below his ankle. Look at his shaven uh face. Look at this woman who's not wearing hijab. Look at this. Look at that. So, I keep on resenting people, looking down at people, thinking highly of myself. This is what shaitan wants and allahel knows best."
