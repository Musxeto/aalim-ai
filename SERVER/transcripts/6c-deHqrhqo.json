  "transcript": "from jida Saudi Arabia our first question is from Anam it says if one is not sure how many times he or she washed a body part can he or she wash that part one more time during woodo this question a lot of the Muslims ask and these simple things if we as Muslims are a are able to put the guidelines and know our parameters we would be in no need to ask similar questions in the future what does that mean or jurisprudent or the rulings of your forms of worship in particular are governed by Quran verses Hadith and the scholars have simplified these rules and regulations to be easy to comprehend and each one has its evidence to support it so when someone asks you about the pillars of woodoo what are the pillars if I miss one my woodoo is invalid the answer would be washing your face which includes turning the water in your in your mouth and sniffing the water up your nostrils and blowing it out washing your arms from the hands till the elbows wiping over your head which includes the ears number four washing your feet up to the ankles number five the order which I had just mentioned these four pillars in face arms head and feet as in accordance to the Ayah inah ma chapter 5 and finally number six that it should be simultaneous there should not be a gap between these pillars answering the phone then coming back to continue no this is noo so if you know this you don't have to ask questions regarding to the pillars of wo because now you understand the verse you understand the Sunnah end of story we come to the question one is in doubt whether he washed two or three times his arm for example to be safe would he be allowed to wash it for another extra time if you knew the Sunnah you wouldn't have asked this question so what is the Sunnah teach us no problem the prophet used to washat each limb once and he did that twice and he did that three times and he used to vary so he washes his his face once and he washes his arms twice and he wipes over the head once he washes his feet three times there's no consistency it's all alhamdulillah allowed however the prophet Alat wasam did not exceed over three times so he told us not to do this so if you are in doubt whether he washed it once twice or three times this is sufficient there's no need to be doubtful what you have done is sufficient but if you fear that will be making the fourth in this case this is not permissible and you have to refrain from doing that Rana from Saudi"
