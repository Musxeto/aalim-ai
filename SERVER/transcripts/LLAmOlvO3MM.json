  "transcript": "Sara says can my parents-in-law take the gold back they gave me on our wedding is it not my gold what is the ruling on gold gifts given to me by his family members such as his auntie's grandmother on our wedding my parents-in-law do not want to give me my gold even to keep would I still have to pay zakat on it if they keep the cat if they keep the gold you're gold with them and prevent you from acquiring it possessing it or doing whatever you want with it there's no zakat on you however I am uphold I am totally shocked with what is coming to me through emails and phone calls from sisters not mainly from the subcontinent where her parents-in-law in association with her husband sees her own gold given to her by her parents sees her own dowry given to her by her husband and they seize the gold that they gave her on the wedding night and all the gifts that were given to her and they lock it in their own room and they only permit her to take a necklace or some bracelets here and there when she has a wedding or the likes and they don't give her access to her own gold and some of the brothers call me and say that is this okay we're safe keeping it blah blah blah I say to them you there is the husband and your parents are crooks you are thieves you have to be ashamed of yourself how dare you take someone's money without his permission and keeping it and preventing them from doing whatever they sure he might sell that she might do something wrong with it it's none of your business it is her gold she decides to give it all to her father this is her gold she decides to give it in charity to build a message it's none of your business you are thieves and crooks Cher we gave her the gold on the wedding night as an investment so that we can utilize it later on for our granddaughters etc this is a big lie you know that I know that you gave her the gold as a gift but now you're keeping it with you the Prophet described you alia saw to Salaam beautifully do you know what he said he said whoever gives a gift and retracts it takes it back he has the same altitude he has the example of a dog vomiting then the dog comes and eats its vomit this is your example given by the Prophet Isis Salam how dare you give the gift and take it back or claim that no it wasn't a gift we're just lending her the money or lending her the gold how dare you take her dowdy and prevent her from using it or utilizing it as she wishes well llahi I feel sorry for such wives living among such crooks thieves who don't have shame in their face and then if you look at their daughter when they get their daughter married they tell her don't give your parents-in-law your gold keep it with us so subhanAllah it's hell are for their daughter and harem for their in-laws daughter-in-law this is shocking this is genius and I feel great resent to such people who claim to follow the Koran the Sunna if they are from deviant sects if they don't believe in the Quran and the Sunna this is maybe excusable because they have committed so many innovations and bida and they have problems in toe heat that this would be trivial but for people who claim to be salaries or to claim to follow the Quran the Sunnah and they do such hideous things well la hey I don't know how to explain this so may allah azzawajal grant you the patience and may Allah restore your right to you you can as any oppressed make duaa against them this is the only thing you can do you can make dua that Allah Azza WA JAL avenges you from such people who had taken your property unlawfully"
