  "transcript": "from india says now you said that there is no special form of worship during the month of rajab and offering such forms of worship would make it a bidder i have a confusion what about the miraculous night journey the israel and which a lot of the people think that took place on the 27th of the month of rajab is it a bidder the answer is the event itself without any doubt took place it's a reality it's a fact we believe in that did it happen in rajab we don't know it's not authentic that it happened on the 27th of rajab and hypothetically if we were to say that it did happen in the 20 on the 27th of rajab there is nothing reported in the authentic sunnah from the prophet or his companions or the tabernae or the tablet taberin to have ever celebrated that night or specifying it with sadat or special kinds of worship or reciting the quran or fasting it so anything of of the sort is a vida but to believe that the prophet salaam was taken from mecca to jerusalem and from jerusalem to the heavens depending which is first it's an issue of dispute some say he went from makkah strait to uh the seventh heaven and then he went to jerusalem led the messengers in prayer and then came back to mecca it's a different opinion among scholars which happened first this is definitely authentic and proven"
