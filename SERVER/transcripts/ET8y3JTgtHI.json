  "transcript": "a sister says my mother and I are the ones cooking if bar for the whole family during the month of ramadhan including my brothers who do not pray and sleep whole day and wake up at iftar Thai time without taking advantage of the month do we still qualify to get the reward of cooking for them the answer is yes and you would be more rewarded if you would try to give Dawa to your brothers and supplying in a very kind and diplomatic and indirect way so that may Allah so JAL open their chests and hearts to the words of truth that would add more value than cooking but without any doubt cooking for them and serving them during the month of Ramadan is highly rewarded"
