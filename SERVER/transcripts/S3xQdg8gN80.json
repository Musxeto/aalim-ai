  "transcript": "is it permissible to look in front during salat or is it a must to look at the place of prostration and is there any hadith of the Prophet as I'm regarding this where a person looks is related to the amount of hosh or of submissiveness in his salat the Prophet told us alehissalaam that looking around while praying so if a person looks like this this is stealing off say of Satan from his prayer so Satan is actually snatching from his prayer bits and pieces and the scholars say that the Sunnah is to look where a person is prostrating and this was reported from a man from so many great scholars of Islam that one limits his looking to the spot where he puts his head when he prostrates and this is why we put a Sutra is Sutra is a visor is about a foot high that we put in front of us a screen a visor so that it limits our gaze from going here and there so when you pray you pray in submissiveness and look at the prostration spot now is it mandatory the answer is no so if I look up my sprayer is still valid meaning look forward not up to the sky because looking up to the sky while you're praying is a major sin that may be punished by allah azza wajal turning a person blind this is disrespectful during prayer during salat to look up while you are praying unlike outside the salat if you're not praying and you make duaa any look up this is permissible but during salat you must not raise your head and look at the heavens at all as the prohibition came from the prophet alayhi salat wa sir so coming back to the question is it permissible to look in front it is not recommended but if there is a need for that then there's no problem what do you mean by if there is a need for that if a person is praying and he is afraid of an enemy coming or he's waiting for a messenger to come with good news that may impact his life or the life of others so he's praying and all the time looking in front of him to see if anyone comes or if someone is praying and he doesn't know if it's time for Fechter or not so he wants to know whether he should offer whitter or not so he looks in front of him where the watch is or the clock this is something that is permissible no problem but to pray all the time looking up at the people's backs and their hairstyles looking at the message it's decoration looking at the fans know this is not permissible but does it invalidate the prayer there is no it does not invalidate your prayer but definitely it reduces the reward coming out of that"
