  "transcript": "says is it permissible for Muslim women to wear kimono and that is a Japanese traditional dress what about Japanese Muslim women so this question has two parts number one the ruling on wearing something that is known only to be worn by non-muslims and the ruling is prohibition and the evidence is overwhelming in the Hadith of the Prophet saws when he says and this this Hadith was narrated by Abdullah um pleased with a man with his father woman and whoever imitates a people he is considered to be among them now imitating a people means you are mimicking them in what is specifically part of their characteristics and tradition and religion not something that is widely spread so using a car this is done by the non-muslims can we use cars can we wear watches can we use pens when writing wear glasses it's of course this is not something specific only done by the non-muslims can I wear jeans and t-shirt no problem half if not more of the Muslims wear jeans and t-shirts there's no problem in doing that the issue is can I wear a specific attire or a dress or clothes that when people look at me would I identify would identify me as a non-muslim the answer is no so this is part one of the question it's not permissible says what about if a Japanese woman accepts Islam she lives among her people do we tell her that you have to change all your clothes this is a sensitive issue why when the prophet Allah and his companions were living in Mecca they did not change their clothes they were not ordered to okay take off your clothes and put a new set of a three-piece suit or a tuck or a bow tie or what they were not ordered to do this just to go out of their way and change your clothes they were among the community this was their dress code so they continued so for a Muslim woman who lives in Japan and this is part of her culture of her daily life of her clothes I would I'm inclined to say that this is okay this is permissible for a Muslim person living in China or in Japan using Chopsticks to eat if he accepts Islam we don't say drop your chopsticks start eating with a spoon or use your hands let me continue to do that the issue is for me as a Muslim when I go to a Chinese restaurant and I order a bowl of rice and some even a bowl of soup and they say can I have Chopsticks duh what is this I said Chinese food I have to eat in the Chinese way you gotta collect it one by one can be reasonable why are you doing this there is no answer except to imitate there's no fun in eating with chopsticks I've tried it I've been there I've done that but it's how to impress people how to feel that you're overcoming your inferiority complex may Allah protect this so coming back to the question yes if you are in Japan and you're from Japan and this is your cultural dress that you wear or you used to wear and now you're a Muslim there's I see no problem in wearing it of course without exposing yourself to Nan mahram you can wear it with in front of women and providing it does not shape your body so it's not really really tight as in some uh kimonos when they're really really tight and exposed the bone structure and a woman cannot walk except like a few centimeters apart this doesn't make any sense but again we don't say that it is Haram and Allah Knows Best"
