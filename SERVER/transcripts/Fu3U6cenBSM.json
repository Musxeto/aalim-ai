  "transcript": "and blessings and blessings dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum today we have a new Hadith and there are so many lessons we can learn from it I don't know if we will have time for this to be thoroughly studied in this program or in the coming days or not but we will give it a shot with him said that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam once sent an expedition to a tribe of the Idol worshipers who were fighting the Muslims and they met and fought and there was an idol worshiper a mushrik who was an excellent fighter and he was killing right left and Center and one of the Muslims gender says with him and we were told that he was usaid followed that man until he got hold of him and raised his sword to strike him when the man saw the sword he said Allah the testimony of faith the testimony that when a person says it becomes a Muslim so Usama killed him and the messenger from the battlefield came to the prophet Allah to give him the Glad Tidings of the victories so he sat there and he spoke to the prophet about the about the whole battle until he reached that incident and he said to that man he killed him and the prophet summoned usaid so Osama came and the prophet asked him first why did you kill him Osama said o prophet of Allah this mushrik has inflicted a lot of harm upon the Muslims he killed so and so and so and so and he gave a list of the Muslims that this man single-handedly killed the prophet asked him a clear question once again did you kill him the man said yes the prophet asked him what will you do with on the day of judgment meaning that when it comes on the day of judgment complaining to Allah that you've killed the person who said it what will you do there so he said Osama said o prophet of Allah ask Allah to forgive me and the prophet kept on repeating it and repeating it what will you do with Allah on the day of judgment now this was reported in Muslim in another narration agreed upon by buhari and by Muslim usaid says the prophet said to me Usama you killed him after he said Allah so I Justified my action by saying O prophet of Allah he only said it to protect himself and to prevent himself from my sword the prophet said you killed him after he said and he kept on repeating it until Usama pleased with him said I wished that I did not Embrace Islam until that day now in this beautiful Hadith there are so many lessons we must learn as Muslims if we are the true Muslims first of all in Islam we are not ordered to look into people's intentions and hearts because this is only Allah who has the ability to do this not even the prophet Allah not even the prophet Islam is entitled to do such a thing he judges in accordance to what he sees in accordance what appears to him as for what's in the heart this is to be judged only by Allah and if we deal with people in such a fashion our life would be much easier than what it is at the moment the biggest problem with Muslims is that they judge people by their intentions and this is wrong you see a wrong action you judge the action not the intention so many times people do mistakes people do sins or people do crimes and they say well Our intention was not as it appeared to you we say islamically we only judge your actions what you had said as for your hearts it's between you and Allah it was reported that in the Battle of Badr the uncle of the Prophet Allah was captured among the prisoners so the prophet Islam according to the advice of a buckar ordered them to pay Ransom so that he would set them free as pows Abbas came to the prophet saws and said o prophet of Allah I am a Muslim but I'm pretending not to be one and I'm with the idol worshipers so that I can convey information for you but I am a Muslim the prophet said we judge you by what you do and look not but why but not but let me rephrase that not by what you claim so you say that this is something in your heart but you were captured while being with the mushrik army so this means that you're with them if you're truthful Allah will compensate you for what we take from you and if you're not then you're being treated like everyone else so this is point one never judge people by their intentions or what's in their hearts the man said in a situation where he just killed few of my colleagues and Muslim Brothers yet by saying it immediately I have to accept it for his face value he's a Muslim I cannot go beyond that I cannot be more Roman than the Romans as they say he said no he intended to protect himself but he's not really a Muslim what will you do with on the day of judgment and therefore if someone testifies that there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah and that the prophet Muhammad is his messenger and he prays and he gives zakat he's a Muslim if he says he's a Shiri roughly a jersey whatever he says as long as he on the surface says these things he's a Muslim regardless of his label regardless of his cult but if he performs or admits to a belief that nullifies Islam in this case it's a different story we have to look into the criteria for giving Tech fear but the default is whoever says unlike the Hawaii reach to them everyone is a kaffir by default unless he proves otherwise and that is why they go on a killing spree and they kill anyone they meet even if he was a judge or a scholar or an Imam because to him or to them he is nothing but a kafir because he intends cover in his heart and they know this subhanallah from this Hadith we know that whoever announces the shahada he's a Muslim now a lot of the people judge others ah this revert said the shahada only to get married to this Muslim sister this person claims to be a Muslim so that they would give him a raise at work because they're all Muslims so being a kafir would not give him any chance of getting a raise so people accuse others intentions and this is unislamic you hold me accountable for what I say hold me accountable for what I do what's in my heart is between me and Allah azzawajal and that is why on the battle of tabuk when the prophet went and came back 80 plus men came and apologized they were Hypocrites no doubt about it yet they gave lame excuses and the prophet Allah accepted and this is the Hadith he said the prophet accepted their apology gave them the Pledge of Allegiance and sought forgiveness for them at the sight of Allah all of these things yet he knows they are hypocrites and liars and Allah exposed them in chapter 9 Surah nevertheless the prophet Allah is our role model he is doing what we are all supposed to be doing that is to believe the people when they claim something not to act upon their intention not to judge them according to what's in their hearts because no one has the knowledge of such a thing except Allah in this Hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is magnifying in great proportions the issue of killing killing is not an easy thing taking a soul of a human being is not an easy thing the prophet told us that part of the signs of the day of judgment meaning that these are the signs that we are approaching the end of time is the spread of killing people kill one another without knowing why they're doing so killing is abhorred in Islam it is something that Islam forbids and restricts the prophet said and the Hadith is narrated or reported in Muslim the prophet said whoever Rebels against my um so we have an ummah Muslims and a faction Rebels comes out and Rebels striking the righteous and the non-righteous the good and the bad and he does not refrain or hold back from the righteous and the Believers and he does not fulfill his Covenant he is not of me and I am not of him Allah this fits like a glove with those terrorists whether they're Isis daresh whatever people names they have look at them blowing masjids in Nigeria while the people are waiting for a star blowing hotels in Chad and magadishu in Lahore is this part of Islam is this part of the teaching of the Prophet Allah is not he himself said whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me and these people are not of him I guarantee this for you the prophet said that he is not of me and I'm not of him the one who rebells against the Believers and he kills everybody Allah says in the Quran and whoever kills a Believer intentionally his recompense is held to abide therein forever and the Wrath and the curse of Allah are upon him and the great punishment is prepared for him those who call themselves Freedom Fighters or they're doing Jihad who are they killing they're killing the Muslims they're killing other mujahideen they're killing civilians they wouldn't kill the kafir the real kafir why because to them the Muslims who apostasized are more worthy of being killing than the Jews and the Christians and even the Jews and Christians you are not allowed to kill unless they fight against you unless they are enemy armies on your territory on on your land you may kill them but the Muslims why are you killing them the prophet said every sin Allah might forgive there's a possibility except a person who dies in the state of kufur in the seat of shirk in the state of disbelief meaning he's not a Muslim or a believer killing another believer intentionally if you kill someone who's a Muslim intentionally then you will not be forgiven the prophet said if the whole inhabitants of the heavens and of the Earth where to participate where to collaborate in the blood of a Believer meaning in shedding the blood of a Believer and killing a Believer Allah would toss them all and throw them all in hell if the inhabitants of the heavens and the Earth all the humans all the Jinn all the Angels were to collaborate in killing a single individual a Believer the prophet tells us Allah that Allah would throw them all in hell and this shows you the gravity of the sin those people are doing suicide bombers why are you doing this he said I want Jannah I want Paradise are you in paradise and who told you that this is the way of paradise this is the way to hell you blow yourself up you end up in hell because you committed suicide and wallahi they did not choose you because you're brave or your Gallant they chose you because you were stupid if what you're doing is something good for you and good for Islam and good for the Hereafter and to your Paradise they would have selected that mission themselves why would they bring you all the way thousands of miles to do something they could have done and they're the locals simply because they couldn't find anyone stupid As You Are this is something you have to reflect upon you are not following your Prophet Allah which means you do not love him you love this world your heart is filled with hatred your heart is darkened by these negative feelings you have and this is unislamic this is not the way the Muslims were raised by the way do you know he's the fourth caliph may Allah be pleased with him and he's the cousin of the Prophet Allah and he is the son-in-law of the Prophet Assam the husband of Fatima Muhammad how did he die he was assassinated by Abraham and who was he he was one of the kawaris he believed that Hadi who is one of the ten heaven-bound who is one of the best of the Muslim ummah ranked number four he believed that he's a kafir and he deserves to be killed if such lunatics Fanatics could do such a thing to one of the greatest companions on Earth how do you think this would trans form into in our days into a killing spree into bombings assassinations killing civilians and innocent people indiscriminately and then they come and say that this is Islam the Hadith is a really important Hadith for us to contemplate upon simply because it's reported in bukhari Muslim so it has the highest degree of authenticity after the Quran secondly because Usama by the way was the so-called adopted son of the Prophet is when adoption was permitted but then it was abrogated before that everyone knew him as Muhammad but when Allah abrogated it in chapter 33 then he was called after his father he was the love of the Prophet as a son so he used to be known as the love of the prophet he was his adopted son and then when he got a Boy by the name of Usama the prophet loved Osama as a grandson so this man of such a high ranking of such closeness and love between him and the prophet Allah and when we see how the prophet reacted to what he had done we understand and realize the gravity of the issue of killing someone who testified that there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah regardless of the circumstances and regardless what is in her his heart this is between him and Allah burning people alive is this part of what the prophet salaam used to do Killing Children Killing women executing innocent people executing Scholars of Islam judges of sharia imams reciders of the Quran executing Them In Cold Blood even if they say them these people are the dogs of hell and whoever collaborates with them whoever sympathizes with them will be with them on the day of judgment because you turn away from the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah and hence these are the dogs of hell if you were sincere if you are looking to what pleases Allah azzawajal go back to the Quran and understand it only with the understanding of the salaf how the prophet taught it to us how his companions understood it and don't twist it and don't only rely on the Quran to understand it as it is because this is the fashion and the methodology of the people of innovation you cannot understand the Quran by simply reading the Quran because this is exactly what the khawaris did exactly what the people of irja did all those who follow their whims and desires known as they only rely on the Quran because as Omar said may Allah be pleased with him the Quran has faces it has angles to look into so whenever you read an Ayah shaytan comes to you so that he twists your angle into what suits your Innovation or your whims but if you govern this engage it you're on the right track do not speak to them by the Quran that is when you debate with the people of innovation and whims and desires do not speak to them with the Quran because it has different angles speak with them through the Sunnah and this is where your Akida is fixed this is the importance of Sunnah but to only focus on the Quran alone without these knowledges these sciences that help you understand what Allah wants of you then you are in a big trouble if you don't use this from the Hadith of Osama bin Zaid we understand again the importance of Akida now a lot of the people say the Hadith of Osama means that if you say then we should consider you as a Muslim no this is not what the Hadith says the Hadith is corresponding I was ordered to fight the human race I was ordered to fight the people until they testify there's no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah our Feud with the people is only for them to worship Allah so if someone says he's a Muslim we accept this from him and we refrain from harming him when there's a fight when there's armies attacking one another we stop until something else pops up but on the face value he's a Muslim then he is ordered to okay let's pray and if he prays khalas he's a full-fledged Muslim what else do you want if he does something that may nullify his Islam we do not jump the gun on the contrary we ask him we interrogate him we clarify things for him so if if someone for example in the United Kingdom on the U.S or in in Denmark reverse to Islam he's a newly revert and he says that whiskey is okay there's no problem in drinking scotch on the rocks so this is kufur you're a kafir we no no wait wait wait don't jump the gun the guy is a new a new Muslim so most likely he has issues and the biggest issue is his ignorance so we cannot give him Tech fear we cannot call him a cafe and there is a list of things that must be followed before you actually give takfir not only that it is not me and you who gives the fear it's a panel of Judges a panel of Scholars who would sit and talk to that individual and try to bring him back to his senses and to explain to him so that person who says scotch on The Rock Says halal he's not a kafir what he had said is a statement of kufur yes but as an individual we do not label them as a kaffir until we bring him and say these are the verses of prohibition of intoxicants in the Quran these are the Hadith this is the consensus of all Scholars of Islam that anything that intoxicates you is prohibited and it takes the ruling of wine or intoxicants mentioned in the Quran and he says ha I didn't know so now you know said yes now I know I still insist that it's okay in this case he becomes a cover but if he was shown the the right path and he sought Allah's forgiveness I apologize I did I didn't know or I did it out of error oh out of arrogance I apologize your page is clean you have nothing to be afraid or ashamed of we all do mistakes therefore it is very crucial and important not to dilute issues of Akida you go to someone who worships the graves and prostrates to them he says I'm a Muslim no actually you're not a Muslim what you're doing is an act of shirk and this nullifies your Islam I'll explain it to you one two three you uh agree if he agrees alhamdulillah if he doesn't then this is something else we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back and welcome back we have Abdul qadir from Nigeria she said yes yes please it is permissible to start uh your social immediately after it okay any more questions after any more questions from Saudi Arabia Lottery six yeah Harmony is so my father told her that she has to pay zakat on the gold also because including all the wealth uh she already paid but I just wanted to confirm because I heard that the goal should be 85 gram so should she pays a carton 50 gram gold second question my second question is when we raise our hands at the end Imam says salaam on Prophet saws so that time we keep our hands down is it correct or we should still raise our hands okay first question Yeah question number three my sister asked that she in she from from Saudi Arabia she went to Pakistan during Ramadan and in Pakistan you know always there is one more fasting because they start one day later and one other Eid is also one day late so she asked that for example if 30 fastings are there and when she will be there she will Fast 31 days so after teeth when she will complete her missed fasting for example it is seven days missed so should she make up for seven days or for six days because already she fast 31 days number four yeah question number four is that um in the prayer when Imam says Allah to move on the positions for recruits or any others we will listen only all over and move or we should also say Allahu Akbar by our own self after he says okay and question number five if we don't memorize for example I don't memorize the Arabic supplications in Ruku only subhanallah as you might say but nowadays for example the required are so prolonged so can I repeat again and again and if I can then is it must it should be in odd numbers or I can say uh any as much as I can during that time okay question number six uh if anyone for example I missed Isha prayer in Masjid and I prayed my uh by my own in the home so can I join uh Imam in if I didn't pray behind him the Isha prayer but I Prayed by my own and my home from Turkey uh I just heard about your remarks about Isis and I would like thank you for uh saying such things about it you know at first Mustafa do you have a question okay a question straight straight to your question please yeah uh yes another one Paul said that Isis created the U.S and okay for your remarks but again we insist on having only questions Sarah Sarah from Kenya yes yes I just had a question um is it okay for women to perm their to although we lost Sarah but I think she was asking about trimming the hair I'm not sure anyhow Abdul qadir from Nigeria says that we know of the six of shawwal the sixth of shawal is the six days after Ramadan and fasting them is a great reward uh with Allah the prophet says whoever fasts Ramadan and follows that by fasting six days of shawwal Allah would reward him as if he fasted the whole entire year and when to begin of course the first day of Aid it is totally prohibited for any soul to fasted but after the first day which is the second day onwards to the end of the month you can fast these days in a row or scattered so if you fast Mondays and Thursdays this does the job if you fast them all in a row or two days and Skip few days in two days it's up to you the sky is the limit we have uh Waseem from Kuwait Allah thanks so much for uh speaking about uh those you know groups that you said they don't they actually go to hell and you know uh they are working with the Positive regimes okay question question the question is uh okay my question is what is your uh what is the Islamic ruling on uh gambling in the mouth of Ramadan and uh what is your take on those Muslims who give taxi on the others is it Sunnah from Saudi jalid hello yes sir yesterday the Imam is like when we when you go to Ruku and it's taking time so what we have to decide that time what do you mean by taking time in the position of record taking like many hours like the 10 minutes five minutes yeah so during that time what have we had to decide sir I will answer inshallah thank you um we have okay Nadia uh had sex six questions um her mother has 50 grams of gold with cash does she have to pay zakat for the gold the answer is no it did not reach the 85 grams threshold so there is no zakat on it uh she says that in at the very end we say we say Allah at the conclusion when he says some people fold their hands some people put their hands uh uh by their sides is this right the answer is yes the salutation of the Prophet is not Dua so we don't raise our hands it's a salutation to the prophet salaam by asking Allah so raising the hands in kunout needs an Evidence and when we offer salutation to the prophet salaam elsewhere we never raise our hands so we shouldn't do that here either her mom went to Pakistan and they may I don't know if her mom or her sister someone went to Pakistan and they started to fast with us here in Ramadan in Saudi and Pakistan is a day late so we started like Thursday they started uh on Friday so most likely their Eid would be one day late so how would she do she has to fast with them even if this exceeds the 30 days so if she reaches a 31 days this is part of Ramadan for her can she consider the extra day as a day of compensation for a missed day because of her Menses the answer is no the whole 31 days are considered to be off Ramadan and she has to make fast it with them she says when the Imam says bow or Allahu Akbar to prostrate raised from prostration do we say it the answer is definitely this is mandatory upon you and upon the Imam you have to say Allahu Akbar in each and every movement except when he says you do not repeat after him but rather you answer what he had said by saying her fifth question she doesn't um memorize a lot of Dua to be said in the Bowing position in the record or in the sujood position and this is similar to jalid's question from Saudi Arabia when the Imam prolongs the Ruku and the sujud what do we say first of all in night prayer it is the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah to prolong the Ruku and the sujut and to prolong it in a fashion that is really long so what do we say there are a number of great duas to be recited and it's in the Sunnah so you have to obtain for example or foreign and you may find some of it scattered here and there so you can say it and repeat it but if you do not know what to say then you may repeat the supplication such as subhanallah repeating it until the Imam raises his head in the sujood position you can say subhanallah once or three times and then ask Allah for whatever you want from this Dunya and from the so oh Allah pay off my debts so Allah guide my wife or Allah guide my children or Allah give me Health in my body oh Allah give me a strong Iman or Allah give me the highest levels in paradise and you have the whole world to ask would give Allah is the most generous so if you don't have these supplications that were prescribed by our Prophet is the limit and finally she says if I prayed Asia home and I couldn't pray but I know that at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock uh a.m they have a extra set of prayers known as so can I definitely you can you you're not restricted in praying everything or not praying anything at all you can pray to our cousin leave you can pray for you can play Pray eleven whatever you want this is all permissible we have Muhammad from Libya I'm calling from Libby and I wanted to ask two questions if it's okay it's okay if a question is no problem yeah okay the first one is uh I was in an Islamic country and all my slow countrymen are Muslims so I want to know when our government is corrupt is it our responsibility to you know go against them and topple them or should we obey them as Muslims just because it's a problem second question second question yeah the second question is if a cruel man goes and kills someone else and then comes to our house is it right that you let him in and you know act as his host because that's what Saudi Arabia is okay I got your question inshallah leader who came there he's a killer and Saudi Arabia I got your question I got your question Muhammad Anwar from Saudi Arabia uh okay we are human being while calculating the zakat we may make a mistake and and probably not complete the target what we are supposed to so in this case when we give others something will there is a card will be compensated do you intend it to compensate for your zika or you just give it generally uh okay any more questions no thank you very much Sarah from Kenya and she says is it permissible to clip and uh the line was cut off usually when callers call and they begin the questions like this either they're asking is it permissible to clip our nails and to cut our hair while fasting and the answer is yes it has nothing to do with your fasting or is it permissible to trim our hair and cut it short as women and the answer is yes as long as you're not imitating men so you don't have a very real short haircut or resembling men there's no problem in that insha Allah um Hamad from Libya she says that what's the ruling on obeying a corrupt uh um government and should we obey them or should we topple them and rebel against them and he's calling from Libya and we know what is happening in Libya and how the terrorists are trying to cause confusion and tyranny and Chaos there and then he's asking another question which is not a question actually but it's again part of their Twisted ideology these people don't know the Quran and from his accent he is you know from where he doesn't even read the Quran he doesn't know the Sunnah and he's asking a question that is basic knowledge to Children if we have a corrupt government can we rebel against it what did the prophet say Allah know the answer the prophet said Allah it is totally prohibited for you to go against the ruler unless number one you see so it's not something that you heard you saw this with your own eyes you see blatant and not possible something that is Crystal Clear number three kufur number four you have ample evidence from Allah on it four conditions the prophet put Allah when the companions said o prophet of Allah the ruler is corrupt the government is out of of of order shouldn't we fight them shouldn't we take arms against them the prophet gave four conditions only if you see not if you hear people speaking you have to see and you see blatant kufford so it is clear and it is kufur not anything else and fourthly you have evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah that is totally unambiguous Bilal from Tunisia hello I appreciate you for your good program against Isis and your question is between Isis and Saudis okay they're very active they call from all over the world they are invading uh the internet Facebook the Twitter like cockroaches and the Muslims the sunnis the salafis are standing Idol they're not commencing either they're afraid or they think that no this is just you know a cloud in in summer and it will disappear you have to make a stand and you have to make a difference and you can make a difference with the grace of Allah you have to expose this and show the people their true nature their blood thirsty they are not related neither to the Quran or nor to the Sunnah the prophet said whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me and they are not of him so these people they are clearly the dogs of Hellfire and all what they are doing is just claiming that and announcing that to the whole world may Allah guide them uh I mean I mean from Bahrain hello I have one question yes uh Chef we have got um we have heard hadees saying that if we pray uh Isha pray with Jama and then we go to sleep and then we pray the Fajr with the JAMA again it is as if we have prayed the whole night now in the ravada if we pray Jabba and do taravi and we don't pray and then again we join the main congregation will we get the full Sabbath of the whole night praying and is it will be okay for uh also this uh okay any more questions again Sarah yes oh sorry I got cut off earlier my question was can women color their hair or change the texture especially if you're from African descent we tend to have rough hair sometimes can I permit or is that um okay any more questions okay no that's all okay um Wasim from uh Kuwait and I doubt he's from Kuwait definitely he's calling from somewhere else he was asking two questions unrelated he's asking about the ruling of gambling in Ramadan so this is like a bait for a second question that he's trying to give uh gambling is totally prohibited in Ramadan and in other places uh other months as well so it's it's prohibited in the Gulf countries it's prohibited in Las Vegas it's prohibited in Atlantic City it's prohibited in Monaco Monte Carlo everywhere so this is it as for takfir I will talk about takfir tomorrow inshallah and the misconceptions of these khawaris and how they give takfir and also those who are affiliated with them how they leave they have a possibility of seriously leaving Islam by giving take fear to others because the prophet Allah told us that whoever says to a Muslim one of them will take it so if you say to accept what you're saying but on the day of judgment one of us will take it so if you're wrong and there is a possibility that you might be wrong that you will take it on the day of judgment uh so one must be uh careful Aisha from Gambia yes hello yes how are you I'm fine yeah I was asking whether a woman have to see her period and go to the mosque if if a woman has her period yes can she go to the mosque to pray if she has her period how can she pray that is big yeah I will answer your question inshallah you're quite welcome okay um Anwar from Saudi Arabia he says that sometimes we give the zakat money but due to a human error we may make a mistake don't open the door for shaytan if you do your level best in calculating your zakat and you according to your knowledge that this is your zakat Allah would not hold you accountable if it's less than this or more this is something that Allah would not hold you accountable but if you want to give something extra just in case whatever charity you give is is permissible so if your zakat money is 1000 reals and you say well I'm doubtful uh let me make it 1200 reals that's okay there's no problem in that but once you give the charity you should have this intention not after giving a poor person 500 yells and and I leave and then said ah I'll tell you what let 200 of what I give in him be of to fix whatever uh wrong is in my zakat calculation no this cannot be it has to be intended before you actually give it out I mean from Bahrain says we know that there is a Hadith and the Hadith is referring to is in Muslim and elsewhere the prophet said whoever prays reisha in congregation as if he has prayed half a night and whoever prays Fajr in congregation it would be rewarded to him as if he prayed the whole night so he says hmm if we do the math if I pray Russia and Fajr during the last 10 nights of Ramadan and I pray them in congregation this means I will be rewarded exactly as if I prayed night prayer so hence I will also get the reward of praying it's not calculated like this first of all you have to make sure that your prayer of Aisha and Fajr is according to what pleases Allah azzawajal and that the hashur was attained second of all there is a difference between there is a difference between reward and what makes up for an actual form of worship for example the prophet says whoever prays Fajr in the Masjid in the congregation and remains there remembering Allah until the sun rises and then he prays turaka Allah would reward him for a Hajj and umrah perfect perfect this is the Hadith so can any person say to himself in this case I don't have to go for Hajj because I already performed Hajj this morning when I prayed or even better more if you say Allah as if you have freed four slaves of uh the descendants of prophet is married so if I have Oaths that I have broken what I would would I say okay I did four so I have three now because one is freeing a slave and I freed already four by saying this no the reward is different than the actual or what takes place of the form of worship likewise if you pray Aisha and Fajr you will be rewarded but it would not be at all like that person who prayed the whole night otherwise the prophet Islam would have slept the whole night and just prayed Fajr and the Isha in congregation during the last 10 nights of Ramadan I wish seriously I wish it was as easy as that but it's not so there are five more day nights to go maybe four so do your best in them inshallah from Kenya she says that due to their uh nature some of the sisters and the brothers in Africa have afros and the hair is uh hard so what's the ruling on um straightening it up by chemicals or by any other means there's no problem in that as long as it's not harmful medically for you if you go and make your uh hair straight and and really loose with chemicals there's nothing wrong in that at all now dyeing it or changing the color this is also permissible but to my knowledge there are two types of dye some type is like the henna which is merely a color see if I use this pen and I put a mark on my finger this is not something that is a an obstacle for water to reach my skin this is just the color it doesn't have any Mass but there are hair dye that are chemical made and they make a layer on the head itself so even the hair would look thicker and heavier now this is a problem because it prevents water from reaching the hair itself because of this layer and this you cannot use but other than that though the type that has the color only this is permissible Aisha and this is our last question of today uh says what's the ruling for a woman in her Menses to go for Masjid entering the message is totally prohibited for a woman in her Menses but to attend the Eid prayer if it is conducted outside of the uh defenses of the Masjid or in the open as the Sunnah is this is permissible they don't pray but they attend the congregation and they stay away from the worshipers and they listen to the khutbah the sermon and they participate in the Dua but not to pray however if this is conducted in a Masjid she is not allowed to enter the Masjid she may stay out of the gates of the Masjid with other women in their Menses knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's program until we meet next time Beyond oh"
