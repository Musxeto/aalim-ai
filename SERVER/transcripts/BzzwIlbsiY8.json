  "transcript": "Isis as you've said in one of your posts that a Muslim must not serve food to anyone during the daytime of Ramadan are we not even supposed to serve food to our elders sick and children who do not fast Asha you misunderstood what I had said it is an issue of dispute whether a disbeliever a person who's not a Muslim any person who's not a Muslim is a kafir at this believer whether it is a Christian Jew Buddhist see a Hindu as long as he does not embrace Islam he's a disbeliever in our point of view in our religion he's a disbeliever if I go to a Christian if I go to the Pope and I say Pope am i a disbeliever or a believer he said son do you believe that Jesus is the far is the son and he is our Lord and Savior I said no I believe he's our greatest one of the greatest messengers of Allah and is a human being he said you're a disbeliever Pope you're getting me tech field said yes what's wrong in that if I go to a to a Jew if I go to a Buddhist if I they all say if you do not follow my way then you're not with us if you're not with us you're against us so this is the norm if you are not a Muslim you are a disbeliever you're a kafir that doesn't mean that I have to kill you I have to harm you on the contrary Islam tells us how to deal with you but with fairness in accordance to the parameters of Islam not to dilute things and say like oh we're all brothers and sisters you're a kaffir you can worship an either or a statue or whatever but this doesn't mean a thing we're brothers and sis is not true yet we do not transgress against them they have their religion they worship from whether they want it's up to them now issue is it's an issue of dispute whether a disbeliever is accountable for the major and minor things in Islam or not what do you mean she'll see I must fast the days of Ramadan a Muslim if I do not I'm sinful and I'll be punished for that is John who is not a Muslim accountable as well sure he's a kafir yes I know but is he also accountable for the small things for not clipping his fingernails for not growing his beard for not praying five times a day the most authentic opinion is that he's accountable though his kafir he is held accountable for all the these details that Allah ordered him to do yet he did not fulfill which leads us to the conclusion and that is in the daytime of Ramadan he's a kafir he eats and drinks in his country okay this is up to him he's gonna be held accountable for that I on the other hand have a restaurant and as a Muslim can I serve Him food during the daytime of Ramadan let me ask you another question if a Muslim comes during the daytime of Ramadan can I cook him food where he does not have any legitimate reason to break his fasting as there is no likewise this kafir I'm not allowed to sell him food or drink during the daytime of Ramadan but sure he's not fasting this is his problem my problem is not to give him assistance not to cooperate with him on this evil which is not fasting which is one of the byproducts of being a kafir if you understood this Asia then you can understand the answer to your question the elders in my home a woman who's menstruating a child whose life's too fast a sick person who has permission from Allah to skip fasting a person who is a traveler who has permission from Allah to skip fasting all of those I can prepare food and serve them without any problem because they have a legitimate excuse from Allah which allows them to eat or drink during the daytime of Ramadan so I hope inshallah this answers your question"
