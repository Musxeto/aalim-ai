  "transcript": "uh sh my question is that I didn't know that rest is part of the AA and we have to cover it during prayer I have prayed all this time without covering the wrist but I did cover my elbow until the mid of my forearms always but sometimes I also prayed with my wrist covered so my question is do I have to make up for all of those prayers and if yes then how do I pray it because I don't know how many times I have prayed with my wrist covered and how many times I have not Allah is the most merciful the most forgiving and the most kind Allah subhah wa ta'ala does not hold us accountable when we behave out of ignorance or due to an error or a mistake so alhamdulillah what had happened in the past without your knowledge of this being from the Is Forgiven and you don't have to make up any of your prayers"
