  "transcript": "last time we talked about the of lordship and the second type of is and this is of worship it is called because we attributed to Allah it's also called because it's attributed to the forms of worship and to worshiping Allah the almighty and it can also be called and either way this form ofed is one of the highest and most important forms of it is to worship alone with all types of I whether it is verbal or through actions whether it is concealed or exposed and apparent to everyone and is to completely deny and to reject giving or offering any type of worship to other than Allah Allah says Allah had decreed that you must not worship except him and also it can be defined as worshiping Allah with the actions of his servants so the lordship toed is worshiping Allah Asel through his actions being the Creator The Giver of life and death the facilitator of all things the provider the ETC while the of worship is worshiping Allah with our own deeds and actions and this is the type ofed that the error has occurred and the defects and all the problems took place and this is why Allah had sent the prophets and The Messengers peace be upon them so that they would clarify this to their people and to bring them back from Darkness to the light and through this form ofed those who followed the messengers were successful and those who didn't failed and went to hell Allah Asel says and we did not send any messenger before you oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam but we inspired him saying none has the right to be worshiped but Allah so worship me alone and none else so this is clear that only Allah is worthy of being woried and Allah Asel also says that is because Allah he is the truth and that which they invoke besides him is Al which means falsehood Satan and all other false deities and that Allah he is the most high the most great this form ofed is indeed one of the greatest forms ofed and where the deviation in the umah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the followers of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam the deviation took place in this form of so now when we say of what are we referring to the sky is the limit if you pray this has to be to Allah if you prostrate if you bow if you have trust it has to be only in Allah if you have fear you have to fear only Allah if you have hope you have to have hope only in Allah when you seek cure for your children your heart should be connected with Allah knowing that only he can cure them when you want something and you want it real bad your heart has to be connected with Allah knowing that only Allah can bring you benefit and when you fear something and you want to seek Refuge you seek refuge in Allah because you know that only Allah the almighty has the power to give you Refuge from what you fear and what you worry about and hence these types of worship we will find that they can be verbal they can be through our actions with our bodies and they can be by the heart all of this is what the book of revolves around and this is where you find a lot of the musl Muslims for falling into blatant shik they worship other than Allah go to dargas go to graveyards and you find them worshiping the dead look what the sects and and Cults are saying yah Hussein they're calling Al Hussein they're calling Ali in asking him for benefit and seeking refuge in him from Evil and they're dead they don't even have any benefit that they br can bring to themselves let alone to you and I so when you see people even the slightest forms of shik it's still sh when we have a the minor shik when people say last quarter I managed to fulfill my targets and increase the profit by 25% and reduce expenditure by 50% and I managed to do this and I managed to do that when you attribute all what you have done to yourself neglecting Allah even verbally although your heart is content but verbally you did not acknowledge Allah's Grace over you this is considered to be part of the minor shik that the scholars have warned us of this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
