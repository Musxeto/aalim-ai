  "title": "Can we offer funeral prayer for someone who does not pray? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "rashad from tunisia now he says says that if someone knows that this person doesn't pray he must not cheat the people and he must warn them not to pray funeral prayer after his death we've been through this if you go to my youtube channel you will probably find a lecture called the great debate and this was done in birmingham when i was allowed to go there nine years ago ten years ago it was a debate but it was a not a debate it was a dialogue between dr bilal philips abu amina may allah preserve him and myself about the ruling on a person who does not pray the conclusion was that there are there is a theoretical aspect and a practical aspect the theoretical aspect is anyone who doesn't praise a kafir boom the uh a practical aspect is let's implement this in today's world i cannot go and say okay my father doesn't pray so he's a kafir how do you know i haven't seen him pray okay this is practical do you know if he doesn't if he prays or not when you are in the masjid no but most like ah most likely this doesn't count this is bogus this is doubtful he may pray when you're in the bathroom he may pray when you're in the masjid he may pray when you're alone when you're asleep at night you never know so unless he confesses and says i don't pray i don't believe in praying and the conditions of taking him out of the fold of islam are fulfilled so he's not ignorant he's knowledgeable he's not forced he is willingly doing it he doesn't have any misinterpretation rather he knows exactly what's going on other than that you cannot claim that he's a kafir his faith is with allah azzawajal and definitely you cannot go to people and say oh my my dad died as a kafir don't offer funeral prayer because this is not right"
