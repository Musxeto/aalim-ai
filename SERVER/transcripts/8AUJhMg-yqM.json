  "title": "Can we be friends with non muslims? Quran says not to take them as allies #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Um I'm having conf I'm having like confused like I thought that being friends with non-Muslims is halal. But in the chapter 5 in the Quran verse 51 it says believers do not take the Jews and the Christians for their allies. So now I'm getting confused. Is it halal or not to be friends with non-Muslims? There is a difference between being friends and taking them as allies. Taking them as allies means that you fight side to side with them even if you have to fight against Muslims. This is what is prohibited and might nullify a person's Islam when he takes them as allies and fight the Muslims and be willing to give his back to Islam just to please them disbelievers whether they're Jews or Christians. And this is prevailing unfortunately nowadays. We can see that this is a problem. Having them as friends in the sense that having them as acquaintances, seeing them at work, cheering them up, how are you doing? Good morning. Uh maybe grabbing a bite together at the at the lunch break, maybe serving them coffee or accepting their gift when they bring us a coffee. That's no problem. We coexist. We live together. But what is prohibited is to taking to take them as allies as confidants. I go and tell them about my secrets about my problems and I confined in them and I trust them. This is not permissible in Islam. Our allegiance, our trust, our confidence should be only placed in Muslims and those who deserve it from the Muslims, not any Tom, Dick or Harry."
