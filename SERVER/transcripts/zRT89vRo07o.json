  "title": "Get a prenup before marrying in the west #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "well before I continue in the west and I've been having lots of counseling sessions regarding this issue if you have to marry and you definitely if you're living in the states or in Canada or in Europe or elsewhere you have to marry so before you do this make a preop and make a contract that is legally binding that if divor were to take place none of the spouses has the right of the property or the wealth of the X because it really goes ugly in such cfir countries when two Muslims divorce and one of them doesn't fear Allah if he believes in Allah in the first place so he or she they go to the civil court and they demand half of the property or the wealth of their ex and this is totally Haram so many times women come and say no I'm divorced now I'm entitled for half of the house which is a million dollars or more and the husband says I worked 25 years to earn my hard-earned money through Halal means and I bought this house now she wants to take half of it she says yes this is my right I spent 25 years with him and this is totally Haram going to non-muslim courts and legislating to them and seeking arbitration or a verdict from them to consume your Muslim fellow wealth unlawfully a lot of the scholars take that person out of the fold of Islam for not following in the conduct for not following the Shar ruling rather giving his back to Shar to the Quran and to the Sunnah doesn't care about any of that of that and wanting the ruling of the disbelievers and the manmade laws to consume worldly filth so that he would be happy for couple of years and then he would find his torment awaiting for him in his grave and then hell awaits for him inshallah so before you get married just before things maybe get ugly just write a penob so that legally no one of you could trespass and violate Shar laws by demanding such thing and Allah Knows Best"
