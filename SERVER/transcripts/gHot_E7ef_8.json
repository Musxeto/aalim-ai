  "transcript": "she my question is uh so I work in a lot of like different buildings and the thing is I use my phone for the app and occasionally it messes up and gives me the wrong direction and usually it happens that like you know different buildings and there's not a Muslims working in the buildings that I'm working in and I'm wondering what should I do in those type of situations where I try my best I use more than one app for the app and sometimes it gives me the wrong angle like more than 45 degrees or sometimes completely wrong what should I do most likely you have to try your level best to try to allocate the direction in an area where there's no interference magnetic interference so even if you have to leave the building and go to the street in the open air to to detect the you should do this but if the diverent is slight a little bit to the right a little bit to the left this is Forgiven and the prayer is valid but if it is like something extreme something that that is like almost 90 degrees or or or so no so do your level best and Allah will not hold you accountable for the best of your ability and Allah Asel Knows Best"
