  "transcript": "so sheikh my question is if the imam mistakenly stands for the fifth record during the communication prayer and we say subhana wa but he doesn't sit back down what should the person playing behind him do jezebel so a scenario the imam is praying for raqqa prayers such as in the third rakah after the second prostration he says allahu akbar instead of standing for the fourth he sits for the third and everybody says subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah and he continues he's relentless he doesn't want to listen he thinks that i'm doing the right thing or the imam in the fourth rakah after the second prostration sajdah says allahu akbar instead of sitting for the teshahud the final to shahood he stands up for the fifth raka people say subhanallah subhan allah and he doesn't come down he thinks that i'm doing the right thing what to do in both cases the moom some scholars say has to wait until the imam finishes and rectifies and some say that no the imam has committed an act which is distorting the nature of the prayer so in the first scenario he has abandoned a whole pillar a whole unit raqqa and he's not listening to the people behind him what to do you guys stand up and continue your fourth rakah and do your should you do your shahad and offer conclude on your own each one on his own intend to depart and leave your imam in the second scenario when he stood up for the fifth rakah you guys remain sitting do your teshahood and offer your salam and leave the prayer or if you wish you can sit and wait until he finishes his fifth raka and does his to shahood and offer salam with him but i wouldn't do that personally i would just leave the prayer allah knows best"
