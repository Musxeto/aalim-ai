  "title": "The dressing of Prophet Part 2 Characteristics of Prophet Ash Shama'il Al Muhammadiyah assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "an Malik may Allah be pleased with him says that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam it seems that among the dearest to him sallallah alaih wasallam when wearing them clothes was the and this is a striped Garment of yate fabric that he used to wear now one of the dearest of clothes to him in a previous episode we said it was the so what is it first of all whenever a Hadith refers to something it doesn't mean that it excludes everything else the most beloved thing was this then we will find another Hadith saying the most beloved things were another thing so this means that in order to combine between the two that the most one of the most beloved things to the prophet was this and this sallallahu alhi wasallam secondly we can tell that the type of dress which is the shirt was beloved to the prophet Alam and here the type of fabric is what had these beautiful uh signs and colors Etc on it which the prophet uh used to wear brought to him from Yemen said that his father narrated that I saw the prophet wearing a red he saw the prophet wearing a red Garb as if I were looking at the sheen of his legs sufyan says I think it was a striped Garment of Yen fabric so again again the prophet was wearing a grab and this is a a Garb which is a suit it's made of two pieces and as we said it's not red purely because pure red is prohibited for men to wear but it is a mixture of red and some other colors but the dominating color would be red and he was saying that the leg of the Prophet uh uh were shining which also refers to the fact that the legs of men are are not and also refers to that the dress of the Prophet the lower Garment of the Prophet wasam was usually to the middle of his legs and this is something that many people would consider to be out rageous they would expect men to cover their entire feet entire legs that is even if below the ankles while women is normal for them to uncover their legs maybe part of their thighs and this shows you how the F of people has been reversed it when it comes to the lower garment the sunah for men is to wear their lower garment to the middle of the legs so people would make fun and say oh it's like a woman wearing a maxi dress yeah this is the way men should look the prophet said one of his companions that the place of the Garment is here and he hits four fingers underneath his knee and if if you don't want it then here and he adds another four fingers so eight fingers below the knee and then he said and there is no right for the Garment to exceed the ankles this is the way of the Prophet this is the Sunnah I know if I were to wear my trousers to the middle of the legs people would laugh at me and mock me and say oh looks like Charlie Chaplain but if we were abiding by the Sun no one would dare to laugh at you but unfortunately we have neglected a lot of the Sunnah now wearing it below that is not Haram yet if I were to see someone wearing it to this extent I shouldn't be looking down at him or making fun of him rather I should be envious that he's following the Sunnah where I am not then we have Ali Allah be pleased with him where he said that I never saw anyone among the people more handsome in a red GARP than the prophet of Allah when the hair of his head was touching close to his shoulders we've gone through the issue of the hair but again the issue of wearing red we've also talked about this Abu Ram may Allah be uh uh pleased with him saids I saw the prophet wearing two green garments and this again is not part of the Sunnah rather it's something that's permissible whether the prophet wears green whether he wears black whether he reads something that is red mixed with other colors or with stripes all of this is permissible there's no restriction on that so no one should jump and say that this is part of the Sunnah that's why I'm wearing it the Sunnah is displayed in the following Hadith where the Prophet says in what Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father narrates he said that the prophet of allaham said you should acquire white clothes so so that your living ones may wear them us when we are alive we should wear white and you can shroud your deceased in them ah when people die we shroud them in white why for they that is the white are among the best of your clothes so this is what the prophet sallai wasallam recommended not only that he also in the Hadith of samur may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said wear white for it is most we white for it is most pure and pleasant and you must shroud your deceased therein so this is a highly recommended thing what do Scholars say wear it because it's pure it's Pleasant in the sense that it doesn't carry dirt meaning if I wear white any small dirt would appear and people would rush to clean it also because it's the most visible color to carry any impurity so it is mostly washed more than any other uh uh clothes or garments and that is why it is purer and Allah Knows Best"
