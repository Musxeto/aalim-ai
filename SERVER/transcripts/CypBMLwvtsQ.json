  "title": "Can we say the prescribed dua of rain when it snows as well? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so he's asking about the dua which the prophet whenever it trains he would ask allah to make it beneficial a rain that does not destroy homes or flood areas can we do the same dua when it snows the answer is no rain is different than snow you may ask allah azza if the snow comes with hail or with wind that you ask allah from its goodness and what it was sent with and ask allah to prevent you or to give you refuge from its evil and what evil it was sent with but to ask allah to make it a beneficial rain when it is snow no this does not make any sense"
