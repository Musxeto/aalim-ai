assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this I think it's the 58th episode of Islamic Feb and we are about to conclude the things related to distribution of inheritance and we I think lastly stopped at the five kinds of errors that may take a share of one-half so if you recall those who inherit the heirs either inherit due to a prescribed specified shares allocated by the Quran the Sunnah and these are the 2/3 1/3 1/6 1/2 1/4 and 1/8 these are the six shares mentioned and some scholars when they talk about distribution of inheritance they find it easier to mention the share and who inherits through that share so when we come to half 1 / 2 who are those who inherit with the half the compiler the author says 5 kinds of heirs may take a share of one-half number 1 the husband and this is mentioned in the Quran whenever the wife dies the husband gets half providing and this is a condition that his deceased wife did not have any children so it doesn't matter whether he himself has children or not what counts is the deceased did she leave any children behind the answer is no automatically the husband gets half number 2 the deceased daughter whether a father dies or a mother dies leaving behind one daughter no other siblings for her so she automatically gets half but if there is a brother of hers in this case this is a different story number three the deceased sons daughter and this is providing there is no one else to block her and what do we win by blocking her see if the deceased had a daughter or a son this granddaughter may be blocked totally or may be reduced her share because of the presence of someone above her number for the deceased full brother and this is totally wrong and this is a mistake probably a typing mistake and all of you should change it and correct it number for the deceased full sister not full brother a brother does not inherit shares a brother inherits through virtues of kinship but a seed so this is a obviously a typo mistake it should read the deceased full sister so take out the brother and replace it with the deceased full sister when he has no siblings there is when she has no siblings to share with her and the deceased has neither offspring nor parents or grandparents I hope this is clear number 4 why am i talking as if I'm teaching people who something wrong at me but this is important you have to change it so again I speak slowly number 4 the deceased full sister when you have to change a pronoun from he to she when she has no siblings to share with instead of him put her and the deceased has neither offering or parents or grandparents okay number 5 the deceased half-sister born to his father when she has no siblings to inherit with her and the deceased has neither offspring nor parents or grandparents nor a full brother or a full sister etc number two so half we finished this number two quarter so who inherits a quarter of what the disease had left behind two kinds of heirs may take a share of a quarter one the husband to the wife end of story the husband in the beginning took a half because his wife did not have children but if she has and she died leaving behind a child or more then the share of the husband automatically is reduced into a quarter so this is the quarter we're talking about what about the wife the wife either gets a quarter or gets an eighth the condition if the deceased husband died leaving no children behind she gets a quarter if he had a child or more behind she gets one eight so here we are with the quarter a husband and a wife number three heirs who take a share of 1/8 and this applies only to the deceased wife or wives when the husband has offspring to inherit from him but here is a trick in Arabic if a woman has a co wife meaning that the husband is married to more than one wife the other wife is always referred to as Baba and Borla is derived from the word harm but royal blue blue and a bull harmful or or or harm as a noun messenia bull so why do we refer to her as something harmful well she's not something harmful except to the co wife how come because she deprives her co-wife from having her husband full-time now she has him half time and not only that the the funny thing is that when her husband dies both of them share one-eighth of the husband had children if she was a single wife of to her husband meaning that she had no co-wives she would have taken the full one-eighth but when the man dies leaving two wives this one gets one over sixteen which is half of the eight and this one gets one over sixteen imagine if he had three wives if he had four wives and this goes on and on on so the portion reserved for the wife which is 1/8 let's assume it's $100,000 when there are two wives each take 50 so she looks at her sister and says if she were not here I would have taken the 400 and if there are three of them or let's say four wives that each one takes even a lesser part of the hundred so she takes 25 25 25 and 25 this is why they call her Bangla because she shares with her co-wife half or more of the share had it patchy inherited a husband alone number four who inherits two-thirds so there are four kinds of heirs together take a share of two thirds these are the daughters the granddaughters the full sisters and the half sisters and these are all women so that the two two thirds are exclusive for women as the one-eighth is exclusive for the wife or wives so when does a daughter gets to third generally speaking a female whether she's a daughter or if there were no daughters sister or sisters or before that granddaughters etc if they're one they take oh she takes half if they are two or more they share two thirds so a man dies leaving behind a mother a daughter and two sisters how is this going to be distributed this is one problem write it down a man dies leaving behind a mother a daughter and two sisters remember when you talk about inheritance do not talk about the relationships to you or to your friend talk always about the relationship to the deceased so we get people say sure my father died leaving behind my mother this is wrong you should have said leaving behind a wife because when you talk about yourself you gotta mix things up and the chef would not give you a correct answer because when you say leaving behind a mother then I would think that you're referring to the deceased mother where she gets either 1/3 or 1/6 as we know while the your mother who's the deceased wife gets either 1/4 or 1/8 and because she's your mother definitely she's gonna get an 8 so you got things all mixed up and Haywired always mentioned the relationship to the deceased and not to you personally now a man died leaving a mother a daughter and two sisters this is done as follows the mother gets one-sixth due to the presence of an offspring the daughter gets half half yes because she's one and the two sisters get the rest due to the virtues of kinship Darcy and this is starship malray not bill rail and this is I know confusing but okay it's just for the fun of it we're mentioning it some people have a gift for it so they immediately understand it the vast majority of people would see the can we move to the following chapter so it's always good to investigate and to study these things so who gets two thirds 2.2 sisters two daughters two granddaughters two half sisters etc so the first one the two daughters okay sure what did you give us the example of a man dying leaving behind a mother a daughter and two sisters I was testing you because if you have half asleep like I am definitely not gonna understand it now reverse this and say a man dies leaving a mother two daughters and one sister in this case the mother gets one-sixth because of the presence of offspring the two daughters get two-thirds and the rest goes to the sister to the sister due to the virtue of kinship number two the sons daughters meaning the granddaughters of the Sun because the granddaughters of the daughter your daughter's children do not inherit you your daughter's children do not inherit you so when do the daughters of my son inherit when I died leaving no offspring that can't block them if I died leaving a daughter or his son they will not get anything they'll be blocked so let us give an example a man dies leaving a daughter three daughters of his son and an uncle the daughter gets half the uncle gets the rest and the three daughters of the son are blocked by their aunt who is the daughter of the deceased and so on and a full the deceased full sisters the same thing with the daughters if the deceased left no offspring at all and he only left to the two sisters then the sisters get two thirds and then the last third we look for any male relative from his kinship that could inherit so an uncle a cousin immediately they will get the last third and also if we have two or more half sisters of the deceased so he died leaving two half sisters who shared the same father with him they get 2/3 providing they disease does not have a brother or half a brother or a real full sister and this again would be easier if you were to read or go through a book that deals with inheritance and gives you problems to solve number five who inherits one-third two kinds of heirs inherit the share of one thirds one deceased mother to have a brother born to the deceased mother okay so the mother as stated before either gets one-sixth or gets one-third she gets one-third when there is no offspring and there are no siblings of the deceased but whenever that is a we're talking about which one was talking about ah I've dropped one did I yeah so we're talking about one-third this is number five two kinds of heirs and headed the share of one-third who are they the mother and the mother gets one-third when the deceased has no offspring and no group of siblings to inherit from him what do you mean by group because if he had one she still gets one-third if she has if the deceased had two brothers or two sisters then she is reduced from one third to one sixth so one-third the mother of the deceased gets it when there are no offsprings the deceased had no children at all and there are no siblings of the deceased as a group more than two and more but if one this is a different story the second type that gets one third is half-brothers born to the sees mother when the seas has neither offspring not parents or grandparents to inherit from him this or these are known as if what one Leone they are half-brothers from the mother side and they would get 1/3 if the deceased had no offspring because the offspring by default block the siblings and anyone else so whenever there is a male offspring it automatically blocks them all so there are no offspring nor parents the parents are there then the half siblings are blocked or grandparents to inherit from him 6 and this is the last who inherits and six one over six seven kinds of heirs take a share of the six number one the deceased father when the father has children so the father and the mother whenever the missus has a child a son or a daughter immediately the father and the mother get 1/6 as a specified share now the father may as we mentioned last time get in addition to the sixth the rest due to the virtue of kinship Darcy but this is a different issue we're talking about the fixed share who gets one six number one the father when there are offspring number two the mother when there are offspring number three a grandfather when the deceased has children but no father so if my father if I die leaving behind a father and his father my grandfather my paternal grandfather is blocked automatically by the presence and by the life of my own father but if I die leaving no father behind my father is already dead so my grandfather in this case inherits and he would inherit one-sixth if I have offsprings so he takes the position of my father and number four we have the deceased grandmother so the mud grandmother is exactly like the mother if the mother is dead then the grandmother takes her place so if I have offspring a child or more then my grand mother takes and my mother is dead my grandmother takes one-sixth number five the deceased sons daughter when he has no brother to inherit with her when she has no brother to inherit with her and when the deceased has no higher offspring other than an heir who is entitled to share of one-half this grand daughter takes a share of one-sixth only when there is another heir inheriting one-half though it's very easy when a man dies leaving behind a female meaning a daughter a sister etc we've just mentioned that she gets one-half if they are more than one there are two and more they share two thirds and this is mentioned the quran about daughters clear Yoshiko mafia lady whom the daiquiri miss to have the concern if I'm concerned for nothing if they were women above to fella who never lose her metallic well in cannot worry if she was only one for the harness she gets only half so this is crystal clear one gets half more than one they share two thirds if they were to 1/3 1/3 each if they were 3 we divide that on three shares the two thirds and then we get each one one etc now here the deceased sons daughter meaning if I were to die leaving behind one single daughter no other offspring and I have also my late son's daughter who's alive so I have my daughter and my son's daughter which is my granddaughter so by default my daughter gets half but because my granddaughter is there and the percentage of daughters still can incubate both of them they are considered to be my daughters and they should get 2/3 of my wealth but then if I give them two thirds of my wealth my daughter would be deprived from 1/2 to 1/3 so they said no no no no no her half remains and the two thirds for both of them will be granted so what's the difference between the two thirds and a half that this daughter has secured the answer is one-sixth if you add 1/6 to half you get two thirds so the daughter gets half which is the highest which is her legal right and the granddaughter gets one sixth so that we would complete the two thirds allocated for mato more than one daughter or once the circle one female inheriting and this is used a lot when distributing the inheritance so that we would compensate for someone who usually would inherit but it's blocked by someone so we compensated throughout this way according to the swindle number six the deceased half-sister born to his father when she has no brother to inherit with her but the deceased must have a full sister who takes a share of one-half the same thing the issue of full brother and sister being more privileged than half a brother or half a sister is clear in Islam a man dies leaving behind one full brother and five half sisters and ten half-brothers this single full brother takes all and he blocks everyone else because those were not his full brothers and sisters they were half so assuming a man dies leaving one full sister and another sister from his father's site the all three of them share the same family name the same father but one is full father and mother and the other one is only from his or from her father's side so in this case by default the full system gets half what about the half sister we do the same thing we did in the previous issue she gets 1/6 so that the total would be 2/3 and finally number 7 the deceased half brother or half sister born to his mother when a a deceased has no offspring to inherit him be the deceased has no male ancestors and see there is only one half brother or one half sister ok can you explain sure a brother or a sister from your mother's side so you both don't share the same father's name or the family name your mother married a man or 2 or 3 and had children from all so you have siblings from your mother side now if a person dies leaving a brother or a sister from his mother side a single brother or a single system not more from his mother side he or she will get 1/6 providing these three conditions number one that the deceased has no offspring no boys no girls okay the deceased died leaving no boys no girls having a wife this doesn't count number two the deceased has no male assistants so no father no grandfather no great-great grandfather and number three there is only one half-brother meaning that he's single but if they were to this is a different story if there were five if you attend see the half brother from the mother side either gets one sixth or he shares with his other half brothers from the mother side siblings one third and this is what people this is what we mentioned a little bit earlier in number five who inherits one-third we said half brothers born to this deceased mother etc so I know this is a little bit confusing but it is something that we have to understand in order to okay let me get this thing up and running I hate this you do this and you think that okay you have to learn this because as I said this is one of the great sciences of Islam that a lot of the Muslims are not aware of you're not gonna be expert by getting through this I'm not an expert but definitely you would have so much knowledge if you've understood and listened carefully to what we had studied in the past couple of weeks with today's class definitely you would have a huge amount of information more than 95% of the Muslim population when it comes to inheritance this is without any doubt so we move on to what is known as a tower Schreiber and I hope we can finish this because we've gone for so long doing this I don't know if we're gonna have time to take questions or not does it means the presence of heirs known as the asaba who inherit but have no predetermined shares if there is only one of them and no heirs with assigned shares that single air takes all of the property if the single asaba air is joined by heirs who have assigned shares he takes what remains after other heirs take their assigned shares the profit as a subset give the assigned shares to the heirs entitled to them and what remains goes to the closest male so this is known as a Sabah and the asaba is divided into three types one as if you see as follows there are three types of a Sabah and a Sabah to be Neffs the person himself is Asafa to a la cerva tubal a three a la Sabah to malray number one the person himself is a Sabah such as the father such as the Sun such as the grandfather if the father is not there the grandson if the Sun is not there the brother half a brother the cousin the uncle have whether full or half etc all of these are considered asaba by themselves meaning that if a person dies leaving behind a father and two daughters so the daughters get to third and that is goes immediately to the father if a man dies leaving a father only no one else he's not married he doesn't have children the father takes everything if a man dies leaving a son 10 unten brothers and five sisters the son takes it all this is a Saba bill Neffs this is themselves by their own there are they are considered to be a Saba then we have an a Saba to build a ear so they themselves or a person becomes a sober because of the presence of another one so if we have a daughter a daughter of a son a sister who is a full sister and have a sister so this is what they can be a Sabah and more depending with whom they are with the third one is the person becomes a Sabah when joined with another and this is called the LA Sabah will reign and this is specifically for the sisters with the daughters when they don't have a another male son with them and we've mentioned this so when is it that a sister inherits with someone but when joined with other a man dies leaving a daughter and a sister so the daughter gets half the sister gets the remaining of the two-thirds or she gets the rest because of the osawa sure she gets her sixth completing two-thirds the rest where does it go it goes to this sister and we always say that the full sisters give a priority over half sisters so these are the types of Asafa Hobbiton be nerfs Hobbiton bill rail Hobbiton MA and higher again this is a little bit confusing but we do need a number of problems to solve it if there or if this was a designated course in distribution of inheritance then we have to go through each and every segment and part of it giving six or seven problems so that you work your mind over it and you know it and understand it the final part with us is called exclusion and if you use the word blocking that would also be fine exclusion in Arabic is called or as the the terminology is terminology used for it is and Hajj book and this refers to the prevention of an air from taking all or part of his or her share because of the presence of another who has a stronger claim so there are different types of Hajj there are there is husband bill was my husband wishes what is this Hajj by description meaning that it doesn't matter what relationship a person to the deceased what matters is the description that this person has and we had gone through this in the very beginning of talking about inheritance distribution when we said that there are three reasons that would block an individual from inheriting reason number one slavery so this is exclusion or blocking by means of description he is described as a slave he cannot inherit and we've explained this earlier and saying by saying that this person when he inherits whatever he possesses belongs to his master so what's the point no he's blocked from inheriting number two murder if a murderer kills someone then he's blocked automatically so when we say blocked automatically this means we treat him as if he did not exist give an example a man was killed he left behind a wife a murdering son and an uncle meaning that paternal uncle we know that maternal uncle do not inherit at all so now we have these three individuals a wife and we know that the wife inherits what or what a wife inherits a quarter if the deceased had no son and inherits one-eighth if the deceased has an offspring a son or a daughter so how much do we give the wife if you said eight the answer is wrong because the son is the murderer and due to his crime he's treated as if he does not exist and he would inherit nothing so his mother now that is the wife of the deceased he's treated as a widow of a man who had no children so she gets a quarter and the rest which is the three quarters goes directly to the uncle who inherits through virtue of kinship and the third type that blocks by description or excludes inheritance through description is difference of religion a man dies leaving a non-muslim mother a nun Muslim wife and a far paternal cousin everything goes to the paternal cousin everything and man if you have a cousin like this you got it made because then all of a sudden they tell you you're far cousin who migrated to Argentina 50 years ago and happened to be a multi-billionaire died leaving a wife no children and his Christian mother and his wife is also Christian and you don't you are the only heir that is good so these are the three excluded blocked through description now there is another type of exclusion which is by the person himself so there's a person that blocks me from inheriting and that these types of exclusion are divided the two types husband has warhead man totally depriving a person from inheriting and Hajj book knocks on another one is reduction of his share so for example there are six types of people of Aires that can never be deprived from inheriting due to someone else blocking them the parents always inherit the spouses always inherent man and wife and the children boy and girl always in health nobody blocks them nobody blocks them so that they don't get a penny no of course unless they were of a different religion or they were murderers or they were slaves and as for an example of how can a person block another person so let's assume a man dies leaving a son or two and five grandsons now if the man died leaving no sons at all his five grandsons would inherit everything true yes but due to the fact that he left one son or more behind this son would automatically block his grandsons they would not get anything so this is called rajma Hermann they're blocked by that individual that son blocked them from inheriting had he not been there they would have inherited as for husband oxen on the reduction and this is found everywhere so a man dies leaving behind a mother a father and an uncle or a brother the mother gets 1/3 because there are no offsprings the father gets 1/3 because of there are no offsprings and the rest due to the virtues of kinship is asaba his uncle or his brother the deceased uncle or deceased brother gets nothing but if a man dies leaving a mother and a father and a son immediately it is Hogeboom knocks on the mother gets to set up 1/3 1/6 and the father gets instead of 1/3 1/6 and the rest the father does not get anything of it it all goes to the Sun because this is Hajj book knocks on and allah azzawajal knows best and this brings us to the end of today's class about inheritance we should look about some of the questions that we have so faithful sense if I pray Witcher 3 rokkes then after completion of my turrican I stand up immediately without sitting for tisha hood when I stand up for the third raka can I do roughly a day before starting certain Fatiha now what is face still talking about Faisal is referring to the position of raising the hands in salat we've mentioned this before that there are two positions that happen only once and there are two other positions that have happened every single record so for every single record every time you go for bowing Allah Akbar and you rise from block or semi a la una man having the view raise your hands every single Agra that's easy as for the times that happen only once in the beginning of your salat inauguration saw two competitively from Allah a kebab the first one this happens only once because you do it only ones in the beginning the fourth incident or time when you raise your hands is if you print hirokazu for a cos when you rising from this first - a hood so fetcher there is no first shot it's only to shout it is concludes by Salam but in motherland after the first shot you rise up for the third after Asia after the first shall help you rise to complete - third and fourth rekha here the Sun that is after doing your to shout a shadow line in Allah Allah sure you can wash I don't know Hammond and I will do well so you stand up for the third Rock I say Allah Akbar so now faithful is saying if I pray with you three rokkes but it's not like motherland because I'm not sitting in the first shot which I cannot sit in the first shot like Maghreb I stand up immediately for the third so do I raise my hands answer is no you do not raise your hands because you're not standing up from a Tasha hood so it is treated like the first record like the third raka etc the second question is what happens to the topic pregnancy of six weeks to eight weeks at the time the ultrasound detects fit fatal or fetal heartbeat so my question is well the baby go to Jenna of six to eight weeks miscarriage the answer is no unfortunately because the child or the fetus is not a human being yet though there is heartbeat but the soul has not been breathed and yet the soul is breathed when the fetus is a hundred and twenty days old which means that it is almost 16 or 17 weeks old for months before that this is not a human being yet and the third question of today my wife has kids and grandkids that's not from me my question is who are they to me or what who are they to me in relationships nothing there your step sons and step grandsons they have no rights to you and you have no rights towards them they're not you relay relations in the not your kinships they are not your relatives they related to your wife only and under a man says can you list out in order or or all the Willys the guardians of a woman and what is the difference of opinion may be among scholars that is the son of a woman being a 1e or not the scholars such as Venus a mean and others may Allah have mercy on them they say that guardianship are in five the fathers the truth the sons the brothers the uncles then the allegiance so when they say this the first priority of a woman's guardian is to her father and if he's not available than his father that is the grandfather and if not then his father so this is how it works and having said that if the father is there and his father is also there the grandfather cannot be the guardian was the father himself is at present unless the father authorizes it and this happens in some families so whenever someone proposes out of respect the father says to his father father your granddaughter is to be Wed tonight I'd like you to be her guardian and to give the proposal and to approve of the marriage no problem but he cannot override his own son he says no no no my son doesn't know anything I'm the one who's going to give her to that person no my son disapproves the marriage is invalid so the first thing is the parents even if they go upwards if all the parents are dead the father the grandfather the the woman doesn't have any male ancestors in this case we moved to number two the sons even if they go down the son the grandson etc is the son given more authority than the brothers then his uncle yes yes yes but his uncle is fifty years or six years of age and the woman's son is only 16 or 15 years of age still he is her guardian because this was done by the Prophet Elisha sternum when he proposed to own Salama and when she accepted he asked her son Rama to a Minerva Salama to be her guardian and to give her to him in manage so yes his son has more authority than a sibling and a grandson has more authority than a sibling if she has no sons at all then it is her brother's and the full brother gives priority over half a brother if she has four brothers which one would be her guardian is it necessary to be the eldest no any one of them can be her guardian and specifically if he is the wisest and the best of them in choice then we have if no brothers at all we have the uncles the paternal uncles if there are not a single paternal uncle available then the paternal cousins and the further the further it goes from her paternal side and I think we will take this last question abdel hakim says please about what to recite after surat al fatiha in salah can someone have it in mind that i'm going to read this surah or what just come to mind at that time people think that before I begin salat I have to decide what I'm going to read in the first Locker and what am I going to read in the second drug a meaning I'm going to pray mother it so before actually beginning my salat I have to say okay in the first record I'm going to read Surat al a little bit further in the second record I'm going to read cool out of business so then I start my prayer and for one reason or the other I forgot what I had decided people are confused sitting I have to perform through the cell no I have to repeat my prayer and although this is bogus all of this is not true whether you recite a predetermined surah or you just simply do like all of us do cell or what work well do very malleable lean okay what should I recite Lillehammer first emirati of lovely when to do mafia pushing more tofu I just picked it up no problem you don't have to decide and even if you decided you can change that anytime you like and Alonzo adjourn knows best so this is all the time we have until we meet next let's assume Thursday I leave you fear Manila what Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
