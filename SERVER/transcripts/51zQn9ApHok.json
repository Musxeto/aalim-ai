  "transcript": "oh we're still studying the chapter that deals with times of prayer and the hadith we have has the number 134 hadith narrated by rafael khadija and brother noor will read it for us they're rendered by over the morning prayer at down for it is greater for your reward offer the morning prayer at dawn for it's greater for your rewards one would say okay then when do you want us to offer morning prayer it's definitely offered that dawn scholars say this hadith is not understood as some people have translated it but it translates literally to us which means that extend your fajr prayer until it's morning until light has come so it's not what the translation has been translated to offer the morning prayer at dawn because we can only offer morning prayer at dawn this is the time so it has no meaning but the actual meaning is prolong your fajr prayer until it's light which means that when you pray at dawn don't pray for five or ten minutes no extend your prayer until it's like half an hour and this is the sunnah he used to pray between 60 to 100 verses of the quran in fajr prayer and this is the sunnah of the prophet to begin fajr early when it's dark and to end prayer when it's light and in one incident abu bakr may allah be pleased with him pray that fajr and it was just before sunrise he finished he finished praying just before sunrise and the companions his father and his companion said abu bakr what was this you almost extended your prayer until it was sunrise so he said that if the sun rose it wouldn't have found us sleepy it would have found us praying it would have found us praying so this is a positive thing it's not a negative thing but the essential thing is when to to begin your prayer so if you be you start your prayer at the very beginning and you extend it until it's daytime so there's no problem with that and this is the doing of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam now the four the the four schools of thought al-imam malik think that it is the best to pray it early in the morning just after dawn abu hanifa prefers that it is delayed and the majority's opinion is the correct verdict in accordance to the hadith of the prophet the following hadith narrated the prophet saw allah said he who prays eraka of the fajr prayer before the sun rises has offered the dawn prayer in its time and he who prays eraka of the astral prayer before the sun sets has offered the afternoon prayer okay there's another reported yeah another version reported by muslim he said the same above hadith narrated by aisha who narrated instead of prayer unit and then he muslim said implies okay now this hadith tells us that if a person succeeds in praying one rakah or as in the version of ayesha one sajdah before sunset of course what is the prayer before sunset noor the prayer before sunset uh it's praying tsunami no zaki answer okay so watch out so the hadith tells us that if you delay asa prayer for one reason or the other for example if you sleep over it or if you were engaged or if you had something that was so urgent and if you forgot and you just remembered before sunset and you managed to pray one rakah so the prophet says that you have succeeded in praying asar in its time it the time did not go though you finished the other three after the sun has set but the you're still the asar was done on time likewise fajr prayer if you were engaged or delayed the prayer for one reason or the other and you managed to pray one rakah before the sun rises this also means that you have correctly prayed fajr before the time ran out now of course this doesn't mean it's okay but it tells us when it is not possible to be prayed afterwards why i'll tell you why allah says that prayer has been timed it was timed on us which means that we should pray on time because if we do not then our prayer is invalid meaning if i am sitting home watching a football match and the football match runs from asar till after maghrib and my wife says come and pray asar and i say sh i'm watching the match and i know i know that the team will lose because this is inevitable they will lose whenever i support someone and i'm not okay with allah we will all lose so i insist on watching this game and i watched the game and it's ten minutes before sunset the game goes on it's two minutes before sunset the game goes on it's sunset then i realize and for allah i have made a mistake let me go and pray can i pray asar no i cannot why can't i make allah no you cannot why because you've skipped the time the prophet salallahu says whoever sleeps of a prayer over a prayer or forgets it then he must pray it as soon as he remembers there is no way else for him to compensate for it other than this so it is a must for you if you forget or you sleep but if you deliberately abandon salah until the following salah comes you may not pray it even if you pray 10 times it will not suffice and it's gone uh abu malik has a question well my question he just answered it well i was gonna ask if you know anybody that leaves a prayer late at laziness from nativeness they cannot no they cannot come back for that prayer no they cannot if they deliberately abandon prayer they cannot pray it again and zeki has a question when we can call the prayer you cannot it's gone there is kodo in prayer is only when you sleep or you forget sometimes you're engaged in work you know you're typing and doing and all of a sudden whoa it's an hour after prayer time i i didn't realize it and allah knows that you're saying the truth it happens i i tell you the best example that happens all the time with those who are used to praying in masjid if you have this sunnah in you and you pray all the five prayers and masjid then you're programmed to pray only and masjid but for example if you go to the hospital and you're stuck you know the doctor is operating on you or doing something and you have to be there and it's my rip time oh okay i'll i'll try to wrap up the doctor says couple of minutes more and it finishes in half an hour you leave the the the hospital and you go back home and you go in and you you know relieve yourself change and sit down waiting for isha prayer the aisha prayer calls and you go to prayers at nine ten o'clock p.m said whoa i didn't pray maghrib i completely forgot why because you didn't pray it in the masjid you completely forgot about it so now you can pray it because you forgot sincerely but if you leave it intentionally it's not acceptable i'll give you another example though it's not our subject yet it's a little bit related to it a person stands on mount arafat on which date mustafa which date date which eighth of hedja tenth of hedger tenth of a hedgehog you guys i should have a scholarship and i'll send you to makkah for pilgrimage on the account of uh whoever you wish but not me definitely on the ninth line the day of arafah the day of arafah is on the ninth of hijab tenth is eight eight is the day of teruyah okay well it happens to the best of us let's assume that someone comes to arafah on the ninth and said whoa all these people it's crowded i can't find any place to park my car tell you what i'll come a couple of days later he comes a couple of days later there's no one in sight it's about now now i can stay for the whole day in arafah and then go to minna and is this acceptable no because it's limited with the time allah has put a time frame begins here and it ends here so if you come afterwards goodbye it doesn't count prayer is like that if you don't pray within the time frame that was set by allah then your prayer is invalid well i'll offer more sun i'll do it's invalid okay yes i'll do it i'll just do it it's not accepted don't do it you don't have to do it and this is the verdict or or the choice of ibm may allah have mercy on his soul and the also the verdict of sheikh bin baz and mean they all have stated on this controversial issue and that is why i know that you have a lot of questions i'll try to go through them as quick as possible we have 60 seconds left go ahead all right all right right now somebody not you know he left the prayer laziness on purpose what you know what does he do to make up for that prayer if he skips prayer out of laziness this is a major sin it's one prayer he just left mahdi prayer he didn't pray until asia prayer was called and then he's sorry what does he do he repents to allah asks allah for forgiveness and prays voluntary prayer as much as possible to compensate but still he has committed a major uh sin i think you got 20 seconds a surgeon is performing an operation and he cannot leave the operation and he it starts like before though and ends after us what does he do well i'm afraid that we have to break uh i'll answer your question inshallah right after the break so stay tuned back to the prophet join sheikh ahmad in the program back to the prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the holy quran the muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few muslims had to leave arabia and migrate to africa to live among kitab christian people who followed the gospel of christ before the break brother fadi had a question can you repeat your question again please if a surgeon is performing an operation and for instance this operation is a lengthy operation taking up to eight or ten hours and he if the the time of salah comes in and he cannot perform it because he cannot leave the operation because there's a risk for the patient's life so what does he do i believe that this is a hypothetical question because usually in such long operations you would have three or four surgeons next to you operating with you assisting you to be humorous change your profession but then this wouldn't pay because i know doctors charge a lot of uh of cash yet to answer a question allah says that fear allah possible as you can so in this case if a surgeon is unable to leave the the operating theater because he's the only one operating and there's a risk that a muslim or a human being his life is in jeopardy then this is an excuse for him to continue but as i said i believe that usually there are three or four other surgeons that would take care it's exactly like i tell you what it's hypothetical now during the eight or ten hours of surgery what happens if the guy has to answer the call of nature and he has really to go and answer the call of nature he had bad chinese food the day before and his stomach is you know making noises and sounds and definitely he's going to leave the operating theater and then go and answer the call of nature so it's the same thing prayer does not take more than four to five minutes of your time it refreshes your mind and concentration makes you go back better than the way you left again another question no but usually there's a professor he's in charge of the operation he has a first second and third up to fourth assistant he's the one who if he if there's a call of nature for him then he takes a break but for instance the fourth assistant doesn't have the right to choose so and he doesn't actually sometimes sometimes and it's sad but sometimes they don't pray not all surgeons pray so if i'm for instance the fourth assistant assistant then assistant then he does not allow us to like to leave unless the surgery is finished believe me brother whenever there's a will there's a way you can always talk to the professor you can always talk to the physician to the surgeons whenever there's a will there's a way and if it's a it's a must you're going to leave everything and go so prayer does not cost much time all what you have to do is alternate tell them that this guy takes my place for three four four minutes and i'm back now if if things are as bad as you say and there is no way you can leave then there is a possibility that you join the hurt with a answer or delay and you can join for raqqa and for raqqa this is a permission and if you know uh worst thing happens and you cannot and it's a matter of life and death islam tells you you have to continue working and this is a one shot every a blue moon it's not everyday event that takes place because if it's an everyday event then you should change your profession seriously but it happens once every six to eight months maybe because of the timing and off uh the situation uh you are talking about coming back to the hadith before us this is a issue of a difference between scholars now to be able to pray the prayer on time do i have to only make the bowing the record or do i have to finish the whole raqqa which is consisting of bowing and two prostrations and then standing up because when we here aisha says sajdah this means the whole thing and raqqa also can imply or mean only the bowing it's not the full fledged so what's the most authentic uh of all the most authentic of all that jummah prayer congregation fajr and asir all are caught all are uh considered to be made by catching one which is the bound position which means that if i go to the mosque in friday how many rakahs do we have in fredericton pardon me how many rakahs do we have on friday prayer two two so if i go to the mosque and the imam is bowing in the second rakah if i say allahu akbar and i bow with him this is considered to me as catching one rakha which means after he finishes prayer i can pray one other raqqa and my prayer is considered to be jummah friday but if he raises his head and says i could not catch him and i joined the prayer after he raised his head then there's no friday for me i have to pray for raqqa as lord prayer abu malik sorry i heard some people i'm not sure if this is true or not they said that if you don't catch the fatiha they didn't catch the raqqa no this is not true at all because this the prophet allah said that clearly whoever catches he catches the whole prayer so if you and the hadith of abu bakr also states that when he came to the masjid and they were all in the bowing position in the raku position so as soon as he entered the masjid and saw them bowing he said allahu akbar and walked while bowing until he reached the line and joined the congregation so the prophet prophet as islam continued the prayer and after he finished he said who did that and the prophet had the ability to see what's behind him and this is something miraculous only for the prophet allah when he used to make the the lines and roses say that keep straight lines because i see you from behind i have the ability of course he doesn't have any cameras and he doesn't have any eyes but allah azza show those praying behind him to him as allah would show him things that we cannot see not that he is you know a six million dollar man or whatever no no he the prophet allah is can see what allah shows him so after prayer has ended he asked the prophet salam who did this so abu bakr said i did it and i intended well because i couldn't bear walking while you were bowing how could i stand straight well you are we're in the bombing position so the prophet says may allah increase your carefulness for prayer and do not repeat that which meant that the raqqa if it was not acceptable because he did not recite the fat the prophet would would have told him repeat it again because it's void and this is one of the evidence that scholars use to say that fatiha is not a must for those praying behind imam is an issue of dispute we will come to it inshaallah later on so uh now we understand that if we catch if we uh joined the imam in raqqa this counts as one if we join the imam in the rakuwa position in the bowing position this counts as wat zaki catch this which entitles us to uh continue the prayer with the imam and it's accepted as a congregation prayer the following hadith number 136 narrated by abu sayyid may allah be pleased with him i heard allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam saying no salat meaning prayer is to be offered after the morning prayer until the sun rises or after the afternoon prayer until the sun sets in another virgin of muslim there is no salat meaning prayer after the french meaning morning morning meaning more morning prayer may allah please with him narrated there are three times at which allah's messenger used to forbid us to pray or bury our dead when the sun begins to rise till it's fully up when the sun is at its height at midday till it passes the meridian and when the sun draws near to setting till it sets okay now this hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi tells us about the times that we should not pray in let us get things straight up we should not pray voluntary prayer but obligatory prayer there are no times for you not to pray them so get this straight i get people saying that oops i forgot to pray lord and it's four o'clock or five o'clock in the afternoon this is a time where we denied to pray so i have to wait until it's sunset is this acceptable you may pray the five obligatory prayer any time of the day or night there are no restrictions to that of course providing that you did not leave them because of laziness yeah you left them because of forgetfulness or of sleep so this is the first uh part or issue that we should always uh pay attention to fadi and also if we prefer performing a homura and there's two or three supposed to do after to off if they come in the forbidden time we're also supposed to prepare them right well this is what we are supposed to uh go through after a while and the same hadith is mentioned here but what i'm talking about there are certain times during the day when it's forbidden for us to pray this rhymes there are certain times in the day when it's for forbidden for us to pray and here in the first hadith of abu sayyaf it's mentioned two times and the hadith of there are three times so all in all there are five times in the day two times that are general and white and three times that are specific and short so the white times are right after us or prayer until the sun sets the second one is right after fajr prayer until the sun rises uh a little bit which is about 10 minutes after sun rise to 15 minutes so these are two times they are general they are about three four hours uh long maybe less a little bit less the three times mentioned in america's hadith are very specific that is when the sun starts to disappear or when the sun starts to rise so this is a span of five to ten minutes and the last time or the fifth time that is when the sun is exactly in the center of the sky when things don't have any shadow at all this is the time that it is completely forbidden for us to pray five times we need more time to explain this unfortunately this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi ah"
