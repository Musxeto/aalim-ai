  "transcript": "is hack from india scholars say that who prays and fasts and does the whole nine yards but does not give da'wah will go to hell don't listen to these scholars well i don't know where you're getting these scholars hell is their own backyard oh simon says go to hell simon says go to paradise it's not up to you giving dawah is one of the forudal kifaya communal obligation if some people do it then the rest of the ummah are exempted from it and even if you see something that needs to have dawa given and you don't do it you're sinful who said that you will go to hell it depends on so many conditions and reasons and obstacles to be removed so definitely these scholars you're learning from they have many question marks with such statements either you are misunderstanding them or they are totally off uh the straight path and they are saying things without knowledge"
