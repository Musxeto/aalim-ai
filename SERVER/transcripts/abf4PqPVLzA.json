  "title": "Is it permissible to eat meat of a stunned animal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "cd from germany says stunned meat what's the ruling on that stun stunning animals before slaughtering it is highly recommended by the disbelievers the kuffar and they think they think that this is more merciful which is totally bogus but they're kuffar they're disbelievers they don't believe in the oneness of allah how would you expect him to believe in other than that however to us muslims it is prohibited to eat what is not slaughtered so we cannot eat a sheep or a cow that was not slaughtered islamically and properly now stunning this animal either would sedate it would make it drowsy so that we can easily slaughter it without it fighting back or stunning it would electrocute it and kill it if it's the latter it's totally prohibited in haram and you cannot eat that if it's stunned just to make it weaker and controllable and then we slaughter it while it's still living while still alive but stunned in this case it is halal though it's not recommended because this is a form of torturing the animal before actually slaughtering slaughtering it is the most merciful act you can do for that animal but these people don't care so if we don't know sheikh well if you don't know to be safe you have to investigate because at the end of the day it's not a necessity and unfortunately i've heard that some european countries today only issued a law that mandates stunning before slaughtering if the stunning the the electric shock kills the animal then it becomes totally haram and the muslims there must object much must take all legal actions to fight this unfair resolution and this is one step in many many steps that would be enforced upon them to change their religion beginning with niqab beginning with their food beginning with sexual uh orientation and education for their children so many things the end result is you have to be in the same melting pot you have to dispose of your islam and of your religion if you want to stay here and this is actually waging war against your religion so you have to be civil you have to be diplomatic but take all legal actions possible to counter this and as i usually advise if you can get the heck out of here and go back to a muslim country where you can live as a muslim"
