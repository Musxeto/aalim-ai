  "transcript": "a brother says does Islam believe in bad omens and what are the bad omens in the month of safar believing in bad omens and especially in the month of safar was the doing and the akkada of the disbelievers the idol worshippers and when the Prophet came on in salat wa salam he said that there is no belief in the bad omens of safar and there is no ham whether I do well a tiara the the concept of bad omens is totally prohibited in Islam and this is why the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said in an authentic hadith narrated by Abdullah bin miss road may Allah be pleased with him he who he said that Ali Susanna aplia ought to shirk that believing in bad omens is part of shirk of the lamas road commencing says and none of us is saved from this but Allah takes it away through to a cool meaning that as human beings we can't help ourselves from having this feeling but Allah Azza WA JAL hears us from it through tower code and the Prophet said al-islam another hadith and the hadith that he is not from among us who believes in bad omens and believing in bad omens means that you do not trust Allah and you think negative of Allah and you think that these things have an impact on your destiny thinking that they have impact on your destiny on and on your fate is shirk because only Allah can control this so if I'm going to an interview and I see a dead cat black or white there is no racists here in front of me and I said whoops I'm going back home I'm not going ahead with this interview because this was a bad omen this is shirk this has no impact on your life if I'm going to propose to a woman and then get an accident have an accident car accident and I say this means that Allah doesn't want me to get married to that woman this is belief in bad omens and this is not part of Islam so yes there are no bad omens in Islam we believe in Good Omens because Good Omens means that you trust Allah and you are thinking highly and positively of of Allah so whatever you see as Good Omens you see Allah so jealous sha Allah will make things facilitated I'll get things moving on and it's going to be to the best insha'Allah this is believing in good omens in the treaty of hudaibiya when Salib nama or that is so high even anger may Allah be pleased with him came to negotiate he was from among the idol worshipers when they told him so hey Lebanon is coming to negotiate the terms of the treaty with you the Prophet heard the name of Suhail which is stemmed from ease so the Prophet said say Allah unbroken alhamdulillah by his name he thought of it as a good omen that things will be facilitated to the best inshallah so believing in Good Omens is part of Islam believing in bad omens is not"
