  "transcript": "foreign oh now the treaty or the truth of how debia is materializing the negotiator from the politicide is suheilib and he's the one when the prophet sallam saw him coming said that things will go smooth and easy the reason of that is his name is suhail and in arabic it's a normal practice to make from names things that are lesser from the same name for example you have the name of umar the smaller form of umar is and also you have the name of sahil the lesser lesser name of that would be suhail sahil means easy so the prophet saws when he saw him he told them that your your things are easy now because of his name so when they sat down to the table they came to agree on four items on that treaty the first one would be that muhammad sallallahu asallam and his companions would go back to madinah this year they will not be admitted they will not be allowed to perform umrah this year so they have they have to go and they are allowed to come the following year but only to come with their swords no other arms and they will be allowed to enter mecca and stay in mecca for only three days after that they have to leave the second item was that there should be a truce established between the muslims and the people of quraish for a period of 10 years during which no one will attack the other and no one will attack the commercial caravans of the other of course this was in the favor of the polytheists because the most muslims had no commercial caravans the third item was that having these two parties the muslims and the people of quraish any tribe that would wish to enter in alliance with one of these two parties would be considered part of it in the sense that if anyone attacks such a tribe that already had established an alliance with one of the parties this attack on that tribe would be considered an attack on the party they had their alliance with and immediately after this was established the tribe of huzzah went to the alliance of the muslims and the tribe of bani bakr went to the alliance of quraysh so they because since the beginning of time they had their feuds and fights among them tribe of huzzah and so now it was clear that they had to go on separate ends the fourth and last item was that whomever comes to the muslims camp from quraish without the permission of his guardian his father then by by default the muslims must return him back so if someone accepted islam from quraish and went to the camp of the muslims but without the permission of the people of quraish any man who comes to the prophet sallam and his companions he they must return him back to the people of quraish but if someone from the muslims rejected islam and went to the people of quraish quraish may keep him and they are not forced to send him back to the muslims now this was really strange strange and strong because it was clear injustice to the sides of the muslims but the prophet sallam agreed to all these items and signed a treaty and a truce with sahaja yoga the muslims were not very easy with this as they were discussing this treaty before signing a man came in his chains and shackles he escaped the camp of the people of quraish and threw himself in front of the prophet salallahu sallam and said prophet of allah rescue me from the polytheists who are torturing me to reject islam and that man was abu jandal the son of suhailim namr so the prophet was negotiating with someone and this someone's son is coming to accept islam and seeking refuge with the muslims so the prophet as he was talking to suhail suhail looked at the prophet and said this is the first one you reject and you send back to quraish so the prophet sallam said we didn't sign the treaty yet we're just negotiating so suhail was frustrated and said then we have nothing to agree upon that would have jeopardized the whole truth so the prophet sallam said to sahil well let him go for me he said no way i would not accept him this is the first one that you return to quraysh so the prophet had to accept to get the truth implemented and abu jahnel started crying muslims whom are you going to leave me for they are going to torture me until i reject islam come on give me help and the prophet sallam would say be patient abu jandal allah the almighty will make a way for you out of this crisis and out of this calamity and they pulled him to the mushrikeen's camp to the people of christ's camp walked next to abu jandal with his sword hanging from his waist just an arm reach from abu jandal abu agenda could have taken the sword from ahmed umar's waist and this is what umar intended he went and talked with jandal walking side by side saying abu jandar you know these polytheists are like dogs killing them is like killing a dog it's okay and he's encouraging him to take the sword and chop his father's head off and then they're even but abu zhandel of course would not do something like that and umar regretted that he was not that strong he says that i wished he took the sword but he didn't now alongside the agreement there was nothing mentioning women so came in one or more companions of the prophet female companions who fled their people among them was and other companions women came to the prophet sallam to migrate to medina so their parents their husbands called them back and told the prophet that this is what we have agreed upon so the prophet told them no we agreed that any man that comes to you comes to us we send him back to you but we did not talk about women and there was a verse from the quran that was revealed to the prophet alaihis on that occasion where allah instructs the believers that whenever women come migrating to you you have to examining them you have to examine them how would you examine women accepting islam and coming in in migration to you by asking asking them what brings you if they say well i had to leave my husband because i don't like him or i didn't want to pay him his dowry back or i threatened him so many times this means that they're not sincere but if they accept islam they say the testimony and they show their sincerity that they migrated only for the sake of allah then you have to accept them if you know that they're believers you keep them do not return them back to the disbelievers this verse is crystal clear that they are not to be returned back to the disbelievers and before this verse was revealed it was normal that a muslim woman would marry apologist and it was also normal that a muslim man would have two wives or three wives or whatever of the politics of the disbelievers but once this verse was revealed it was forbidden for muslims to keep their non-muslims wives and was forbidden for muslims to return the muslim women to their disbelieving husbands and the verse was was there and things went smooth to an extent and why do we say to an extent i think shaykh the whole agreement in the side of quraish this is exactly what the muslims felt they felt that this was unfair why do we agree on something that was not fair to the muslims the first signs of being unpleased with this agreement was ali may allah be pleased with him refusing to erase the messenger of allah he's rejecting the instruction of the prophet not because he's in defiance or he is dis obeying the prophet salallahu but he cannot digest the fact that he would raise the name of the prophet saw sallam the name of the messenger yes did abu bakr and omar have anything to play in this part well that's a good question abu bakr what is his nickname and what's the meaning of sadiq the one who believes now there is a sadhak which is a normal name which means the honest and the one who tells the truth but asadeep is the one who believes without questioning and who is always honest so so whatever happens you would always find abu bakr may allah be pleased with him on the same tuning of the prophet are on the same wavelength so abu bakr had 100 agreement with whatever the prophet would do going back to umar it's a different story though he is the second ranked man in the muslim nation you know the first one is abu bakr the second one by no match had a different opinion and this inshallah what we will know after the break stay tuned and we will be back abu bakr accepted all the points of the treaty because it is the prophet approved of it so it had to be from allah was a hot-blooded man in the sense that you recall all of his positions previously whenever they had a a prisoner he would always advise the prophet sallam to kill that prisoner and let him be executed by the hands or on the hands of his brother his son or his father someone who is related to him so that the disbelievers would know that we are strong and tough in our religion in this incident incident may allah be pleased with him could not tolerate what he saw and felt to be injustice for the muslims so he went some narrations say to the prophet sallam and others say he went to abu bakr and it appears to me that this is the most acceptable sequence he went first to abu bakr and told abu bakr in a form of dialogue just to portray what he felt he asked abu bakr aren't we muslims said yes aren't they disbelievers yes aren't we on the truth and they are on the false hood side said yes so abu bakr why do we give in in our religion why do we accept humiliation in signing such a treaty that would be a form of injustice to the muslims abu bakr immediately answered umar and told him he is the messenger of allah and allah will not put him astray stay with him follow his footsteps and you are on the safe side that was it now may allah be pleased with him was not satisfied still his blood was boiling it wasn't at ease with that answer it wasn't sufficient so he decided to go a step further he went to the prophet saws and the minute he saw the prophet sallam he said aren't you the prophet of allah that's a challenging question by default so the prophet sallam knew what was going on in umar's mind so he said yes i am. now if someone was approached by one of his followers you know if a king was approached by one of his citizens and and this man said aren't you the king he would kill him immediately because are you questioning my status yet the prophet sallam the mercy to the worlds knew what was going on in his mind so when the omar asked him aren't you the prophet of allah the prophet said yes i am. i'm asking again aren't the people who died from our side martyrs and in heaven and those who died from their side in hell so the the prophet saw said yes again umar said aren't we following the truth and allah is with us and aren't they defending falsehood so the prophet said yes so hammer asked the prophet saddam the final question then why in god's name why in allah's name are we being humiliated and giving in in such a treaty so the prophet saw sallam answer was umar i am the messenger of allah and allah would not set me straight he would not leave me to go astray he will always guide me and whatever i've done i did it for the for the sake of allah so omar said o prophet of allah didn't you say that we are going to enter makkah perform umrah and you will have the keys of the kaaba didn't you say that so the prophet answered him in a very normal and logical manner omar did i tell you that we will do this this year i told you that this is what i saw and it's going to happen inevitably this is a must but i didn't say it was this year and believe me allah would not set me astray omar tells us that after he heard the message the answer of the prophet sallam he felt deep remorse and he regretted the objections he had to say and he said that i have prayed so many times and i've fasted so many days and i've spent my money in charity and i have freed so many slaves only for that word and objection that i've given or said to the prophet and that objection was not due of due to arrogance simply out of sheer love and sincere uh feelings and emotions of defending islam and the muslims now as the muslims in a sense agreed and accepted this treaty they were ordered to take off the case of ahram and the garments and as we know when a person like when a muslim performs commits himself to the status of what does that mean it means that he makes certain things forbidden for himself until he accomplishes his pilgrimage or umrah among these things he must not wear shirts or trousers he must not cover his head with a hat or whatever he must wear only two pieces of garments one an eye apron like around his waist and something to cover his shoulders he must not wear perfume he must not cut his nails or hair he must not uh uh have any intimate relationship with his spouse and so on things that are known to be things that nullify or that are forbidden to be performed while in the state of israel one must not change into normal clothings until he accomplishes his so the prophet alaihis salatu was asked his companions to slaughter their camels and sacrifice and to know to shave their heads and to wear normal clothes he asked them first they did not comply he went and instructed them again nobody listened to him he said it thrice and again they would not follow his instructions so he went inside into his tent to his wife um may allah be pleased with her depressed in a sense so she noticed that there's there was something wrong see she asked the prophet what was wrong and the prophet told her that your people are not following my instructions so she told the prophet allah that o prophet of allah you have to understand their feelings and they were they are depressed because of the treaty that they felt that was not fair to them the only way for them to comply is to do that by yourself to set the example to them so the prophet sallam went out of his tent did not talk to anyone instructed the barber to come and shave his head and he instructed someone else to slaughter the sacrifice camels the minute the companions saw this they all jumped to follow suit to the extent that they almost killed each other by shaving their heads and her advice um tells us that they did not know what they were doing when the prophet salam instructed them three times to they were in disbelief they were hoping that maybe he's going to change his mind maybe a revelation would come from heavens instructing us to go to mecca they could not believe and grasp or even accept the idea that they're going back to medina without performing uh uh umrah is that like a sense of sadness also it was extreme sadness not normal it was extreme to the extent that they did not comply with his instructions three times which tells us that any time the prophet would tell someone to do something even if he tells him to throw himself in fire he would have done that but they could not understand his instructions hoping that something would abrogate this or revelation from allah would come down telling them to do something else they they thought of everything except of going back without performing they slaughtered the sheep and and their sacrifice which also indicates that whenever someone is prevented from entering makkah due to illness due to an enemy due to any other reason then he can come out of the state of ahram by slaughtering and shaving now if someone goes and decides not to continue his for one reason or the other he's already got into the status of haram and while on his way to mecca he decided not to he cannot simply take off his clothes and go back to uh uh doing normal things even if you slaughter one sheep or ten sheep or whatever the minute you go into the state of iran you have to accomplish and continue your worship whether it's hajj pilgrimage or umrah and among the things that the prophet sallam said on that journey he prayed to the almighty to have mercy on those who shave so his companions said and also those who cut short their hair or prophet of allah so he said o allah have mercy on those who shave their heads so the companions again said oh prophet of allah what about those who cut short their hair they don't shave but they cut short their hair the prophet for the third time said o allah have mercy on those who shave their heads and cut short their hair which meant that cutting short your hair after accomplishing your hajj or umrah is acceptable though it's on a second level the first level would be to shave now this is a form of worship now people would say why are people doing this why are they shaving after umrah and hajj it doesn't look nice it doesn't look that well this is not to me or to you this is a divine instruction from allah the almighty and subhanallah why when muslims shave their heads people don't like this and they are not at ease with it and when punks or uh uh gangsters or a form of fashion or rappers or whatever shave their heads it's okay it's it's very strange whenever it's something to do with islam people are always on the offensive and when other people do this they have no problem with that i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time foreign oh hmm"
