  "title": "Suffering from kufr OCD & unsure if something haram is kufr, say shahadah or ignore? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shake a person who suffering from kufur OCD can apply the certaintity doubt principle if he knows that who what he did or doing is haram but he he is not certain that it's or not so so what he should do he should he say the sahada or just ignore the doubt this is something that is going to continue to mess up with your had for decades simply because you don't have the right foundation. You need to build your iman on a solid strong foundation. But if you don't, Shayan messes up with you and you'll become like a feather in the wind just going right and left and don't know where it's going to toss you. Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity. A shepherd in his cattle or herd, a farmer in his farm, a nomad in the desert. They don't have the knowledge you have. They don't read the Quran. They're illiterate. They don't memorize except the fat and maybe one or two suras. But they have concrete and solid iman that would not be easy to shake. because they have conviction and belief. You on the other hand have intrusive thoughts. You listen to shaitan. You're willing to doubt yourself and your iman. You're willing to think negatively of Allah. And this is why you're suffering. So learn your religion more. Try to sit with scholars or therapist who would open your eyes and show you your mistakes and enlighten you of the ease and beauty of Islam. Then you will not have these thoughts and definitely repeating the shahada multiple times per day is not part of Islam. Shaitan has messed up big time with your head."
