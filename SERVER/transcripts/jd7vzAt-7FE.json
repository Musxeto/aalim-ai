  "title": "Why do some imams (in haram) look straight ahead & not at sujood position when praying Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "why do people in the haram and some imams when they recite not look at the position of prostration and look forward okay this is their their problem not mine you're asking me how did the prophet pray i'm telling you you're asking me what's the right way to pray i'm telling you you have to look at your area of prostration if these imams do otherwise then they're not following the sunnah and not necessarily everything they do is according to the sunnah they are human beings they're not great scholars of islam that are followed in every single thing they do first of all second of all some of them as i've heard because they recite the quran they want their voices to be beautifully coming out so they have to raise their heads and look in front and this is a lame excuse no way that you go against the way of the prophet hassam and say that well this is for necessity it's like people when they recite and they want to go for record some imams do this they go to the microphone everybody is in roku and the guy is just interested in his voice coming to the microphone and then he goes for the court this is totally bogus and not from the sunnah so follow the sunnah do not follow the people and allah"
