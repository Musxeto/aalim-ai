  "title": "Double intention for missed fasts with Ashura Arafat 3 White days Mondays Thursdays? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Sheikh I have um excused fast from Ramadan that I didn't fast around the week for valid reasons and when I wanted to make them up I fasted um ashram and then I fasted the white days and then I also fasted Monday and Thursday and I made up the whole days and then my mom said to me that the no master it's by itself it doesn't count when you have um fast that you need some makeup and she says she's not sure about Monday and Thursday and the white days so I checked online and it's true that your mashada is by itself but I'm not sure about the other days if they count did I make up my fast are they by themselves or what can you please shut somebody it is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is the opinion we always remind brothers and sisters of that is you can combine making up for missed days of Ramadan in Ashura in arafah in the white days of the month and Thursdays and Mondays and this is the opinion of the great scholarship may Allah have mercy on his soul so his opinion states that Allah azzawajal put the reward of expiating the sins of a year if you if you fast Ashura so if you combine that with fasting a day making up a day of Ramadan there's no problem in that because you are hitting two birds with one stone and Allah's Mercy is greater than that"
