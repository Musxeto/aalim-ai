  "transcript": "so what is the explanation of this hadith and what does surat he refer to here jazakallahu kaidan zakum this hadith is an issue of dispute among scholars some and it translates to the following allah the almighty has created adam according to his image his image does it refer to allah or does it refer to adam the most authentic opinion is that it refers to allah azzawajal in the sense that allah created adam according to his image in the sense that allah has a face but we don't know how this face is and nothing is unlike allah azza nothing is like allah subhanahu wa so no matter what crosses your mind allah is unlike that but we know the general descriptions and attributes of allah so allah has a face allah has two eyes allah has a hand or actually allah has two hands and allah has fingers so all of these indicate to us that allah created adam according to his image and the image is something that you can relate to the prophet said allah you will see allah azzawajal on the day of judgment when you are in paradise all of you will be able to see allah's face as you can see the moon in the middle of the lunar month when it's full and complete this is how you clearly see it not how allah is therefore the most authentic opinion of this hadith is that allah created adam according to his image subhanahu wata'ala other scholars say that no according to adam's image meaning that what we know that the image of a human being and this doesn't make any sense and allah knows best"
