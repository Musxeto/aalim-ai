  "title": "Why are there two Adhan / Athan for Fajr? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh brother youssef i think is asking about the two advance of fajr and why do we have to advance well this is how it was at the time of the prophet all the years that the prophet hassam lived in medina they had two advance the first adhan was done by bilal the muslim of the prophet and the prophet said to the people when bilal gives the adhan this should not stop you from eating and drinking this is just a reminder so that those who are praying to hajjud know that fajr is approaching so they can they wrap up and pray with her and those who are asleep would be able to wake up and eat sahur the in preparation but when the adhan of tomb is called this is the adana fajr so these are two events until today there is the first evan which is just a reminder and in this adhan by the way we don't say a salah twice we call the normal adhan which means that it is a reminder but then of the actual break of dawn where you can pray and when you must stop eating and drinking this is the adhan where we say assalatu and know me twice and i hope this answers your question"
