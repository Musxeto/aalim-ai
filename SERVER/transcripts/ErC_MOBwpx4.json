  "transcript": "from bangladesh he's saying is it permissible for a woman to travel with her mahram for tourism well the question should not be is she allowed to travel because the ruling is the same for her and for him so what's the ruling on traveling for tourism scholars say that if a person is living in a muslim country so all what you see around you and you're from bangladesh it's a muslim country yes there are sins like every other muslim country but in totality it's a muslim country the adhan is being called people pray in the masjid people meet you in the streets you say salam alaikum alaikum they fast in ramadan etc so it's a muslim country to travel to a non-muslim country where the majority are non-muslims and non-muslim practices are being visible and maybe influencing the thinking of muslims in this case the scholars say it is not permissible to travel to non-muslim countries unless there are legitimate reasons and what are such legitimate reasons one you're traveling because you're trading you're a trade you're a merchant you need to buy goods you're traveling to get your education which you cannot attain except in that non-muslim country no other muslim country can provide you with the same education three uh you need to get treatment medical treatment and you have to travel from this country to that country such reasons are permissible providing that you have sufficient strong akida that would repel any doubts the non-muslims throw and cast on you you have sufficient virtue and piety that would repel any desires that shaytan may cast upon you and that there is no other muslim country that could fulfill this except this non-muslim country and allah azza knows best also"
