  "transcript": "reasons behind Madding late females who is not married here well they're more than before uh the the one who were married 18 wait wait wait wait 18 years of age Masha Allah see girls always marry early and that is why those who have girls become old early I was 45 44 45 years of age and became a grandfather so I can boast about it when someone says I'm a grandfather let me ahead in the queue so when I come I'm an uncle I'm a grandfather they put me at the first okay 19. 20. 21. 22. 23 masha'allah above 25 above 25 got married okay so usually here it's 24 to 25 this is the average after that it is danger zone for the girls and this is pathetic because there shouldn't be a danger zone for the girls a lot of the boys when they want to get married I need someone who's below 18. or 19. how old are you I'm 45. so why don't you marry someone who's 30. that is old and what about 45. I'm a man so what this is wrong but unfortunately it's like this in Saudi 22 is the average so if a girl is 22 or 23 years of age we start to worry they marry her when she's 17 18 usually second year or last year in high school and that is the suitable age I personally don't think so it depends on the girl there is a possibility that the 17 years old girl is perfect for marriage she's sensible she's mature sometimes 23 years old is not responsible yet so what are the reasons one the father constituting an obstacle quickly without people noticing do you think your father constitutes an obstacle in your marriage raise your hands Allah mashallah one who okay do you think that he was an obstacle in your marriage you're married now but he was an obstacle alhamdulillah loving fathers good liars so what are the reasons for fathers becoming obstacles one I'm talking about normal Islamic countries a big dowry so when someone proposes to my daughter and he has a very low job low salary I demand for a big Dowry you have to pay me hundred thousand reals fifty thousand reals and the gold what we call shabka and the wedding and so on so the boy says might as well I go to Syria or go to Jordan get a much cheaper wife there cheaper in the sense of expenses because if I marry from Egypt for example it would be 10 cost 10 of the costs that I would pay probably here is the same but men definitely don't do this because they're getting richer so they would not go and get it elsewhere which is wrong so hoping for a big dowry is a cause is a reason for a woman to get married late because the father keeps on kicking people out no no no until he gets someone in a Mercedes ah you're the man and he gets her married and then discovers that the Mercedes was rented the second reason is her salary so the father would not give his daughter in marriage because she works she earns and she spends and in Saudi unfortunately this is Extreme uh sad but it's happening in some tribes in some families I got so many complaints from sisters daughters that is and they call me and they say we are three sisters all teachers getting very big salaries unmarried we're 30 above some of us went and to reach at the age of 40. and our father refuses to marry to get us married not only that salary we get he has the ATM card he gives us only 800 to 1000 reals and he takes the rest to himself which is eight thousand or nine thousand years and he has a second wife and he has family so it's it's Prof profitable for him to get so much money that's why he refuses to get married and this is very sad those who have children beware one of the girls that was not married and this is one of the said it in his lecture she got sick when she was 35 years of age and on her dying bed she was dying she said to her relatives her mother convey my salaam to Allah to my father and tell him I will stand in front of Allah on the day of judgment asking him to punish him for not being letting me married and she died it is a great responsibility that you have you have children marry them to someone who feels Allah this is natural one of the reasons for the father being an obstacle is he needs a mate and who can be better made than my daughter so if she gets married I'll be alone with the old woman my my old wife and we will nag together and I will not clean she will not clean no let my daughter stay and she will serve us inshallah so this is the Father's problem now moving on to the second reason for women getting married late the second reason is initiated from the woman herself so she wants to continue her career and I've heard this from girls in 16 and 17 years of age saying that we would not want to get married we want to go and finish our school get Masters and PhD if you're 16 years old then this is what you think this means that you have seen in your house from your father and mother so many trouble and problems and nagging and fighting to the extent that this caused you not to want to get married does this happen in your house does your father and mother argue and fight yes unfortunately this is a problem so for you youngsters whenever you have a dispute with your spouse never ever do it in front of the children it's difficult for the manner she's shouting at me in front of the kids I have to show them who the man is She's the Man no if you find this oppress yourself until the kids go and then you can communicate never ever fight in front of the children because this is the result of them not wanting to get married and it keeps a lot of sad stories at the back of your mind sometimes you find a woman a girl in her 20s she is dominating personality she is controlling you feel like she's a man she's the man of the house this is wrong but if you look in the roots you will find that her mother was like this with her father and the opposite way around you'll find the husband that is abusive that uses foul language that never appreciates and you look at his father you will find that this is the way he used to treat his mother so you bring your children in the best and perfect and Islamic way never ever leave a negative impact on your child among the reasons education career indication is different yes education is pursuing your studies career is pursuing her position in a company in Saudis we don't have alhamdulillah up till now but we do have women who are men like working in companies mixing with men and trying to get higher positions the majority of women work in teaching so she wants to become a better teacher she wants to become a supervisor she wants to be a Headmaster so she doesn't get married because of these reasons and we have a lot of unmarried women in Saudi Arabia because as I've said as stated 22 23 is a little bit late so if she reaches a good position when she's 28 who will marry her I know personally one who is not married when she was 28 years of age she wanted someone to come within this age span 28 to 235 but the people 28 to 35 was always looking at 18 and 19. so no one proposed when she became 35 years of age she said okay I will accept anyone who's divorced but those who are divorced who are looking for someone young only those who were married proposed as a second wife she refused when she became 45 of the years of age she said okay even someone who has a second wife I will accept but it's too late someone wanting a second wife taking a 45 years old taking a grandmother my wife is about 40 7 years of age my first wife and she's a grandmother of six so whenever someone says yes you have two wives she's like I'm married to a grandmother and she becomes very angry what do you mean I'm a grandmother and she poses for a minute and said when you're the grandfather too so I said okay I'm not angry why are you angry they become angry very quickly unfortunately so education is one of the reasons one of the reasons for women to marry late is her lineage you have this unfortunately all over the world when someone is a say it meaning that descending from the prophets lineage they insist on marrying someone who is like them and usually the demand is far less than the supply this is economics 101. so you have so many proposing so little proposing men well the demand is so huge so she waits for someone from the same lineage maybe she waits or maybe her father Waits and they refused they refused they refused and that is why the majority of those unmarried are because of this reason and from the Saeed a lot of them we call them Ashraf or Sada because of this problem um elsewhere probably in Saudi Arabia because we don't marry except from the same tribe not from the same nationality but even from the same tribe usually unfortunately for men it's unlike that men can marry from any tribe women cannot marry except from their own tribe and this is segregation this is discrimination not disaggregation discrimination that is unislamic the prophet Allah married his cousin may Allah be pleased with him married her to Zayn even Hadith who was a freed slave and she was one of the dignitary of quraish no problem he is God feeling and she is a tribal woman he got he got her marriage so this is not in accordance to uh Islam among the reasons is that we have custom and traditions I have two daughters one proposed to the youngest will I accept the majority would not why he's a righteous man he's Rich he has a good position so it will break my eldest heart she would her heart would not be broken she loves her youngest sister she said no no we have Traditions the first one to get married is the eldest sometimes this delays the marriage of five years nobody proposes to the eldest everyone proposes to the youngest or the younger or the younger so why do you burden your children because of the eldest this is wrong says this is the customs and traditions this is something we have to change with the grace of Allah my first three daughters were married one two three in sequence number five get married before the fourth fourth is still unmarried nothing happened I would not say no sorry you have to take it in sequence no they propose to number five I gave them number five number four is still waiting for Allah's uh blessing and favor upon her when she is ready Allah will grant her a husband if Allah Wills that number six is it number five a logical conditions why women do not marry early because they have illogical conditions she wants a driver she wants a maid she wants a summer trip every year she wants her husband to allow her to work and this is a a big problem because the majority of men do not want their wives to work is this correct anyone here who wants his wife to work raise your hands no problem okay one good not working uh is something Haram I'm not saying this if a woman Works in a totally segregated place this is completely Hala but the majority of men would not want their women to work unless they need the finance maybe sometimes I'm unable to support my house and I need extra money and she's wearing we need this cooperation but the majority say no I want my wife to stay home take care of my children when I come back she takes care of me this is her responsibility in life my responsibility is to work her responsibility is to take care of her kingdom among the women who what the question should be among the married women who wants to work one two three four five who wants her five six why would women want to work very easy to find out the answer one I did not study to put it in a frame my certificate and hang it on the wall I studied for six 10 20 years to work and to be productive good answer two I want to work because I need money I don't want to become a financial burden and my husband besides I have family my my mother my father they need my support three I'm fed up I'm bored I don't want to sit home all of these reasons might be acceptable but definitely they do not come even close to sitting home and taking care of the husband this is your primary objective in life that is why the prophet said a woman if she praise her father and faster Ramadan and protects her Chastity and obeys her husband into Jannah immediately enters Paradise four things men a long list you have to do this you have to pray in the Masjid five times a day you have to uh enforce righteousness and prevent evil you have to take care of your parents the women don't have to take care of the parents it's not their obligation because she's married she's obliged to obey her husband her husband says do not go to your parents house every day only once a week she has to obey him do not go to your parents house at all the whole year she must obey him he's sinful he will be questioned by Allah but she must she's obliged to obey him so she has so little things that she will enter Jannah so illogical conditions among the reasons age why doesn't she get married because of her age what causes her to stay that old the previous reasons Career Education her parents her conditions Etc among the reasons age of the proposing persons so if someone comes to you who's 50 years old no no no he has to be my age sister you're 25. the man proposing to you is 35 none of this too old I want you to be 26 27. so the age restriction of the person proposing causes a problem and delays the marriage having a crush on someone so many people come and propose the father says daughter he's a good man he's a Pious man no no I don't want to get mad why if you go and ask her why don't you want to get married to someone because I love someone I had a relationship three years ago on the internet with someone and he promised to propose to me do you know his real name no have you seen his picture no well he showed me his picture it was uh uh Leonardo DiCaprio so he was not the one but this is the picture he posted so you are connected to someone you have a crush on someone who does not exist and he may exist but he's not proposing so forget about him get married no no I'm waiting for him a lot of the sisters when their father tells them that someone is proposing to you she says how does he look like a man no no no no describe him to me uh he is my age oh he's too short I did I say h M he's my height so no no he's too short I don't want him okay he's a little bit fat no no he has to does he have muscles yes he has muscles does he have car no I don't watch him so they have a mental description of the husband to come he has to come on a white horse wearing his shiny shining armor and with a big you know speed and sword and and the horse goes on two legs and he may fall down but this is will be edited inshallah and then again she wants she thinks that this is my uh a night in shining armor he is the man of my dreams why did you have this mental picture in your head because you're watching a lot of movies so sisters come I don't love my husband why he never brought me a red rose I say sister we live in Saudi Arabia it's desert if he brings you something maybe he brings you a big lizard this is what we have in the desert with that we don't have red roses what are you talking about this is the media they have and the boys have the same thing huh in Saudi when you when you have a list my wife has this obsession she likes to get people married so all the time I come to the house yes okay what's his what is her his requirements she has room okay the age restrictions okay every time on the phone what are you doing matchmaking she loves this she says I don't have knowledge I don't have money so the best thing to me is to match make alhamdulillah she's doing good she says we have a problem in Saudi Arabia the majority of the youth when they want to get married they say she has to be white Fair White and soft hair not curled and she has to be thinning thin and skinny model and Saudi Arabia you don't have this you have fat women they don't have sports they don't move they just keep on eating Pizza Hut fried Kentucky Fried Chicken and hamburgers that's what they ate so you're not being realistic because the girl have similar conditions huh okay and I tell her when these boys ask you for these conditions what is their description she said they're five feet tall bulky Bunchy and their teeth is crooked and one eye here one eye there they have problems themselves so yeah you should take someone same level but they don't have this so women girls when they have a crush on someone or when they have this mental picture of the husband to come this delays the marriage a lot and this is why the prophet told us what is the criteria his moral conduct no no for the man for the for the girls his moral conduct and his practicing being practicing his religion with religion with knowledge too whether he's black or white is not a criteria whether he's handsome or Fair he's not whether he's rich or poor it's not the rest will all come with Allah's Grace finally the fear of the past a lot of the sisters refuse or postpone their marriage because the fear of the past I'm talking about this out of experience huh I get a lot of emails a lot of the sisters say I don't want to cheat my husband to be I had a relationship unfortunately I was sinful I was this and that I was so far from Allah I knew men or a newer man or when I was a teenager I had a relationship with my neighbor or with my universities uh colleague and the inevitable happened this is natural put fuel next to Fire and say please don't ignite will it ever happen will it never it has to Natural so now the sister is in a dilemma how can I do how can I deal with this so I will not marry at all in my life and this is wrong how is it wrong she cheated she committed Zina and if a man comes and proposes to her and you say no she can marry he said yes okay in this case she has to tell him no no Allah azzawajal concealed your sin does anybody know about your sin Allah concealed your sin Allah is always forgiving you sought Allah's forgiveness and Allah forgives you you get married without telling him he will know how will he know I was weak and I told him after marriage of six months I told him you tell me I tell you I am telling you out of experience I get so many problems this is true the sister calls me and says I told him and he got angry and now he wants to divorce me what should I do it's your mistake why did you tell him I thought we were in love and I thought that we had transparency so he told me and I told him but when he told me I didn't get angry when I told him he wants to divorce me you you deserve what you get a rule of thumb whenever you make a sin and you repent from it never tell a soul not even my mother not even your mother not my sister not even your sister nothing the prophet said all of my ummah Allah will forgive all of their sins subhanallah accept those who brag and boast about it except those who expose themselves Allah will not forgive you if you committed adultery and you went to your friend and said I made a mistake I committed adultery Allah will not forgive you conceal it no one knows about it ask Allah forgiveness this Hadith is in bukhari and elsewhere the prophet says part of exposing yourself is that you make sin at night and no one knows about it it's morning time you go and meet your friend and tell him listen didn't you know yesterday I did this and that and he exposes Allah's he supposes his secret and exposes what Allah has concealed a lot of the boys and girls yesterday I saw this movie did you see it no whoa it's a good movie no I didn't see it he's the CD you see it so that we are both in the same sin Allah will not forgive you Hadith is clear and obvious so if you have a past what's in the past in the past see colors forgiveness nothing had happened always feel remorseful have this repentance in your heart okay we have now some of the characteristics that we would like our future wife to have so what do you think what do you want in your wife she can no no if you were not married don't be a chicken come on then I can't see you they can't hear you they don't know who you are okay good that first condition a woman is married for four reasons number one is for her wealth second is for her uh status third is for her beauty and photos for virtue I was searching for one with the virtue and I would if I have to marry one more hamdullah and it would be definitely a plus if you can get all four exactly usually they're in Jannah but you never know you look inshallah what would you look for a future spouse other than what was mentioned no this was mentioned Dean religion we know so what else respecting my parents good sure yes I am still to plan for a second one and still to plan for a second one no no I'm talking about the first one if you were looking for a first one I had all the four okay then this is a typical scared husband so let's let's move to someone who's a little bit yeah any more Brave what would you look brother keeping keeping security keeping you in security can you define this a little bit secret I mean keeping Secret keeping my secret so what keeping your secrets very good a lot of some sisters are masha'allah always doing this so you always go and she's doing this either eating or talking all the time and she tells all her secrets to her mother so you go to your in-laws and how are you my mother-in-law why did you do this yesterday ah sorry it was the first time no you did this six months ago and she takes a log book and she knows everything you have done so this is on Islamic I need to have a wife that keeps my secrets so this is good so let's go through so that we would not would not waste a lot of time and the characteristics that we require in a wife in the future wife whether you're married once or twice or three times a lady religion quietly righteousness being practicing woman does this come on the top of the list Liars what you the first thing you look is that she's beautiful and then she's rich and then she comes from a good family and then if she's religious every phrase ah okay that's good it depends the brother says it depends on the age if you're 18 you may prioritize it as Beauty Etc but if you're 35 well I I beg to differ even if a person is 60 years old average but you could go for Beauty First and religion second maybe or third or fourth so the prophet says a woman may be married for four things"
