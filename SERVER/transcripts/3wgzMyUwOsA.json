  "transcript": "what is the ruling on eating or drinking while standing up there is a where the Prophet saw someone drinking while standing up and he said throw it up and the man said why should I do this prophet of Allah so the prophet said would you like that cat drinks with you from the same Cup and the man said no definitely not I do not like anyone to share the water with me let alone that it be an animal so the prophet told him that well something who is worse than a cat just drank with you and that was uh thean but the most authentic opinion that drinking standing up is permissible yet it is not recommended some Scholars say that it is forbidden others say that it is permissible but not recommended because the prophet drank while standing up and he drank Zam standing up may Allah be pleased with him also stated that the prophet did the standing up and he said I do not care whether I drink standing up or sitting down and so this inshallah uh um points out and gives us an Insight that it is permissible to drink sping up though it's prep preferable and highly recommended to do it while sitting down and Allah Knows Best"
