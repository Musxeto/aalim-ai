  "title": "How should a girl behave when a suitor comes to see her in presence of her wali? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "anonymous person says must a girl be dead serious during a marriage meeting because the suitor is not her muharram or can she let her personality show because she is his potential wife to see if he likes it and vice-versa I think the question is clear what the sister is asking so she's saying that if someone comes to propose my father meets him and he thinks that he and he checks on him and he passes so my father arranges for a meeting which is an interview which is part of the Sunnah where the girl gets to look at the boy the boy gets to look at the girl and they're not ordered to lower their gaze rather they're ordered to look and take a good look and talk for an hour or so just to try to find means and ways of liking one another in order to proceed with the marriage a proposal or to decline so she's saying that must she be that serious in this meeting meaning do you go to college yes do you like desserts not much and it goes like an interrogation no of course not she is allowed to look at him to exchange questions to be humorous to let down her guard in a sense but not to be a stand-up comedian not to crack jokes and sit on the arms of the chair or hang from the chandelier just to make him laugh know a person by nature a Muslim by nature has to be respectful has to have his dignity there's no problem in being humorous being funny having good remarks showing that yes this or that giving remarked here there but not to the extent of being a comedian or a clown so the answer is to take the middle path not to be so frank that is so serious and rigid and at the same time not to be so loose and doing something impulsively that would put a bad impression against you in his mind and Allah knows best"
