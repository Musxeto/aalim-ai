  "title": "The Three Fundamental Principles (Thalaathat-ul-usool) Part 14 - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when the prophet settled in medina yes when the prophet sallam settled in medina he commanded all the remaining laws of islam such as a cat fasting hajj and then jihad commanding good and forbidding evil as well as the other laws of islam he remained doing this for ten years and then passed away peace and blessings of allah be upon him while his religion remained this was may allah is mentioning to us what the third principle of these three fundamentals constitute off so knowing your prophet was knowing his biography knowing his seerah knowing how he lived and what he presented to the um and why he is considered the best of allah's creation he tells us that after the prophet salam had spent 13 years in mecca calling people and we spoke about this last week he called people to to heed so imagine establishing the concept of tawhid for 13 years in makkah and what this resulted in because we know that at times of calamities at times of war at times of necessity only those whom the prophet islam has raised with his own two hands in makkah those whom he told them about akida about the religion and about everything that this beautiful religion is founded on only those remain steadfast with him after 13 years when the prophet went to medina the timing differed the situation changed so instead of addressing people who were strongly based in shirk now he is preaching the muslims who are eager and thirsty for knowledge so the rest of the revelations came down such as the establishment of prayer though we spoke about this and said that prayer was mandated three years before hijra but it was established as congregational prayer with all the different ruling different rulings afterwards in medina zakat hajj jihad the establishment of the avant all of these came later when he went to medina and also in joining virtue and righteousness and preventing and prohibiting vice and evil and the rest of all the islamic rituals and religion that maintained or remained after his death sallallahu alaihi wali wasallam as he stayed in medina for 10 years having said that this shows you the importance of archaeda which so many people seem to take lightly akida is the essence of islam praying is part of islam zakat hajj doing good to others is all part of islam but the essence of it the thing that motivates and drives people to do these things is a sound akita without your islam is not of that great importance without taheed your islam is not of that great importance and this is what we as muslims should focus on when we give our dawah you see the field of dawah is very wide and we have so many types of scholars students of knowledge of daes who call people to islam which is good diversifying their efforts but the cause and the aim is one yet we tend to see people underestimating the importance of alpeda not only that there are people nowadays who are undermining the efforts to establish the correct akida so we end up seeing people saying that is not of great importance on the contrary it divides the muslims so whenever you speak about the heda of the prophet hassam and his companions you will hear calls and cries from different parts of the world and maybe some known figures objecting to that and saying no you should not speak about deviant akidas and sects and cults as long as they say we should be united and this is not true we do not stand out of our way to condemn others or to speak about others but it is important to know that we cannot unite without being on the same appeal we cannot join forces with sects that curse abu bakr um or slander mother aisha we cannot join forces with cults that worship graves and sacrifice to other than allah azzawajal we cannot join forces with liberals and people who claim to be intellectual that scrutinize our quran and the sunnah claiming that we are implementing the academic scientific laws of verification and they come from america from europe from east asia and targeting our fundamentals saying that this does not make any logic this cannot be done our unity has to be based on arpeda and akida does not follow a particular country or a regime it does not follow a particular individual it follows the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of our righteous predecessors of the three favorite generations of the companions taberine and taviret this is what the prophet is brought to us and taught us and this is his legacy that remained after his death and this is something that we have to acknowledge and adhere to in order to be muslims this was his religion there was no good except that he directed his ummah towards it and there was no evil except that he warned them against it the good that he directed not to work for and everything that allah loves and is pleased with the evil like you want his about him everything that allah hates and reject okay so what the imam is saying to us is that one of the fundamentals of islam see when we come to define the meaning of shahadat what is the meaning the definition of testifying that the prophet haslam is allah's servant and messenger in arabic it rhymes very nicely with us this is the meaning of to believe in what he brought to us to obey him when he orders us to refrain when he prohibits us and not to worship allah except with his religion so this is a principle in our belief that the prophet alaihis salat was did not die except after telling us all the good that is found and possible to be done that gets us closer to allah azzawajal and he warned us from all evil that would distract us and make allah azzawajal angry with us and the best of all goodness that he brought to us is tahit everything good revolves around tawheed to heed of lordship to heed of worship and to hate of the beautiful names and attributes of allah azzawajal and the worst of all evils that the prophet salaam warned us from is shirk and everything that allah azzawajal abhors and rejects and this has to be clear to us as muslims this is the type of submission that if we fail to have the conviction of we fail to be muslims real muslims acknowledge this with their hearts and say it with the tongues and act upon it with their limbs they know for certain that there is nothing better in this world than tawhid because this is why allah azzawajal has created us and if we manage to understand and have this conviction in our hearts we will prevail we will win but the majority of us think that allah created us to get married to buy a house to become rich to enjoy our lives in my 24 hours how much am i devoted to worshiping allah azza and how much am i devoted to worshiping satan we worship allah how long see we think that worshiping allah is offering 17 raka's in a very routine way and that's it i prayed my fight for now i can watch youtube i can go to the movies i can listen to music i can flirt with girls on social media i can slander i can cheat i can gossip i can lie i can do anything i want is this why allah created you people fail to sit back and reflect say hmm what did allah create us am i fulfilling my duties to allah now if we cannot have this conviction in our hearts we have a big problem so once we submit our will to allah and understand and commit to the fact that allah has sent to us the prophet salaam and the prophet sallam did not hesitate to tell us everything that is good that would lead us to allah and to paradise and he did not hold back anything that is harmful to us or that would make allah azza angry with us yes allah sent him to all mankind and he made an obligation upon everyone from the two species of jinn and mankind to obey him the proof of this is allah saying say o people verily i am the messenger of allah sent to all of you allah perfected okay no no let's wait here so the prophet alaihis was job description was clear from the beginning he was sent to mankind and this is a well-known fact everybody knows that the prophet allah was not sent only to the quraysh tribe the prophet of salam was not sent only to the arabs he was sent to all mankind whether they are in siberia in russia or in the north pole or when the askimo or in the jungles of africa or in the jungles of asia any human being on earth the prophet hassam was sent to him and this is why and we've mentioned this before when we say that the word um is divided into two types of dawah and um meaning that all humans muslims and non-muslims are included in the ummah of the prophet allah whom he is giving them dawah so the ummah of calling includes the americans the russians the indians muslims and this believers as well but we are proud to be of the second type of ummah which is the ummah of response and answering so these nations were called to islam and not all of them complied and accepted those who are accepted to be response and answering they answered positively and they followed the prophet alaihis and we are among those and the grace of allah so the prophet isaiah was not sent like every other messenger because the prophet said in an authentic hadith that i was given the favor of over five things that no prophet before me was given it each prophet was sent to his people and i was sent to all mankind and not only mankind also to the jinn i don't know why it was disconnected but i hope we're back are we back uh nasser no sir yes we are backside we are back now hello hello okay was it from your side or from my side no from your side i think shakes uh network is having a bit of problem and now yes you're back but we can't see your chef yes we can see you now we can see you now now we can hear you okay alhamdulillah as long as you guys can hear me and see me i don't know what happened to nasa but uh anyhow so the prophet salallahu was not only sent to the humans he was sent even to the jinn which is a whole different world that we do not see allah says in the quran about satan and his offspring that the jinn are capable of seeing you while you are able to see them so the prophet was sent to them and there is a with this name the jinn and we're told how they came to the prophet and they said to one another listen and they heard the recitation of the quran and immediately they went back to their people and said o people we have heard a quran that was astonishing and this quran leads to guidance and they called their people to islam just by heeding the quran so the prophet salallahu was given this huge duty to be the messenger of all humans and the jinn no sir are you on or not yet no i'm unsure i can hear you can you hear me i don't know where the moderator is gone but we will continue inshallah um with whatever we have with us and so allah azzawajal perfected the religion with our prophet wasallam the evidence for this is the saying of allah which means this day i've perfected your religion for you completed my favor upon you and have chosen for you islam as your religion and this is the most perfect situation for anyone who wants to [Music] innovate add or subtract anything from this beautiful religion allah says clearly this is the day that i have perfected your religion which means that anything that is perfect cannot be undone it is a perfect religion that we have that allah azzawajal has given us and it will remain perfect until the day of judgment so there is no room for anyone to come and say um the prescribed punishment you know cutting the hands flogging stoning execution these are too severe for our present times so we have to change them no it can't be changed because it was perfected 15 centuries ago if someone claims that it is okay it is all right to abolish laws of inheritance so why the daughter gets half of the male this doesn't make any sense we have to make them equal and this unfortunately took place in quote unquote muslim countries such as tunisia and they're debating a lot about it and they're muslims but this is what happens when apida departs and man-made laws prevail the deen the religion is complete and allah azzawajal has accepted it now the sheikh moves on to another um point which is the death of a prophet but i'm before i continue i don't know why brother nasser is not possible for me to hear him um let me disconnect and reconnect again and maybe this would become handy so i'll stop here and reconnect again all right [Music] yeah he thinks i think he has having problem with his network so inshallah i think he'll be joining us back soon as soon as he joins i will add him a picture yes it's gonna be back inshallah it's gonna be back now things having a bit of an issue which is connection that's right so okay let's let's talk about the death of the prophet go ahead okay so the evidence of his death foreign after the ayah this day i have perfected your at your religion okay okay yeah so the proof that he was died as a saying of allah you would surely die and day two will surely die then on the day of recompense you will be disputing before your lord when people die they will be resurrected for this is allah saying from it the earth will created you and to eat we shall return you and from it we shall bring you once again okay let's stop here let's stop here so why would the imam mention the fact that he died which every single person with logic understands and believes because most likely he is trying to prove to some of the cults and deviant sects who claim that the prophet is not dead ali and nowadays unfortunately we have such sects and cults who would fight with you who are willing to go into battle with you if you say that the prophet muhammad ali islam is dead and they say that the prophet al-isram is not dead rather he is alive in his grave and he is however nother meaning that he is present and overlooking everything and he controls the universe like he controls the palm of his hand and he's the one who facilitates things and he's the one who answers us when we make prayers and dua and call him to save us from whatever is happening to us indeed this is shirk to believe this is a profound breach of al-qaeda because allah azzawajal said in the quran verily you o muhammad will die and verily they too will die then on the day of resurrection you will be disputing before your lord azzawajal this is a fact now before we go on who was it that died at the time of the prophet allah who was it that was washed and shrouded in three white garments who was it that the muslims prayed funeral prayer in pairs or in threes who was it that was buried in the house of isha where we know that the grave is known as the grave of the prophet no muslim would argue and say it was someone else everybody would say this was the prophet muhammad so is he dead or is he not dead yes there's definitely he's dead but this death is related to this world on earth that we call al hayat because there are three phases phase number one is this life phase number three is the eternal life whether in heaven or in hell for eternity in between them there is a transitional phase in people's graves it's a different world than ours so the prophet is in our standards of today's world on earth is dead in the standards of the barzah he's alive the martyrs are alive but their life is unlike our lives so they do not see what is happening on earth they do not eat and drink and go to the toilet like the humans do their relationship between their souls and bodies are different than our relationships between our souls now and bodies and it would be different on the day of judgment in the eternal life and there this is why the imam mentions this fact and the ayah so that those who are delusional those who may allow shaytan to mess up with their minds and make them think and be convinced that there is a possibility that the prophet is alive one of the previous mufti's of al-azhar and this is reported to me by one of his students and he's a super sufi and the sufis say this a lot in their books if you pray or offer salutation upon the prophet five hundred times every day you will not die until you see the prophet allah in broad daylight now this is too much if you claim that you will not die until you see him in your dreams okay i can i can swallow that but to claim that you would not die until you see him in broad daylight how is this possible this previous mufti who's still giving fat was left right and and center that does not relate to islam unfortunately till date he comes in the media and he says heinous things telling people in america it's okay to sell intoxicants there's no problem in selling haram things because you live in a kafir country subhanallah what kind of a religion is this this guy said to his students that i observed offering salutation upon the prophet 500 times a day maybe more and once i was in medina in the masjid of the prophet alaihis and i approached his grave and i was shocked to see his honorable hand extended to me and i shook hands with the prophet alaihis salazar giving him the pledge of allegiance seriously these guys lie and fool people and the funny thing is that they're making money out of it and they're filthy rich because of the way they fool people and the people believe them you shook hands with the prophet isaiah said yes in the flesh okay with all due respect why did you let go what do you mean why don't you why didn't you while shaking his hand had the firm grip and pulled the prophet salallahu out of his grave so he would come alive and solve our problems that we see in this world these guys don't have brains if the prophet was alive alessa take him out then they would say um no i they can't say he's not alive like us because this would undermine the castles the palaces that they have built on this myth that they make money out of we love our prophet we adore his sunna and follow it to the letter which in many cases lead others to insult us and abuse us because of us abiding by his sunna but we'd never lie against him we never fool others and touch their inner feelings with blatant lies the prophet is dead and every human being whom allah has created will inevitably and eventually die and everyone will be resurrected on the day of judgment and we will stop at the issue of resurrection insha allah azzawajal so that we would try to comment on it next uh time we meet so do you have any questions uh yeah sure we do have some uh few questions the first question is um does breaking knuckles invalid valid now the things that invalidates a lot one are the things that invalidate your wudu so if you did not break your wudu your salat is intact two the things that invalidate the salat are the things that would take you out of the description of salat so salat is like this if someone looks at me he would say the sheikh is praying but if i am during praying i do this what is the sheikh doing whoa hey what are you doing since i'm praying hallelujah what kind of prayer is this this breaks us a lot because whoever looks at me says that this guy is not praying he's dancing he's playing around if i am facing the qiblah and all of a sudden i do this then this breaks my salah because i gave my back to the qibla unlike if i do this if i do this slight movement if i look this doesn't break my salah but it reduces it especially if there is no legitimate reason so breaking your knuckles or or cracking your knuckles or whatever they call them this is a gesture in a movement that is disrespectful of allah it shows disrespect usually people do it without any paying attention to it but nevertheless it is disrespectful to allah so does it break my prayer the answers no your prayer is still valid and you have reduced your reward drastically but still it is a valid salat and allah knows best and i'm sure can a woman do waxing of her legs and hands if the hair is too much even if the hair is not too much a woman may beautify herself as needed without any problem and let me instead of giving you a fish every day let me teach you how to fish the hair on the human body is of three types one prohibited to remove for men this includes the beard the eyebrows for women this includes the eyebrows only if she has a beard she has to shave it or remove it two hair that it is mandatory to remove for men and women and this includes the armpit hair and the pubic area here the third type of hair is the type that islam did not comment on so the general trend is it's up to you you want to remove it you can do so you don't want to remove it it's up to you so if i were to say that i'm a man and i have hair on my chest can i remove it wax it the answer is okay don't i have a to have any reason no i don't have to have any reason i can remove it okay i'm a man can i remove my arm hair and the hair on my legs yeah you can do that seriously yeah this is permissible to remove or to keep logically people would look down at you and say hey are you coming out of the closet why are you removing this is not natural for men but it is not haram it's a cultural thing so going back to your question a woman can with or without any reason whacks her legs and her arms without any problem can someone buy a government job so that he can take care of himself and his family if the person is very capable of doing the job thank you this is not buying this is bribing bribe is prohibited and a major sin in islam the prophet said allah is may allah curse the one who gives the bribe and the one who receives it so it is totally prohibited to give a bribe to secure a government job now the problem is that if we have a problem in our country and everything is done through bribing and if he you tell us not to bribe that would cause a lot of hardship if not disastrous implications because i cannot get a driving license without bribing i'm i'm willing to wait for a six months for a year but even if i wait they will not give me they will always fail me even if i am michael schumacher one of the best in a race driver they are self-failing i cannot get a seat in the university i cannot get a job in the government so in this case if the whole country is corrupt and things are not facilitated without giving a bribe to get what is lawfully yours i'm not getting somebody's else share or trying to steal someone's else rights rather it's my own right that i'm trying to trying to salvage it seems that if you are qualified for the job and there is no other way but through bribing inshallah this is permissible and allah knows best can we dye our hair in colors like rainbow or any other color for meals males are allowed to dye their hair providing they do not go against the norm whenever a person stands out in the crowd because of how he looks or how he dresses this is haram this is known as the dress of fame the garment of fame so everybody in my country wears white soaps like the one i'm wearing imagine if i tomorrow come with a pinkish soap and i go to lead the prayer in the masjid they will stone me and kick me out of the masjid this is feminist this is not of a man of a man of religion likewise if a man dyes his hair if the color is acceptable so if he dyes it in red due to hinna or if he dyes it into brown of he if he dyes it into blond and he is of fair skin yeah that's acceptable but if he puts rainbow colors on his hair then he is most likely endorsing the lgbtq community this is of course not permissible at all so a muslim must not swim against the tide a muslim should be normal among his community and not trying to draw attention to himself with such weird acts nowadays we get sisters unfortunately dying their hair in weird types of dye of colors i saw one of my mahram relatives dyeing her hair in purple and the following week she dyed it in a weird color that was i don't know dark blue or was it like um between red and brown so ugly and they also put you know uh uh nail polish that is black or dark brown and they are imitating the kuffar the muslims don't have this stuff in their lives so a muslim must avoid standing out in a crowd with such colors and allah knows i think foreign"
