  "transcript": "sh if my period yellow discharge lasts for over 15 days do I have to make up the Salah for all the days above my normal cycle I can recall that there was a time when I used to take bath on the eighth day but I don't remember if I used to do it correctly at that time perhaps later maybe I got my period for different number of days and now I feel the discharge sometimes it lasts over 15 days although it does get lighter towards the 15 day do I have to wait 16 days and see if the discharge lasts 16 day too to fall back on my normal cycle or can I take my bath after 15 days and start praying I read a fatan okay uh I got your question so basically speaking the women's mensis is marked by the flow of the blood and this is derived from the or origin of the word when we say so when there is the flow of the blood this counts as the women's mensis when does it end it ends when the bleeding stops and she sees her Purity and the Purity is identified by either seeing the white uh thread like discharge or by the total dryness now if neither of these two are visible in this case Scholars say that the discharge that follows the Menses would be considered part of the mensis due to the Hadith of mother may Allah be pleased with her when women used to send her their pads with brownish or yellowish discharge and she says do not hasten do not be Hasty wait be patient until you see the white white thread like discharge and also the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her when she says at the time of the Prophet Alam we women folk did not consider the yellowish or brownish discharge as menis if it was seen after Purity so it has to be identified that the woman is pure now the Dilemma is what happens if the yellowish discharge remains with her almost most of the month not only for 14 15 days if it stays after the bleeding stops for five six days this is understandable it's part of the Menses what if it stays after the seven days of mensis and goes on to another 20 days in this case no we consider this to be and we tell such a individual that as long as your period was fixed all your life for seven or eight days known when to begin when to end and then this prolonged yellowish discharge has occurred upon you in this case you to take when the bleeding stops and you know that this is the time where your menis is over and you consider yourself through the rest of the month as a woman in meaning that you clean yourself uh uh wash yourself and perform W after the aan enters and this is for every and each Salat and Allah Knows Best"
