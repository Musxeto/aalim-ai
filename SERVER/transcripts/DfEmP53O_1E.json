  "transcript": "my question is she regarding um so if a person he breaks an oath he pays the um he he has to feed 10 people right and pay the fidya um I paid it before and then um I didn't I didn't pay it fully cuz I I just searched up the um like the average money cost to pay a me and then I paid it then but then I found that the fidia price is actually £50 so £5 per person so um but there was another time sh which I paid the um I paid for an oath which I done but that oath was um when I when I was like a child so I didn't have to pay that o so that that money that I spent that time I had the intention to pay for my oath so can that money um go to fill up the the one that I broke my with first of all the experation of breaking an oath is to choose between one of three either to free a slave which is not applicable nowadays or to feed or clothe 10 poor Muslims and if a person is unable financially to do any of the previously mentioned three he has to too fast 3 days now the Hadith or the Ayah specifically States on feeding which means if you give 5 pounds to a poor Muslim or 50 for 10 poor Muslims that would not suffice and would not expediate your broken oath because you have to actually feed them by buying them food and giving it to them giving them cash is not sufficient if you authorize a charity organization on your behalf to buy food and feed these Muslims that is also sufficient so you state that this is5 PS per person buy food and feed the poor and they committed to that this is valid what you have expediated in the past for an oath you thought you needed to expediate is gone if you made Oaths while you were a child and did not reach the age of puberty this does not oblige you to expediate because you were not accountable at the time so the money that you have given is gone for charity but it cannot fill in the gap of nowadays um broken Oaths and Allah knows rest"
