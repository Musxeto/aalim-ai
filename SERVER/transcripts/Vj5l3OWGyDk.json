  "transcript": "so when I was praying maybe uh and I was at the second I stood up forgot the second T and when my back was almost straight I sat back down uh when I sat back down before I set I'm not really sure I'm doubtful whether my back was 180Â° like Lally straight or uh 75 or degrees or a bit more I'm doubtful uh and when I sat down uh and I sat don't to do the t is my Salah valid and usually when does the zoom meeting start if you knew that you're not allowed to go back from the second Rak to the T the first T because standing up for the third Rak is a pillar and going back and leaving this pillar to a mandatory act which is the first tah invalidates your prayer if you knew the ruling and you did it deliberately your prayer is invalid if you were confused did not know we're ignorant of the ruling then your prayer is valid but don't do it again"
