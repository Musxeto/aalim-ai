  "transcript": "alhamd I was honored to speak in front of you tonight and I was asked to make it as short as possible and I will inshallah um the topic is about the importance of knowledge and our religion as stated in Tamil language but I don't understand it but I I presume that it was about the first thing that Allah ordered his Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam with was to recite to read so in our religion has great value on knowledge on reciting on reading on anything that increases your knowledge but is it an open thing Islam encourages knowledge and this is without doubt Allah says Allah would exalt Allah would Elevate the status of those who believe among you and those who have knowledge so those who have knowledge are not similar to others our Prophet if you go from the beginning to the end of the Quran what did Allah ordered him to ask of increasement what did he tell him to ask Allah for and to increase him in in health in wealth in power the only thing that Allah ordered the prophet to ask Allah to increase him in was [Music] knowledge so knowledge has a great status in Islam to the extent that the prophet said Those whom Allah wants good for them Allah would grant them the comprehension the understanding in Dean now reverse this Those whom Allah does not want well for them he would make them ignorant in Dean and this is a very important aspect to look when you acquire knowledge do I have phds and master degrees and all of these things in Islamic Studies or or in other studies what is the level of my Islamic knowledge one would always look at this Hadith and appreciate the gift of knowledge our Prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam says whoever follows a path to seek knowledge Allah will make easy for him the path to paradise and I believe that the brothers and sisters who graduate they would say thumbs up Allah has made these three years easy for us and alhamdulillah we've gained knowledge and it's it's just like this so many times when you begin something there are so many hurdles in front of you especially if you want to go to University ah it's too long it's too expensive it's too far I have so many things to do and whenever someone asks me to do something I always use this justification I have so many things to do and this is a fact but you have to prioritize now after they have finished their program they would say what people say when they break their fast The Thirst has been gone I broke my fast and my veins have been moisted by the food and the drink but the reward has been settled alhamdulillah we've achieved and the same thing that we do whenever we accomplish something Allah would make easy for him the path to Paradise the prophet goes on to say sallallah alaihi wasallam and whenever you hear his name offer Salat if you love him and if you want to be with him on the day of judgment Allah Muhammad he says that the angels beat their wings in approval of the Seeker of of knowledge and those who are in the heavens and on the earth pray for forgiveness for the Seeker of knowledge even the fish in the water Subhan Allah the whole universe worships Allah and Allah created the whole universe to worship him yet everything in this universe works for your favor if you are with Allah even the fish they seek forgiveness for you you if you seek the proper knowledge and the prophet says the superiority of the scholar over the worshipper you find people pray 10 Hours night prayer fast every day or alternate day and they have long bees short stes and these are all good attributes of a Muslim but they don't have knowledge and the prophet tells us that superiority of a scholar of those who are worshippers is like or similar to the superiority of the Moon over all other Heavenly Bodies if you go out now it's a clear sky look at how bright the Moon is and look how small and Tiny these Stars far away are the scholars are the heires of the prophet he says the scholars are the heires they will inherit the prophets of Allah asael for the prophets did not leave behind dinar or Durham rather they left behind knowledge so whoever gains knowledge has gained great good fortune and Allah has limited the true fear of Allah in those who have knowledge verily that those who fear Allah most among his servants and slaves are those who have knowledge and the simple question would come Define knowledge is Newton a person of knowledge is Einstein a person of knowledge knowledge is divided into three types Islamic knowledge which is what Allah means when he speaks about knowledge in the Quran and also what the prophet means when he speaks about knowledge in the Sunnah Islamic knowledge such as the knowledge of the Quran the knowledge of the T the knowledge of thei the knowledge of the foundations of the knowledge of itself the the knowledge of Arabic language all these things combined lead to Allah so these are recommended in Islam and these are the sciences that you are rewarded when you're studying providing that you're sincere and you're doing it for the sake of Allah even if you're not sincere what even if you're not sincere if you study the Quran and the Sunnah you will be rewarded once you change your intention the scholars of the salaf used to say we have sought we have sought knowledge not for the sake of Allah but Allah made us and forced us to make it for his sake so you begin in the beginning for a job for people to appraise you but somewhere down the line Allah will make you change your intention and make it clearly for him because you're studying the Quran and the Sunnah you no hypocrite would study Quran and Sunnah and remain hypocrite except if he's a good hypocrite well I don't I cannot imagine people memorizing the Quran and studying it and yet still do not fear Allah or do not comply with the Quran and with the Sunnah so this is the first type of knowledge the second type of knowledge know is permissible knowledge which people study in schools mathematics chemistry physics uh languages all of these are permissible you're not sinful if you study them as long as they do not go against Islam and you're not rewarded if you study them unless you have the intention to serve Islam and the Muslims so if I'm a medical school uh a medical student what am I doing it for well the best thing that pays nowadays so if is permissible go ahead no problem but if I'm doing it to help the Muslims and I've seen so many great doctors here in in in India who do this for the sake of Allah they treat poor people for nothing now this is something that Allah would definitely reward them and this permissible knowledge becomes a form of worship getting closer to Allah the third type of knowledge is the forbidden knowledge something that the said I seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that doesn't benefit me so give an example what is this theater I think it's from music and arts and huh so if someone says I want to make my ba or PhD in music in drums or in guitars on so what is this this is Haram so but this is knowledge you get a degree for that this is Forbidden Knowledge one who works in astrology what sign are you and the the signs themselves are Haram people who work in and and read the uh uh Zodiacs and want to know and and it's very stupid people say what Zodiac are you I said I'm a bull and I says I'm a scorpion the prophet ordered us to kill scorpions and to kill snakes why you're a scorpion so people and they don't know that even if you read it for fun if you are just want to know what's H going to happen to me tomorrow if you read it for fun 40 days of your prayer will not be accepted and one says okay if it's not accepted I'm not going to pray no problem you don't pray you become kafir you have to pray but you'll not be rewarded and if you read believing in it says oh it says tomorrow you'll have an accident tomorrow I'm not going I'll sign sick then you become a cafir because you believe that other than Allah knows the knows the Unseen so this is part of the knowledge that is Haram for you to learn now we agree that the knowledge that benefits you is the knowledge of Islam of the Quran of the Sunnah and those who are graduating today alhamdulillah or uh uh we're celebrating their graduation they have not attained a thing yet it's only the tip of an iceberg because three years is nothing academically or even islamically you are still uh on your legs and hands you're still an infant you did not walk yet and the biggest problem with Islamic Studies if your intention is not good this is the biggest problem if you don't walk the talk so I preach well but if I don't practice I'll be the first to be thrown into hell thei of Abu Muslim the prophet tells us that the first three to be thrown into hell are aari a person who gives in uh uh charity and a person who died fighting the cause of Allah they're the first to be thrown into hell the the knowledgeable person Allah would show him his favors and blessings and then said what did you do he said I've learned the Quran and I taught it for your sake I've learned the knowledge and I've taught it for your sake and Allah says tells him you are a liar you did this so that people would say oh he's knowledgeable take him and throw him in hell so a True Believer or let let me rephrase that a true scholar a true person of knowledge is not the one who has a degree stating that this is from an Islamic College it is a person who acts upon his knowledge verily that those who fear Allah most from his slaves are those with knowledge so your fear of Allah proves that you are knowledgeable and that that is why when the prophet Alat was challenged by one of the Hypocrites he said he was angry I am the most knowledgeable upon you and the most fearful of Allah it goes side by sides knowledge with fear of Allah therefore if you find someone who claims to be a student of knowledge but he's arrogant he thinks that he's better than everyone else he is rude he's not generous he is not kind if you find him abusing his wife or children if you find him disconnecting his uh uh kinship and not connecting to them if he find if you find him using obscene word or profanity if you find him not kind to his neighbors Muslims and non-muslims alike and if you don't find him praying in the Masjid or he doesn't fast voluntary days Mondays and Thursdays if he doesn't have night prayer time if he doesn't finish the Quran at least once a month from cover to cover if you find someone who claims to be knowledgeable and does not walk the talk know that he is not knowledgeable and he is in great danger usn z may Allah be pleased with him and with his father tells us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that there would be a man on the day of judgment in Hell whose guts would come out and he would go around it like the donkey that operates a a water mill or something like that and the people would come to him and say hey in the Dunya you used to tell us to do good and to stay away from Haram you would you used to command us to do uh uh uh virtues and right ous things and forbid us from doing Vice and evil things he said yes I used to order you to do good things but I would not do them and I used to forbid you from doing bad things but I used to do them so this is what he will be punished by or with on the day of judgment it is a very important thing but this is a celebration huh we're supposed to give them Glad Tidings and inshallah yeah you've graduated inshallah it's not a Time time of threatening you but those who love you would tell you what benefits you we can all Sugar coate and say mashallah now you are becoming Scholars no you're not with this degree you have a long long way to go and the least you have to look into learning and perfecting Arabic and you'll find that most of your teachers per are are perfect in Arabic so once you that level maybe you can and not not only that this degree should make you more humble it should make you more uh uh submissive it should make you know the reality of your knowledge not to make you arrogant and think that I know you don't know this is a big problem and this is what Allah taught his Prophet MSA peace be upon him he was once speaking and he was asked by the congregation who is the most knowledgeable person on Earth what did he say I am the most knowledgeable person on Earth Allah taught him not to say this and told him there is someone who's more knowledgeable and he asked him ordered him to travel to Al and you know the story inah Al finally whatever we know whatever you and I know this is only from Allah's favor Upon Us Allah has chosen us and Allah has taught us Allah says in the Quran Allah has extracted you from the wombs of your mothers while you did not know a thing remember how old you are you are now if you're like me like half a century old remember half a century ago when I was born mashallah I was fluent in Arabic little English and I knew you the books of tar and zaka which I will deliver tomorrow inshallah no we all were born with zero knowledge who made us who we are oh myself oh my my strength oh my family my wealth no whatever made you what you are today is Allah so you attribute every single favor every single blessing of Allah to the one who gave it to you so whenever you think that you know or you would like to look down at those who are lesser in knowledge of you always be warned that if you do this Allah May deprive you from this knowledge Allah is the one who gave you the knowledge so act upon it and with this I seek Allah's forgiveness for myself and for you"
