  "transcript": "oh God Bless America and we are welcoming you in lessons in Phil brother what is the book that we're studying as just a reminder and brother Noor do you remember who compiled this book who wrote it I remember uh very very good even and we are studying which Which chapter brother Mustafa Purity well we were that's the big times of Salah yes the times of Salat and Hadith number 138 inshallah will be read by Brother Muhammad narrated the Twilight is the redness okay now the Hadith is itself is not authentic nevertheless we have learned through the previous programs that Maghrib prayer is marked by Abu Malik smart by the sunset okay it extends to extends to Sunset is gone totally until night breaks in well the sunset does not go the redness of the Twilight disappears so this Hadith tells us that the Twilight is the redness and this is true though the Hadith is not authentic Maghrib prayer ends when Aisha prayer starts and Russia prayer starts by The Disappearance of the redness in the West in the direction of West which is the Twilight Hadith number 139 narrated Allah's Messengers said that Dawn is of two types the dawn in which eating is forbidden for the fasting person and prayer is permitted and the dawn in which prayer is forbidden meaning the morning prayer and eating is permitted and Hiking reported something similar to the above Hadith from jebber and added to the type of dawn in which eating is forbidden it is spread widely in the Horizon and to the other type it has the shape of a wolf's tail okay now the prophet is telling us that there are two types of dawn and they may confuse a person he but before we go on to explain these two tribes I think it's relevant that we say for us it's difficult to see Dawn why is that double Malik because the UC don't they didn't have electricity and the new lights of technology that we have these days so they were able to you know distinguish between all the different lights that's completely true we live in cities and with all the electricity and light we have it it makes it almost impossible to distinguish whether it's night or the break of dawn you cannot tell that but if you if you're in the open if you're Outdoors if you're away uh from your city or Village or whatever and you look into the direction of East you can see that clearly because it you have only Darkness you have only night that there are two types of dawn one is called the lying Dawn it's not the truthful one and one is the truthful Dawn which is the one we should uh look for so the prophet says that the first one which eating is forbidden for the fasting person and the prayer is permitted and this is the truthful Dawn fasting becomes forbidden the minute the the actual Dawn breaks fast and faster fasting becomes obligatory and uh you have to fast and prayer is due it's okay for you to pray this is the truthful and actual Dawn previous to that about half an hour or an hour earlier there is the lying Dawn Dawn does not lie but this one it camouflages itself and you are confused and you think it is done and the prophet sallallahu told us that it looks like the tale of a wolf how would the tale of a wolf look like have you ever seen wolves usually their tails are erect so the prophet says that the actual Dawn goes horizontal the lying Dawn the one that is not true goes vertical and the vertical one comes like half an hour to an hour before the actual Dawn you just see that there's a strip of light horizontally from the ground to the to the to the sky so if you see this the prophet tells you don't pay any attention to it you may still eat if you want to fast the following day and you may not pray morning prayer because it's not time yet but the minute the actual Dawn breaks and you can see that on the top of of mountains or Hills you can see the light because if it's completely dark towards the east when the when Dawn breaks you start to begin you start to see the light on the top of the mountains and hills and it's horizontal then this is the time where it's forbidden for you to eat or drink if you're fasting and this is the time for you to perform your Fajr prayer so I hope that this is understood now though it's not our subject but remember that in Ramadan the the fasting month for Muslims we have to advance for Fajr one of them is quite earlier than the other and the the the first one is not to indicate that it's time for prayer because if you pray your prayer is not accepted it's just a reminder that within half an hour or an hour Dawn will break and you have to stop and refrain from eating and drinking so if you want to do it you can do it now so it's just a warning message like this uh not actual Dawn that comes vertical we move on to Hadith of IBN Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father Hadith 139 read that one did we yeah 140 now okay uh then 140. Allah's Messengers one of the best Deeds is to offer Salat meaning prayer in his early time now this Hadith has different virgins one of the versions that and and this is used to ask the prophet Allah to clarify things and that is why he was one of the knowledgeable Companions of the Prophet they're all knowledgeable but he you know stands out in the crowd because he used to ask a lot and that is why once the prophet died that is he said to his friends and Associates and companions that I have taken 70 plus surahs from the mouth of the Prophet Allah I've heard it myself and this comprises almost two-thirds of the Holy Quran he didn't hear it from someone else he took it straight from the prophet sallallahu alaihi because he used to accompany him at all times so he asked the prophet what are the best Deeds that Allah would like and this gives us an indication that a Muslim should prioritize his actions you should set out your priorities because you don't want to do something and puts effort into it and find out that there were other things that were much better and easier to do and I'll give you an example if you know that prayer is very nice and acceptable in Islam and it's you're rewarded to it especially prayer but at the same time the prophet said foreign during the month of Ramadan is equivalent to pilgrimage with me with him so the reward is magnified you come all the way you travel to Makkah you reach and you find the people at the last 10 days or 10 nights of Ramadan praying and and you immediately go and make tawaf and sorry for your umrah while people are praying now this guy has done something that is great which is umrah the reward is magnificent which is equal to a pilgrimage with the prophet Allah nevertheless he has left out something he has abandoned something that is far greater due to the fact that the actual time will go now if you don't pray with the congregation you will miss the reward but if you pray with the congregation and perform umrah afterwards you've done both so a lot of people take up things that are less in reward without prioritizing things you have to set up your priorities for another example it's time to pray congregational prayer Mahari prayer and a person says well I'd like to visit my uncle this is he is a relative and I have to visit him because this is obligatory and he goes and he skips Mahari prayer now he did something good but he left out something that was better so we should set out our priorities did the same he went to the prophet and he told him that what are the best Deeds at the side of Allah so that I can choose from them you know if you tell me that they are the top ten one to ten it's logical that I would not start with 10 I'd start with number one and go downwards accordingly so the prophet said the best thing is to pray at at the Early times of prayer in another virgin reported by Muslim Muslim the prophet said is to pray on time now on time means from the very beginning till the very last so you have a large or a big interval which may span up to two to three hours but this specific Hadith it says that the best thing is to pray on the early time of the prayer as the prophet sallallahu said to offer Salat in its early time which means that immediately after the call for prayer has been called and we said before that this applies with Fajr this applies with aser this applies with Maghrib as for lohar prayer in summer it's preferable that you delay it as for Asia prayer it depends on those who are with you if you delay it then alhamdulillah it's it's good because they are tolerant and they want to follow the Sunnah if they have any objection to that then pray it at the very beginning we have a short break we'll be right back inshallah Islam is a comprehensive way of life it deals with everything wanted to empower people and he wanted them to feel the responsibility not just to rely on the state The Companions and in particular in the beginning they were not pleased and they were not proud to become the Khalifa these days we see the candidates running it has to provide all inhabitants with the basic needs it has to fulfill their basic needs foundations of the Islamic state is to establish justice foreign the following Hadith is to be read by Brother Noor narrated by Abu Maduro May one be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the earlier's time of the prayer is what pleases Allah the mid time is for the mercy of Allah and the letters is what Allah has reported something similar narrated by IBN Umar may I will be pleased with him without mentioning without mentioning the mid time okay the Hadith is not authentic so there is no need to elaborate on it whatever you pray the earliest is the preferred prayer as we mentioned before the break so I think we should go on and move to Hadith number 142. narrated by abnormal may Allah be pleased with them Allah's messenger said there is no Salat meaning the voluntary prayer after the break of dawn except detain meaning the Sunnah and another narration Abdul razak also narrated there is no Salat meaning the voluntary prayer after the break of dawn except the two Sunnah okay this Hadith comes in line with times of Salah it tells us when it's not a recommendable when it's forbidden for us to pray now you recall that we've said and mentioned earlier that there are two rakas before Fajr prayer now this Hadith tells us that between the Azan and the ekama the prophet says that you must not pray except two rakas for Fajr and it's called in Arabic and this Sunnah the prophet salallahu would not skip it whether he's traveling or in his city in in Medina he would not ever leave this Sunnah even if he had he would sit and pray it sitting down if he was tired and he said these two rakas are they are the Sunnah not the obligatory prayer these surakas are better than the whole world they are better than the whole world that we live on so if someone were to give you the whole world as a gift or as a a cost for you not to pray this to the prophet says no the turakas are more important and these are the Sunnah so you should compare and ask yourself what about the obligatory prayer was about the original Fajr prayer if this is the case with the Sunnah so how would we classify in regard uh the obligator prayer coming back to the Hadith the Hadith is clear if you prayed the turakas then you should not pray anything else oh of course accept those that there is a need for so this means that Mustafa if you pray to raka's home and you go to the Masjid should you sit or pray you should pray you should pray but if you do not pray home and go to the Masjid and pray the Fajr Sunnah the turakas can I stand up and pray again for the Masjid the salute of the Masjid no it's not it's not possible and it is reported that said may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the companions of the companions of the prophet he once saw a man coming to the Masjid and before I finish this was one of the scholars of Islam one of the great Scholars of the Islam he had only one generation between him and the prophet Allah so Those whom he have seen were the companions of the Prophet Allah and we have a name for such people Fadi we call them so we have Companions sahaba and whoever saw them is called tabain so a tabiri is a person who saw a companion of the prophet and a companion is a person who saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam talks about himself and he says that I have prayed 40 years in Medina and I've never seen the backside of any person which meant that he had prayed 40 whole years five prayers every single day in the first row he never prayed in the second row and he never skipped one single prayer so he was one of the great Scholars of Islam I know a lot of people that have prayed 40 years without seeing at the back of people because they're praying home they don't pray in the mosque and and this is a shame unfortunate and unfortunate was in the mosque once and he saw this man coming in after Adan al-fajr after the Fajr the call for Fajr and just before the prayer itself and he started praying to rakaz and salaam surakash and offering salaam to rakazam so say grab this boy and said uh nephew of mine you know the elders always call those who are young nephews and the young always called those who are old uncles and this is a type of respect in Islam that we should always try to uh bear in mind because in Islam it is a must that you respect the elderlies even if he was a janitor even if he was a servant or whatever he is older than you are you have to respect him and if a person is younger than you are you have to have mercy on him you have to be kind on him and you could do the math you know you have to be kind to those who are older than you respectful to those who are older than you and you have to be kind to those who are younger than you to the young ones and this means that the community will be filled with love and care so say again goes to his this man who's praying and says hey nephew of mine don't do this because the prophet salallahu said that you may only pray to rakas after the adhan so the guy didn't like this and a lot of us don't like advice a lot of us went being given advice would get this feeling of arrogance and what do you know and and why are you telling me that I made a mistake I don't like people pointing out that I make mistakes I don't make mistakes so the guy had the same feeling and said to say oh Uncle do you think that Allah will punish me because I pray for him and look at this logic now Saeed is not telling him don't pray because I don't want you to pray he's telling him don't pray because the prophet said do not pray except so the man is arguing this and he's saying well do you think that Allah will punish me because I pray for him our answer would be definitely not so say it's answered in this manner he said nephew my son Allah will not punish you because you pray for him Allah will punish you because you are not following the Sunnah he's not he will punish you because you are not obeying the order and the instructions of the prophet and this logic is Twisted because a lot of people come and say I want to pray after we tell them it's forbidden the prophet said this time is forbidden he said well I'm praying for him do you think he's going to punish me it's the same logic people go and you know mix with females they're not allowed to do this they're mixed with the uh the opposite uh gender the opposite sex and the talk and they mingle and probably they would teach them some Hadith and and verses of the Quran and we tell them that this is not allowed so they say do you think that Allah will punish me I'm teaching them Islam he said Allah will not punish you because you're teaching them Islam Allah will punish you for shaking hands with the opposite sex which is completely forbidden Allah will punish you for looking at them and not lowering your gaze Allah will punish you for the this disobeying his instructions so one should always keep in mind that whatever you do you should be following the instructions of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the following Hadith narrated by um may Allah be pleased with her Allah's messenger came to my house after offering prayer and offered to rakat then I asked him about that and he replied I was cut busy and failed to pray the Tucson after prayer so I offered them now I asked him should we offer them if we miss them he replied no this Hadith is a controversial one because though it is authentic that the prophet salallahu used to pray these two rakas after aser and in some versions with her said that he frequently did this and in this Hadith um is asking the prophet Allah is it possible that we prayed the prophet said no and the scholars of Hadith have different opinion on him saying no some of them say that the Hadith is authentic then this is the verdict it's not possible and others say no it's not authentic so they are referring to it as a Sunnah and that is why we are at the fork of the road some Scholars say you may pray after aser if you've skipped other Scholars say no you may not pray after because it's a time of uh it's forbidden for us to pray during this time so what is the authentic verdict of all what appears to me that staying away from it refraining from it is on the to be on the safe side because we do not know if this is permissible only for the prophet Allah or it's a general permission the Hadith if we considered it to be authentic where the um asks the prophet Allah if it's authentic then it's the evidence that it is forbidden for us to pray after even if we missed or skipped sunnat but if it's not authentic and we join this Hadith with the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her then it indicates that it's okay to repeat or to pray the Sunnah which is recommended which has a cause it's not you know open voluntary prayer there is it's a recommended prayer and it has a cause then it's okay to pray it in my point of view the best and safest way is to refrain from praying after Asa because if you do then you are in accordance to the Sunnah and at the same time you have the ability you have the possibility of praying it after Maghrib after Aisha you can make it up any other time with the exception of this time where you are forbidden to pray so I believe that this is the the best of all opinions that one could apply and insha Allah you have all the day and night left for you to pray those as soon as that you have skipped I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah until we meet next time oh oh my God"
