  "title": "Ustad told Friday Khutbah must only be in Arabic Any other language is haram, TRUE? #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so is it a valid belief that the Friday J must be delivered exclusively in Arabic my has informed me that conducting it in any other language is considered Haram citing the historical practice during the time of our Prophet sallallah alai wasallam when individuals from diverse regions who didn't understand Arabic attended Juma prayers the was still delivered in Arabic so is it accurate to regard the translation of theba into other languages as a mere modern day phenomenon brother safe alhamdulillah we Muslims have logic so in addition to following the Quran and the Sunnah we have proper logic now you look into what your usas says that during the time of the Prophet Alam so many people were there who could not understand Arabic seriously what did they have Google Translation who how did they communicate this is bogus totally not true if there was one in a thousand that would be an exaggeration one in a 10,000 maybe everybody spoke Arabic and those who did not speak Arabic were either bantian Christians or Persians from uh uh Persia and Iran but no one that was bilingual or someone who came from the subcontinent was there and could not understand this is totally bogus secondly in countries like Europe and in continents like Europe or in countries like uh Australia Canada the us when the vast majority don't understand Arabic what's the point in giving a which is not Quran which is not the Salat that is 100% must be in Arabic what's the point in giving two hbas in Arabic where the only person who can understand is me I'm the I'm the IM and the rest don't know what I'm talking about whether I'm putting a a forecast of what's going to happen between the Lakers and uh um whoever in the NBA or what nobody knows what I'm talking about so it doesn't make any sense the call it's yes it is an issue of dispute in schools of thought but the most authentic opinion that goes with the Quran and the Sunnah and with the proper logic that as long as in the itself you praise Allah you offer salutation upon the prophet you say the and you recite one Ayah in Arabic then the whole thing is in English or in uru or in whatever language you're speaking then this is valid with the grace of Allah Jan"
