  "transcript": "um if a famous trustworthy scholar is being labeled by other treasury scholars as misguided how should we layman deal with it well this is an easy question if you trust either one of them you should follow the one you trust in their verdicts in their teachings but not in their labelings why i to some i'm considered to be a famous scholar hypothetically and there is another person in another country who is considered to be also labeled as a famous scholar but there is beef between us and i don't like him he doesn't like me this is what counterparts usually have and the scholars from long time ago used to say do not accept what peers say against one another so maybe i don't like what he says or criticize some of what he says due to jealousy due to hidden agenda i don't know maybe but if this particular individual was labeled by so many trustworthy scholars who are as famous or maybe more famous and more knowledgeable and this so called famous scholar was controversial everybody knows that he has flipped and change to the dark side in this case you have to do your due diligence and figure it out but if only me against him and everybody else is idle in the same i don't know what's wrong both of them are good this is peer talk and it's a form of competition and rivalry that you should ignore never jump on the boat because you trust me if i speak against someone and you say yes shahasa said that this person is deviant don't take my word for it because i might have a hidden agenda and you cannot face allah azzawajal on the day of judgment when he asks you why did you slander this diary or this shaykh or this and you say because shaykh asam did no this does not give you any justification or a legitimate reason to do so if that person is controversial and all say that he's deviant then you should take their word for it if not then if he's trustworthy and you think that his teachings are fine you have to choose between us and if you think that i'm more trustworthy than him or more knowledge will follow me with all due respect to the other guy don't slander him don't speak ill about him and don't learn from him and allah knows best"
