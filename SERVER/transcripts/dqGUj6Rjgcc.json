  "transcript": "so I'm the law from Canada says is Allah capable of changing the destiny of a person on the night of other lailatul patter the question itself is inappropriate to ask because Allah social is capable of doing whatever he wills first of all but maybe it was inappropriately framed or formed secondly the issue of Aadhaar is a very important issue to know it is Allah's knowledge now you and I don't know what Allah's prescribed for us so when someone says how is it possible that making do I change the cutter so you're objecting as if you know that my mother was to die today and I made dua Allah prolonged my father is that true you can't tell you don't know whether I'm going to die today as preordained or after 10 years so how dare you question the change of other when you actually don't know it so Dora is part of your destiny and dua has the power to change Qatar which you do not know so don't think over things that are way above your pay grade trust Allah believe in Qatar which is Allah's knowledge and that it was preordained fifty thousand years before Allah created the universe acknowledge this fact and you will feel happier and more content everything can happen but I don't know what's gonna happen five minutes from now well actually I know because the episode this time is over but no seriously speaking I don't know if I'm gonna have an accident if I'm gonna reach home well if I'm gonna die if I'm gonna fall and break a leg no one knows so thinking and overthinking of these matters would corrupt your life have trust in Allah believe in whatever happens it was with the destiny and preordainments allah azza wajal"
