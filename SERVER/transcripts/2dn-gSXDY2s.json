  "transcript": "this is Shannon Smith man over him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik Delilah mean nabina muhammad in wasabi I'm a bad wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and we begin our class on the explanation of the Thera that 'soon and we stopped i think yesterday at the second part of the testimony which is Shahada - anna muhammadan abdullah al assad oh no the proof does define that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah is his saying verily there has come to you a messenger from amongst yourselves it grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty he is anxious over you to be guided and he is full of kindness and mercy towards the believers Allah my Allah my Allah Muhammad these are the last ayahs of what of Surat October Raja Akuma pursue Fujiko Mazda Sonali he met Theresa Nariko Mannino for him and this ayah some people consider it to be part of the eighth car of the morning in the evening and the hadith in this regard is not authentic but it proves that the prophet alayhi salatu salam is a messenger of allah among so many many many other evidences and this is the and part of the Shahadah which your Aslam cannot be valid without so if a person says I believe even Allah in his attributes in his lordship and worship to hate but I don't believe in Mohammed Ali Saleh to sinner we say that you are a kafir because the Prophet said adding his salat wa salam by the one who's my soul is in his hand no Jew or Christian who would hear about me and not believe and follow me except he will enter hell Hellfire so this hadith is crystal clear without the belief in the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you cannot be a Muslim and you can never enter Jannah for those who had heard of the Prophet or a sorcerer but what does the testimony wash hadu Ana Muhammadan Rasul Allah what does it mean to testify that prophet alehissallaam is the Messenger of Allah it includes that you obey him in whatever he orders and refrain from whatever he prohibits to do and to be believed in whatever he tells you about and to worship Allah by none except of what he had showed us to do so in Arabic it rhymes nicely which is a you para fema among what and usually never Manohar and who was judge oh well you're better in lobby measure are so this is believing in the prophet Isaiah also what the sniper who FEMA a bar so high - who FEMA Mr Weston abou Manahan who was a sure what are - who FEMA out of sleep over FEMA Akbar Allah with Allah illa bima Shara to obey him to stay away from what he had prohibited to believe in whatever he told you whatever he tells you any things of the unseen of the rahib of the hereafter of the torment in the grave we believe all of this without seeing it and this is the highest level of belief and this is why abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was named as acid depot the one who believes because when the Prophet I did sir I'm told the idol worshippers that he overnight in couple of hours went to Jerusalem and offered prayer as any man for all the messengers and prophets of Allah then he ascended to the seventh heaven and he spoke to Allah and he spoke to the messengers and he saw heaven and hell then he went back in couple of hours time so they went to a broker and they said to him didn't you here what your friend has just claimed he clue you that mean such a thing such a claims yes I believe him that allah is revealing to him for an don't you want me to believe that he goes to the heavens and comes comes back in kabbalah the Prophet as some without involving your sick logic without involving what you think is right without any evidence of proof and you reject or Anderson just because of your whims and desires no you have to believe in whatever he orders and to stay away from whatever hippo hippo habits he tells you don't do that you just simply don't without saying but everybody else is doing it share there are scholars who do that you you cannot worship Allah says it except with what the Prophet Isis them had told you and instructed you to do okay know the meaning of testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah is obeying him in what he has commanded believing him in what he has informed us of avoiding what he forbade and want against and not worshiping Allah except by what he has prescribed the proof now this this this of course not worshiping Allah except with what he has prescribed is something that all Muslims accept very logical who doesn't accept this the innovators those who have the tariqa those who have follower I could be a very very rich man I have many followers if I tell them to do things and I tell them to do them without asking questions just follow me blindly and believe in me I'm the Sheikh I make myself glow in front of them to take their money to take power over them to have influence over them now when someone stands up and says share please but this is not from the Quran and the Sunnah isn't that a beta Lee and shout at this person are you a kafir don't you believe don't you believe in me I know everything you will not reach the profit Alice Aslam except through me even when you make dua to Allah you have to imagine me and by imagining me I will convey your dua to the prophetess and I'm like a mirror and the professor would reflect your dua that came through me to the allah azza wajal and people will say Allahu Akbar Allah Subhan Allah what is this you guys are nuts you crazy this is a stab you have no no one to intermediate to be into an intermediate between you and Allah knowing to mediate he's evil scholars it's don't want you to classify what they're doing as innovation don't want you to worship Allah with what the Prophet had brought erase autosum because this would take the carpet from underneath their feet this is extremely important that you memorize this brothers and sisters it says to obey Allah to obey the Prophet is awesome in all what he ordered believe him in all that he informed refrain from all that which he prohibited and Allah is not to be worshipped except through what he sallallahu anyone who Selim legislated this is extremely important for you to carry this throughout your life and to cross-examine every way every step of your life am i fulfilling the testimony of ash hadu ana muhammadan rasulullah because those who oh and wait reduce new things those who swirl and make liquor and they move strangely and a like aerobics exercise and they claim that they are worshiping Allah they're not worshiping Allah because it's a worshipping Allah with other than the teachings of the Prophet I still at Sarah yes sir the evidence nam the proof of prayers at art and expression of the heat is fun Allah saying and they were out this is now this is moving to pillar number two and three you remember we have five pillars of Islam the testimony a shadow Allah illa allah muhammad abdul rasul we finish this now we come to pillar two and three which is salat and the cat where is this coming from the ship doesn't bring anything from his own pocket it's all in the Quran in the Sunnah yes the way they and they were not commanded except that they should worship Allah making the religion that is worship so liquor him alone and that he should perform the prayer and give this a cut and that is the right religion so all what they were ordered to do one is to have to hate Europe prayer and yours the can't without to heed is without any benefit it has no value you were ordered to worship Allah and Express sincerity and to offer prayer and to give zakat and this is the rightful religion this is the correct religion so these are the same second then the third pillar of Islam okay now the proof of fasting is Allah saying o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you just as it was prescribed fertility for you in order that you may acquire took dutifulness to Allah and the proof for Hajj is Alassane and the hajj pilgrimage so this is the this is wait wait wait wait wait wait wait okay so the this is the fourth pillar of Islam which is fasting which we are enjoying at the moment with the grace of allah so widget' and fasting as is the ayah clearly states is not something new in a las religions rather it was prescribed upon us as it was prescribed upon the previous religion so all religions had fasting as part of their religion but it differed from religion to the other and the reason of fasting is not that Allah enjoys seeing us suffer being hungry or thirsty rather this way of fast they would they the level of piety of takua so that we become pious and every Muslim notices this even if you are not a practicing Muslim I hear a lot of the youth coming to me and say sure well I don't know what it is but subhanAllah during fasting I don't listen to music I don't watch haram even at night time in Ramadan I am ashamed of doing it but afterwards it would all go back to normal so fasting has an impact on your piety it increases your righteousness the fear of allah azza wajal so this is why allah prescribed fasting so that it would get gets you it will get you out of addiction addiction of what addiction of halal drinking and eating which is hell on we're addicted to it every day by default at one o'clock or two o'clock p.m. we have to have lunch my mrs. cooks presents the lunch and I eat like a robot why I'm not hungry she said but I cooked so okay better safe than sorry I'll eat but when I travel a lot of the times I don't eat lunch I don't feel like eating lunch so this addiction to halal Allah is reconditioning us to abandon even had an addiction which is food and drinks let alone Haram so those who smoke and say I can't leave smoking liar you can if you fear Allah properly you can because when you're fast you don't smoke and this is a good 15 to 16 hours so you can't continue doing that if you anticipate that allah azzawajal is watching you not only when you're fasting also when you are breaking your fast so fasting would ensure that you reach the level of taqwa and the fifth pillar is touch and the proof is Allah - and the Hajj pilgrimage to the house of the kaaba is a duty that mankind owes to Allah for those who are able to do it and whoever disbelieves by denying Hajj then indeed Allah is not in need of any of his creation so the Hajj is well known ritual and a pillar of Islam it is do once in a lifetime providing that the person is capable physically and financially and if it is a female then she has to be capable physically and financially third condition which is habit a male muharram accompanying her without these conditions has is not mandatory nor obligatory until the conditions are fulfilled now we move to the second level of Islam now we want to learn about our religion we said it's knowing Islam Eman and SN Islam we've gone through that so now we come to the second level yes siree ma'am yeah the level of amen amen consists of more than seventy branches the highest of them is leader high in the law and the lowers of them is moving a handsome object from the road and higher modesty is a branch of amen if this was this was a hadith by the Prophet Elisha and EEMA and Bill Brown what's a burnisher bath it is 70 plus branches levels now these levels the highest of them is la ilaha illaallah and the lowest of them is removing harmful things from people's way thorns broken glass rocks something that is smelly and offensive so you do this for the sake of helping others this is part of Amman and bashfulness or shyness is a branch of Eman as the Prophet had said a little strap however we know that there are six pillars of Eman as the author will come and speak about so how can we reconcile are there six pillars or seven Baba or branches scholars say no these are two different things the fundamental belief has six pillars that all things revolve around in Islam which is to believe in Allah to believe in the angels and the messengers in the books in the day of judgment and in predestiny with a good or bad these are fixed six principles pillars as for the 70 plus branches these are acts of Eman which people do or say because what is Eman linguistically you know that every terminology is defined linguistically and legislatively so Eman linguistically means so just the concept of opposite of to falsify or to say you're a liar when you believe you say Ammon do you believe but legislatively it is not sufficient to believe it is the belief this is definition Hemans definition it is the belief of the heart the saying of the tongue and the action of your limbs so if someone says sure I'm a believer I'm a Muslim I believe in Allah and the messenger Allah is salat wa salam and i do believe in the day of judgment I believe in the angels in the scriptures and the prophets and the messengers and the predestiny he says but I don't want to say that I don't want to confess and testify well why I have my reasons okay don't want to pray and I don't want to fast and I don't want practice anything of Islam but I am a believer I'm a Muslim it's in my heart said nothing this doesn't work like this Eman is actual belief there is accompanied by rhetoric and by actions if you don't have this then your Eman is an intact so when we come to the branches of Eman what we mean by the 70 plus branches is that if you manage to collect all of them you're a full-fledged movement you remove my phone for extra he means the whole nine yards but I keep on abusing my neighbor I'm not a full-fledged movement I'm a movement but there are discrepancies there are shortcomings I'm not fully a believer so these must have all of this combined in order to gain the title proudly of being a believer yes I named it's nothing our six the first one is that you believe in a love the second is his angels the third his books the fourth is his messengers the fifth last day and six that you believe in other divine decree the good of it and the body of it okay so these are the what the six pillars of Eman and if we were to talk about them extensively it really ages so in short but not with any being so brief that we would not give it its due right believing it a la what the first pillar of Eman is to believe in Allah scholars say to believe in Allah Azza WA JAL you have to have four things one to believe in a large existence claim to not believe believing in Allah Azza WA JAL is something that's natural all people were created believe in Allah so the pizza his salat WA Salam mam in ma luden Allah well you little fella no child is born except he's born upon the fitra which is monotheism the belief in Allah is there was else oneness the Prophet says his father or his parents make him a Jew a Christian or an idol worshipper so it's the environment that sure Muslims are people in general are born Muslims believing in Allah as oneness by logic if you just open your eyes and look around you you will find that this universe is perfectly made don't listen to infidels and idiots who ignore the elephant in the room they don't see the elephant in the room they say why do we have volcanoes why do we have floodings and hurricanes why do we have earthquakes this shows you that nothing is perfect and they ignored everything else they ignore how allah azzawajal is so kind we are in a room and we can see the light imagine if the light was turned off like this we will be totally in the dark and we can't even move on in hit the chair at war until we can find our ways out and the opposite is true imagine if we are in a dark room sitting there and all of a sudden hundred spotlights are turned on we will be blinded unable to see imagine the earth how subhanAllah when it's daytime and it's time for night how the Sun goes slowly slowly slowly until it disappears and becomes dark our eyes are accustomed to the lack of light we could see and when the Sun rises after a long dark night it rises bit by bit so our eyes won't be harmed by it and you tell me there's no perfection the whole world cannot make one single I take well I can't take off with look at my eye can America Russia Cuba Europe combined make and manufacture an eye that I can see with definitely not don't be fooled by the camera as they do they these cameras don't see this is what an organ is and can see which is a miracle by itself who created it I did know I didn't my father did know was it created by itself yes how can vacuum create itself how can something that does not exist create something that exists how many eyes are there on the planet Earth seven billion human beings multiplied by two there is our fourth T iliyan eyes how many eyes are in the making in the wounds of pregnant women maybe three more billions or two more billions that's a lot how many eyes are there for all these animals on earth lions elephants rabbits dogs cats how many eyes for these birds flying in there billions how many eyes the fish and the sea creatures have how many eyes insects in the trillions have and you tell me this perfection was created by nothing with all due respect to you crazy so when you come to talk about a la nature cateura tells you there is one God logic in Utley if I come and I sunshine with swimming pools with tennis courts with squash courts with everything you want and desire in it colors are beautiful air-conditioning is perfect the heating system is one of a kind a beautiful kitchen everything is set even electronically when you come into the room it senses your identity and it sprays a perfume that you already registered to like so it knows the people coming through bluetooth and when I tell you that mashallah this mansion was found we don't know who build it we don't know who owns it yesterday wasn't here now boom it's there you would say you're crazy this is not possible there has to be an engineer there has to be a contractor who did this and executed this and built this and an architecture electrical engineer civil engineer all of these had to work on this beautiful house no one even the atheists would say that yeah I could have been built by itself so logic tells you that Allah exists and the Scriptures tell you that Allah exists if you read in any of the divine or the scriptures of religions whether Christianity Judaism Islam Old Testament New Testament all what they say is that Allah is one analyze the Creator lies the provider Allah is the giver of life in there Allah is the owner of the whole universe and all of these leave no doubt in our hearts that alike so on you have to believe in the existence of Allah - you have to believe in the rubia of Allah known as the Haida lordship the lordship no heat so you have to believe that Allah owns creates sustains and provides for all what he had created and no one can provide and give life and take take it except him subhana WA Ta'ala with his orders with his instructions thirdly though he did Allah here so what's the difference between Ruby and order here rubia is acknowledging Allah Azza WA JAL by his attributes and actions he's the owner he's the Creator is the provider and sustainer he is the one who owns everything and gives life and takes it who he is worshipping Allah with our actions devoted to him we cannot divert or change any form of worship other than to Allah so to him we pray and fast and perform Hajj and give zakat to him we fear make duaa we hope we're it's a cliff seek refuge and all the things that we mentioned before in our previous classes these are this is the hidden Hulu here and fourthly toe-heel Asma it was the fact that we have to in order to believe in allah azza wajal as part of the six pillars of a man that we have to acknowledge in know Allah through his beautiful names and attributes without Distortion and without taking the meaning out of it and make it idle without any meaning without misinterpreting it so no no it is like what you said but it needs something else and without giving it a form so a las hands are like this out of allah they say chemically a shape there's nothing like to him well who has semi I'll go see and he is all-hearing all seeing we know that Allah is all-hearing but when we come to explain hearing in our human capacity we say hearing is when the sound moves through the airwaves and it comes to our ear loops and we hear it Allah hearing is not like that subhanAllah yes but Allah hears sure yeah but he doesn't he'd like you and me Allah said true which is it's not like yours and mine this is the biggest problem with those who don't have knowledge and art Eden when we say the leg or the arm of an elephant the arm of an ant the arm of a gorilla and the arm of a human being putting them together would anyone say that these arms are the same definitely not the name is the same but the nature is different and Allah has the highest example no one is unlike a larger so you have to believe in these four things part of belief ring in Allah the all-mighty we have the Angels shall we talk about the Angels now or postpone it late for the I think we can add many questions yes we have questions so she repost so we stop here we can just take the engines okay we will postpone the angels I have like two pages angels only so I think yeah we will postpone that to a later maybe tomorrow let's move let's fix for tomorrow Oh Brahimi masha'Allah - were like Allah treason yella matter she's a young guy he's he's much younger than me and more handsome it's okay Hollis then we will leave it until next Friday if will it be shown your questions please numb the first question here is when you get to the Hadees of recording interest based transaction bin Haram I asked an imam and he said that the Hadid is a reference to a recording so recording eats at the time when the transaction actually have actually is happening between the two parties and not merely person account entries is this true I didn't understand the question at all he is I didn't get what the questioner they were strange so I think it's going to talk about the hadith that talks about interest based transaction if you witness it and other person also witness it at the same time and okay let's write it would you be responsible yeah what does the SEC say he asks someone what did this someone said about this hadith they you will be held responsible no but this is with all due respect yeah any if the Prophet tells me and is also in an authentic hadith in the so here LAN Allah who Akeelah Reba may Allah is the one who diva ours Reba one more Killa who may Allah curse the one who gives it what cat and the one who registers it washer Heda he and the two people witnessing this transaction Huma home Fulani Sawa they're all sharing the same curse if this is what the Prophet says to me in plain Anna Bukh I have translated it in plain English would you as a Muslim have the audacity to go and say oh sure so-and-so stairs this doesn't apply seriously circle ahead in this case I don't have to pray to Allah Carthage ER and wake up at five o'clock or four o'clock this is too early because the Prophet when he told me to pray fetcher this doesn't apply and I don't have to give zakat two percent that's a lot of money man what is this taxation but the Prophet said that is a sense I don't have to do that so I don't know either the question was not posted correctly and my understanding to it was wrong or a hey you have a serious problem in Amman for accepting such an a person to reject the hadith of the Prophet as a sauna says no no he is not sinful it's not cursed for that so correct me if I am wrong and communicate with brother Nasir to explain yourself again Allah knows best Shalom then the next question is Allah access to further Quran and the teachings and saying of the professor Laura was synonym which is a hadith as a path of guidance then why acid in teens practice if it wasn't stated you I again did not understand the question can you put it in what the question is trying to say evil access to food the Quran addition of muhammad sallahu i will send them why do we also follow some statement perhaps like the spin of the scholars and it makes of it why don't we just stick to the quran anderson because you do not possess the necessary tools to allow you to take directly from the quran and the sunnah so you have to be first of all an arab you have to understand arabic language then you have to have a decent amount of knowledge in the quran in the authentic sunnah and what the previous three favorite generations had said about that particular issue imagine if i am an arab and i opened the Mushaf the quran and it is verily those who commit a sin and the their sin surrounds them they will abide in hell forever I come to this ayah says woe so I am sinful because I smoke and yes this sin surrounds me this means I'm going to help forever this means gaffur and he takes this ayah neglecting all the other ayahs that governs it all the hadith that explain it wouldn't that be going astray definitely yes so and I'll give you this final story a man once who has a farm and there's the stream of water passing through his farm and going to his neighbor's farm as well so his neighbors his neighbor always watches his farm and crops from the stream that is coming through one day his neighbor put a dam and prevented water from going to his neighbor so he complained neighbor I need water to water my crops he said no I'm not gonna do that anymore why he said I heard the hadith of the Prophet as I'm prohibiting this the neighbor had no choice but to complain to the judge so he went to the judge and he said look what my neighbor is doing to me my water my crops are getting dry and we're thirsty so the judge summons the neighbor and says why did you prevent your water from going to your neighbor as usual he says because I read the hadith last night the Prophet say analysis is not for a man to water his neighbor's crops so I started to follow this and I'm a Muslim and I'm a practicing Muslim so the judge looked at him and said I don't know what to be amazed of most your compliance all your ignorance the hadith and the judge is explaining the hadith was said in a metaphorical way and because you're ignorant him you don't know the circumstances applying it at value is wrong this hadith was said when the Muslims won in a battle concubines and slave women and as it is known in all religion jeans or all cultures and that concubines can be slept with so the Prophet said to them are is awesome it is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and the Day of Judgment to water someone's else crops meaning that you must not approach these women until you ensure that they're not pregnant from their previous relationships boyfriends or husbands because then you will be putting your own water related to semen and giving it to someone else crops meaning pregnancy so this farmer understood it twisted lee because he has no knowledge so you my friend would be like this without proper knowledge in Arabic and not only Arabic that farmers and Arab as well without proper knowledge of the Quran as a whole and of the Sunnah as a whole in order for you to understand that there is nothing else in the Quran and the Sunnah governing your understanding and making it wrong without this this is not applicable and Allah knows best mashaallah said the next question is Aslam o alaikum is it permissible for a woman to freely dispose how well except with the permission of her husband and a woman does use her own world without the passion about one husband a woman in Islam is an individual who has full access to her own wealth no one has troll over what she does with her own money so if she inherited a million dollars from her husband and she wants to build a Masjid or she wants to open a school and her husband opposes her he has no right to do that if she inherited a hundred million dollars I'm available but seriously speaking no he has no right in controlling her money he has the right in controlling what he gives her as money for the house so I give my wife a thousand dollars every six months to buy groceries and meat and food only for the house she takes some of the money and gives it to her father I'm not happy with that this is not permissible for her she takes some of the money and buys makeup this is not permissible this is specific between for groceries you as a wife don't have any right to control but if she works with the permission of the husband you and he tells her at the end of them card I'd like what I want or give me access to your bank account or put your jewel it's jewelry in my safe deposit Bank I can do whatever I want with it this is none of his rights and she is not obliged at all to listen to him to obey Him and I would always always always advise sisters to have their own separate financial transactions isolated from the husband if you wanna a true happy marriage my wife does not know how much I make I've been married for the past 36 years of havilah she never knew what's my salary or how much savings I have or how much debts I have I don't know how much she possesses in her own bank account or ha how much her Julie and this is the best way to maintain a happy life I've seen so many problems coming from man and wife putting their money in a joint venture account or in a joint account only after 15 20 years the woman is shocked to see the man building another house or getting married to a second wife with her money don't do that and Allah knows best my shoulder I think does have one question the next question is about under this lockdown we've been praying at from the Juma prayer we are tending my family and we do the tumor presence we attend I answered this before and I said the most authentic opinion of the majority of scholars is that jun-hwan means to gather from eg team our Jamaat Jumma someone the purpose of eight is to create in congregation so if this is not applicable in message due to the illegal armor the Muslim ruler stating that this is not permissible yet due to his own HT had due to the information is getting from his medical advisors and this is what he thinks is the best we as Muslims are obliged to obey Him and to pray for her in our homes it's been almost seven weeks now 7g ones that I haven't prayed in the message it and I have been the Imam giving hot buzz every single week for the past 32 years with the grace of Allah so to come in times like Rama by which for all of us to give dower to call people to Allah remind them of Allah the month of repentance a month of mercy and being unable to do that it hurts but we have to comply and we have to be patient and we have to acknowledge that this is a mercy from Allah so although we fail to see that but we acknowledge and know for certain that it is part of Allah's mercy upon us and insha Allah when Allah wills things will go back to normal and we will reflect upon these time names and remember always all's great NEMA blessing and favours upon us so that we try to hold on to it so that it won't leave us again as in the past my show not America let his AK Alaska reshape hope to see you next week he shall bid nil ahead of allahö island when his virtually eliminated yes them was allah
