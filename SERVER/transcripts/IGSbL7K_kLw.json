  "transcript": "okay first of all such problems often happen in marriages now I don't know of couples who don't have skirmishes arguments this is the black pepper and and salt huh but when it comes spicy and you put lots of Curry and jalapeno no this is May spoil it so it is one of the biggest mistakes of the man or the woman to go and complain to their parents this is utter stupidity if my wife does something and I am angry agitated I go to my mom mom my wife did this and did that and I didn't eat last night I I I went on an empty stomach how would my mother feel horrible as if I stabbed her in the heart the following day me and my wife we kiss and make up so I come to my mom embracing my wife W this woman I love her she's going to pull her hair she's the best person I've ever met in my life and we've been married for 41 years alhamdulillah but is she Allah I love her mom is my mom going to forgive her 10 years she will always remember that day when I came frustrated and hungry because of what she done even if she was the best woman on Earth because of my stupidity a what stays what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas never ever take out your dirty laundry and show it to the people especially your parents now unfortunately the mistake has taken place the consequences her parents came took her forcefully snatched her out of the husband's house your parents her parents are crazy what do you want we want divorce why because he's not treating our uh daughter uh correctly and this and that he's no no respecting us but you have they have three children and even though we do okay the man comes to me what do I do Sheikh if I was impulsive I say divorce her alhamdulillah this is from Allah get married to someone younger much much more beautiful and much much more religious and she's richer and she's an orphan she doesn't have a father and a mother and if she's deaf dumb mute Allah that would be win-win but I I don't do this usually and I'm WI you know I'm a counselor you know I solve people's problems so I would say try your level best to go apologize to the parents uh bring your family because breaking a house breaking a marriage is not easy and the problems resulting for the children for the families is ongoing to 20 30 years why come back down from your Ivory Tower and try to solve things but what the parents had done is definitely 100% wrong and Haram and sinful they're sinful for that at the sight of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
