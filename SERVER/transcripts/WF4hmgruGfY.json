  "transcript": "Moyes does a man's children sisters parents or any family members have to pay for his sins in this world we hear this statement a lot that if you do something bad your offspring would suffer in this world due to your sins this question is quite confusing and mixed first of all the general understanding is that a person does not carry the burden of others well at a zero wasiatun wa surura a sin does not result in others carrying the burden and the sins who are not related to it a person is accountable only for his own sins or the sins that resulted from his own sin so a person who throws a party with Haram music free mixing booze involved he will carry all the sins of those attending his party because their sins is a result of his original sin which is throwing the party in the first place but when we come to the concept in where is question which is revolving around a father who did something wrong to his neighbor's who embezzled who received bribes who stole money now people the concept would be that Allah would punish him through his children so he will see the impact of his sins on his children is it true or false this is something that we cannot judge because allah azza wajal predestined things with wisdom and knowledge that we may not understand so in the good side a father who is righteous practicing and pious would find that Allah protects his children due to his righteousness as in Surat al-kahf when musa peace be upon him came to the village and they asked them for food and they rejected there was a wall about to fall and al Hodder erected it and fixed it and he justified this by saying that it belonged to two orphans their father was a righteous practicing man some interpreters of the Quran of the tafseer said that their father is referring to their seventh grandfather so Allah is protecting all of his lineage and this and an offspring till the seventh generation either way in good we have no problem in that now in evil maybe your evil you've done bad things what bad did your children do to be punished or tormented the answer is we don't know so maybe a person does evil in his life and allah azza wajal tests him with a child with special need or with illnesses or with poverty now this tournament is not the result of the doing of the children and it might be the result of their father's punishment or sins but they're not being punished the children are being tested and this is for a better good that we don't know no off so it is wrong to say ah look because he was a crook allah azza wajal granted him a child with special needs or his child was bedridden for a long time or his child was a blinded or whatever this is wrong because we cannot say that this is the judgment of Allah so gel and the torment of Allah because of his sin maybe it's something else so we cannot say that but at the same time there is a big possibility that it is part of his torment for his evil deeds and for his sins this is part of but not the only reason for that and Allah Allah knows best"
