  "transcript": "has a question similar to question number nine or actually number 10 munir says often I remember death and I feel very afraid I dream that I have died and I wake up very scared now the fear is a human characteristic every single person has to be afraid you have to fear so no I'm a Muslim I trust Allah I depend on Allah and I rely on Allah once you see a cobra or a lion charging at you let's see your dependence on Allah definitely we all depend on Allah but there is natural fear that has nothing to do with shik or associating others with Allah if I'm in my room and nobody's with me and I'm afraid to read a letter or open a book or uh uh think of something because I'm afraid that the authorities may put me behind bars or or some Tyrant would uh uh torture me this fear relates to shik because I'm feeding someone who does not have the ability to judge my feelings yet my fear is far greater than the fear of Allah Asel but natural fear if your house is on fire you can't stay in your bedroom and say I I will make VI and inshallah it will be extinguished no you have to run and you have to fear this is natural so fearing death is natural now what is not natural is the consequences so if there is fear in you this might be positive and this might be negative if it drives you to stay away from sins if it drives you to pray on time in the Masjid to fast Ramadan to offer voluntary deeds and forms of worship fearing Allah loving what he hasel hoping for Paradise then this is a positive fear because it prevents you from doing what angers Allah but if the fear turns into an obsession in the sense that it makes you depressed all the time and it makes you hopeless in Allah's forgiveness and mercy and it ends up by you saying if this is the case then Allah would throw me in hell and there is no use for me to pray or ask for forgiveness and you leave all forms of worship this is negative fear and it is Haram for you to do this thing now going back to ha's question it's the same thing fearing the punishment of the Grave this happens to all of us we have to fear the punishment of the grave and this is why we do not backbite we do not uh take people's uh uh chitchatting to others where where they are harmed by it when they hear it we do not do things that qualify people to be punished in the grave so what to do if you have something that you fear and you want a Dua a supplication there is one great Surah that the prophet told usam that whoever recites it when going to bed it is composed of 30 Ayah if you recite it every night when you go to bed Allah Asel will exempt you from the punishment or the torment of the grave and that isah mul all the children in Arabia memorize it by heart it's very easy you can do that in less than four or five days 30 verses only three Z also in every Salat before we conclude the Salah we say the supplication which the prophet Alam ordered us to recite before Salam and that is oh Allah I seek refuge in you from the Hellfire the torment of the Hellfire and from the torment of the Grave so you're seeking Allah's forgiveness and refuge from such trials and whenever you seek refuge in Allah Asel Allah will give you what you seek so if you do these two things inshallah you have nothing to fear khad"
