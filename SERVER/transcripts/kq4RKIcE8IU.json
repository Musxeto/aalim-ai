  "transcript": "we know as muslims that allah has preserved the quran how can we prove it to the non-muslims first of all we don't have to a lot of the muslims devote a lot of their time giving dawah to non-muslims and go out of their way and spend much time to give dawah to non-muslims which is a good thing but we have priorities there are so many muslims who need your dawah you yourself need to learn about islam properly rather than to memorize one or two verses and give da'wah to the non-muslims and just bank on such knowledge no you need more than that to get closer to allah azza so in the beginning we don't need to prove anything to anyone we need to educate ourselves and the other muslims about the beautiful religion nevertheless what more evidence do you need to prove to them that this quran is preserved other than there are no other copies look at the bible how many virgins of the bible do you have or do they have hundreds and thousands revite standard virgin new revised sided virgin kim james version the do we virgin the this and that hundreds and thousands of different versions that they update change certain words according to their liking every couple of years quran is one you go to indonesia all the way back to america passing by morocco syria saudi arabia it's the same quran even if we were to burn every single copy of it the following day more than a hundred million person who memorized the quran would sit down and write it to the exact same dot how is that possible because allah has pledged to preserve it and it's preserved in the chests of people not only written form everyone memorizes it a seven or eight year old child while reciting in my masjid and leading the prayer if i make a mistake he corrects me and he's behind me and no one's called him everybody praises him and say masha allah barakallahu very good excellent because he helped in preserving the quran which i made a mistake in there's no problem in that other than the scientific miracles in it the linguistic the social the economic etc the quran is was and will be there preserved unchanged not a single letter it's been there for 15 centuries show me one scripture that is preserved in its original language in its original form unchanged you will not be able to do that"
