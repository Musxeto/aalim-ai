  "title": "What to do if one forgets to say dua between the two prostrations (Rabbigh firli) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he's given an example if i forgot to say between two prostrations so this was not in the prostration this was in the position between the two prostrations not saying the dua is an issue of dispute because saying rabbi firli some scholars say it's others say it's mandatory i am inclined to say it's mandatory so if you forgot to say it this means that you've dropped a mandatory act which requires that you offer two prostrational forgetfulness before salaam after offering to salutation upon the prophet and finish your dua before you conclude your prayer with salaam you offer to the sahu and allah"
