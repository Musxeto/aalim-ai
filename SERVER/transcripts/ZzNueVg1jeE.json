  "title": "Attending non muslim relative wedding, uploading kinship (slaughter sheep for them)? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so basically what happened was um so I had this um conversation with my brother so um my third cousin back from where we originally cut the word up where we are originally from is a cafe so I was having a wedding so obviously my dad still lives back home they were um they all went to the wedding so prior to going to the wedding that's one of my uncle which is a practicing Muslim alhamdulillah to slaughter a sheep for them so they can give the guests at the party so my uncle refused on 100 basis why would it be facilitating such marriage because they're both Cafe those people getting married so my uncle refused but at the end he slaughtered the ship for the um for the um for the wedding I was saying to my Prophet that my uncle shouldn't have because he's facilitating a wedding that is not permissible which of course the cafe but my brother said no that is upholding the king I mean times of kinship so at the end of the day it all matters is his own intention so what do you think about that shake okay first of all we have to look into the whole picture and not do small details number one it is not permissible for a Muslim to attend the rituals of marriage of funerals of things related to their religion for non-muslims whether there kinship whether their cousins whether they're brothers and sisters it is not permissible so the marriage rituals which conducts the marriage contract whether it's in a church or in a temple this is not permissible for me to attend after this is conducted if they are throwing a wedding party in a hotel this is a party there's no problem in attending it providing there is no Haram things for me as a Muslim to witness such as free mixing music dancing consumption of Haram food or drinks so hypothetically if there's a cafe wedding in a hotel there's no booze there's no free mixing men are segregated from women there's no problem in me attending at all no music nothing Haram and there's no problem in me offering them even a meat slaughtered meat or a meal or a chip in some of the expenses if I wish as a gift there's no problem in that inshallah so the concept of slaughtering a sheep and offering it to the guests or to The Newlywed couples is permissible as long as it's not related to the marriage rituals that are related to their religion so I hope this makes some sense insha Allah"
