  "transcript": "ah him alhamdulillah allah wa sallim wa barik an idea what a soothing in a bi muhammad in why dad he was a ph main I'm about cinematic mortal nahi over a Kato now what we say to hate what do we mean by no heat the heat is derived from the word one so when you say the verb wada meaning that he made things into one and though heat is the belief in the oneness of allah azza wajal so first of all the belief in the existence of allah which every human being know and every creature on earth believes of such a thing then you have the three divisions of the heat and these three divisions are to heat a robo be the lordship toe heel toe heat and hulu here the worship tohey and then you have the heated asthma was safe at the toe heat of allah's beautiful names and attributes all of these three types are combined in a verse of the Quran Allah Azza WA JAL says Lord of the heavens and the earth so this is toe heat or who bubi when you acknowledge that Allah Azza WA JAL is the owners the Creator is a facilitator this is part of the Lord ship though he Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them so worship Him alone and be consistent and patient in his worship this is though he that eloheem that the head of worship Allah then on goes on to say do you know of any who is similar to him and this is a towhead of Aurasma was the fat now the three types are very easy to believe in the towhead of lordship and this is to worship allah azza wajal to believe that allah azza wajal is his let me rephrase that to acknowledge allah azza wajal with his actions subhanaw taala so you believe that he's the creator he is the owner of everything we have we see and we do not see and that is he is the facilitator of things Allah Allah says indeed your Lord your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days Allah Azza WA JAL tells us that he's a creator no one argues this can you find someone saying oh hey wait I'm also a creator Allah is a supreme creator you may create something and make a toy or a prototype but this is not creation this is assembling creation is to make something out of nothing so this is the actual and true creation Allah goes on to say o mankind remember the grace of Allah upon you is there any creator other than Allah who provides for you from the sky and the earth the answer is no so this is Allah's creation to everything we see and finally Allah Azza WA JAL says and to Allah belongs the Dominion of the heavens and the earth and Allah has power over all things so Allah is the owner alonzo gel is the creator allah subhanaw taala is the provider as he says say in whose hand is the sovereignty of everything and he protects all while against whom there is no protector if you know so allah azza wajal is the one who protects the one who owns allah azza wajal also is the provider we could not have anything on earth we could not have anything in the heavens without him providing this to us see we take things for granted I have taken a deep breath inhaling it now once I exhale it no one else can bring it back to me except Allah so watching I myself cannot even prevent from myself from this action a lot almighty says say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing in sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who disposes the affairs subhanahu wa'ta'ala it is Allah who raised his people and he puts people down it is Allah who honors people and he humiliates them as well it is allah azza wajal who gives nation's wealth and who deprives others from such wealth the health and illness is in Allah's hands subhana Allah all is given with wisdom and this type of tow heat which is the lordship no heat no hidden rubia there there was no great dispute among the humans since the time of Adam no one ever claimed to be the provider the facilitator the Creator the giver of life and death nobody dare to do so that is except one or two people who said this out of arrogance not out of true belief and they give the example of an emerald who was debating with Ibrahim and he said that I give the life and take it away he brought two prisoners or didn't want to be executed he saw he said see I've killed him I took life of him and the other one he ordered him to be executed but then they start he stopped them and he said I gave him life and also Pharaoh who said I am your Lord the high and we know what happened to him other than that there are no known examples of those who say that they themselves are allah the creator of the heavens and the earth so this brings us to the end of this episode about the heat of lordship illegal Amandla assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
