  "title": "The story of Al Najashi (Negus) King of Abyssiniya - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "wow subhanallah so you have this what is historically documented you have her Achilles you have him like you are bringing to our attention that the he put all the Christians together they got to hear some of the Quran they're crying weeping uh they recognize this as the truth but they didn't accept because that power like now what are you going to do you're going to just live for Prestige power you're going to live for just the things of this world are you going to accept the truth but with the truth there come sometimes consequences right people rebelling like they were going to do against him uh but then you have other examples you know uh you gave this example the Persian but then there was also others Christians who also accepted like the Christian king of abyssinia so this is another example of a Christian can you talk about who now he also was someone who was just who was fair someone who later did he accept Islam well this was way way back in the beginning in the early times of Islam the lectures to the to the uh um to the Persian Emperor to the Emperor of Bahrain which is an eastern part of of Saudi Arabia the emperor of the byzantians the king of coptics of Egypt and to the Abyssinian ruler these were on the ninth year of Hijra which is uh 22 years after the Revelation started that was about two years before the death of the Prophet is if I'm not mistaken so it's almost when people came to accept Islam Etc this is when it was sent and it might have been uh let me recollect no no I was wrong I was wrong sorry I apologize um you don't have to edit this but this just to show how poor I am and how mistakes I made this was way back because when it came to the Brazilian Emperor Abu Sofia was at the time of the truce between the Muslims and the this the mushri king and this was before the conquest of Mecca so this was before between year six and year eight of Hijra this is when it took place now the Abyssinian King you're talking about his name was he he was Christian at the time he was Christian but this incident took place 12 13 years ago meaning that when the Muslims were prosecuted in Mecca before they migrated to Medina they were so finding it difficult to live to the extent that the prophet assams told them listen Allah has made way out for you you may migrate to abyssinia which means that you have to get on boats cross the Red Sea go to a foreign land with a different language and nowadays if you're a frequently flyer and you have uh um access to different airlines and hotels no problem you just can't send me an invitation to Kuala Lumpur and I'll come within eight to ten hours that time it was like the difference between life and death for for bedouins to go on ships and cross the sea not knowing how to swim to a foreign land whoa so they went there now the thing is that the prophet told them so go there because there is a king people will not be oppressed under his reign and that is one mind-blowing fact because for a a a man who was illiterate who did not read and they didn't have any Fox News or CNN at the time yet he knew who the rulers of countries around him and how they dealt with their people this shows you that the amount of knowledge a prophet had Isis about what was going on so he said to them go to him so they went and they asked permission to live in his country and the the najashi the Abyssinian King allowed them to after some time the idol worshipers of quraish of the enemies of Islam did not like this so they sent two men to try to persuade the king to send them back these men and one of them was very pleased with him who was a cafe at the time they went with lots of gifts so they gave all the close ones to the king particular gifts watches jewelries golden pants money so they bought the court of the king and then they went to the king and said to him we have a problem with our our locals who came to you their Renegades and they um say bad things about our gods and Idols so we would like you to send them back with us we will deal with them all those around the king says yeah yeah they know their people send them back with them we don't need strangers and definitely we're not going to build a wall or like Trump's wall so send them back so he said no they came they chose my hospitality and Country how can I return them back do this yes ask them what they say about Jesus because they say something that is extremely wild and inappropriate being a Christian he said okay I have to hear what he they say about him so he gathered them their spokesman was the cousin of the prophet of course the brother of Ali so he was the spokesman who came in and gave his speech and he said I will read you verses from Al-Quran and he read the verses from the Quran portraying the miraculous birth of Jesus Christ and what had happened with his mother by the time he ended reciting the Quran tears was filling up the face of a najashi and even his monks and Priests and he said to them is nothing more than what they have recited Jesus yeah Jesus Christ this is when the monks and Priests started to become angry because it says that Jesus had no father and there was no male intervention rather it was the Archangel jibril who planted his soul in the womb of mother Mary they did not like this and the Abyssinian King was unlike the uh Hercules he ordered them up and said that this is the truth and nothing else is the truth they conceded it and he told them do whatever you want you are free to worship Allah in my life"
