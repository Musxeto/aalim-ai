  "transcript": "[Music] consequences of leaving fast is it just like leaving Salah will it lead to go for now this is quite important as Muslims we follow a particular r√°pida and why is that because our prophet told us Ali salatu salam that my nation will be divided into 73 sects all of them are in hell except one so they said which one is it or prophet of allah the prophet said whoever follows my footsteps and the footsteps of the companions this is the saved sect which I claim as well as you do that we are insha Allah among them and how do we know that we are among them by following the Quran and the Sunnah nobody's else footsteps we're following whatever we do you ask me you question me you stop me in the middle of the street if you can and I'll answer your questions they share how do you prove that the Prophet did what you're doing and I'll show it to you from the Quran and from the Sunnah other sects can't do that you tell you tell them why do you do this he says Simon says you have to obey but Allah did not order me to follow and obey Simon Allah ordered me to obey the Prophet erase a lot of serum going back to our question what does this have to do with fasting Ramadan if a person does not fast Ramadan is he a kafir first of all do not play with fire otherwise you're gonna burn yourself those who play the TEC fear game so look at me I'm wearing the saudi table and this red Shamal we call it i look like a  if i keep on looking at people and classifying them hmm this guy's clothes are below his ankle is a kafir this guy fornicates with women he's a kafir this guy consumes intoxicants it's a major sin he's in hell he's a kafir this is the treats of the huarache Allah did not send me as a judge I'm gonna be questioned about my own actions and beliefs not about others so why would I engage and give in takfeer to people not that it is not part of its LOM it is part of Islam but not to every Tom Dick and Harry this is something that is given and appointed to scholars of Islam after fulfilling the conditions this individual he's a kafir did you make sure that the conditions are fulfilled did you interview him did you interrogate him are you sure that there are no obstacles available in him that prevents us from labeling mass cafard no I did it but he did so and so he's a kafir you're wrong the Prophet says are they so some whoever says to his brother ya kafir one of them is gonna pick it up either he is truly a kafir it's gonna stick to him if he's not it's gonna deflect and come back at me and I'll be described as a kafir this is a serious offense so coming back to our question the person who does not fast Ramadan is he a kafir Alisoun Mathew aljahmeir and this is very important and this was mentioned in el happy that it haha we which is a big book that speaks about our Ikeda and it says how he says and we do not label anyone as a kafir for doing something unless he makes it Helen we do not make our label anyone kafir due to a sin he committed unless we say that he he says or believes that it is halal now this statement also has been explained by many scholars before in a nutshell I'm not gonna take you into details because as I say the devil is in the details the devil does not have the guts to come and discuss these things with us because it gets us closer to Allah so it's just a matter for now a hearse anata wa l-jama'a believe that no sin takes you out of the fold of Islam unless it is sheer cork offer or salat O'Shay why are you excluding salat I did not exclude salat it's the prophet alayhi salatu salam who stated that between man and shark or co for is abandoning salat whoever abandons salat is a kafir he has committed over this is the prophets hadith it's authentic I'm not going to go there because our series are about fasting this is what I believe you can always watch the great debate that took place four years or five years ago in Birmingham Green Lane Masjid between the Honorable Sheikh Abu Amina Bilal Philips and my self we discussed this whether he is a kafir or not and you can judge for yourself beautiful debate beautiful manners of my great beloved brother Amina and it was enjoyable the weather was fine check it out so I'm not gonna talk about salat I'm not gonna talk about everything else if I consume intoxicants is it Hara Hara no I'm I know it's Haram but I like partying I like to drink booze I'm sinful I'm committing a major sin I'm still Muslim okay what about the pillars of Islam if I don't give zakat money Amaya Carr or not what is my intention is my intention that zakat is not mandatory no I agree it's a pillar of Islam but I'm stingy I don't feel like giving zakat I'm committing one of the most heinous and major sins in Islam but I'm still a Muslim do I go further I think you got my point what about fasting share my cousin doesn't fasts a single day in Ramadan come why don't you fast Amidon is it a pillar of Islam suggests I acknowledge but I'm lazy I don't wanna fast you are committing a major and serious sin that we probably throw you in hell for a hundred years no no how long it's all in Allah's hand maybe Allah so Jill doesn't punish you but you're not a kafir you're still a Muslim but in great danger so to answer the question consequences of living fast is it just like living Salah will it lead to cover the answer is no it would not need to cover until you believe and I'll give you another example of the person who likes to drink booze so he drinks booze it is pre-recorded it's not Ramadan so this is pre-recorded don't think um this is not life I'm not with you in Ramadan this time you're watching this I'm in home Jeddah fasting with my kids so someone who drinks booze and he acknowledges that it is Haram and it's a major sin is he a kafir no he's a Muslim Allah so Jill may punish him and may forgive him no one has control over that it except Allah Rajan a person who never put a single drop of intoxicants in his mouth but he believes that wine is not Haram he is a full-fledged kafir because of his belief not because of his action he did not drink a drop in his life but because he believes that it is not Haram though Allah has mentioned this in black and white and we show him the evidences from the Quran and from the Sunda we fulfilled the conditions upon him and we know that he has no obstacles in this case the guy has become an apostate so this is a very important and big difference between the two when a person makes a sin believing in it and when a person believes that the sin is not sinful and he refuses to acknowledge it and Allah social knows best yet this leads us to a 1 million Kuwaiti dinar questioned dollars is underrated quasi dinar is high so a person who does not pray should he fast you are not the judge what do you mean okay don't judge people and say listen you don't pray you're a kafir hence you should not fast what would he do so a life I'm a cafe and I'm already in hell might as well leave fasting no this is not your role your role is a diary your role is to make people love goodness and abstain and refrain from evil and bad things so if a person doesn't pray yet he fasts he might fast because if he his belief in Allah he might fasts because of the society in those around him as a culture it's not your business bank on it and utilize it use these positive feelings in him and ask him to start to pray at least our way you invite him to pray a prayer in the message once every blue at least tell him that a Las forgiveness is there and if he succeeds in maintaining prayer that allah azza wajal would love him more and more [Music] [Applause]"
