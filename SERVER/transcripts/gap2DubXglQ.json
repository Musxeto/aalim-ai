  "title": "Lessons in Fiqh 07-Touching the private parts",
  "transcript": "oh [Music] alhamd welcome to lessons in we're still studying the chapter that deals with nullification of w ab olution and uh the following Hadith is to be read read by Brother Muhammad narrated a man said I touched my penis or he said does a man who touch his penis during the prayer should perform ablution the prophet sallallah Al wasallam replied no it's only a part of your body okay and uh it's it's very relevant that we read the following Hadith which is related to it the following Hadith narrated saan may Allah be pleased with her Allah's messenger sallallah alaihi wasallam said he who touches his penis should perform Evolution okay now we have a problem and it has nothing to to do with Houston the problem is that these hadiths seem to be conflicting the first Hadith the prophet says it's part of you if you touch your private part it's okay the second Hadith it says that if you touch your private part you have to perform a bution so what's what what what do we do I'm not going to go into details because it's a little bit confusing but it's simple I'll try to make it as simple as possible now originally speaking it's all from the same Source Quran Sunnah it is all from the same source that is Allah Almighty the Quran is the words of Allah and the Sunnah is the teachings of the prophet am who himself told us that he does not speak out of his own mind it's it's only me Allah tells him to say and do what we see and if he does something wrong it's automatically immediately corrected by Allah as in the case of some wrong decisions he made Alat he tried his best he made the wrong decision and he was corrected immediately and as in the case with the blind man who came to the prophet Alam while he was calling the heads of qur the heads of the non-muslims tribes calling them to Islam and and if they convert to Islam this is a great deal to the Muslim Nation so he was trying his best calling them and talking to them and they're not responding and this blind man comes in and he tells him oh prophet of Allah teach me I'm willing to learn give me knowledge and the prophet Sall wasallam used to look the other side and call the non-muslims he thought the prophet that this guy is an individual he teaches him he spends time with him and that's that is it but if he spends the time with the three or four leaders of the tribes of the non-muslim tribes and they revert to Islam then their followers would follow them then this is a great Victory to Islam this is what the prophet said immediately Allah re revealed to him the Surah ofasa which means that the prophet Sall Ali wasallam has grudged his face and uh uh looked the other side why because this blind man came to him no you should not the blind man is seeking knowledge you should give it to him those who neglect reject what you say you should not pay any attention to them so the prophet whatever he doesn't say it all is a revelation from Allah and if he does something out of his own judgment and becomes wrong he will be immediately corrected by Allah so this is typically originally speaking what happens if we find verses of the Quran conflicting or a verse and Hadith conflicting Scholars say that there are four steps to be followed one the most prior step which is called conciliation and how is that if a Hadith tells you don't do this and another Hadith tells you it's okay to do this you have to try to conceal between the two you have to try to join the two without uh uh denying or dropping any of the uh uh the two parties I'll give you an example in many places of the Quran Allah says that it is forbidden on us to eat Al with them what is M any animal that is not properly slaughtered so if I'm walking down the street and I find a goat a dead goat that died by itself old age or that died by lightning or died by any cause that is not slaughtering and I say whoa that's good meat no it's not it's forbidden for me to use it because it's called M it's dead so Allah says it's forbidden and Allah says that blood is also forbidden what's blood when you Slaughter an animal some tribes this is found in Africa and elsewhere they would some not all they would get this Blood of coming from the veins of of the slaughtered animal and wait until it's dried and some of them may cook it and may consume it eat it so this is completely forbidden for Muslims you may not eat dead animals you may not eat blood so this is General but on the other hand there is a Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's permissible for us to eat two types of dead and two types of blood and he mentioned the Fish seafood and the Lucas and he also mentioned the liver and the spleen so one would say okay the verse says you may not eat dead or blood and the Hadith says you may eat two types of blood and two types of dead meat dead animals so what should we do the first stage is you can join them you can use both by saying all the animals are forbidden for us to eat with the exception of fish and Lucas and all blood that is considered to be blood is forbidden for us to consume and eat with ex exception of spleen and liver and this by this we alhamdulillah have used both evidence and we have not neglected or dropped any of them okay let's assume that we have another scenario that we cannot apply this in now we have two verses of the Quran or two verses two hadiths or one Hadith and one Quran and we try to uh uh have a Reconciliation we have to join we we try to join both uh verdicts of both uh Hadith or uh uh verse and we could not we failed so what do we do we move on from Al joining to the second stage which is try to locate which one was obligated what do we mean by obligated means that the first verdict was this is Haram after a while Allah says now okay it was Haram it has been changed into being halal and for an example at the beginning of time of Islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to the Companions and say do not visit Graves period okay so nobody went to cemeteries nobody visited his uh uh father or his grandfather nobody went to cemeteries except to bury a a dead person why was that companion Scholars say that at the beginning of time at beginning of the time of Islam some of the companions may have may have went to Graves and started saying oh dear father I wish you see you can see what we what's happening to us what do I do and this is part of sh because you're calling a dead person and that person do not have any uh good for you and cannot prevent you from any harm so at the very beginning it was forbidden after a while after a year or so the prophet came up again and said previously I have denied you from going to cemeteries visiting now I allow you to do so so visit them because it reminds you of the Hereafter it reminds you of your destiny and your final destination so if you visit cemeteries often the more you go in you say well I'm walking tomorrow I might be carried to it so it reminds you of the hereafter and of the day of judgment so it's good for you now I have two Hadith one that says do not go to cemeteries and one that says go to cemeteries what should I do joining is impossible I have to drop one of them so the second stage is to know which obligated which and in this case we can know we can tell how can we tell because of the second Hadith he he tells us the prophet in the previous times I told you do not visit cemeteries now you may visit it so this obligated it if we do not know the time then it's difficult to know which one came first so the we move on to the third step of trying to fix up things and how is that is by trying to make one Hadith stronger than the other so if we have a Hadith and this is called This is called we have to determine I have a Hadith and another Hadith and they conflict together I tried to join both failed I tried to know which one obligated the other I don't don't have the time or the date so I failed the third stage is try to determine which is stronger so if I have a verse of the Quran and a Hadith which one should be stronger the Quran by default if I have two Hadith one in bukari and one in which one should be uh uh uh forwarded first and rated as one alkari of course and so on so this is the third stage joining trying to know which abated which and which one is uh uh more stronger than that other if I fail in the previous three what should I do the Hadith still conflict and I can't do apply the three uh mentioned earlier what should I do Scholars say you have to stop Do not drop any of the Hadith you say I don't know because definitely someone else knows but your knowledge does not a give you the capability to determine what to do with these two conflicting Hadith or two conflicting Ayah so you you pause until you get the knowledge and information from someone else these four steps should be applied with these two hadiths that we've we are studying we have a short break we will continue inshallah just right after this break H TV is launching a new website for you your family and friends everyone a new look top level designs and better technology you will be able to Ping Hoda TV's new website and read all our articles surf our video archives chat live on Hoda's Forum vote support our programs and give us your suggestions or criticisms we welcome your thoughts we strive to please all our viewers worldwide Hoda a light in every home Alayah and welcome back now before the break we talked about the four steps that a a student of knowledge should follow whenever he's encountering two verses or two Hadith or Hadith and a verse that conflict with each other and you you don't know what to do and we said that you have to either join which means that you apply both at the same time without dropping anyone and this is the highest and the best solution and if it's not applicable then you have to drop one of them by knowing the time the date and you say that the latest oated the one before it and if you're not able to know the date or the timing then you have to move on to the third uh uh uh step which is you have to determine which one is stronger than the other so if it's a verse of the Quran then it's stronger than Hadith and if it's Hadith in a bukari then it's a strong stronger than a ter and if it's in the ter is stronger than for example or or whatever and the final and fourth step states that if you cannot apply any of the first three steps then the only thing left for you to do is to stand back and say I pause I don't know and this is very easy for a person to say and this is very logical unfortunately a lot of us don't don't know how to say I don't know their arrogance their Prejudice prevents them from doing this there's so many times I ask people that are not students of knowledge that don't have knowledge at all and it's very easy for them to say n this looks Halal this looks Haram and this is a major sin Allah has made this forbidden forbidden on Muslims to to talk without knowledge and IM AB IM Malik anas the IM of Medina the second Imam of the schools of thoughts the four School of thoughts once had a visitor that traveled for a whole month to reach him from the east from Afghanistan or from similar areas so he came to him at the time he wasn't from Afghanistan because then he would have been in problems he would put him somewhere else let's move change the country he's he was from kazakistan for and he came to IM Malik and he asked him 40 questions and each and every question Imam Malik says I don't know he answered only six out of the 40 so the guy you know after traveling for a whole month and they didn't have any first class it was all one class either on foot or on Camel Back and it was terrible and difficult so the guy was you know shocked said what would I tell my people after traveling a whole month coming to you and going back a whole month to them what would I tell my people that Imam Malik only answered six questions out of the 40 he told him it's very simple my friend tell him Imam Malik does not know imagine this knowledge this guy has this Imam has with all the knowledge he has he still does not feel embarrassed of saying I do not know because Allah knows best and my knowledge is not capable of answering all of your questions it has to be researched I have to ask others who are more knowledgeable than myself unfortunately Scholars of well not Scholars students of of knowledge in in our times now you would find them answering all of your questions you may see someone that you think he's a knowledgeable say oh sheh I have a question said go ahead uh it's medical said no problem I can answer any question it's political well I'm a good politician it's economical well I I think I can go go ahead it's mechanical I don't drive but I think I can figure an answer to your question could that be could this is this possible whereas I don't know the scholars say whoever says I don't know this is half of knowledge the rest is you know but half of knowledge true knowledge is saying I don't know and this is not something to be embarrassed of on the contrary it's an incentive for you to go ahead it gives you a push to learn more research ask and do the effort do do your effort in uh uh researching a a particular uh topic or an issue that would increase your knowledge so the fourth thing is you don't know going back to our subject we have two hadiths one stating that touching the private part is a normal thing it is like touching any part of your body the second Hadith tells us that whoever touches his private part whoever touches his penis should perform wood perform Evolution which states that it is it nullifies w so what's to do well to join some of the scholars say it's easy how the first Hadith that tells you it's part of you means that touching a private parts from uh uh uh Beyond clothings so if one touches his private parts from outside of the clothing while he's wearing his clothes not touching it directly then it's like touching any of your normal parts so there it doesn't nullify woodo and this is the consensus of Scholars if a person touches his private parts uh uh not directly but from uh uh there's a barrier between his hand and his private parts then the woodo is intact it does not nullify it touching it directly flesh to flesh this is a disputed uh issue so we've join some of the scholars joined by saying this verdict others said no the second Hadith which tells you you have to perform W obligates the first one how is that is there any date mentioned Mustafa is there any date mentioned here in the these two hadiths no so can we say that one operates the other is it possible we cannot tell without the date some you know smart scholar said uh-uh we can how they built their uh uh uh this case on a rule in F it's called the original innocence it translates all in Arabic it's called but this is roughly translating it to English the original innocence what what's what does that mean simply it means that everyone is innocent till proven guilty let's apply it on Purity everything on this world is pure until proven to be impure so if somebody says is this glass Pure or impure you don't have to think you don't have to analyze you don't have to make a you know consult a consultant immediately you would say it's pure is this pen pure is this paper pure is this desk pure everything is pure it's unless proven otherwise this is called originally innocence original innocence now if you come to food there are food this is okay is this fruit okay it came from Indonesia I don't know it looks strange this food came from the Amazon this came from Kenya this came from I don't know the these types of fruit is it okay to consume and eat the answer would be yes why the original innocence likewise in touching your body if somebody comes to me and says she is it okay if I touch my hair when I have to perform Evolution what would the answer be no you don't have to perform ablution if somebody comes and says I'm I want to touch the tip of my nose should I perform ablution says no I want to touch my toes again so the first Hadith Hadith is built on a man walks in and says if I touch my penis if I touch my private part must I perform ation the prophet answered himam in accordance to the rule which says you don't have to it does not nullify your wo to touch anything so if you touch your penis as if you touch the tip of your nose now anything that takes this original innocence out of his course it will be obligating anything that takes it from its original innocence would be oating in the sense that is it okay to eat all types of meat yes it's okay this is original innocence until a verse comes says do not consume ham pork is forbidden and this obligated the original innocence and the second Hadith bu safan when she says that the the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam said who he who touches his pis should perform W this moved it from the original innocence to a new a new stage which means that this obligated the first Hadith where we were told that it's part of your body so it doesn't nullify your wo so some Scholars say that this is obligated not because there is a date F not because there is a date mentioned but because it removed it from the original innocence to a new thing so so this is why they say it's obligated other Scholars say well this is too difficult for me to understand if you touch your private part with lust with desire nullifies your wood if you don't if you just touch it accidentally then you have no problem with uh uh that and the safest thing is to do the safest thing to do is to perform W and this happens only when someone uh uh either sleeps or bathes if someone takes a shower and at the very end after he performs woodo he is Drying himself and he accidentally touches his private parts it's recommended that he performs W again just to be on the safe side now what about touching other people's private part such as children this is imagined with Children of course if a a woman is cleaning her child who's a six-month old or a year old she is touching his or her private part so does this also nullifies wo it's a a matter of dispute among Scholars again the safest thing is to perform W though a lot of the scholars say no this is something that is reoccurring a a mother cleans her child like 20 50 times a day depending on the child's frequently uh doing what you know he does best so H H uh it's so it's difficult for her to go and perform Evolution and this is inshallah the most authentic authentic thing that it does not nullify a mother's woodo touching her child's private parts when cleaning them but if she prefers if she uh uh performs wo then she had would have done a good thing this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time [Music] [Music] oh what"
