  "transcript": "shahla rahman al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen pasa la la voz a la mobarakeh abdi he wore a suit in amin nabina muhammad in vara re he was happy esmerine Emma back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh 217 was narrated by abdullah ivan mackerle he said i SAT with carb Naruto may allah be pleased with him and asked him about the vidya and he replied this ayah this revelation was revealed concerning my case especially but it is also for you in general i was carried to the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and the lice were falling in great numbers on my face the prophet said sallallahu alehiwassallaam have never thought that your ailment or struggle has reached to such an extent as I see can you afford a sheep I replied in negative then he said fast for three days or feed six poor persons each with half Azhar of food in another narration the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam ordered him to distribute a 40 which is free size between 6-foot persons sacrifice a sheep or fast three days this hadith is usually related to what is known as fiddy tool ah da and Vidya means ransom and here it means what you pay as an expiation or what you do in return for something that place which you were not supposed to do as a mushroom and allah azzawajal mentioned this in surat al-baqara and allah azzawajal told us that those who have a need to do some of the things that are restricted in harm and among them is to have something wrong or something harmful in their head and hence they need to remove that hair this is permissible as in the case of carbonara but one has to pay the expiation in this hadith and from other hadith when looking at them through the light of the ayah in surat al-baqara we understand that if a person is in need to do something of the restricted things in a harm he is given the choice of one of three either to sacrifice a sheep or a seventh of a camel or a cow or to paint six people the amount of half-ass are each which means that he should feed each poor person to moods or he has a choice of fasting three days and there is no preference to those scholars say you have the choice but of course we know that a sacrifice is far greater than feeding six-foot person or fasting the three days and scholars cascade this hadith to any of the things that are restricted to do while in the state of a harem and they give an example if a person is handicapped or disabled and cannot wear the dress of ROM the garments of a romp in this case scholars say that if he had to wear trousers or a shirt or something that is not permitted for a mahram this is permissible but he has to pay fede atul other he has to give this compensation or this expiation for the things that he's going to do likewise if a person had to clip his nails for one reason or the other or he had to put perfume or he put it intentionally not he had to but he put it intentionally in this case he has to give the video to other as for those who do these things out of forgetfulness or out of a mistake it's not intentional and then scholars say that they are not obliged to do anything because allah azzawajal forgives those who do such acts out of forgetfulness or by mistake the following hadith is narrated by abu shiroi who a lead in nuremberg whose i may allah be pleased with him that he said to armor even saheed even an ass and he was going to send troops in batches to Makkah I'm Rubin said he was going to send armies to matka to fight Abdullah of the zubur may allah be pleased with him and with his father so I was sure I said Oh chief and he is respectfully addressing the Emir the leader so he said Oh chief allow me to tell you a statement which allows prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam said on the second day of the conquest of Makkah my two ears heard it and my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it the prophet said allahís alot wassalam Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Allah and not by the people so it is not lawful for a person who believes in Allah and in the last day to shed blood in it or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in mecca because the prophet of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam was allowed to fight in it say to him allah permitted his prophet sallallahu ala salem and did not allow you and even he that is the prophet alayhi salatu salam was allowed for a short period of the day and today it's sanctity has become the same as it was before those who are present should inform those who are absent about this hadith theories then a beaujolais was asked may Allah be pleased with him what did amoureux say to you when you give him this advice I bushra said he said I knew that better than you o Abu Saleh the harem that is the mecca area does not give refuge to a sinner or a fleeing murderer or a person running away after causing destruction now this hadith a beaujolais is advising this man who was about to send his troops to fight Abdullah have disobeyed and as we know after the death of Muhammad allah be pleased with him there was a confusion whether yazid was supposed to assume the leadership or the imama or the Halawa or not and so many things happened afterwards we will not go into that because history is something that took place in the past and it would not do us any good to discuss it at the moment as nomar of nab disease may allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul when he was asked about what happened between re and while yeah he said allah azzawajal did protect our swords from participating in such a battle and therefore we protect our tongues from talking about such a subject because it would not do you any good however a Boucherie is speaking to armor when he wanted to do what he wanted to do and he told him i'll give you an advice the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us the second day of his conquest to mecca and it's an issue of dispute among scholars was Makka opened by force or was it by truce and the most authentic opinion it was opened by force and that is why the prophet entered it with an army and that is why he's saying in this hadith that Allah made it permissible only for me only for a portion or a period of the day so I Boucherie may allah be pleased with him went to arm and spoke to him in a very polite manner and this is how people should talk to the leaders and to those who assume positions it is not at all part of the Sunnah to go to the leader and shout at him or curse him or talk to him in a disrespectful way especially in front of people because Allah ordered moosa and haroon to go to Pharaoh and to advise him gently and his Pharaoh and they are the messengers of Allah yet Allah ordered them to address him in a very lenient and soft manner we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so a Boucherie addressed this ruler in a very polite manner and he told him give me the chance give me the permission to tell you about something that I've heard something that I've seen something that my heart remembers seeing the prophet erase errata said I'm saying what did he say sallallahu Salem after praising Allah and complimenting him the Prophet said that this area the sanctuary of Mecca was made a sanctuary since Allah created the heavens and the earth so it was not sanctioned by people it was not made a sanctuary for a period of time it has been made a sanctuary since Allah created the heavens and the earth and it is not permissible until the day of judgment for a man who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to shed blood in it nor to cut a tree of what grows in it or grass and if someone justified his action by saying that the prophet alayhi salatu salam fought in mecca and this is a sunnah tell him that it was given as a special permit and permission for the prophet alayhi salatu salam from allah and you don't have the similar permission and not only that that allah gave His Prophet and it was not only a period of the day a portion of the time and not for you and the Prophet says in the second day after the conquest of Mecca and now its sanctuary had came back to it again as it was yesterday so no one can do anything that goes against what the Prophet is a lobster I'm has stated or goes against its sanctuary and the Prophet not only said that he said that all of you must inform those who were not present today scholars say what is the ruling on executing prescribed punishment such as killing a murderer such as chopping the hand of a person who stole they all agree that if a person makes his sin makes his crime in the sanctuary of Mecca then he must be punished for that and they differed if a person committed his sin or his crime outside of the sanctuary and then fled to Makkah seeking to be secure and safe and they differed some of them said he cannot be punished there you cannot implement the prescribed punishment on him there and he has to be forced to go out of the harem area and then he may be punished others say no you can do that because otherwise people would go and flee to Mecca whenever they make a crime and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and we will have one of the hadith that proves that if a person commits a crime he is to be punished even in Mecca however this is again an issue of dispute and therefore the reference in it is the ruler of Makkah and if the ruler of Makkah says is to be implemented and then it is ok and if he says no you have to get him out and then give him the necessary punishment then it should be done as well the following hadith is the hadith of Abdul omnibus may allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that on the day of conquest of Makkah the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam address the people and he said that there is no more migration after the conquest of Mecca but jihad and intention and whenever you are cold for jihad you should go immediately what does that mean that it is not over but I'm just trying to explain it while giving it to you the prophecy that there is no migration after the conquest of Mecca this is not a general concept this is a specific meaning that no one my grades from matka elsewhere because before the conquest of Mecca all those who accepted islam in makkah were forced and instructed and ordered to migrate to medina because Medina was the city of Islam and Makka at the time was not after the conquest of Makkah the prophecies that migration from Mecca is over but it is still continuous till the day of judgment from any country of the world and what is the criteria to migrate from any country of the world scholars say if you're unable to practice Islam if you're unable to show your Islam it becomes mandatory upon you to travel and to migrate to a Muslim country give an example if you're not able to pray in the message they stop you they prevent you from praying in the message or if they prevent you from naming yourself or your children Muslim names if they're preventing your wife from wearing the hijab if they are not allowing you to eat halal meat all of these things are part of our religion if you're not able to do this in this case it is mandatory for you to migrate this country or that region because it's a region of co 4 and then the prophet said allahís alot was salaam after that that there is no migration from occur but there is you had and intention so whenever some of the rulers call you for jihad you should go immediately meaning that you may not migrate from Makkah but you go out of Makkah if the Islamic ruler requests your presence to fight for the cause of Allah to make jihad and it has to be the Islamic ruler not any Muslim he has to be the ruler who has the control of the country and who has the army once he tells you generally to fight in the cause of Allah or specifically you are drafted then you have to respond as the Prophet said that is salatu salam then he goes to say no doubt allah azzawajal has made this place that is Mecca a sanctuary since the creation of the heavens and the earth and will remain a sanctuary till the day of resurrection as allah azzawajal has ordained it's sanctity fighting was not permissible in it for anyone before me and even for me it was allowed only for the portion of the day which is this hour of mine so it is a sanctuary with a las sanctity till the Day of Resurrection its thorns and this shows you the greatness of Makkah and the sanctuary of Mecca its thorns the Prophet says alehissalaam should not be uprooted the thorns that no one uses the prophecies it cannot be approached it and it's game things or animals that are being hunted it's game should not be chased so it's not only forbidden to hunt it's forbidden for you to chase it or to scare it and the Prophet says it's look up ax which are the things that are found lost things that is should not be picked up except by the one who would announce that publicly all of this to show you how great and important and different Makka is and its vegetation that is grass and trees etc should not be cut and I bass said Allah be pleased with him o prophet of allah make an exception of harm and if there is a form of plantation that the blacksmith uses and it is also used for their domestic purposes so the Prophet Ali salatu salam agreed and said except the eighth harm from this hadith we learned that the Prophet Alice osim is emphasizing the fact that Makka has a sanctuary no one should uproot its thorns or cut its vegetation it's grass its trees but is this general scholars say no if humans plant something or grow something it's permissible for them to cut so if humans for example grow tomatoes cucumbers vegetables this is permissible for them to cut because they have grown it themselves but we're talking about the trees the grass that Allah so jeal grow and not the humans then in this case it is not permissible for you to cut also if you find anything that of value in the streets anywhere you may announce it publicly and after one year it becomes yours except in Mecca you can never own it whatever you find you advertise you announce for it publicly until you die but you may not get it out of Makkah and you may not own it so that is why scholars say if you find something of value in Makkah leave it don't touch it because the owner will come back to it and it's not your business whether it is lost or something takes it unless you're going to take it and give it to the Lost and Found department and the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he said what he had said even the game even a rabbit or a pigeon or a deer you cannot chase it just for the fun of it let alone hunt it and this is one of the major sins to be done in Mecca and there is an expiration for that as mentioned in the Quran and also as displayed and clarified in the hadith when al abbas asked and requested for in her to be an exception from what is permissible for the people of Mecca the Prophet allowed them at a histologic salam to cut this type of vegetation because it was something that they need and again from this hadith we learn that Makka has a special place has a special sanctity to it unlike any other spot in the world and this is not because the Prophet had made it haram not because Ibrahim peace and blessing be upon him made it haha it is because Allah is the one who favoured it and made it a sanctuary since the beginning of time this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah salam alaykum warahmatullahi avocado"
