  "transcript": "so she what's the ruling on some podcasts or videos where people expose their sins as as a will they be held accountable if they tell people today a sin that they did in the past but they didn't know that it was Haram the prophet Sall alai wasam told us that Allah will forgive his umah the whole entire umah except for and those who publicize their sins after being concealed by Allah therefore such podcasts though the intention of the brother was good but when he comes and says I was a an actor I was a singer I used to do drugs I used to go to uh nightclubs and party I used to have relations with women I used to gamble I used to do this and that he's exposing Allah's what Allah's uh um sit and what Allah concealed upon him and the prophet told us that such an individual will not be forgiven by Allah though his intention is good so one has to refrain from this and refuse to be a candle that sheds light to the people while burning itself because this is exactly what he's doing he's giving light and hope to the people but he's burning himself he's like putting himself as a bridge between the edges of hell where people walk on his back while he's being burnt to save them and Allah Knows Best"
