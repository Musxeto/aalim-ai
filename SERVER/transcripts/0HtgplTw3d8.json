  "title": "Islamic ruling on expressing happiness only when a boy is born - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says in my husband's family they only celebrate when a boy is born I'm pregnant and now even my husband wants a boy first shouldn't they be happy even when a girl is born what does Islam say these in these matters this is human nature people by nature the vast majority of them like boys because they feel that this boy has less problems than girls and he will grow up to assist the parents financially physically take care of them he would carry their name etc so this is human nature there's nothing wrong in that what's wrong is when you hate that a girl is born this is mimicking and imitating the disbelievers the idol worshippers who are not liking this"
