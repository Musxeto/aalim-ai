  "title": "Can we give Zakat to our grandchildren? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Matt says can I give my zakat money whether it's there's a cat of my gold or my cash or my investments to my grand children whom their father died the scholars differ in this and the normal trend is that your ancestors fathers mothers grandfathers grandmothers and as long as they all go up or your descendants your sons daughters your grandchildren they cannot have your zakat because it is it it's mandatory upon you to support and provide for them whether they go up will go down however some say that if you're not inheriting so for example if you as a mother of the deceased but you're not the mother of the grandchildren if the grandchildren have their mother alive and they are boys and and and girls if any of them die you will not inherit because you're blocked by the presence of their mother their mother would get her share of one six or one six usually if there are no siblings then she will get one-third depending on the situation but you as a grandmother will never inherit by this rule therefore it is permissible for you because you're not you will not inherit it is permissible for you to give them from the zakat providing that they are poor or needy but if they are well-off or they are normal people they're not poor then you cannot give them from the Zeca"
