  "transcript": "Junaid says can we recite Buddha Sharif border is a poem that was written in Arabic in praising the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as a result if I'm not mistaken of a dream a man saw and this Buddha contains a lot of silk where it raises a prophet at Islam to be in the level of Allah the Almighty in knowing the unseen in controlling the universe in having the knowledge of the book of the preserved tablet and the pen and to be generous that this world and the hereafter is part of his generosity and gifts to the world this is only for Allah Scioscia and praising the prophet erase or something like this takes a person out of the fold of Islam unfortunately the vast majority of people who celebrate the Mawlid and who are deviant Sufis rely immensely on this poem and they repeat it and most of the people who repeated are non Arabs so they parrot it out not knowing that it contains shirk and some of them do unfortunately so definitely it is something that Muslims must not read or come close to"
