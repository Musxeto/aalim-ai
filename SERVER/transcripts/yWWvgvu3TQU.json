  "transcript": "ald we are still discussing the chapter that deals with fasting and you all know that fasting is divided into two types mandatory fasting and voluntary fasting and you all know that mandatory fasting is also divided into a number of types different types so we have Ramadan which comes on the highest of all we have of course making up for M days of Ramadan we have Oaths that you Pledge on yourself Allah did not pledge it on you but you called it upon yourself and this is mandatory for you to fulfill and lastly we have expiations so if you kill someone by mistake you have to fast two months as an experation if you say to your wife that you are forbidden on me and you are exactly like my mother's back or my sister's back and since that I have nothing to do with you regarding intimacy you're like my mother then you have to also part of the sequence of experation if you cannot free a slave then you have to fast for two consecutive months and Etc so these are the types of mandatory fasting the voluntary fasting the sky is the limit we have the highest of all is fasting the day OFA expiates the sins of 2 years fasting the day of as expiates the sins of one year and the Sunnah is to fast Mondays and Thursdays as the prophet used to sayat the Sunnah is to fast three days of every month and these are preferably the white days known as the 13th 14th and the 15th it is part of the Sunnah also to fast the fasting of the wood to fast the day and to skip the next so these are all considered to be voluntary fasting and you can do there is of course as you all know forbidden fasting and it is forbidden for a Muslim to fast the days of and and it's also for forbidden to fast the last the three days of they are the three days that follow which is the 11th 12th and the 13th of it is forbidden to separately fast Friday for the sake of Friday and it is forbidden to fast Saturday separately for the sake of Saturday but if there is a legitimate reason for doing this this is permissible as in the case when you fast alone and it coincides with a Saturday this is permissible as in the case if you fast the fasting of the wood peace be upon him so this means that this week you will isolate Friday and the following week you'll isolate Saturday is this Halal yes because this is a fasting of D I'm not deliberately isolating fasting the Friday or Saturday for their sake I'm doing it because it comes within the Sunnah of the Prophet we have Hadith 179 and who will read this Hadith an Malik said that the prophet may Allah bless him and Grant him peace said have sahur there is blessing in in this Hadith of Malik we learn some of the etiquet of fasting and that is to have the what is the the itself is the pre-dawn meal it is the last meal that a person who intends to fast has it before the break of dawn and it is part of the Sunnah that the prophet used to do and Scholars differed whether it is mandatory or it is highly recommended and the most authentic opinion is it is highly recommended why is that because there are a Hadith where the Prophet permitted his companions to continue fasting when it's Sunset they continued they did not break their fast until the following day of sunset so they fasted 48 hours and the prophet did thisat wasam to punish them and we will get to know this inshallah so the prophet would not sallallahu alaihi wasallam permit them to do something that is forbidden that is skipping the pre-dawn meal theur which indicates that the pre-dawn meal is not mandatory but rather it is recommended and must however the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that in this pre-dawn meal there is Baraka so one should not at all take it lightly even if you are about to fast and you don't have something to eat the least you could do is drink some water and intend by drinking that water that it is your preone meal because the prophet promised us and informed us that there is Baraka inside of that now people differed some of them especially the Deviant sects think that one should not have a good pre-dawn meal because this goes against the intention of starving yourself but actually is fasting intended to starve yeah Allah is punishing us no if I don't starve what happens I personally when I fast with the grace of Allah I don't feel hungry and I don't feel thirsty because I don't eat a lot those who are used to eating a lot may find this but does this mean that I should prolong My fasting until so that I can feel hungry no so it is not as the Deviant sex say that Allah wants to torture us and hence we should not have a big meal for pre-dawn meal no you eat whatever is permissible for you to eat and you should use this pre-done meal to give you strength so that the following day you would act normally and do what Allah Asel wants you to do as a Muslim moving on to Hadith number 180 yes brother narrated Anin Malik that zit said we took our suur with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when they finished it the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam stood for the fud prayer and offered it anas asked Z what was the interval between their finishing the suur and the starting of the morning prayer anas replied it was equal to the time taken by a person in reciting 50 verses of the Quran actually it is not anas who replied it was zabit who replied because anas is asking Zade and he told him what was the interval and Zade said that it was about or the time that a person takes to recite 50 verses of the Quran from this Hadith we learn that the Sunnah is to postpone And Delay the sahur to the last minute nowadays in most of the Muslim countries you will find in the Islamic so-called Islamic calendars they distribute you will find imak or imak Ramadan and it will come 15 minutes or 20 minutes before thean of f they tell you the time to fast is that correct this is not correct this is not part of the Sunnah in Islam you're allowed to eat and drink and have intimacy until you can distinguish between day and night what so the break of dawn is the determining factor of you refraining from eating drinking and things that nullifies your fasting other than that there is no value of it or to it so if I have these calendars that say that 15 minutes I should refrain and stop eating or drinking this is not true unfortunately 95% of the Muslims apply this in their lives and you find them 15 minutes before the aan fasting and this is an innovation one of all secondly this is imitating the Deviant sects and the Jews and Christians probably because the prophet told us in an authentic Hadith the people will remain in good shape the Muslims as long as they delay the and those who stop eating 15 or 20 minutes before definitely are not following the Sunnah how do we know that it is not part of the Sunnah Zade said between finishing theur and starting to pray 50 ayas how much would a person take to recite 50 ayas 10 minutes less than 10 minutes let's say 15 minutes so by the time he ended the aan called and they went to make W and then the was called This Is 50 50 ay 50 verses of the Quran which means that it was so late that it was just before the aan they finished their and immediately afterwards they prayed F prayer Hadith number 181 it is related from and F used sometimes to find the messenger of Allah sallallah alai wasallam in janaba state of sexual impurity from one of his wives then he performed and fasted in this Hadith we have a report by two of his wives sallallahu alaihi wasallam what do we learn from it this is what we'll find inshallah after the break so asalamu alaykum and and welcome back mother and Sal they are teaching us that Purity from sexual activity is not related to fasting in the sense that if a person has intimacy with his spouse and the fuder calls the break of dawn is there while you are in the state of sexual impurity does this affect your fasting it does not affect your fasting and that is exactly what the prophet Alam used to have the F would break the Dawn would break and the aan would be called for fer and the prophet was in the state of sexual impurity and this did not affect his fasting he used to go and have his total bath his rul and go and pray and continue to fast so this is understood now this is different than if a woman had her menus and thean of f was called and after thean of f she saw and realized her Purity does she continue to fast or not the answer is no her fast is not valid why because she did not recognize her Purity from what prevents her from what restricts her from fasting before the aan if she saw her Purity before the aan and then thean was called and after thean was called she took her this is okay but if she did not see her Purity except after thean this is not valid likewise if a woman was pure fasted the day just couple of minutes before Sunset and she got her menus is that day valid for her no the day is invalid because she did not complete fasting the day from the break of dawn till sunset and this Hadith clearly states this issue moving on to Hadith 182 yes brother it is related from abuur that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam may Allah bless him and Grant him peace said if he forgets and eats and drinks he should complete his fast Allah has fed him and let him drink the prophet wasam is mentioning to us one of the things that if a person commits one of the Nullification of fasting his fasting is considered to be complete and correct and what are these things Scholars say that in order for your fast to break you have to be knowledgeable you have to be choosing and you have to be remembering what is this they say if you eat not knowing that eating nullifies your fasting do I continue or not they said yes you continue continue because knowledge is a must if I eat because someone has a gun at my head and he said either you eat or I'll blow your head can I eat and the answer is yes okay afterwards can I continue to fast the answer is yes again because you were not choosing to eat you were forced to eat and the third case is when and I eat out of forgetfulness if I ate forgetting or I drink forgetting the Hadith clearly says that it is Allah who fed you and offered you to drink so these are important to know now we've stated that if you eat and drink while forgetting this is from Allah if I see someone in Ramadan drinking or eating should I leave him and say my mallah lucky him Allah has fed him and gave him drink or should I tell him you're fasting I must tell him that he's fasting because he is doing something something that is not permissible but he's not accountable I on the other hand am accountable for that it's like if I see someone drinking and thinking that this is water I know that it is not water I know it's vodka for example and I say let him drink he's going to have fun he's going to be joyful and cheerful he's not sinful you're sinful you have to tell him and stop him from doing this mkar so likewise now we know that drinking and eating nullifies fasting but what else nullifies fasting Allah mentioned in the Quran the eating drinking and intercourse Scholars say there are more so let us talk about the things that there is no difference among Scholars they said that you add to that anything that takes or substitutes eating and drinking so for example if you take this IV that can make you alive for five or six or 10 days without eating and drinking this is the same ruling this nullifies your fasting understood they also add to that cupping and it's an issue of dispute among Scholars is cupping one of the things that nullifies your fasting what is cupping cupping is slashing wounding the back of the neck or the shoulders and extracting the Bad Blood it comes in dark and heavy State unlike the wounds that takes place and after doing it you feel relieved your eyesight improves your memory improves your sleeping habits or patterns also improves Scholars say that also falls under the category of intercourse ejaculation so if someone does not have sexual intercourse but he ejaculates intentionally or what they called as masturbation if he masturbates in ejaculate then his fasting is invalid and he has to make another day for that what is ruling on taking samples of blood Scholars say that is is okay it's not like cupping because it does would not make you tired so it is permissible to take it is there anything else does anybody know anything else that I might have forgotten yes vomiting purposely asent excellent very good the prophet said wasam whoever vomits intentionally must make up for that day and whoever is forced to vomit sometimes you eat and you've eaten something bad and you can't help it all of a sudden you vomit yourself the prophet says your fasting is valid okay let's take your questions shik you mentioned many prohibitions the people who are not allowed to fast does that include the hajis as as well the pilgrims the what the pilgrims when they go for Hajj the five days of Hajj they also prohibited to fast or how does that work okay if you're talking about the three days of T the 11th and the 12th and 13th I'm saying the five days of Hajj when people the five days The Eighth Day and the ninth day day of and the day before it they can fast but it's not recommended they can fast the day of ARA the pilgrim can fast the day of araa it's not forbidden for him uh to fast and he may fast as mandatory if he cannot sacrifice so the schols say that if someone is unable to sacrifice thei if he's doing or Allah says in the Quran three days you fast in the and seven when you go back these three days are to be fasted on the eth and the 9th or if you canot fast them you fast them on the 11th 12th and the 13th so you can fast those inshallah this regarding the intention of fasting when should we begin intending for a fast and should it be done every day for mandatory fasting remember we have mandatory and voluntary for mandatory fasting you must intend to fast before the break of dawn whether this intention is by eating the pre-done meal nobody eats at 4:00 so definitely if you're eating at 4:00 you're intending it or by before going to bed you intend in tomorrow I'm fasting so even if you overslept and woke up after fer your intention is correct now in regards to Ramadan Scholars some of them say that you have to have intention for every single day and this is not true as long as I know that Ramadan is 30 days or 29 days it is sufficient only to to intend the first day after that it is like the domino effect it takes place without me intending it because every day I'm going to have my pre-done meal and so on unless I separate or break because of illness or traveling so I break one or two or more days because I'm traveling once I want to resume fasting I have to have for the first day the intention and after that everything goes as usual yes the brother there Alum sham some people say that even brushing the teeth is not permissible during fasting what is the ruling it is okay for a person to use the seak you know the siwak the miswak it is permissible for him to use it throughout the whole day and night no problem it is even permissible to use a toothbrush providing you can guarantee that you do not swallow any of the paste and most people can do that can guarantee that but if you're afraid or if you're used to eating some of the past and swallowing it Scholars say no this affects your fasting and you should avoid this I'm afraid that this is all the time until we meet next time"
