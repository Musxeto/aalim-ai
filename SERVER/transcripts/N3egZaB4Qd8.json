  "title": "Stole something, is it enough to repent or must I return the amount / give charity? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh if you are ignorant and you stole like a Haram item from a person but you repented you still have to con compensate with like charity first of all when you steal something from an individual this is a stolen property you took from me this mug whatever you've done with it you broke it you sold it you used it you still have it my possessions are missing so you cannot repent without giving this item back to me or the equivalence of its actual cost why because you've taken something from me and you owe me and the prophet said who had ever taken something or done something to his brother in this Dunya he has to clear that with him in this Dunya before the day of judgment because on the day of judgment there is no Dirham or dinar there is no dollar or Sterling pound there is only good deeds and bad Deeds which means that if you failed in compensating me for what you had stolen from me I'll take from your good deeds on the day of judgment if you don't have any good deeds I'll give you some of my sins and put it on you so that you would be punished instead of me for those sins therefore you have to compensate the person you stole the property from I don't have money I don't know where the person is I know if I do such a thing I'll be putting cups in cups and and they'll throw me in jail okay there is a greater harm in this case you have to take the equivalence of the uh cost of this mug and give it to the poor and needy Muslims as a form of cleansing your wealth and on behalf of that person hoping that on the day of judgment he would approve of such charity and accept it otherwise may Allah azzawajal make him pleased and compensate him with whatever he would make him forgive your crime on the day of judgment but these are the only two choices you have an Allah Knows Best"
