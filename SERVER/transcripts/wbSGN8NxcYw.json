  "title": "Can an accountant audit financial statements that contain Riba ( he will only check & not calculate)",
  "transcript": "sh can a person audit the parts of a financial statement that contain interest he will not be helping the company calculate their interest or documenting it for them he'll just be checking if they said the truth about their earning from interest for example see the issues with accountants and Auditors is very sensitive because if they have have to deal with RBA their job is Haram so if a financial auditor is just revising the financial statements and checking the numbers and coming to a conclusion that this is okay or this is not okay without having anything to deal with RBA meaning he would not say okay you guys had 10 million uh uh um dollars in your bank account which means that you should have received x amount of Interest over such a deposit but I don't see it in the financial why and so they Rectify it and correct it and they put it in no this is Haram now you're auditing this or you're saying that you took more than what you deserve or you took less than what you deserve when it comes to riba this is not permissible if you don't have to do this and you have nothing to do with saying that riba was supposed to be added or was supposed to be given on this particular uh uh quarter in this case if you don't have to do anything with that inshallah there's no problem in that though I very much doubt that to be the case"
