  "transcript": "uh shake a woman I know of a woman who does not have good relation and does not stay with her husband a son or brother that these men don't spend or her neither she convinces them to take her responsibility nor she herself wants to stay with them so this woman stays with her son-in-law and daughter who looked after her for a long time but now he does not want to spend anymore which leads to fight between the husband and wife so there are a lot of reasons why her son-in-law or her family members don't want to with in short this woman is like f so now the question is if these men are present who are responsible for taking care of her does it become obligatory for her daughter to find and do a job and look after her mom who herself is dependent on her husband first of all the son-in-law is not at all obliged to accommodate his mother-in-law at all this is not mandatory upon him in Islam it's not a charity organization his wife has no right in pressuring him to accept her mother to stay with him uh in his own house so whether she has a husband and siblings that are willing to provide for her or not he's not obliged so it's his house he can uh uh ask her politely to leave and if she doesn't he can kick her out is his wife permitted to work against his will of course not and if she insists then Al dillah Allah can substitute him with a younger more beautiful more practicing and less trouble uh uh uh wife who's wearing the pants and I and I hate it when such questions come to me showing the dominance of the wife over the man who's wearing the pants be a man and act like a man you've tolerated your wife and her mom for so many years you've spent on them Allah will reward you but enough is enough so if your wife is insisting on working to provide for her mom who has people to provide for her but she doesn't want because she's evil or she's arrogant then no this is not permissible for the wife to do so and Allah Knows Best"
