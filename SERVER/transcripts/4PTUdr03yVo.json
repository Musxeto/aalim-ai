  "transcript": "miss megan says can i sell makeup and other cosmic cosmetics to women are there any guidelines to follow when doing such a business well what's the ruling on selling cosmetics it's hella selling a lipstick an eyeliner mascara nail polish all of these things are like the ruling of selling a knife you can use the knife to cut meat and bread with and you can use it to hurt people and I do not know what your intent is the product that I'm selling is hella how you use it is what makes you sinful or not and therefore selling cosmetics makeup perfumes online for example or in a shop when people come and buy I do not have the right to accuse their intent that they're going to wear it without the hijab they're gonna give it to an actress who's gonna appear on movies and I would be sinful for assisting her this is not logical because you can open the door for with wasps and for the doubts of Shaitaan even if you sell a bottle of water this bottle of water can be transformed into ice and then you can have scotch on the rocks so you've assisted him to drink drink intoxicants I would have in LA this is not logical you cannot sell cars you cannot even sell a pen because this pen might be used in signing a RIBA based loan and tract so the rule of thumb is if the product itself is halal then selling it is halal providing I do not know the intent of the person buying it I have a bakery someone comes to me and says I'd like you to bake me a cake chocolate cake with this and that on it ok the price is so-and-so gives me the price and leaves I give them the cake they take it and they celebrate a birthday or an anniversary I didn't know that your money's halide your work is Halong someone comes to me and says I'd like you to make me a birthday cake and put happy birthday to Jonathan you refrain and say I apologize but this is against my religion I cannot participate in making you such a cake because now you know before making it and selling it the intent someone comes and leases your apartment or a shop in your building and they say that we're going to sell clothes they say that we're going to live in it let's Helen after the contract is signed for a whole year you find out that they have an ATM machine or they are selling something that is Haram or they are partying in means of Haram and music etc you didn't know but now you do after the year is over you do not renew the contract and so on you"
