warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have with us the hadith of mother are you sure may Allah be pleased with her and she said that a man by the name of hams abdominal eslami came to the prophet alayhi salaatu him and asked him should I fast while traveling and the Prophet said Alice lobster damn fast if you wish and break the fast if you wish regarding the issue of fasting while traveling we will discuss and take a number of a hadith that cannot be taken understood in isolation we have to look at them all combined and together the hadith that follows that is hadith number 185 anas bin malik may allah be pleased with him narrated that we used to travel with the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam and those fasting did not find fault those not fasting nor did those not fasting find fault with those fasting so they all were and traveled some fasted and some did not and no one would point the finger at the other and say ah you did fast this is wrong or you didn't fast be week or so moving on to the following hadith hadith number 186 the hadith was narrated by abu dhabi allah be pleased with him he said that we set out during the month of ramadan with the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam in such an intense he that one of us would place his hand over his head in order to protect himself against the excessive heat and none among us was observing the fast except the messenger of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam and abdullah heaven raha may allah be pleased with him so everyone did not observe fasting except the prophet and his companion Abdullah even know haha and we move on to the following hadith hadith 187 this hadith was reported or narrated by jabber may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam was on a journey and he saw a crowd and a man who was being shaded so the Prophet ask sal allahu ahlam what is this and they told him that someone who is fasting the man being shaded is a person who is fasting the prophet said alayhi salatu salam fasting on a journey is not part of piety and in another narration for muslim the prophet said array salatu salam except a las permission that he has given you and in hadith 188 Una's narrated may allah be pleased with him that we were with the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam on a journey some of us had been observing the fast and some of us had not been fasting we got down at a place on a hot day most of us who had shade were those who had clothes what does that mean that the luckiest among us who could shade themselves who had an extra piece of cloth so that they could raise it and take shade of it but those who did not could not have any shade on top of them he says there were those amongst us who sheltered themselves against the Rays of the Sun with the help of their hands the observers of the fast fell down because of the weakness those who had not observed fasting they got up and pitched tents and watered the mounts there upon the Prophet sallallahu ala Salem said the breakers of the fast have taken away the reward today now from these hadith we find to us that may seem as conflicting messages in the first idea you wish to fast go ahead you don't want to fast break a fast in another hadith anna says we were divided into two groups while traveling none of us would point at each other saying you shouldn't have fast or you should have fast everyone dealt with it as he pleased the third hadith the prophetess m saw a man being shaded due to his weakness and that people were helping him and carrying him he said that it is not part of piety too fast while traveling the fourth hadith they all did not fast except the prophet end of the La Roja and in the last hadith those who did not fast due to the fact that they were the one who fetched and erected the tents and watered the camels and served those who were fasting who fell down the Prophet said that they took all the reward so even because you were fasting this is reward of all those who did not fast because they are serving you and doing all the work they have taken all the reward far greater than yours so what do we understand from this scholars after looking at this and the evidence is from the Quran said that Allah has the urge el when he said that those who are traveling or ill may fast other days and ramadan this indicated that whenever you travel and whenever you're ill you have the excuse not to fast however what's the ruling if I want to fast I don't want to skip fasting so what's your ruling on that scholars divided fasting in traveling into three types they say if traveling and fasting is hazardous to your health or may cause in your death or it would be harmful for you it is forbidden for you to fast example I'm an airplane pilot and while fasting long distances that is if I'm going from here to the west so this means that I am chasing the Sun and the Sun would not set easily unlike if I'm traveling to the east if I'm traveling to the east it will be quickly gone and over with but if I'm traveling to the west the day will be so long it's unimaginable so I'm a pilot I decided too fast and while traveling i feel that i'm drowsy i'm unable to concentrate and there is a big big possibility that i would endanger my life and the passengers with me or at least put them in hard and in harm's way so what's the ruling on that scholars say that this is forbidden for you too fast likewise someone who's chronically and terminally ill yet he decides to fast doctors say if you fast you may die you have to take the medication or you'll die and he says I'm going too fast and he does that he's that permissible scholars say no you have to break her fast it's a must and then it is not part of piety too fast while traveling the second situation is if while traveling I can fast but fasting is hard i will feel hunger that is not normal i will get thirsty that is not normal however i'm not going to die it's not going to affect my health but the hardship is going to be a lot in this case the scholars say and similarly for a person who is ill they say he will not die but his recovery is going to be delayed a little bit instead of being able to recover in a week it's going to take him three weeks so he's not going to die but it's gonna affect him so scholars say that fasting is permissible but it is highly not recommended it is makrooh so one should not do something that is makrooh you should avoid anything that allows the well jel hates even if it's not haram as long as Allah hates it you should say away from it the third type scholars say is that when a person is traveling it is exactly the same whether he breaks his fasting or fast to him it's the same thing in this case scholars say if this is the case then it is recommended for you too fast why because especially when it comes to Ramadan it is best for you too fast Ramadan while traveling if it doesn't affect you rather than making it up on a month other than Ramadan when you are fasting with the majority with the gemara it's easier than when you're the only one who's fasting and everybody else is not and if it's not affecting you then hamdillah you are recommended to fast and this is the doing of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and Abdullah Abdullah waha from all of this we learned that the best methodology to learn thick is to first of all gather all the evidences because if I took only the first evidence and neglected the others I would tell you even if you're going to die while traveling if you wish you can fast but once I tell you about the hadith of that fasting while traveling is not part of piety and I tell you about the hadith of the Prophet I'd assume that those who broke their fast took all of the reward you know and understand so you have to before judging an issue look for the evidence is collect them analyze them try to join all of them together and then you will find in sha Allah the right conclusion the following hadith is hadith number 189 and who will read that for us yes second brother there narrated aisha was your low on her sometimes i missed some days of Ramadan but could not fast in lieu of them except in the month of Shaban I shammy Allah be pleased with her is telling us that she used to delay she used to postpone making up for the days missed in Ramadan and making them up and we're in shaban which is the month before the second ramadan in sahih muslim she justified this by saying due to my position from the prophet re salatu salam meaning that she wanted to make herself available to the prophet alayhi salaatu was salaam we have a short break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back our mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her she says that she used to delay she used to postpone making up for the days missed in Ramadan and of course we know what why she missed them because of her monthly period so she would not make up these days immediately which indicates that it is up to you if you miss a day or two while traveling you don't have to make them up in show one or the garda you have the whole year but you have to make them up before the end of Shaban because then Ramadan would be due and she told us that she used to delay that due to the fact of her position she wanted to make herself available to the prophet alayhi salatu salam who loved her most and she wanted always to be ready for him however we also can learn from this hadith the ruling on a woman fasting voluntary fasting while her husband is there is it permissible or not it is permissible only if he approves of it a woman cannot fast voluntary fasting while her husband is available until he approves of it or he gives her a general approval so if a woman is interested in fasting Mondays and Thursdays and she tells her husband do you give me an open approval and he tells her if you want to fast the whole week go ahead I could care less so this is a general approval she can fast Mondays and Thursdays without his permission yet if he calls her she must break her fasting to attend his call however when it comes to Ramadan when it comes to mandatory fasting his approval is not required she may fast whenever she wishes and this is up to her therefore mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her she out of her own goodwill wanted to postpone making up for these days until the prophet alayhi salatu salam knew that this was the time for her to make up for Ramadan and that was mandatory and that is why it's okay for a woman to postpone mandatory fasting until just before Ramadan the question that always comes up is that what is the ruling on fasting the six days of shawwal for a woman who has missed days and Ramadan the most authentic opinion is that the six days of show al will not be accepted as in the hadith if there are days missed in Ramadan meaning the Prophet said that is awesome whoever fast ramadan the whole of ramadan and then follows that with six days of shawol this is equivalent to fasting the whole year in another hadith the justification one good deed is multiplied by 10 so Ramadan x 10 these are 10 months and the six days of shawwal x 10 these are 60 days to months so this is the whole year it would not be rewarded if a woman or a man skips a day or two and before making them up fast the sixth day of the days of showa why because the hadith gave the reward to those who fast Ramadan and those who missed a day or two cannot say we fasted Ramadan those who missed seven days cannot say we fasted Ramadan he said I fasted 23 days of Ramadan so they must make up before they fast the six days of shawwal and a lot of the times people say and complain an object I Asia may Allah be pleased with her used to make up for the day's missed and Ramadan and we're in shaban and then they used their logic is it logical that she never fasted the six days of shawan is it possible is it possible that she did not fast are sure she did not first out of her I sure an alpha is different even if you have days missed in Ramadan you can still fast assure an alpha but for the days of show while no you have to first of all make up for the day's miss in Ramadan and then follow that by six days of shawwal and whether it is it logical or not yes it is logical if one says is it logical ayesha did not pray night prayer for five hours or four hours yes it is the prophet used to pray allah salam and she was lying in front of him and whenever he prostrated he pinched her and she took her feet away and he prostrated only when he offered with her he used to wake her up which means that she did not pray night prayer as much as he used to not even close only with her and therefore one does not use his logic when it comes to these issues that deal with fasting do we have any questions Sheikh this is regarding involuntary fasting in that there's a hadith that the Prophet may peace be upon him salalah slim came to one of his wives and ice is there something to eat so she said no so then he said when I'm fasting can you just clarify regarding this kind of involuntary fast this is not involuntary this is voluntary family tree first voluntary fasting mean it's not mandatory and the hadith brother mentioned it is authentic the Prophet Alice of sarum used to pray fetcher and of course after the break of dawn he did not eat anything and he went and when it's daytime at nine o'clock approximately back to his home so he says to his wives do we have any food if they say yes we have this meal they said bring it forward and he eats and if they say no we don't have any he says then I am fasting this we learn from it that it is permissible for a person fasting voluntary fast not to have the intention before the break of dawn but what will be credited for him what he will be rewarded is the period I'll give an example i went to bed at midnight and i did not have the intention of fasting it was sunday tomorrow's monday i woke up at three o'clock in the afternoon whoa i have three hours for maghrib so I prayed to her I prayed Oscar afterwards and couple hours later maghrib was cold and I fasted I intended to fast only at three o'clock so scholars say that I will only get the three hours fasting not the full day which I was asleep so it depends on how or when you and ten these are voluntary fast yes brother shaikh certain people who missed their fasting during the month of ramzan in order to compensate for that they faster later on during the winter season because the duration is quite short and they also justify saying that Allah doesn't want to torture us but I believe their level of the Khalsa comes into the picture so your comments on that there isn't any fat word to my knowledge of forbidden this on the contrary most fat was encouraged this because it was the Prophet himself I think it's awesome who said fasting during the winter is the cold booty call booty any easy booty and the Prophet is encouraging us to fast during the winter season because the day is short so by forbidding people or by telling them not to make up in the winter season you will be torturing them so it's not allowed you are torturing them you say you think no no no you cannot make it in 11 hours at least 15 hours why Allah hamdillah told us in the Quran varied that one mean I mean oh ha that if you skip due to traveling or illness then you can be fast any number of days within the year which is before Ramadan therefore there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah yes brother harlequin she trampled on what is the ruling on a laborer who works all day long and cannot force is there any relaxation for you scholars were asked about the ruling not me of course I'm thrown generally speaking scholars would ask about the ruling on a laborer who works under the Sun in summer from eight o'clock or seven o'clock in the morning until two or three or four o'clock in the evening in the afternoon and they say that it is almost next to impossible to fast and he has no means looking for another job he doesn't have a bachelor degree so that would allow him to pick and choose so what is the ruling the scholars say he must fast however when he reaches the stage where it is life-threatening or he's going to faint then he may break his fast not too intent from the beginning ok I have the whole month of Ramadan I'm working in the morning so I'm not going too fast any day alonzo just says fear Allah to the best durability so I'm as a laborer I take my gear at seven o'clock eight o'clock I start to work at nine o'clock my throat is dry at ten o'clock I'm completely wasted I can barely see in this case yes I break my fast I eat and drink and continue and I have to make up for that day not to come from the very beginning having a big fat English breakfast at six o'clock and then go to work as if I'm not fasting this is not the case I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time
