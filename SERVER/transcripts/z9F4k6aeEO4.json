  "title": "Why is dating not permissible in Islam & Sin of talking about Allah without knowledge- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "second question that a new revert in the u.s. is telling her that she doesn't believe that dating between boys and girls is haram how would they get married if they don't get acquainted to one another and with all due respect this is a common trend among some of the rivers in some of the countries that they have a lot of arrogance in them so they think that converting to Islam and dealing with life like Rambo deals with every thing he sees by arrogance and too much of pride and I know and no one knows a better than me this is the attitude that some again of the reverts have and this is totally wrong and dangerous because now you fall under ayah 33 chapter 7 where Allah lists to us four of the categories that are prohibited by him and at the top the most dangerous one is to say upon Allah what you do not have knowledge and so now she's saying that yes in order to do this we have to allow them to date and the people in the financial sector say in order for us to invest money we have to make RIBA and the people who grow grapes say in order for us to utilize the fruit that people are not doing they have to make winery wineries and and make wine out of it is this people are drifting so far away from Islam they're making their own religion in the u.s. so astonishing and so shocking to find that there are a number of messages with gay in am's hallelujah what religion are you preaching this is Islam these people don't know even the Koran the basics of Islam and they are entitled to have such a homosexual Imam no not only that leading the people what kind of preaching is he gonna preach tomorrow a pedophile would probably have a message for the children and Allah knows what was going to happen next we've heard of this woman an imam of the men and every nowadays you have this is a new religion it has nothing to do with Islam so for this revert we say that what you're saying is totally wrong and out of the question in Islam we protect both boys and girls both men and women we don't allow our women as Muslim women to be to have boyfriends and to go dating yeah but we have the red lines we don't cross what are you talking about our red lines is a Quran and Sunnah and this is totally prohibited if Allah prohibits a woman from wearing perfume and going out where men can find her scent do you think that Allah would allow a woman to chat and socialize with another with opposite gender this is totally a hoax and something that is unacceptable in Islam maybe in her religion her old religion or her new religion that does not relate to Islam this is acceptable but definitely not in Islam"
