  "transcript": "Uh, sister Medha from Egypt asked a question about listening to Quran um as background. Uh, sometimes you you get uh an opportunity you want to revise or study and you put some Quran in the background. Are you allowed to listen to it like this or even put the television on where they're playing the Quran like this? I believe that if this is as the sister explained that this is not permissible. The Quran has been revealed to our prophet wasallam to be listened to and to be recited. I believe that if you're driving or if you're working and you have the Quran in the background, but you are listening, maybe you get a call every now and then, maybe you do something and you're distracted every now and then, this is okay because the majority of the time you are actually listening to the Quran. But if, as she explained, she turns the volume really down. So, she just hears noises but unable to recognize the suras, unable to understand the verses of the Quran. I believe that this is a form of humiliating the Quran. And I would never ever uh like her to do something something like this because it's simulating music. What's the difference? Yes, it's the same thing. Mhm. So uh this is not permissible. Okay."
