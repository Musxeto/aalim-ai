  "transcript": "a sister says I'm going through divorce by force cuz my husband says he never loved me and he's involved in extra marital affairs and it's been two years I'm in this I did everything in my ability from being abused by his parents asking polygamy till giving up my rights we have a son who's 2.5 years two half years I accept the decree of Allah as a Muslim sometimes I'm in rage and tears please advice something which will soothe my heart well my daughter or my sister this is a test from Allah so Jenna there's nothing you can do as long as you have done all what you can in order to fix this problem if your husband is someone who does not fear Allah there's nothing you can do someone who abuses you who talks bad about you someone whose family is against you someone who has extramarital relationships this person is scum with all due respect so it is a lost cause and for you to hang by a thread in such a relationship and still want to go on this is not logical I know that you may have some feelings towards him but these feelings might need to be filtered sometimes a woman in an abusive relationship such as yours has feelings because he's the first man she had ever known in her life he's the father of her child there is oh there was some good times in the relationship but a logical woman must weigh the pros and cons yes if you don't have anywhere to go after a divorce you have to tolerate such abusive husband because this is the the least of the two evils if you believe that there is hope in him being fixed this is a different story but if he's a hopeless case and you know that then there is he's not even worth worth a tear that you shed over him such a person has come he is rubbish he's trash with all due respect I don't know you I don't know him so this is not backbiting and it's okay for me to say that insha'Allah you have to hold your ground move on with your life you're still young and he's not worth waiting for and if his family are oppressive like him so subhanAllah like father like son or like father like mother like son this is not a good relationship to be with so try your level best as a last resort to get mediators to get someone to arbitrate between you and him to find a common ground that maybe would give you some hope but if there is no point in continuing then just leave and never look back and inshallah Sol Allah would substitute you with something better"
