  "transcript": "that's true uh the next one is how can one some people somebody was asking how can one justify sh punishments it's not applicable to this day and age but how do that how did that how would that happen what do you mean by it's not applicable in this day and age from my limited knowledge that's what I know or I think at least okay elaborate please and the head okay is it applicable nowadays not not everywhere let's say very specific area when you say applicable do you mean that if you steal I'll chop your hand off yes so we can't do this now that's I mean yeah yeah but it's doable in Islamic countries of course oh yes yes of course too at least let me say Canada that okay this is a different no no no no no see prescribe punishment is prescribed by whom a judge and a witness a little bit higher the leader or the a little bit higher so it's not for you and me to decide but who is to implement it ah anywhere in the world a prescribed punishment given for a crime committed this prescribed punishment should be uh uh put into effect by The Authority only so the Muslim ruler is the one qualified to do this no one else not the father not even the Holy Ghost not the father not the brother not Tom Dick or Harry only by the Muslim ruler of the countes M so if we have a Muslim ruler that governs and rules a country right and he implements Sharia law it's implemented but no one in his right mind would say okay we are in Canada let's chop someone's hand or let's uh uh flog someone no you can't this is totally unacceptable it's against the law and you should be thrown into jail if you do this this is common sense"
