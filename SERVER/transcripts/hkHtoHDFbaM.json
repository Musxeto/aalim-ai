  "title": "Muslim bus driver let's me on for free Can I accept or must pay fare Amanah in islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "gotcha my question is uh I get the bus um sometimes and uh the bus driver he's Muslim um and sometimes he just sort of lets me on for free uh you know just being friendly um my question is uh is it permissible for me to accept that or do I need to insist that I pay and because it's happened in the past as well do I need to sort of now pay back the bus company for the times that he let me on for free first of all if this driver owns the bus there's no problem in accepting his gift but if he's not the owner and he's just a Hired Hand being paid to drive the bus and collect the fee it is not permissible for you to accept his gift this is not his boss so you have to insist on giving him the the fare now for what was in the past that you did not know the ruling inshallah there is no sin on you the sin is on him or on those who allow this and this is a serious issue that everyone should be concerned of when Allah appoints you in a position and you're in charge this is an Amana and what you're entrusted with there are so many verses of the Quran and Hadith that highlights the importance of Amana and a lot of us are oblivious and sometimes deliberately negligent and ignorant about it because they think that I am the person in charge of the restaurant I can give free meals to my friends I'm in charge of the bus I can give free rights nobody's auditing me Allah is and this is in a manner that you should be aware and this Cascades to all sectors of life where Allah appoints you as a person of charge in charge of a division of a person or persons of property of wealth Allah would hold you questionable for that Allah Knows Best"
