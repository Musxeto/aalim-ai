  "transcript": "avocado okay so the question is regarding or find what to do with finding a lost valuable item okay so it's a scenario based question so I may take a little longer so so the incidence is of 2005 where my sister found a gold necklace pendant okay to make mattress Wars it was a Hindu it has a Hindus ohm symbol on it now what happened is she approached my dad my dad uh due to I don't know uh he says he inquired in and around but as per I don't think he uh inquired as per the one year you know due to lack of knowledge ignorance or greed he decided to keep it fast forward 2021 what happened is he consulted local Mufti and it was with us and the local Mufti said it's been a long time okay so what you can do is you can give the charity and um and use it for yourself so he says in equivalence of maybe Saudi real 3000 he gave it to charity and he he gave it to my sister he added some more gold and my sister is using as a necklace now my question is that I feel we did not do enough back then I was small and maybe because of lack of knowledge he didn't do much to give it to the right person and I feel because of that there's a lot of bad energy and negative energy or marriages are getting till I feel marriage is getting related you're always confused about picking spouses or I mean potential forces or decisions and we lost even our mother due to unusual uh bad health treatment so I want to know what I can't validate that assuming he did in Goodwill Goodwill we are going to pressurize him keep asking him so okay okay in terms of your question first of all your Vibes and negative feelings and whatever is all bogus has nothing to do with this this is all from your own demons and your uh own uh thinking it has nothing to do with this uh a necklace what he did was wrong he should have notified the authorities and those in the adjacent areas of a valuable item lost and waited the whole year because he did not do that he has no right in it hence he has to evaluate how much it costs at the present time and give the amount to charity or give it itself to charity if he did not do that but he just evaluated it and truthfully gave the money that it is worth to charity then your sister can keep it providing its Halal it doesn't have any symbols of Hinduism or of shirk or statues Etc and there is nothing wrong with that your mom's death and the proposals that have been lost has nothing to do with that at all he has to ask Allah for forgiveness and repent"
