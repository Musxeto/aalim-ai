  "transcript": "I have a question um regarding you know having more children so a couple has three children already uh is it allowed for them to decide to not have a fourth one because they want to focus on studying Islamic knowledge for example uh memorizing Quran Hadith study the Arabic language in depth and at the same time focus on the upbringing of the of their children is this a valid reason to not have any more children or about a lot of feet this is an issue of dispute among Scholars some say that as long as you have an adequate number and they never give the number that is adequate of children and both the couple agree that this is maybe enough for now that this is permissible so in your case having three or four children and wanting to slow things a bit maybe five years ten years Allah knows what happens in the future then both of the couple are fine with this they say some Scholars say that this is okay other Scholars say the general Trend and the hadiths of the Prophet is Islam is to go ahead and produce and to have as many children as you want because the prophet is going to boast Islam the other uh Messengers with the number of his followers and he recommended that we marry a woman that's fertile and is capable of giving a lot of children because he said that he's going to boast other nations with our numbers so this is an instruction and a recommendation that we have to keep on having children indefinitely until the assembly line doesn't work anymore I believe that it is permissible to limit the number of children if the number is adequate like three or four or more that's okay but to have one child and then stop and say I don't want to have children anymore or two and have don't want to have any children anymore this is not recommended and some would argue and say that this is not permissible because this device the encouragement of the prophet and there isn't any fixed ruling that said Haram Etc we know that the prophet according to Hadith of Jaber uh may Allah with his father that they used to not have full intercourse with their spouses in order not to have children of course this is done with the approval of the wife and the prophet witnessed that and did not blame them or said no you should not refrain from doing that you should not do this because this would not make your wife pregnant you have to do the whole thing properly he did not comment on it negatively or saying that you're doing something wrong which means that this is permissible but again it's not the best thing to do and Allah Knows Best"
