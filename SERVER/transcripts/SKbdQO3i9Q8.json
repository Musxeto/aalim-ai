  "transcript": "when should you repent and is it ever too late to do so assalamu alaikum and welcome to youth talk i would like to welcome our guest in the studio she has him look minor Hakim a pleasure having with the ship asperger's mine I would also like to welcome my three guests in the studio I have with me Tori who is a student at the Academy of Art I have as well Mohammed who is a translator and Abdullah who is a computer programmer she has him we are talking about we want to talk about repentance first of all let's start off with what exactly is repentance in Islam hungry laughs a lot of cinema I don't really like he was laughing after that before their repentance is comprised of so many things and to go through them I'd probably need a lecture but I'm not gonna do this Oh probably I'm gonna do part of it but as we go on talking about repentance repentance is it's extremely important in Islam since the beginning of the creation of mankind when Adam and Eve ate from the forbidden tree and that by itself was a sin and they repented to allah azza wajal and that is why the almighty descended them to earth with the promise that they if they do well and their descendants that they will go to paradise Satan on the other hand who sent gravely and seduced Adam and Eve to eat from the forbidden tree or from the forbidden fruit did not repent and that is why he was doomed to hell until a for eternity so if you look at the attributes and names of Allah the Almighty you will find that among them is a tell web their ever repenting though the one that could accept repentance of others and and this is ongoing process therefore it is essential for us to know that repentance is not only to those who are simple it is even to those who are pious and full of wretchedness nevertheless they must also repent the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us that all man or men by nature are sinful and the best of these sinful people are those who keep on repenting and he himself the prophet sallallaahu selim who never committed a sin he himself told us that oh people ask Allah surgical forgiveness and repent to him because I personally ask a lot of forgiveness and repent to him in a day more than a hundred times and this is the Prophet the messenger of allah who never did anything that we could may consider it to be as a sin so it does have a very great role in Islam much do because we are ordered to repent or why why do we repent well I wouldn't X was expecting a better question and that is why do we repent or from what do we repent because if you do not acknowledge a mistake you're not gonna fix it if you're not if you do not acknowledge an illness or a disease you're not going to treat it that's why you have to identify the things that you must repent them from and scholars say that repentance is divided into two sections one is prepared repentance and the other is the obligatory repentance so it is preferred for you to repent from doing things that are not recommended it's preferred for you to repent from not doing the preferred things you're instructed to do for example it is recommended that you pray 2 rakaats after Maghrib prayer now if you don't do this it's highly recommended to repent from this so I repent for doing a repent for nun doing you repent for for doing and you repent from not doing so things that are recommended to do if you don't do them you have to repent and things that you are not recommended to do it's mccool but you still do them you are recommended to repent from those for example if you keep on eating with your left hand and drinking with your left hand the majority of scholars say that this is not recommended though the authentic verdict gates it is it is forbidden but let's go with the majority and say it's not recommended for this example then it is recommended for you to repent from this action now this is the recommended repentance we move on to the obligatory repent repentance and it is obligatory for you to repent from committing sin it's obligatory for you to repent from not performing the obligatory acts of worship that you're told to do for example a person that drinks alcohol he is obliged he has to repent from drinking because this is a major sin a person who does not pray with the congregation in the Masjid though he's capable of doing this this is again a sin he is obliged to repent from this sin he has abandoned praying with the Muslims in the congregation does repentance have a certain time I mean after you've done the sin right away or if a times passed and then you repent this is one of the conditions of repentance there are five or six conditions for repenting I don't know you want me to do to please say it normal okay and we will go to your question the first condition for repentance so that your repentance is accepted by the side of Allah that it has to be for the sake of Allah for example a person that smokes and he develops cancer a person that drinks and he developed liver cancer and the doctor the physician comes in to him say listen if you don't stop now you're gonna die so the guy says with his booze in his hands it I'm sure I'm gonna miss you and he repented after he does they said well I'm gonna repent now his repentance is not for the sake of Allah his repentance is because he's afraid he's going to die this repentance is not accepted a person that goes out of his house with all the keys and and and and and the bar towbars and so on he's going he's headed to a rich man's house to rob him and he has everything planned for the minute he reaches there he farms at the police patrol they said oops well I think I'm gonna repent for today and and leaves this repentance is not accepted your repentance has to be for the sake of Allah and you're doing it for Allah this is condition number one condition number two you have to repent by abandoning the sin immediately which means that if I'm committing a sin I have to do it now and it's not acceptable to do it next summer as people do because if you are indulging yourself in a sin you have to repent to stop it immediately if you say no I'm going to go on for a couple of weeks and then repent this is not acceptable and this is the case with the Companions who used to drink alcohol got wine because it was permissible and immediately when the verse of Quran came and said it is forbidden so stay away from it no one can finish the glass he was drinking from immediately they tossed it away and it's over so this is immediate repentance but for someone to come and say well I have the bad habit of smoking I'm gonna kick the habit in Ramadan Ramadan is six or five or four months away no this is not acceptable because you are timing your repentance and this is not acceptable so quitting the sin the third condition is that you must intend not to go back to it again so I my intention is sincere and pure for Allah I'm repenting for him and I immediately stop this sin on the spot a third condition is that you intend not to do it and I give you a simple example there are sins that are connected with seasons so lots of people travel in summer to foreign countries fornicate drink gamble do whatever is forbidden for them to do in their country and when they come back to their hometown they say I've done wrong to myself sinned a lot so I repent to Allah and then they call their travelling agency listen next August 2007 or six don't forget to book me a my ticket round-trip ticket to Rio or whatever this is not acceptable because this repentance is not complete so we have three the fourth one would be that you must feel real burning remorse because of the sin that you have committed you could be sincere you could quit on the spot you could intend not to do it again but you don't feel the remorse so you you enjoy what you did and whenever you sit with your buddies and home is it what won't remember a couple of years ago go go go dad my girl was fine that thing we did was was cool and you enjoy it you don't feel the remorse this is a breach of repentance and that is why the messages of a messenger of allah sallallahu said I'm told us that repentance remorse is repentance three simple words remorse is repentance if you are sad if you feel like your your heart is boiling because you feel the remorse of doing the sin then I give you the glad tidings that Allah has forgiven your sins with their morsel but without remorse you have a big problem the flip condition which brings us to your question would be the time your repentance has to be in a time where it is valid and we have a private time and we have a general time so a private or individual time is for each one of us and this individual time is before the what we call Hara Hara in an Arabic word before your soul reaches your throat - this is seconds before you die and like Pharaoh did because fair when he started drowning and and he he realized that he's gonna die though he was claiming to be God then he said well listen listen I believe in what Musa was preaching and I believe in the God that Musa was calling for Allah told him is it now you want to repent it's too late because you are dying there's no way for you to repent those so this is the time of individuals if you repent before this time your repentance is accepted but if you are your soul is just about to come out and you realize you're dead for sure then your repentance is not accepted as for the general time which is for all mankind this is at the end of time when the Sun rises from the West the Prophet tells us our Sun and that repentance is accepted if the time does not come when the Sun rises from the West we have a final and sixth condition in this depends if I have done others wrong Abdallah had a question I'm just asking they say how could we repent because in our daily life we face a lot of things and this is considered as maybe minor sins as we walk in the street we find those very nice girls and stop and you keep watching them and then get the girls were not nice okay so many things that in our daily life so so I think that we have each 10 minutes to repent so I don't know so how could we do this this the same question was addressed to one of the great scholars of Islam at Hasan al-basri his companions went up to him and said Oh scholar we have a problem we sin and when we conclude we seek the forgiveness of Allah and we repent and then we sin again and then we repent and then we sin again and we repent and ask forgiveness and then we sinned again and then we are ashamed of our Lord we are ashamed of Allah who's we've done so many wrong things so we do not repent or ask for forgiveness because we were ashamed of him so al-hasan al-basri said that by allah this is exactly what Satan wants from you the more you repent Allah repents accept your repentance the more you ask for forgiveness Allah forgives your sins the minute is stopped then it's Satan's game he's happy because you're not seeking the forgiveness of Allah there was a which leads us to another thing and that is the Prophet said sallallahu Selim's acts all mankind are sinful and the bed oh those sinful those who keep on repenting there's a beautiful hadith which means that it is a a higher than the hadith of the Prophet and lower than the Quran these are the hadith that Amazon said but they are the words of the Prophet it's not like that the Quran the meaning and the words from Allah Almighty no hadith Qudsi is that the meaning is from Allah the words are from the Prophet SAW sallam he said that Allah Almighty says whenever the Prophet says that whenever a servant of Allah sins and asks unlocker forgiveness Allah the Almighty says my servant has sinned and he asked me for forgiveness knowing that I forgive sins and I give repentance to those who seek it I forgive him and I do have repentance over him and the prophet says and the man sins again and seeks the forgiveness of Allah and Allah says the same thing and he does it for the third time and Allah says just the same thing and he does it for the fourth time and Allah says the same thing my servant has sinned and he knew that he has a Lord that forgives sins and accept repentance he I forgive him and I give him my repentance and he may do whatever he pleases as long as he keeps on asking me for forgiveness which means that our Lord that our God Allah the Almighty is 11 forgiving God and it's not like what people you know seem to talk about the god of Muslims as being a God of hell a God of punishment this is the wrong idea completely because Islam tells us that our Lord is most forgiving so the more you do sin and you have this remorse in your heart you're sad about it and you want to do something about it but it comes back to you the more you ask Allah forgiveness and repent you will at the end of the day be successful in repentance but there has to have the same conditions of repenting that we just mentioned in the moment yes you do you do have to these conditions and it's easily fulfilled but the problem is that shaitaan/satan didn't leave you alone he comes you say listen in doing this every second two or three minutes why not delay it at the end of the day and repent then and if you do this then that one of the conditions which is to immediately abandon the sin has been missed and even if you do this at the end of the day you'll do it for 3-4 days a couple of weeks maybe a month at a maximum and then you'll completely ignore the idea of repentance and you will think that this is it's not not a big sin and this is what you started saying it's not a major sin which means that it's okay to do so what's the greatest sin that accept acceptance couldn't be done in this repent the the biggest sin why repent when it couldn't accept it I mean there couldn't be accepted there isn't the greatest sin there isn't there isn't the greatest the greatest sin of all is to associate someone else or something else with Allah the greatest sin of all is not to believe in Allah not to believe in the religion of Allah not to believe in the oneness of Allah not to believe that Allah is the one that gives life and takes life not to believe that Allah is the only worthy of being worshipped this is the biggest sin but if you repent of this biggest sin then Allah will accept you and this is exactly what is stated and swore at alcorcón where Allah talks about those who do not associate others with Allah and do not kill innocent people and do not fornicate and whoever does these things will be punished in hell forever except those who repent and do good deed Allah Almighty will transform their sins into good deeds and the interpretation of this is we're interesting some scholars say that Allah will transform their sins to good deeds in the meaning that on the day of judgment when they see because of the repentance from these sins that they had for example a million unit of sins Allah czaja will transform these milli units into a million unit of good deeds so a lot of them would say we wish with it we would had done a little bit more since the other interpretation which is the most authentic is that Allah Allah will transform these sins into good deeds in this life in the meaning that they're associating others with Allah will be transformed into two heat in the belief in the oneness of Allah they're killing innocent people would be transformed into being safe to humanity and to mankind and therefore negation and adultery would be transformed into chastity and being a good citizen that does not porn again and so on what about punishment and in dunya or in our life punishment against sin could it be done here in our life you said that it could be accepted the descent could be the will be accepted so what about punishment by whom by the government by by Sharia I'm saying ok like zina like like like like adultery that is to answer your question there are certain crimes that are punished by Sharia law killing others stealing laundering adultery drinking intoxicants wine and so on these are punished and a few more are punished by Sharia with certain punishments if a person does any of the previous but repents before the authorities cat or he does not confess he depends then Elijah will accept his repentance a person had a girlfriend they've been living together for a few years then they repented then it's okay Allah is most forgiving if it's gone now these are the crimes that we have a fixed punishment on there are other crimes that do not have any punishment though they might be far greater than these mentioned for example being bad to your parents what it's called a local wedding being mad to your parents is far greater than adultery though it's not punished in this life because it's so grave is so serious that no punishment in this world would be enough so what's waiting upstairs is way beyond your imagination because the parents have a great role and right that must be preserved so come back to your question the punishment in this life is not only limited to chopping the hands and the heads and slashing or lashing the the back or whatever stoning to death no no there are further punishments that you may not even see the depression you have is a punishment from Allah poverty is a punishment of Allah illness is a punishment of Allah being far from Allah is by far the greatest punishment of Allah it was reported that a man from the sons of Israel at the time of Moses or whatever may Allah peace and blessing be upon him this man was praying to Allah and he was saying O Lord so many times I sinned and yet you're not punishing me the guy is seeking refuge in you so I'm doing this in yet you are so kind to me you not punishing me so Allah Almighty revealed to this to the prophet of their time and that was there go to this man and tell him all my servant so many punishment I have and you do not feel it is the thickness of your heart the hardness of your heart and the lack of tears that come that do not come from your eyes and feeling that you're doing fine doing well is a punishment only if you could feel and sense this so there are different ways of punishment but because we're away from allah azza wajal as long as we have our wheels and we have a good house and the kids are fine and my bank account is big and wealthy then my Lord loves me and this is a very big mistake okay we've got a break now and we'll be back right after this just a question is what if the person is he was under arrest by the Sharia Authority and he felt that he is wrong and he get back again to God so what about that again if a felon was under arrest now we have to look at the crime so let's presume that his crime Steve was robbing people or killing others so and and he repented would his repentance be accepted though he's under arrest this is the first question the second question then you remind me with that because I'll probably forget it what happens if he was under arrest but he did not repent and then they chopped his hand or chopped his head or whatever going back to your first question one of the conditions of repentance is number six which we did not mention and this is the one whenever the crime is between you and another human being then in order for you to repent you have to clear your record with him in the sense that if I took money from you whether I borrowed it and then ignored I said that I did not take anything from you and you did not have any proof or I stole it from you if I slandered you or said to Abdullah that part of is so and so and so and so and said so many lines about him and you don't know about this this means that I did you wrong now Islam tells me that in order for me to repent that I have to clear my records with you the sense that whatever I stole in order for my apprentice to be accepted I have to give it back if I borrowed money I have to return it back if I said something wrong about you if I hit you if I shed some blood of you because of well fighting I have to seek your forgiveness if this is done then Alonso Jo will accept my repentance this brings us to another issue and that is okay I can bring back the money and give it back to you but this means that they're going to report me and maybe this would cause more harm than good so if I stole the money from you for God's sake so now you're telling me to go well listen let's get some makeup I sold this money I want to give it back to you you could probably gonna have a fight with me and then call the police to arrest me scholars say you have to return the money but you don't have to return it directly in the sense that you can deposit it in his bank account you can put it under his doormat you can just put it in his car and his drawer a secret we can send someone by any other means if again we reach to a point that there is no way possible to return the money back to him and this is a realizing and an imagined if I stole money from someone and this person left to the country or died yeah if he left the country I don't know where about his whereabouts so what would I do scholars say take the money you stolen or what is equivalent to it and spend it and the means of charity and to give it to a poor person someone's getting married and arpan whatever and anything that is good building a mosque mosques are not accepted next quarter state because mosque art should not be built except with pure money this is another issue going into it we could probably take a look but you have to spend this money on the intention that the reward goes to the one who stole from it's not because your a nice and generous person no you're just getting rid of this money so if you do this then your repentance is accepted going back to the second question I think idea I didn't forget this yeah and that is what happens if the authorities arrest a person who did something that was strong and then he was sentenced to be either executed or his punishment because he stole money he we must chop his head off his hand off or because he drank alcohol it was caught drinking he must be whipped 80 lashes on his back what happens if the guy was arrested sentenced yet he did not repent scholar said say that the grace of allah the mercy of allah stated that if the the punishment has been implemented this it raises his sin even if he did not repent because allah even because allah is so generous that he does not combine two punishment on the same felony so imagine if my hand was what was chopped off god forbid and then when i go at the day of judgment Allah will throw me in hell because I stole money this is double jeopardy and this is not the case at humbly lack in our religion is the case or can repentance all types or repentance accepted all the time I mean all the said all sort of sending me all type of sins that repentance can be accepted for or is it certain situations I mean a few moments ago when you were saying that if you've done a sin and then you repent and you could possibly recur it again and then you repent again and it's accepted I mean other sins where there are repentance or situations where repentance is not accepted alhamdulillah no all type of sins that as long as you repent before your soul goes out that is accepted and this is part of the general see and and kindness of our Lord of Allah as ocean he created us and he knows that we are not perfect he knows that by nature we are sinful and he almighty enjoys it when we ask him for forgiveness so no matter what you do providing that you are asking Allah for forgiveness then he will forgive your sins providing that the conditions are fulfilled in the sense that I could sin and ask for forgiveness with my tongue only by saying oh Allah I seek your forgiveness but in keeping the hearts what are you kidding me tomorrow night we have with this party time so this intention only Allah knows about it the remorse only Allah knows about it if you don't have the remorse and you say well I guess I'm just repenting just for the heck of it or just in case I died today okay do you find the remorse in your heart well no but who knows no Allah knows so all kinds of sins are accepted your repentance of all kind of sins it's accepted because Allah is forgiving so one has to repent from all sins manner over media are the degrees of repentance in terms of in other words that shall I perform repentance for minor sins and another repentance for major sins or repentance are the same for all sins well each there's a general repentance condition that you by nature you have to be repenting but for each and every individual sin there has to be a specific repentance because you cannot come at the end of they say o Allah I'm repenting from all okay can you count them no said yes I can I'm America from looking at females without any legitimate right I'm repenting from swearing I'm repenting from slandering I'm repenting from playing from gambling I can't repent from smoking the I didn't think of that so I skipped this so general repentance is not accepted because you have to have remorse over each and every single sin that you commit but in essence yes generally you have to keep on repenting asking Allah for forgiveness but when it comes at the end of the day of this particular sin it has to have its particular repentance no I mean that I want to repeat from lying for example should it like me the same way when I repent from fornicating I think like that is it connected that all sins I have to paint from them at the same time or can I repent from a sin and still commit is the method of repenting force for sin like lying the same as the way I would repent for a sin like fornication it's the same thing what I mean yeah yeah it's the same thing as long as it's not between me and another human being is between me and Allah the same methodology is applied and that is it has to be sincere the conditions it has to be on the spot I have to intend not to do it again I have to have the remorse and then it has to be in the valid time despite the gravity of two sins lying it's the same very sin the same is a sin but the the sincerity and the level of repentance would definitely grow the heavier and the bigger the sin is so if someone watches for example movies and watching movies is a sin because it involves looking at the opposite sex listening to music witnessing lights so no no not but if you're watching a movie that does not have any women the opposite sex that is it does not have music and it's a documentary that adds value to you that this is okay this is permissible there's no problem in that so I cannot compare watching movies to fornicating and when you repent from this you have to have far greater remorse from fornicating cuts a major sin then watching move which is a minor sin so but the methodology is the same the conditions are the same focus whatever with what if someone said that Allah is merciful and he's the most merciful so I can make this sin and then I'll repent how how could yeah this is this is understood if there is no remorse it's exactly like going to a child and slapping him in the face and give him a candy bar and seconds later you slap him again on the face and give him another candy bar the third time you do this he's gonna shoot you and Allah has a higher example of course you cannot play with a lot like this he knows your intention he knows what's in your heart so if you sin and repent with the intention to do it again and again and again and again this is not repentance there is no remorse in it but by human nature if you sin and repent and he said I'm not gonna smoke this secret cigarettes no more and you tossed a pack of cigarette the trashcan seconds later you get the urge and you ask your buddy gonna have a cigarette and it gives you a cigarette you smoke it you enjoy it and after you finish it you feel the remorse again it's real it's not fictional it's not something that you make you're making up it is real I am NOT happy without what I'm doing I feel little more said I send and you intend to repent and a minutes later you take another one and it goes on on at the end of the day this is not gonna go for for a long time a long time because it's either you're gonna smoke without any repentance or you gonna quit print and stop my mood question you wanted to pose so sure to open just to observe the fifth or six conditions of repentance as the case may be are the in rituals such as posting a certain day of certain number of days or prayers or giving something out in charity just to support to to make sure that my acquaintance is somehow good okay Jerell is speaking repentance is something that is not physical it is an intention it's a feeling that is mainly remorse and intention not to continue or do this a act of sin again so it is not something physical nevertheless there are things that if a person say this would add value to his repentance and this seeking the forgiveness of Allah so just for example the Prophet told us soul asylum that there is the master of asking a lot of forgiveness it's a supplication that a person says and this is the elite the Cadillac of all supplications and asking Allah social for forgiveness it's called sayyidil is still part it's a long a supplication but it is nice because it you acknowledge in it that Allah is your Lord and that you are his servant and that he has created you and you worship Him and that he controls your life and you accept his judgment and that your sins are so overwhelming yet you confess of them and his blessings and good tidings are again so overwhelming and you acknowledge them and therefore because of the previous things of your acknowledgement of knowing that you are his servant and Schley and that he is your master you seek his forgiveness because no one else can forgive you so this is called say that is the heart it is extremely important for a Muslim to say it every day and every night after Fajr prayer and after Maha prayer and the Prophet says the Prophet SAW solemn says that whoever says it before he goes to bed and dies he is bout to go to heaven and whoever says it in the morning and dies is bound to go to heaven so this is something that you say as for fasting praying performing pilgrimage these are all good deeds that add value but they do not we don't have any symbolic ritual that represents a repentance for example the Prophet says sallallaahu are do you sell them the five daily prayers o Mara to the other or the following Umrah hedge all the Roma Bahn to the following Ramadan all of these Eliezer gel will forgive the sins between them which means that the more good deeds you do the more credit you have the less a sins you you'll be having because the good deeds erase the the bad ones I know some people who say that if I don't wake up for Federer he intends to punish himself by passing that day so it's permissible or is it some no this is not permissible and I'll tell you why first of all this form of punishment makes Satan exceeds his ways and control over a person because the other way around yes maybe the other way no no no it's never the other way around because you are innovating now people missed such a prayer at the time of the Prophet SAW silence the Prophet himself missed one Fajr prayer as wood they were travelling in the authentic hadith one one time they were travelling in the desert and when they had the caravans set and at the tent you know they were spending the night in one area the Prophet asked his companions who will you know wake us wake us up for Fajr prayer badad said I'm your man so Bilal was awake but during the night he just put his back on to one of the camels and then went to sleep and they all woke up when the Sun was in the middle of the sky almost the Sun has already risen so the Prophet said belad what have you done he said by Allah whatever made you fall asleep made me fall asleep this is a margin so the proper did sleep and he never punished himself or the others by attaining them well you have to chop a hand or a leg or you have to perform a number no no that's not like this at all by imposing on yourself that you should do something fast or spend fifty reals or hundred riah of whatever every courtesy you using by imposing this on yourself whenever you miss a prayer you are adding something to our religion you are innovating and you are making this form of worship a punishment mm-hmm so then you should perform this worship sincerely to Allah so Chen with the intention of doing something good not as for murrs punishment because then this will keep on going on and on and at the end of the day you'll end up hating fasting and you will probably miss more and more prayers it is wrong to worship Allah only by punishment look at the bright side so don't punish yourself look at the rewards and the bounties at the side of Allah if you pray to fire on time this would help you more to pray rather than you know telling yourself I'm going too fast I have a question here if someone didn't test during the month of Ramadan a certain days so he wants to repent from this and he repented so should he compensate you know the days that he didn't pass or not okay that's very very good question there are forms of punishments on each thing you do which is a sin whether it's a sin that you commit it or an oblique eater thing that you have abandoned which is by its sin so fornicating drinking intoxicants and so on these are sins that you perform but there are things that you do not do which are which which are obligatory and they are considered to be sent such as fasting Ramadan if you don't pass a day of Ramadan this is a sin by itself so how can I repent one by doing the things that we've stated that the conditions to by compensating for it and this falls under the remorse condition because if you don't do it because Allah tells you to do it do you have to compensate by doing it and this does not apply to all in the sense that okay I missed few years of prayer and I get this question a lot yeah but people come to me and say listen I didn't pray I knew I had to but I didn't I just you know goofed I didn't do it a guy comes in and said listen yesterday's mother I didn't pray so must night can I pray it now a lot of the scholars say yes you met you can you can compensate you have to do it again but the authentic opinion of scholars is yet you don't form ears if it's one prayer if it's five years prayer regardless of the time if you miss a prayer because you overslept or because you forgot then you can create the minute you wake up or the minute you remember other than that if you intentionally abandon a prayer this example for example mother prayer the moderate prayer was called I didn't pray why I was working on my laptop I was watching a football match I was having fun okay did you forget it no every single second my father comes to me and say go and pray go and pray and I don't until Asia prayer was called which means that that time has run out and then it came back to me it hit me and said I didn't promote it intentionally okay I'm gonna pray it now scholars say sit down don't promote it and if you pray it's not gonna be accepted kasi why is that we always we always know that I can compensate for prayers that I've missed scholars say the hadith of the Prophet SAW Solomon where he says whoever sleeps over a prayer or forgets it he must pray it the minute he remembers it there is no explanation for it except that there's no kabbalah for it except that so the scholars say and this is the opinion of heaven taenia that the Prophet gave two reasons sleeping and forgetting thing but those who leave it intentionally Allah Almighty said that that the prayer was made to be on time so it's like someone coming on the day of Arafah which is the night of the pager he comes three days later and says oops I missed Arafah well today is 12 of the Hodja I'm gonna stand on the Mount of Erica and considered this a Haj saïd no the time is over and it's over you cannot do it again Shahana I'd like to thank you of course for joining us sheikh hassan book minor Hakim it's been a pleasure having you with us I'd also like to thank the three participants who were with us that story mode and Abdullah thank you for joining us and we'll be back again with another episode of youth talk soon Salaam alaikum"
