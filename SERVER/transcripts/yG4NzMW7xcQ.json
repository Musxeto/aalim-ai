  "transcript": "faizan from saudi arabia he says there's there was a situation where the imam was reciting an ayah with sujud of recitation in it so he said the last verse of surat and najim and he said allahu akbar so all the muslim they thought that he's going for sujud so they went for sudude he the imam knowing that it's not mandatory actually he went for rukur so the imam was in record everybody else was in sujood when he said those in sujud figured it out so now we are in a dilemma what should we do well the scholars say this negligence due to this mistake is forgiven so they should immediately stand up from their sujud and durukur though the imam went to to sujud imam is standing up for saying and immediately afterwards go for uh rising up from ruko and catching up with the imam so being late in a pillar or so is forgiven for such a mistake and allah azza knows best"
