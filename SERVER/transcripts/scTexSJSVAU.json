  "title": "How to get Courage to give Dawah to my Non-practicing Family? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "about math says Allah has given me guidance and I practice Islam but my family back home is not practicing and I do not get the courage to stop them or tell them what they are doing is wrong for example doing on Islamic things like taking loans from the banks eating with the left hand etc how to get the courage to speak up first of all a birth man i pray to allah azza wajal that he keeps you steadfast on abiding by the Sunnah of the Prophet are in salat WA Salam and sticking to the Athena of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaa because this by far is the greatest blessing of allah azza wajal upon an individual secondly what you're facing is merely doubts and whispers from shaitan allah stated clearly in the quran in many places that satan frequently throws fears and intimidates people so that they would not progress and follow the religion correctly allah says in surah al-e-imran in nama daddy come o Shaytan who you hug with Alia a fella - - wah-ha phony in kuntum mu'minin' verily that satan is intimidating you through his followers so do not fear them rather fear me that is Allah Azza WA JAL so this is what Satan does Allah tells us that the believers those who fear Allah they might be afflicted by some of the whispers of Shaitaan yet once they remember they are observant and they can see and they can avoid these things Allah said about an edge wa and an edge wa is when to speak privately in the presence of a third who does not know what's happening this saddens him because they might be plotting something against him which is prohibited in Islam whenever there are three of us we must not talk and isolating the third without him participating or at least hearing and listening to what we see what we say Allah says in the Malaysia I'm in a shape on this private talk is from Satan and the purpose is so that he would sadden and depress the third person and this is why it's prohibited so there are so many places in the Quran listen where Allah shows us the work of Satan and how it is done therefore you should know that such a fear is from Shaitaan now if it were something worldly like someone is interested in buying a car which you know is not a good thing to do and you have knowledge of it you would not hesitate to intervene if it were something medical that you've gone through and you know that this medication has this particular side effects and they're talking about it you would have no problem in saying no this is a bad medication I had the following sentences and then I changed it and this and that happened but you have to notice that if you speak in any other field you would not have this fear nor intimidation only if you want to speak about Islamic things then this shows you that this is from Shaitaan definite and he's working hard to stop you from benefiting others now having said that this does not mean that you become the moral police or the Islamic police every time you see something wrong grow your beard okay your moustache is too long it's exceeding your lips cut it short your trousers are below your ankles my friend the way you're sitting is not right are you eating with your left you're doing this are you should not laugh so loudly don't use vulgar words no I would Willa no one will ever sit with you if you're like this so are you saying that I should not speak no you should call to a large way with wisdom and nice fair preaching and wisdom dictates that you prioritize things first so people that you had not seen for a couple of years because you're an expat being an expat and you're coming back home after two or three years and they see you and you immediately start pointing fingers at them the first thing they would say what hobby this is what they usually say because even if they don't have the ammo to defend themselves but this is the easiest way to defend which is attack tarnish your reputation discredited discredit you so the right thing to do is first you have to have a long term objective and a short term objective so your long term objective is that they embrace RT that understand knowledge amount that they think highly and abide by the Quran and the Sunnah if you manage to do this alhamdulillah they start to love you they start to respect you and when you say something they listen to you not only that they come to you seeking advice and you will find that day because now they trust you and love you they send you whatsapp messages what do you think of this is this halal is this Haram so you become a beacon in their society because now you've managed to gain their love and respect so this is a priority now in short-term objectives sometimes addressing them in public would repel them from your Dawa so try to avoid this try to make it one-to-one try to always sound apologetic so you speak to them individually okay like you did something over there a few minutes ago I didn't want to address it in front of everyone else because and I'm really embarrassed I don't know how to tell you this but please I beg of you do not feel angry can you accept my advice and if you don't want to accept it I'm okay with that but please I I really love you anyone if you give an introduction like this would say okey whatever you want to say say it I'm going to accept it even if you insult me even if you swear at me I'm okay with it because your approach is beautiful and then you start to talk about the priorities growing the beard is not your number one priority maybe clipping the nails is not wrong haircuts is not maybe you should focus on if a person does not pray if a person maybe says something that goes against the heat or curses the religion or says something that is blasphemous this is a priority maybe the way they talk to their parents you should address this to them so focus on an issue at a time while trying to implement not implement to install in their hearts your respect and love let them feel your sincerity and insha Allah you'll be able to speak to them without any fear in the future"
