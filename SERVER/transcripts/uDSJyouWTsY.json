  "title": "Many contradictions in hanafi books when compared to authentic hadiths #islam #ramadan assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Shake uh I have usually seen so many contradictions uh uh to your fatwas regarding from my hafi m. So whenever I get confused I always get to see some references that go against the authentic hadith in the hanafi uh texts such as the musaf of Shiba and Kubra and some other books. I want to know the authenticity of these books whether they are authentic or not because they always seem to contradict the authentic hadith in the these these have authentic and weak narrations. So you cannot paint them with the same brush. You have to be a scholar of hadith and to filter each and every hadith by studying the narrations and going back to the students and uh to the scholars of hadith who would filter it for you and you cannot depend on such books while ignoring the sah and the sunn as well."
