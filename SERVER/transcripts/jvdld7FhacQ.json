  "transcript": "final question for today's episode is from Hua is it permissible for a woman to become a pilot when you say a pilot most likely you're referring to a commercial pilot and a commercial pilot is one of usually two maximum three sitting in the cockpit so you have a pilot a captain and a co-pilot the first officer some old aircrafts had flight engineer sometimes you have a second officer sometimes you have an IP instructor pilot or a Check Airman to examine either one of you but generally speaking it's only the two of them and by nature of the job Pilots travel so a woman first of all cannot travel without a male M accompanying her because the prophet prohibited that so this is restriction number one secondly she cannot be in seclusion with an UNM so she's the pilot and the co-pilot is a man and they sit in the cockpit for 6 hours taking off Landing traveling and sitting navigating and that is totally prohibited the prophet said no man sits in seclusion with a woman except the third person with them in that cockpit or that area is Satan himself so what do you think Satan is going to tell them uh why don't you guys memorize Surah mul it gets you closer to Allah of course not therefore it's totally prohibited for a woman to work as a pilot or to travel without a Maham as a Hostess for example and we know what happens of course we don't paint them all with the same brush but what do you expect a woman who's single who travels and has layovers in different countries in five star hotels seven or eight days a month she stays for two three nights in each layover and she's working with men with purses with uh uh flight attendants or male and having breakfast lunch dinner in the restaurants with pilots and they mix and they go shopping together hello what do you expect such jobs are extremely dangerous for the Chastity of women a lot of such women fall into Zena they're human you put fuel next to fire please God please Ya Allah don't let it ignite it will burn and this is what's happening worldwide as everybody knows so this is not something a Muslim would want in his CV in front of Allah on the day of judgment not even in front of normal people may Allah Asel protect us and our daughters and our sons from such fitna"
