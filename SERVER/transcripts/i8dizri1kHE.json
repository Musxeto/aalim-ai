  "transcript": "foreign [Music] a hundred times my husband is mocking and saying that how a man can divorce her his wife for so many times I think he might say like this divorce divorce divorce and I stopped him and I said him that what are you doing you should not stay like this and he said me that I already mentioned I'm not divorcing you I'm talking about that man and the other day we have a fight and I'm treating him that if you are not gonna provide for me I will fight for divorce and he said do whatever you like yeah is this or is this two incident count as a divorce because I am getting this whisper that this might count as a divorce and it happens so many times I might be living in jaina first of all when you ask your husband or you state to your husband if you don't provide for me I'm gonna file for divorce this means that you have the intention and the willingness to break the marriage this is not normal it's not normal for a wife to go and address her husband such a fashion nevertheless the word divorce has to be accompanied by intention in the sense that if I for example was giving a lecture in the Masjid and among the audience is my wife and I'm discussing the chapter that deals with marriages divorces custody and the likes and I come to the chapter that deals with divorce and I'm teaching the students and say that so if a man says to his wife if I say to my wife I divorce you this is a clear statement of divorce so if I say I divorce you or you are divorced then the divorce takes place my wife cannot jump and say alhamdulillah he divorced me three times he says I divorce you I divorce you you're divorced so now I'm final finally I'm divorced this was like a life sentence let's go I said wait hold your horses what are you doing she said you divorced me and I asked the students did I divorce her every single one would sit of course not check he were teaching us the phrases of divorce and we were dealing with FIP issues so this is not a divorce and what your husband said this is not a divorce he was just merely repeating what the Sheikh had said on the video and also when he asked you to ask or to file for divorce this is not initiating divorce this is what you said and he said if you want to get a divorce get a divorce but he did not say I divorce you likewise intentions if a husband says to his wife I will divorce you next week I will divorce you this is not a divorce it's something in the future divorce has to be in the present tense or in the past tense and Allah Knows Best"
