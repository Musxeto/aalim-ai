  "transcript": "slamming over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Delma birth I'm attending alanine nabina muhammad in wada early he was happy he a Germany back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the topic is about to heat the core of all messengers of allah however this topic usually is a little bit technical there are no stories there are no jokes it is a serious topic however it is the most important topic you could ever learn in your entire life and I'm not exaggerating without the heat you cannot enter paradise full stop sure I'm a good person I pray I fast I give zakat I have a lot of charity let me repeat this maybe he did not hear me well without tell he'd you cannot enter Jenna because Jenna requires a key and the only key suitable for the lock of Jannah is the heat allah azza wajal says and most of them believe in Allah while they are in the state of silk the majority the vast majority of us believe in Allah but we are still associating others with Allah as I will inshaallah point out in a quick fashion if possible so that the time would not be any rush us this ayah indicates that it is an obligation upon each one of us to purify his faith because Allah says woman Makara humble la ilaha mucukunda vast majority do not believe in Allah and accept that they associate others with him so in order for us to enter gender we have to purify our faith our Eman though heat is the only thing that saves you from and it is the dawa of all messengers of Allah it is the call of all messengers of Allah of know of Salah of Shahi of ibraheem Moses Jesus all of them Allah says in so many places in the Quran all my people worship Allah you have no deity other than him then will you nor fear him this is the call of Noah to his people the call of Saleh to Hammoud the call of Sri to median the call of every single prophet allah confirms this when he says in the quran and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship allah and avoid pollute the heat again and this is the core purpose of creating the humans in the gym sometimes we get these ideas why did Allah create us and the answer comes to you in the Quran and I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me so again tell hey but nowadays we watch a lot of the media we have social platforms social media we have face hell or Facebook as they call it we have Twitter Instagram snapchat the whole nine yards and in yet we also have deviant calls trying to repel you to make you stay away from though Haiti don't listen to the heat people who go to hit and wahhabis Santa Fe's listen that they hate the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam they do this they do them so ignorant people would buy what they're selling people of intellect like Huey sha Allah would not do that they say I have my brains if the ship is speaking trash I can tell and if he's speaking logic from the Quran and from the Sunda would you reject this no way so listen to what I have to sell you and if you're buying I'm giving it to you for free or what I need is Jessica Maharani ya Billiken Hammond this is more than sufficient for me what is no heat and where did you get this word one of the Diaries once was approached by someone and this lady was asking him to promote the hate in his talks he was so mad that he blasted on her saying where is the hidden the quran' if the heat was important it would have been in the Quran so come let us meet him he has a point in a way what does he is there he'd mentioned in the Quran by name no but the whole of the Quran is on what until hate but I will come to explain to you what is the meaning of the he that we're talking about however footnote this is out of the lecture it is crucial it is extremely important that you be full of people who would like to segregate Quran from the rest of the deal claiming that whatever is in the Quran we will take whatever is not in the Quran we will not take is this logical is there in the Quran that Fazil historico I'm already three and the rest are four is there in the Quran that zakat can be two point five percent can be five percent can be ten percent can be twenty percent these are four types of zakat sir who is only know 2.5 well see this is why you've come to you I can teach you but I want now my topic is the heat that mistake to toe heat so what is the biggest and most dangerous fitna in the whole world I'm asking shirk hello they did have lunch late I didn't have lunch that's why I'm a little bit hyper social mean you know if you don't know the biggest fitna on earth you are in trouble huh Reba no our the village - am I in the wrong place what women I wish but no more dangerous than women the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam there is no messenger or prophet that was sent to his people except he warned from the greatest fitna ever that that subhanAllah how don't you how do you not know the greatest fitna is the giant mentioned in the Quran Subhan Allah so how can you claim that wallah if it's not in the Quran I will not accept it if it had importance allah would have mentioned it this is nonsense allah revealed the quran to be a general book that is a miracle to the end of time ask the christians where i where is the miracle of jesus they say he used to cure the elder leopard the blind the deaf etc i said show me said we don't have any proof he had a table coming from the heavens and they ate from it show me and he can't ask the Jews what is the miracle of your prophet they say he split the sea and crossed it can I see said no we have to believe in that we don't see anything he had a staff that changed into what now okay a snake and he did this he did that but no one on earth can prove the miracle that His Messenger is true only the Muslims we believe that food Moses is a prophet and his salat WA Salam and Jesus is a prophet we believe in all prophets of Allah because they mentioned in their book he said okay what is the miracle of your prophet that he made the the moon split show me I can't the Prophet did this the Prophet did that show me I can but I have this or and which is my miracle and in it without any doubt a miracle until the end of time the only on earth of a religion that is in the native language of people who speak it how many Arabs do we have three hundred and fifty million and they all can read the Quran and understand it natively and even if we come to all copies of the Quran and we burn it to the ground there is not a single copy remaining tomorrow we will write an identical copy because it's preserved in the hearts of tens of millions of Muslims seven-year-old in Indonesian doesn't know a single word in Arabic I lead the prayer in the messages I make a mistake he corrects me la ilaha illallah he doesn't and I don't feel arrogant Allah say no you don't know I can take I'm correct myself because this is the book of allah allah preserved it neither the jews can bring me the old testament neither the christians cannot bring me the new testament no scriptures aramaic translated into Hebrew translated into Latin translated into English who knows what the original said or an is the miracle so don't expect it to tell you every single thing but at the same time don't be blinded by claiming that the heat is not there the heat is there the heat is to make something one what is one in Arabic why head Allahu Ahad so it all stems from the same word in Arabic - he is from Y hada to make something as one and technically speaking it is divided into three categories what are these three categories the hydrophobia toe heel toe heel toe heel nazma was she fat can you translate we don't know Arabic okay I will do that the first type of the hate I feel like in a microwave mashallah with all this light in front of me if I get tan that's good I forgot my kingdom hey excuse me for doing this but otherwise I'm gonna melt like butter so I have to get some air so chef take us easy no heat what is the heated rububiyyah no hado Bravo BIA actually means the oneness of Allah or the hidden the of lordship what do you mean by lordship who's your lord allah azza wajal can you explain Allah is the creator Allah is the provider Allah is the giver of life and death allah azza wajal is the facilitator of everything we do correct Soto he drove obeah how do I worship allah azza wajal by acknowledging that no one lives risk except him no one gives success except him no one gives life or takes it except him no one facilitates our affairs except him so these are the things that only him can do who makes the rainfall Alonso who makes the crops grow allah azzawajal so this is mentioned in the book of allah in so many places but it's never referred to as though hey Dorobo be because we don't have to one verse Allah says in the Quran say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing and the sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who disposes their affairs they will say the idol worshipers they will say Allah even though I the worshippers acknowledge Allah then says we you not then be afraid of a loss punishment what is this Allah is telling us about his attributes about his actions and this is the hadoo rubia so if i come and say this person has the ability to grant me risk or that person or that idol can make my wife pregnant this is I'm associating others with Allah because this is only done by Allah and this is why when Ibrahim peace be upon him spoke with that tyrant king trying to call him to Islam he says my lord gives life and death what did the King say he said I also give life and death bring me two prisoners he brought them boom executed one and the second one he said go you're free so I give life in death Abraham did not go technically no no I did not mean that no no no no we don't have time they brahim simply said ok Allah brings the Sun from the east bring it from the West the guy was helpless Hamas this I cannot reply to I cannot do that then this means I'm not a god so this is what kind of toe hate rubia the hate of lordship to acknowledge that he's not your lord so if you go to a court and the judge says bow to me and say yes my lord hey hey hey wait where are you this is not possible my lord is allah azza wajal which moves us to the second type of toe heel toe heel although he the toe heel of worship meaning i do not worship other than Allah okay what do you mean by worship any form of worship that can only be attributed to Allah if you actually beauty to someone else this that you are mushrik give me an example hello ha says that frustration salah power slaughtering for mallanna for her the peel for the grave a great person calling for help Alma that Alma dad al how fellows to someone who is dead all of these forms of worship if I swear I tell you swear by Allah you did not steal I swear by Allah I did not steal swear by your share that you did not see how I cannot lie sure no I would Willa how do you want me to go to hell I can just swore by Allah he Allah is forgiving but my Sheikh will take me to hell this is happening this is Allah says in the Quran and your Lord has decreed that you not worship except him okay and allah awj says also in Surat Annisa and worship Allah and do not associate any with him so this is the hidden although here there are hundreds of verses of the Quran if you read it it all tells you do not associate others with Allah not in swearing not in fearing not in hoping not in invoking not in seeking refuge in all of this is Haram providing that this is something only Allah can do meaning I have a big box please can you give me a hand is this Haram huh why is holid because he's able to carry it but if I tell him a fee please can you make me fly you know I fly literally it's like or he can my father died yesterday can you bring him to life this is Sheikh only Allah can do this I cannot ask of you fear if I see a lion coming to me I said I have no heat I'm not going to be afraid fear is only from Allah Bon Appetit he will eat you but this is natural fear you see a lion coming what do you do I'm the hell away a brother sent me a question said chef I am praying and a lion comes to attack me should I continue to pray I said to him yes if your wood is intact yes but most likely if you're praying and a lion is next to you I think you're gonna lose your Google so it definitely you cannot pray what questions is this some people sometimes I'm alone so though hidden below here is the most important ahead of all three times wine because the idol worshipers believe that their idols cannot benefit them they believe that it is only Allah who created the heavens and earth no one comes and says Jesus created the heavens and earth no one comes and says Buddha is the provider or the one who created the they all acknowledge only God only Allah only the Creator who is worthy of being worshipped but we associate others with him for different reasons and this is why all the messengers were sent to their nations because they wanted to clear out this ship of the land Allah says and we did not send any messenger before you O Muhammad sallallaahu are yours in them but we inspired him saying la ilaha illa Ana there is no one that is worship worthy of being worshipped except I Allah so worship me alone and none else all messages of Allah were sent with this type of emphasis on to heat though he did Allu here so if someone believes and there are a lot who say I believe in the existence of Allah even Christians I believe that Jesus is not the Son of Allah he is a messenger I believe that Allah the Aegean is the creator the provider sotto hidden rubia is intact yet he worships other with Allah he asks other with Allah he is a mushrik finally not for the lecture only for the divisions of the he was just warming up I'm warming up you're sitting here in cold mashallah conditioning is coming - masha'Allah tabarak Allah will not give it evil eye goes break said she did it anyhow the third is what though he do and asthma asthma is a plural of ism ISM is the name so and so fat is the plural of safar so the toe heat of names and attributes of allah azza wajal and this is quite easy do not call allah azza wajal except with what allah called himself in the quran or his messenger sallallaahu is seldom called him can any of the companions of the prophet come to us and say so and so is the name of allah this is unacceptable because they cannot do this without attributing it to revelation to him without what he it's unacceptable so the toe heat of asthma was Seaford comes only from revelation 1 and though heat asthma was the path is based on affirming and negating allah azzawajal says in the quran this beautiful concise but perfect ayah Allah says there is nothing like unto him this is negative there is nothing like unto him as though a ducati okay where is the affirmation and then Allah says immediately and he is the all-hearing the all-seeing so when we say there is nothing on to him like him but we affirm that he hears attribute that he sees attribute ok I hear an I see is it the same no the I'm alive Eliza life is my life and Allah's life the same Allah's life is mandatory and eternal he was he is the first without the beginning the last without an end and nothing is like him subhanahu wa'ta'ala so you have to believe that Allah is excelled nothing is like him but at the same of time you have to give him the names and attributes that he gave to himself and the messenger alayhi salatu salam described him with now having gone through though he did anything you hear sound illogical seriously raise your hand if you have question if you have queries about what I said we will open the floor for questions any questions even if it's something any against Islam but you need clarification maybe someone who's not a Muslim among us maybe a person whose Christian he has some doubts no problem take your freedom I don't have any guns with me now but it's in the car I can bring it no don't worry so what I said about the heat does it sound logical is it from Quran and Sunnah then why are they tarnishing the reputation of the head before we go to that if there is enough time which I don't think maybe a la créme let us see some of the benefits of the heat one Allah Azza WA JAL sent the messengers revealed the scriptures to them only for the sake of establishing to eat Allah says in the Quran and we sent not before you any messenger except that we revealed to him that there is no deity except me so worship Me so Allah tells us in black and white in the Quran no messenger was sent except for this purpose purpose of what though he pipe to heat one of the benefits it erases all of your sins we're sinful but if you have proper towhead now I'm not talking about the theoretical what I told you about the three types this is what theoretical meaning that you have to implement it in your life otherwise any professor in Cambridge or in Yale who is a professor in Islamic studies but he's not a Muslim if I asked him would he answer yes we would write a thesis because this is his speciality I would he will tell me though he drew beard or hidden small suffer to hit the loo here - and that does it benefit him because he's not implementing it so this theoretical part we're through now the actual implementation Allah erases all of your sins if you implement it correctly the Prophet said Allah salatu salam allah the almighty said this is hadith Qudsi o son of Adam if you come to me with water bags filled of sins as much as it would fill the whole earth meaning that if you come with sins as much as the whole earth but you do not associate others with me I will fill the whole earth forgiveness for you with the he because you have to heat your sins will be countered by Allah forgiveness okay among the benefits of the heat the first thing you are asked about in your grave is toe heel Allah says in the Quran Allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word this is a LOF abot the firm word what is the firm word ilaha illaallah this is the statement of the heat there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah the hydrophobia and Lohia and as mimosa fed Allah says Allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life meaning in this life and in the grave and in the hill after meaning after resurrection and Allah sends astray the wrongdoers I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who are steadfast in their graves and in the hereafter this ayah is a clear evidence and proof of the torment of the grave those who are steadfast those who say this word will be saved in the graves because they have to heat it is a prerequisite for you to enter Jannah that you have to heat we mentioned this in the very beginning Allah says in the Quran indeed he who associate others with Allah Allah has forbidden him paradise full stop so no way that you may go to appears grave to a mallanna's grave and you slaughter a sheep to him and you stand up in submissiveness and say Mawlana it's been a long time I have a lot of sins forgive my sins one of the people of Saudi Arabia where I come from he's from Makkah he wrote a book on the etiquette of visiting the prophet's grave and in the book he says when you come to the grave face the grave of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam put your hand over your left on your chest and stand in submissiveness and humility and say assalamu alayka wa assalamu alaykum assalamu alayka for her assalamu alayka about him whose names are these and he's saying that these also can be shared by the Prophet alum he's an outward well this is higher number three in surah taha one who will our the one sort of Herod who won over the will ask well VAR hilo al Barton well we could Lachey an ally what are you talking about this is no no no it's ok it's ok no it's not ok this is if you do it you are down the drain the heat makes you happy why is it drugs nowadays ask people how to become happy take some crack steak salmon vitamin a joint of marijuana in do not inhale inhale Clinton didn't inhale but you can inhale they do drugs why do you do drugs it makes me happy it makes me cool this is a poison you do drugs you're happy you sell your wife you sell your daughter you'll sell your mother and you'll sell your sister you do the do drugs people will do you and will take your money and you will ruin your life and you'll end up either committing suicide or in jail drugs is something that takes your mind away are you insane or sane what are you doing say I want to be happy you want to be happy do you believe in Allah she's yours do you believe in the Quran he said yes ok listen what Allah says about happiness Allah says and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and earth but they denied the messengers so we seized them for what they were earning Allah tells you if you believe he will open blessings from the heavens and from the earth but you don't and this is why you deserve allah spanish minh allah says in the quran whoever does righteousness toe heel whether male or female while he is a believer we will surely cause him to live a good life and we will surely give them their reward in the hereafter a good life where in this dunya wallahi and I swear and I'm accountable for my oath in front of Allah wallah if you have proper to hate you are the happiest man on earth when you have full trust in Allah full dependence and Reliance only on allah azza wajal you are the happiest man even if you don't have tonight's dinner I hope my host has tonight's dinner but I'm happy even if I don't have dinner why because I have my heart on cruise control I have my heart overdrive I trust Allah whatever Allah does I know it's from my benefit and this is why Allah makes me live a happy life and what awaits me in the day of judgement is far far far better and greater only if you believe when you don't believe you have a problem why because you can't get happy except with drinking whiskey or smoking hash or taking heroin or doing cocaine you can't be happy until you go to the nightclub dance music maybe get lucky maybe not because you may get HIV how lucky was that a sister sent me a question couple of days ago she acquired herpes and she repented but she has herpes and she wants to get married what to do I said oh no no you can look for another Muslim brother who repented who has herpes alhamdulillah seriously but you cannot marry someone who's well and not tell him this is cheating and this is harming Muslims in us anyway you want happiness you'll find happiness in the heat interesting allah azza wajal the only means of guidance it's not Google it's not your GPS the only means of guidance is to he Allah Azza WA JAL says they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice with shirk those will have security and they are rightly guided you want security in this life in the hereafter or you want to be afraid on the hereafter on the day of judgement when you see hell and see people falling into it and you see this SWAT in front of you the bridge on top of hell it is as thin as a blade it is as sharp as a blade as thin as a hair line and you have to walk and once you put your foot it's all pitch dark unless you have light and the light is your toe heat that will shine over the path for you and your toe heat the stronger it is the wider this bridge is so you walk like lightning the first batch that passes the prophets in Assam they are like lightning then they are like a hurricane so fast then they are on horseback then there are people running then there are people walking then there are people walking and triplet tripping and falling and then there are people who are crawling and the hooks of hell comes and takes them the hypocrites come they see the straight path it's dark then they get a tiny light in their toe so they walk just as they are middle way the lights off like Nigeria but with the generators inshallah we're in good hands there are no Jenna natives on the slot you are in trouble this is where the heat comes your belief in allah azza wajal would make everything light for you and the first thing we have to acknowledge and know that the heat is the main thing you call people to when you meet a Christian when you meet a Jew don't begin except with the heat some brothers talk to non-muslims they say music is Haram why are you talking about music they say our sister your Christian but you have to cover cover what this is ridiculous when you speak to a nun Muslim leave everything aside regardless of their drinking of their partying of not wearing the hijab this is nuns this is of not great importance this is not important what is important to save him from Hellfire and admit him to Jenna how to do this no heat and this is why the prophet said RA his salat WA Salam to MU I've even Isabel may Allah be pleased with him when he sent him to Yemen and Yemen were all Jews and Christians so he told him he breathed him Mahad you will come to people of the book of the Spitzer's let it be the first thing you call them to is to heed and this was narrated or reported in sahih al-bukhari so the word Yahweh Allah though he is mentioned in sahih al-bukhari so the first thing you call them two is the heat so when you want to call someone who's not a Muslim don't start with any things that not of great importance the first thing okay how many guns do you have Syd one one what about Jesus and the Holy Spirit it says yeah we have three in one this is head and shoulder this is the shampoo we have its two in one or three in one with conditioner no it cannot be it's only one God the creator of the heavens and the earth so you talked to him about Tahiti he said no no where Jesus is also God is it is he eternal was he there in the beginning so no no he came 2000 BC 2000 years ago where was he before that let me check so what do you mean by let me check okay if he's God and he was in the belly of Mary who was running the universe it was the father how can the father be the Son and the son if you have four bad sons disobedient abusive and one good righteous son would you kill him for the sins of the four is this logical would this be his reward then why would Allah Azza WA JAL kill his own beloved son for the sins of the universe hello Allah can answer shall forgive all of their sins why kill his own son and torture him you can go on until he but don't divert speak only on establishing the oneness of Allah in five to ten minutes every Christian you speak to if he's objective you say I I hear you I believe what you I actually don't believe in three in one I believe that the Creator is one I have the knowledge we've established though he we can go on into many different fields but not before establishing though he we have little time but it is crucially important to protect the heat what do you mean by protecting the heat get my ak-47 and start protecting - hey no or Arizona we are told in so many places things that violate the heat and how to protect it for example Islam prohibits any ambiguous words that can come for example if I say if it weren't for my dog you know I okay now I don't have a dog my neighbor has a dog and at night a burglar a burglar hamburger a burglar comes in to steal my house I'm asleep the dog of my neighbor boxes him the burglar is scared he runs away I wake up in the morning I say alhamdulillah had it not been for my dog my neighbor's dog the thief would have broken into my home and stole whatever he wanted even our best may Allah be pleased with him says this is for attributing saving your home to the dog now I used to be in the corporate business I used to be a general manager and whenever we have a discussion and preparation of the budget all heads of departments come and they show you what they did in the fiscal year and what is their forecast for next year so as a GM or a VP I hold the pointer and say and the past three months I am I succeeded in raising the funds and reducing the cost I secured three projects I did this I did that all of this when you attribute something attributed to Allah so you say with the grace of Allah Allah made me to do this to do this to do this always attributed to Allah to avoid ship this is the heat also it is shirk to swear with other than Allah in Egypt they always say whenever by the Prophet Wow the the letter Wow in Arabic is one of the three letters of swearing so they say when a be in Syria they say Musharraf II with my honor in Palestine they may say were us a B with the head of my father all of this is because you're swearing with other than Allah and you cannot swear except by Allah or his beautiful names and attributes it is part of protecting the heat that you do not pray regular prayer in a cemetery there are graves and I want to pray ask who are you praying also to to Allah your prayer isn't valid oh why because you're doing it in a cemetery and this is a breach of the heat some people would come tomorrow and build a message it and building a Masjid over a grave is also not permissible and praying in a mosque it that has a grave is not permissible and this is why if you go to Turkey if you go to Sudan if you go to so many countries that have a grave in the Masjid after salat they will come to the grave and say it's been five years I don't have children please grant me a child they believe that he has the power to make a change or a difference in our lives this is why we are prohibited to pray when the Sun is rising or the Sun is setting because the idol worshipers do prostrate to the Sun this is why we cannot prostrate to other than Allah some cultures the ruler sits and they come and they prostrate on their knees to him what is this sculptural share it's okay it's not okay this can only be done to Allah as there was your even when we are the mini Japan came back from Yemen the first thing he did he prostrated to the prophet alayhi salatu salam the Prophet was outraged mad what are you doing is it Oprah feat of Allah I saw them do this to their kings out of respect so I wanted to respect you more what did the Prophet say salatu salam if I where to order someone to prostrate to someone else I would have ordered a woman or a wife to prostrate to her husband but prostration to others is haram now I will conclude with this Yama it's very important do you have any doubt about the heat listen to this hadith the Prophet said Ras salatu was-salam the Jews were divided into seventy one sect the Christians were divided into 72 sects my Ummah will be divided into 73 sects are in hell except one and they said which one a prophet of Allah he said the one that is following my footsteps and my companions now 72 sects are in health one is only in where in general Hanbury Hanafy Maliki Sapphira which one of them is in help hello none why none the Prophet said all of them except one is listen he was not referring to whether you put your hands on your chest or on your site this is not a sect this is a difference of opinion in fact no problem in that phil has no problem has does not divide the Ummah into sects what divides the Ummah is a leader that they hate when someone comes and says there is a messenger after Muhammad alayhi salatu salam and his name is Willem Mirza whoa what what are you going seditious we're Muslims you know you're not Muslims you are among the 72 when someone comes to me and says I'm a Muslim I say la ilaha illallah muhammad rasoolullah I said masha'Allah I like you my brother while I'm shaking hands he says yes but I slander matter Asia she committed Xena and I curse Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and the rest of the companions audhu billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem I have to wash my hands seven times one with soil this is not just kaffir you slander my mother Aisha whom Allah has purified her in surah - Noor in Quran one of the two either you are a kafir or the Quran is false the two cannot be so definitely you're a Catholic so this is part of the 72 and this is why to hate is the most crucial and important piece of knowledge that if you spend your entire life purifying your heart then it would not be - a waste final word I know chef NASA is gonna kill me because I've said this six times but final word how to implement the hate this is something in the heart saying la ilaha illallah is done by the hypocrites in a community poni car ownership in a colossal lock if the hypocrites come and testify to you Muhammad that you are the prophet of allah w'allahu hallelujah animu indicadata solo and Allah knows that you are His Messenger yet Allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars so what they said with the tongue did not benefit them that is why the head has to be acknowledged and you have to have the full conviction in your heart one you have to say it with your tongue too you have to act upon it I pray to Allah that he makes us lie on the word of the heat and he makes us live on the world of the heat and here is their excess on the day of judgement on the word of though he had alimony special meal a Aslam wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad in water he was happy here at 19"
