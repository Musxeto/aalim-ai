  "transcript": "the most prominent schools of thought at the moment our for the Hanafi school the Maliki school the Shafi'i school and the humble school but people have divided into two groups or three who's counting the first group idolizes these schools of thought so they they think and believe whatever the Imam had said then this is close to Revelation we have to blindly follow it and believe in it the second group where those who totally neglected their work of the schools of thought discredited it looked down upon them and maybe even insulted them saying that they are men and we are men as well and this is an exaggeration or an understatement so they totally neglected the work of the great scholars of Islam now the middle path is the path of our scholars our ummah our ulema which is that we highly look up to these great imams while not blindly following them rather appreciating the work appreciating their life time achievements and what they have given to the ummah but at the same time due to the fact that they are not all in agreement in this case we have to implement what Allah has told us in the Quran and that is whenever you have a dispute over something referred back to Allah and to the messenger Allah solution meaning to the Quran and to the Sunnah so we believe highly in Abu Hanifa a man Malik Imam Shafi an imam muhammad in Hamburg but when one of them goes a little bit offline or when they dispute we have to cross examine their evidences so that we can come to a conclusion for example an Amana Shafi may Allah have mercy on soul says that touching a woman whether she's your mother or your wife or a total stranger nullifies your Woodill the other three great imams of the schools of thought say this is not true it does not impact your woudl with difference of opinion whether if it is done with desire and lust or not but there is a difference of opinion among scholars you know I'm Jeffrey says regardless it nullifies your rule so where did you get this from he said I found that in chapter 4 Surat Annisa Allah says Allah has to Manisa in the ayah of teman in short and Nisa I the ayah of Google and him so he says that this is clear that touching the women is something that nullifies boodle and it's also found ensured and made as well there in the very beginning the other scholars said no the understanding of the ayah was wrong Lamas to Manisa means to have int course not to touch so it breaks your Woodill and you have to have hustle and if you don't have water you have to perform to mo this is something that TMM is made for if you lack water that is if you are in the sexual ritual impurity the major ritual impurity so now he understood the ayah differently from the others so who to follow is are we supposed to follow the earliest one of the Imams who is Abu Hanifa because he's closer to the terrain or should we follow Allah Mohammed who's the latest of the four Imams who had the ability to look into different schools of thought and different opinions well the most authentic way of doing it is to refer back to the Quran Sunnah and we will find in the Sunnah that mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her told her nephew as our web needs obey that the prophet alayhi salat wa salam may kissed may have kissed one of his wives and then went for prayer without renewing his woudl and Allah said I bet that this wife was you mother Aisha and she laughed or smiled this hadith clearly states that kissing your spouse not just touching does not impact your Wordle and this is the most authentic opinion among scholars"
