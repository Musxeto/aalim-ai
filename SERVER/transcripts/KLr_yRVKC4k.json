  "transcript": "the Angels asked are you going to put someone on Earth who will cause corruption and shed blood in the land so my question is how the how did the Angels predicted this when Prophet Adam al-islam was the first human being how did I just knew this thank you there is a number of justifications one of them is that Allah told them that this will happen and that Adam will eat from The Forbidden tree and be ordered to descend to Earth some Scholars say that they figured out because he was not masoom he was not infallible rather he was a human being who can make mistakes and errors that this would inevitably happen from his offspring others say that before the humans on Earth there were Jinn and this was the trend of the Jinn fighting and shedding blood between one another and killing one another so they thought that when Adam and his offspring would be descended to Earth they would follow suit and Allah Knows Best"
