  "transcript": "Muslims need the Sakina so that they are not delusions we need the Sakina in times of Happiness we have to have the Sakina in times of sadness when there's a Calamity when you're sick when there is a problem and you are in agony and in pain you always remember that this is from Allah and this is because of my sins so this calms you down [Music] is tranquility it is peace and calmness [Music] our next talk insha Allah will be by Hakim on the topic of asakina the Tranquility a bit of a background about Hakeem he hails from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia he held a ba in linguistics which he achieved from the King Abdel Aziz University in Jeddah chafazim taught for 15 years in a high school teaching ESL English as a second language he holds a high diploma in Islamic Studies from the University of umul Quran in Mecca he has been the regular Imam of a Masjid in Jeddah Saudi Arabia for 21 years where he holds regular classes also participates with various Islamic multimedia Outlets such as Huda TV peace TV various Saudi TV channels as well as radio stations within the kingdom Hakeem has also taken part in many International conferences such as the peace conference in previous years currently the chef is a director of human relations and public relations department at a leading mining company within Saudi Arabia so I would like to invite to the podium to present his talk on us Sakina the tranquility foreign not to bore you to death our topic is Sakina and before we go into defining Sakina as Muslims we read the Quran and we read the Sunnah and we are astonished by a lot of the things that we go through tell me what makes Ibrahim who is a young boy a young man what gives him the courage to demolish to destroy the idols that his people used to worship and when they come to him and say who did this subhanallah Ibrahim peace be upon him has the courage and the guts to say it's their Chief the big one ask him or ask them and they will tell you how did Ibrahim peace be upon him find the carriage to leave his wife and his infant child Ismail peace be upon them who was his only child after reaching the age of 80. it was a miracle from Allah azzawajal and a gift he left them stranded in a valley with no humans no trees or plants no water he left them in the desert and he walked away hajjar said who are you leaving us for that Allah order you to do this without looking back he said yes she said go Allah would not leave us where did she get this courage from now Ibrahim may Allah be pleased with him we're told in the Quran that he saw in a vision in a dream that he is slaughtering his son Ismael and we know that the vision of messengers of Allah are wahi a revelation so he goes to his son who was 14 or 15 years old his only son well he has is half with him but this is his firstborn he goes to him and he says my son I saw in this dream that I Slaughter you so what do you think how did he even attempt to do such a thing may Allah have his blessing upon him which is more stranger and more astonishing the answer and the reply was made this kid did not say come on Father this is just a dream it's from shaytan don't listen to your dreams you want to kill me you want to slaughter me because of a dream no it's Mary who was a prophet and a messenger himself said father do what you are told you will find me not patient you will find me with the grace of Allah being patient because on my own I cannot be patient if Allah does not guide me I cannot be guided I need Allah what gave them this power to say such a thing look at another messenger look at Yusuf Joseph peace be upon him he tolerates the Betrayal of his siblings of his own flesh and blood when they threw him in the well he tolerated being enslaved being humiliated being imprisoned and why was he imprisoned because he would not accept sin all of this humilation is not happening to any one of us it's happening to a prophet the son of a prophet the son of a prophet the son of a prophet when the prophet Allah was asked who is among the best who is among the most honorable he said Yusuf the son of Jacob the son of Isaac the son of Ibrahim all prophets of Allah peace be upon them all and when the messenger came and said Yusuf come to meet the king after he interpreted the dream if any one of us was approached with such a request we would have definitely immediately gone out of prison after spending so many years not Yusuf he had something in him that made him come and say to the messenger go back to your king and let him interrogate let him investigate my innocence among the women let's look at another messenger of Allah it's all in the Quran this is what we read but we should not read it or recited just for the fun of it or just for seeking the barakah we should learn from it we should make it our guide that we follow and we would never go astray by following it if you look at Musa peace be upon Him Prophet Moses after fleeing Egypt and working for 10 years being married to the daughter of his boss he fulfilled his contract for 10 years he wanted to go back to Egypt he travels alone with his wife not accompanied by any guards or any escort in the middle of the night when it's cold and you're lonely and you're in the desert and you leave your wife because you saw a glimpse of light you wanted to go and get some of that fire so that you and your wife would be able to warm yourselves a bit who would do this Among Us leave the wife well some of us would leave the wife definitely but these are not among the best of husbands but those who love their wives would they dare leave their wives and in that situation desert night cold lonely yet he goes there and subhanallah something extraordinary happens Allah Almighty himself speaks to him when a dignity speaks to us when someone who is powerful and Rich speaks to us we may tremble we may lose our concentration Allah the almighty is speaking to him yet he stands still and he accepts and talks back to the almighty Allah and when he was ordered and instructed to go and speak to Pharaoh the tyrant who fears no one who is without any Mercy he stands firm and he talks to him and he calls him he calls him to the Oneness of Allah azzawajal knowing that he's talking to someone who thinks that he is the lord of the heavens and the Earth and when pharaoh wants to annihilate Musa and those with him they flee the lands and the armies with their might and weapons they all follow them until they are stranded between the enemies and the water with fear the Jews say that we are doomed but with belief with Sakina with full support of Allah azzawajal and dependence on him Musa peace be upon Him says this is not true Allah azzawajal is with me and the ocean and the sea is split into two and he crosses the list goes on and on and on of such stories that make you wonder how do they do such things that we consider to be miracles as Muslims as believers we know that the answer is in the Quran we know that Allah has revealed the Quran not only for the blessing for us to put it in a glove compartment of the car or to put it under the pillow when we go to bed why are you doing this so that I don't get any evil eye I don't get any magic any gin it's not for the blessing and the creation of the house or the room it is to be followed it is to be a cure to all of us physical cure and mental cure as well therefore when we recite the Quran we would like to learn every single word of it because it is from Allah it is the word of Allah and Allah is talking not to all of us Allah is talking to me this is how I feel when I recite the Quran that Allah is addressing me don't care about your neighbor about your friend about your brother and say well he's not following the Quran Allah is addressing you so if I look at the word Sakina I will find that it has been repeated in the Quran in six verses of the Quran Sakina a non-muslim would say is she a tennis player Sakina no no that's that's around one she's not Sakina what does it mean well I'll recite the six verses in the Quran and by the way the student of IBN may Allah have mercy on them both one of the greatest Scholars of Islam the books are guidance to all Muslims even says that my Sheikh ibnia once had an illness and when a person is ill he's vulnerable he's weak says that I had lots of attacks from devils seeing me weak seeing me ill they started attacking me so I mean it says I requested those around me to recite the six verses of a Sakina in the Quran and the minute they recited it all the Devils vanished and I regained my strength so these verses whenever you are in distress whenever you are not thinking straight always beside them with the intention that Allah bestows his Sakina upon you the first verse is in Surat al-baqarah verse 248 Allah azzawajal says so this verse is talking about an incident where the sons of Israel the Jews are complaining to their Prophet send us a king that we fight under his flag he told them you will not be patient you will run away you are not the one to do this they insisted so Allah sent them a sign that this king is the one appointed to them and this sign has translated and the prophet said to them verily the sign of his kingdom is that there shall come to you boot a wooden box a coffin-like wherein is Sakina which is the peace and reassurance from your lord and the element of that which Musa and Haroon left behind the second verse is in Surah Allah says um foreign myself I don't know about you I'm not going to influence you this verse was revealed on the occasion of her name the Battle of Penang on the eighth year of Hijra when the prophet is and they ambushed him he was in an army of ten thousand Warriors two thousand of them were from Makkah just claimed and pretended to accept Islam yesterday when they ambushed him in a valley which is narrow they all felt afraid so they retreated because archmen started throwing their arrows at the prophet and those with him everyone went back except the prophet is and those who were with him such as El Abbas and his two sons be pleased with him and his two sons only this handful of people remained with the prophet they were not intimidated they were not afraid on the contrary the prophet was not on a horse that was strong enough he was on a mule yet he started marching and charging the mule to attack the enemy on his own with only six or seven saying which translates to I am the Prophet this is not a lie I am the son of Abdullah come to me this is the prophet that Islam challenging thousands of warriors on his own Allah says the Almighty then Allah did send down his sakeen calmness tranquility and reassurance on The Messengers and on the Believers and sent down Angels which you did not see and punish the disbelievers and subhanallah the tables were turned over and the prophet with his companions managed to beat all of these disbelievers and take their wealth and Allah Grant him Victory the third verse Allah says he foreign Dover verse number 14. again this is describing when the prophet and His companion be pleased with him where in the cave and on top of them were the disbelievers trying to hunt them down after the prophet Allah went for migration to Medina they could not leave him go so they followed him and the prophet in His companion hid in this cave and Abu Bakr said o prophet of Allah one of them looked under his feet he could see us it's a horrible situation terrifying any one of us would feel afraid but not the prophet he smiled and he looked at Abu Bakr and he said Abu Bakr what do you think of to their third is their Lord the Almighty who can beat us who can bring any harm to us as long as Allah is with us this is the Sakina Allah azzawajal says [Music] it is he who sent down a Sakina into the hearts of the Believers that they may grow more in faith along with their present faith and to Allah belongs the soldiers the Angels the soldiers of the heavens and the Earth and Allah is ever all lower all wise and also says Allah says indeed Allah was pleased with the Believers the companions when they gave their bear when they gave their pledge to you Prophet of Allah under the tree which is known as and he rewarded them with a near Victory this was in the year where the Prophet is known as and he went with few of his companions light arms daggers swords nothing much no RPGs no airplanes no tanks he just went to perform umrah and they prevented him and they insisted that he signs a treaty which by he is to go back to Medina and to come the following year an attacked conditions that made some of the companions shocked among them was may Allah be pleased with him in these conditions some of them one of the conditions stated that if some of the pagans embraced Islam and wanted to migrate to Medina the prophet should not accept him he should reject him and send him back but if the opposite happens if one of the Muslims rejected Islam and wanted to go to Makkah they will keep you Omar could not swallow this he said this is not acceptable he went to the prophet saws aren't we on the right path he said yes aren't you the prophet of Allah he said yes so why are we being humiliated in Allah's religion if we are on the right path the prophet that is I am Allah's servant and messenger and he will not betray me he will not make me go astray so believe in that he did not take it quite well he went to Abu Bakr he said the same thing to Abu Bakr aren't you on the right path aren't they Uncle for in this belief why are we being humiliated in our religion and Abu Bakr said exactly the same thing and he grabbed Omar and he shook him and he told him Omar watch out follow his footsteps otherwise you will be doomed and you will lose years after he said whenever I remember this I free slaves I give in charity I offer prayers I fast so that Allah would forgive the sins that I have done on that occasion and finally Allah says in the same verse 26 is and this verse was in reference as I'll explain says when those who disbelieve the pagans of Makkah had put in their hearts pride and arrogance they would not reject anyone coming from Arabia from the pagans to perform but when it came to the prophet Allah it was the pride and arrogance in their hearts where the pride and houdiness of the time of ignorance then Allah sent down his sakeen and that is why the prophet accepted that and that is why Abu Bakr may Allah the peace with him and the rest of the companions accepted it only few who could not tolerate this not out of ignorance but out of love for Islam these are the six verses that have the word Sakina but what is the meaning of Sakina Sakina is tranquility it is peace and calmness it is the belief in Allah that makes you calm down when your heart is filled with fear and it's trembling out of distress once you have this Sakina in you you're not bothered you're not changed you're not provoked or intimidated this transcends on your actions on the things you say and on how you behave and believe Sakina comes also opposite to arrogance an arrogant person does not have Sakina the prophet says that arrogance and pride are with those who have camels and horses and Sakina is with those who have sheep what does that mean if you own camels and horses and you're always with your livestock and you're happy with it and you're taking care of it you tend to get some of the characteristics of these animals which is pride arrogance so you always humiliate people you always disrespect people and this is found in some of the bedrooms who are not fine-tuning their characteristics with Islam with the Quran with the Sunnah while those who take care of sheep and have sheep and grow sheep and take care of it subhanallah because sheep is quiet and calm they also get this Sakina into them this Sakina is what we need now that makes us calm and focused in times of stress in times of calamities the Sakina is not something we earn it is a gift from Allah azzawajal one would argue and say okay what about some of those who are not Muslim but they are patient when calamities strike well this is not Sakina this is patience this is something that they train themselves to attain but you don't know what's in their hearts it can be in turmoil and it can become but this is temporary a lot of the people tend to feel calm and peaceful when they engage themselves in sin so someone says when I listen to soft music before I sleep I sleep quickly and I feel nice and calm but if I don't I feel agitated this is not Sakina because it is not gained and obtained through lawful means it's not from Allah this is temporary you may feel good about it for a while but after the influence the effect is gone you go back to square one the Sakina was there at the time of the Prophet Allah throughout his Sunnah in the battle of the Army almost Was Defeated because of the Disobedience of some of the archers on the mountain went down to collect the booties of the war and [Music] came with his soldiers and they attacked the Muslims the prophet Islam was injured because of this disobedience over were martyred were killed and the majority of them were injured someone came with a threat telling the Muslims that the disbelieving Army the army of the pages of Makkah are regrouping and they're coming now to annihilate you completely now this is something to be afraid of but was not afraid when he was told he simply said Allah foreign after the battle of which means Allah alone is sufficient for us and he is the best disposer of Affairs for us and Ibrahim peace be upon him said to this when he was thrown into fire by his people he said and subhanallah the fire turned into something that was not harmful the companions of the brother had this Sakina they used to take him in the middle of the day in the middle of the summer and they put him in the desert it's burning flames of the stone and the sand and they would put a big rock on his chest and they would whip him and torture him so that he would reject Islam but he had the Sakina from Allah he would simply say I had the almighty is one the almighty is one he would not say anything do whatever you want I have the Sakina in me nowadays people need Sakina we need Sakina because we find a lot of Muslims and non-muslims alike none practicing Muslims and non-muslims share the worries share the confusion share the stress and that is why they often go to psychiatrists to shrinks asking them for help for medication and most of these psychiatrists are not applying the Quran and Sunnah so they give them wrong answers and worse solutions to their cases that they are suffering from are you Muslim does not go to a psychiatrist why because he does not have this confusion he has the Sakina when you read the Quran Allah says that the hearts are calmed by the thicker of Allah so why would we need to go to psychiatrists Muslims need the Sakina desperately to Cast Away and to throw away the doubts that shaytan puts into their heads do Muslims get doubts do Muslims get doubts when you do this I'm not sure if it's yes or no so no the brother says Muslims do not get doubts the other brother says they do alhamdulillah Scholars have disputed as usual everything in Islam there are two opinions so whenever you have a problem say there are two opinions and someone asks you is this there are two opinions well in this there is one opinion there are people who are faced with doubts in Islam and this is normal the companions of the Prophet Allah themselves went to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah we find things in our hearts that to be thrown from the sky and fall on the ground is better than us talking about it we cannot even talk about it so the prophet says did you find it by Allah this is the clear faith clear faith I'm getting doubts about my religion and you're telling me that this is clear Faith yes because you are sad and depressed by these thoughts and you find it impossible for you to talk about this is a clear sign that you have faith in you and that is why Allah be pleased with him was approached by some of his companions and they said they've been Abbas the Jews and the Christians mock about us they're ridicule our prayers and they say you Muslims have Whispers of shaytan When you pray but we Jews and Christians we don't have this when we pray we don't have any Whispering of shaitaan please with him said that's true his companions were shocked true how come the Muslims get Whispers and get thoughts in their prayer and the Jews and Christians don't he said what would shaytan do with an empty heart what would the shaitaan do with an empty heart if I were a burglar I'm a thief and there is this house of a rich person and a house of in the slums which one should I go to definitely to the rich person because I will find something to steal and that is why shaytan is coming to you to steal from your prayer and the more you fight him will reward you more because you have the reward of praying and the reward of fighting him we need not to be delusions a lot of the Muslims nowadays need this Sakina it was reported that a man was a friend of an epidemic these are old Tales no one can be a friend of aperture but this is what they say and he met him once and he told him where are you going so he said I'm going to that Village over there I was instructed to kill 500 of them with the epidemic this is my job a month later the man hears that 5 000 died so he meets the epidemic again and he says listen last time you dropped a zero you told me you were to kill 500 but 5 000 died he said yes I killed 500 but delusion fear killed the 4500 remaining so that they are not delusions they are not fooled by what the shaitaan casts in their heads we need the Sakina in times of happiness sometimes we're joyful we're happy we make bad things bad judgments bad actions that do not befit a Muslim even when you're happy you have the Sakina that calms you down does not make you do like the Hooligans for example if you are supporting a cricket team or a football team and they win the hooligans Go they break Windows they party they do things that are not in accordance to Islam we have to have the Sakina in times of sadness because if a woman husband dies she starts slapping her face tearing her clothes out of grief saying things and the angels say Amen Amin she says may Allah curse me may Allah make me die before him and the angels say Amen no you have to have the Sakina even when times of Sorrow you have to have the Sakina in times of pain when there's a Calamity when you're sick when there is a problem and you are in agony and in pain you always remember that this is from Allah and this is because of my sins so this calms you down and you accept whatever Allah has to bring upon you the almighty Allah azzawajal in the Sunnah is mentioned in a number of places such as in Hajj if you see Hajj and you see these 3.5 million Plus in a very small area and they all want to go from A to B to C in less than three days and everyone wants to be the first and I could care less if you're a Muslim if you're an elderly if you're a woman I just smack you on the face and I'm ahead of you it's exactly like how people drive in India very dangerous I would never ever thrive in India I always put these blindfolds like a horse so I don't see what's coming from the left or the right people in Hajj do this they start fighting each other just to be in front the prophet Allah when he performed when he went from arafah to Muslim after Sunset everybody wants to reach muzdalifa the prophet says it will not grow you closer to Allah azzawajal when you are the fastest or the first you have to become also the prophet tells us to be calm when we go to the Masjid the Muslims men when they hear the Adan they rush to the Masjid well this is not the Sunnah you should not rush the prophet Allah says when you come to the prayer do not rush you should be in tranquility and calmness and be dignified whatever you catch up with the prayer Pray it and whatever you miss make up for it Sakina descends it comes down it's down now how do you know yes I have clearance I have the evidence as we sit now there is Sakina I guarantee you this there are angels surrounding us there is the mercy of Allah now with us in this Hall the prophet says no people gather reciting the book of Allah or remembering Allah or studying it together but Tranquility descends upon them and mercy encompasses them and the angels surround them and Allah mentions them to those who are with Him Allah the almighty is mentioning each and every one of us on the seventh heaven to his angels by name can you imagine this every time we sit and remember Allah or study the Quran this happens so we have the Tranquility upon us now where and how do we get this Tranquility we need this Tranquility this Sakina with our children with our spouses how do we treat our children unfortunately in a very bad manner we don't use the Sakina with them if they do something wrong that's break a leg let's break an arm let's make a black eye do anything whatever my child does something I'm agitated I'm angry why did you do this I shout I curse I hit this is not the Sakina this is not the doing of the Prophet Allah personally speaking whenever one of my children does something I do not like it's not wrong but they're too joyful they're playing when I'm not happy with them the first thing I say hey did you pray did you pray and answer no go pray so it's becoming like a punishment whenever one of my daughters says can you bring me this can you do this is it did you pray what does this have to do with this it's the lack of Tranquility we should be calm we should understand our children we should understand our spouses if my wife comes with my lunch and I'm hungry and it is tasteless it's burnt it's hard and it I don't know if it's food or not Tranquility comes I eat it okay two or three bites alhamdulillah may Allah bless you good food she says liar I said what this is uneatable how do you say it's good food said well I appreciate that you spent two hours in the kitchen the results was not that good but you did the effort so I appreciate this this is the Tranquility we need with the spouse and the woman would do the same with her husband if he's tired if he does what he does and still could not afford to spend some time with her or with the children she appreciates his efforts this is the Tranquility we need we need the Tranquility when we call others to Islam you cannot come to people and say become Muslim become Muslim become Muslim nobody will accept this and you cannot go to someone who is not practicing a Muslim but he's not a good Muslim when you say you are a bad Muslim and you will go into hell and Allah will punish you in the grave and I'll be watching and laughing so fear Allah and join me in the peace to humanity cannot have people doing this no one will accept this you have to have the Tranquility in accepting those who differ with you in opinion who are misguided be kind like the prophet was do exactly like the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam did and believe me will be one of the best there he has ever we need to have Tranquility in times of distress and this is very important Muslims nowadays are being manipulated they're playing with us like puppets you know puppets when they have these strings and they play and you see the puppet dancing but you don't see the hands moving it anything the enemies of Islam would like to do it's very easy they make drawings that are insulting to the prophet what will you do oh I'm angry I love the prophet I will defend the prophet Allah when was the last time you prayed in the Masjid no no this is regardless I would like to defend okay what are you gonna do I'm gonna have marshes I'm going to have a protest I'm going to attack my neighbor he's not a Muslim well he's a Muslim but he and who cares I'm gonna attack him why are you doing this for the love of my Prophet Allah this Islamic now people draw things insulting the prophet is this good no by Allah it is the most major insult to Muslims and to Islam and to the greatest man in humanity but does it tarnish the prophet Islam's reputation does it hurt him do whatever you want to do to our Prophet Allah you cannot insult him this much every single minute round the globe his name is mentioned in the United States of America in Washington next to the White House his name is mentioned and you cannot stop this in the Kremlin in the east in the West in the south in the north his name every single minute Around the Clock is being mentioned so who can insult him the love of Our Lives no one so measure your actions in the scale of sharia Quran and Sunnah see to be a criminal is an evil thing but to think as a criminal to defend Islam that's a good thing whenever you want to counter attack a criminal think like him if I want to think like the enemies of Islam how can I attack Islam well make Muslims do things that are not good so for example we hear in the newspaper that XYZ brought the Quran and put his foot on it wow that's bad what are you going to do about it let's make a protest call your friend call my friend call the neighborhood let's get half a million in India and mashallah it's easy to get half a million get half a million Muslims let's protest as a criminal as an enemy of Islam all what I have to do is bring five Hypocrites or Pretenders to be Muslim and put them in the crowd and the minute they pass a policeman hit the policeman set fire on a car break the windows who will be accused of doing these the Muslims so we need Tranquility we need Sakina what is the ruling on protests Scholars have different opinions some say it's okay some say it's not I believe that protesting is not permissible because it has more harm than good lots of those in the protest say bad things things that are against Islam we do that are against Islam women and men coming together in one place mixing up breaking the windows looting killing hitting abusing defying the law and the authority this is all unislamic we need a Sakina so that we could be guided on the right path this does not mean that a Muslim when having the Sakina is negative this does not mean you be without any jealousy you see your wife with another man and says next time don't do that in the bedroom at least do it somewhere else what are you doing this is Sakina Chef I'm having this Sakina in me alhamdulillah no this is a pig this is not a man you have to measure whatever you do with the Quran and Sunnah not to be negative and not reacting but not to go to the extremes and doing things that do not please Allah and Allah azzawajal Knows Best of [Applause] we now have time for question and answers we have the three mics one at the front one in the rear and one for the Sisters we'll start with the first question from the brother at the front my name is in India the Islamic clergy has the habit of you know issuing fatwas and fatwas as for the Quran if you can correct me is a mere opinion not a command but on flimsy grounds for trivial reasons these fatwas are issued issue tarnishes and blemishes the entire Community as a whole and in India if we come across one bad Muslim that is the tendency to paint everyone with the same brush so I would like to know that when it is appropriate to issue of fatwa and how much of the impact a fatwa should have on Muslims in general thank you for your question first of all I urge you not to sue me as a lawyer when I answer your question now I'll not do that okay thank you brother fatwa is not mentioned in the Quran so you say that the Quran says that we should not do this it is not mentioned in the Quran fatwa is a religious opinion and I've stated through my talk that a number of issues and I said that the scholars have different opinions and this is human nature to follow to a blind Lee this is not Islamic the fatwa should be in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah not caring about what the others say so when I issue a fatwa now I've just issued a fatwa saying that protesting is not allowed in Islam do you think that the people and the brothers believe or accept this I know that a lot of them say no this is not acceptable we have to protest we have to do this this is my opinion and I base my opinion on Quran and Sunnah I can sit and talk and negotiate with other Scholars who know what I'm talking about but what I do not recommend or think that it is appropriate is when someone comes and takes a look at the fatwas and say now this fatwa is flimsy or this fatwa is not appropriate who is classifying and Grading this fatwa he's a scholar I accept this but if he's not it is like me going to a heart surgeon or a neurosurgeon and when he says I have to do this surgery I say show me your procedure so he gives me the X-ray and I say okay he said no it's upside down oops sorry and I start to say um yeah I think you should not give him this medication and I think that you should not go from here from the nose is much easier and it's is this acceptable to this neurosurgeon what are you talking about this is not your field so those who judge the fatwa they themselves should be Scholars so that they can tell us that this pathway is right or wrong and they should justify we as Muslims as a student of knowledge I'm not a scholar and you know very tiny students of knowledge but as a student of knowledge no scholar in Islam could come and say Simon Says do this he said no first of all you're not Simon second of all I am not a child I have the knowledge of the Quran I have the knowledge of the Sunnah you cannot manipulate me tell me why you want me to do this and prove it to me so as Muslims we should not be like sheep The Scholar says do this yes sir give me 50 of your money and if you do then I'd like to be one of your Scholars because this is you make me Rich no we follow the scholars in accordance to the Quran and to the Sundown but we have to know and be knowledgeable and we should not be like sheep allowing people to drive us left and right now having said this I do not care if the government likes it or not and I do not care if the people like it or not I care most if I'm doing what Allah azzawajal is pleased with as a Muslim so I give my opinion to the best of my knowledge now if it's right alhamdulillah I did my best if it's wrong I did my best and I hope this answers the question thank you the next question from the real Mike assalamu alaikum my name is my question to you is for example a footballer guest Sakina from playing football or a druggist gets Sakina while having drugs but the main point is to get the Tranquility then why does Islam focus on the Islamic tranquility stated this in my talk and I said that there is a partial Sakina a temporary Sakina that is not from Allah in the sense that it is not a blessing from Allah definitely no person who is saying and a Muslim would say that when someone takes heroin or cocaine and he gets this calmness this is from Allah and Allah is pleased with him no this is from shaytan so there are temporary forms of Sakina such as patience for example Christopher Reeve well known as Superman he died he passed away this man was an excellent Horseman an excellent Rider he was a famous actor in Hollywood he was blessed with a beautiful wife and four children he was rich he was famous he was riding and all of a sudden while jumping in the fence the horse so so something like a rabbit so it froze and Christopher started flying he fell on his neck he was paralyzed neck down the first eight weeks he wrote this and it was in an article about 12 pages in the time years ago I read this and I felt that this subhanallah was disclosed from becoming a Muslim he thought of suicide he thought of dying and then he got this patience in him believing in what he was suffering and he decided to live his life he participated in the Olympics for the handicapped he participated in ayak race he started making this organization for curing the spinal cords and so on is this from Allah azzawajal he's a disbeliever therefore we believe that this is one of the tools that the almighty Allah uses to guide people if they accept Islam and he was this close to accept because he was patient he was accepting that This calamity is from Allah he's saying this this whatever happens to me is from God it's not the saying it from Allah God so a lot of Muslims do not have this Sakina because they do not ask it from Allah and if it comes they're rejected these are temporary forms of Sakina but they're not the full Sakina that are mentioned in the Quran Allah gives some of it to the non-muslims so that it would draw them to Islam and to knowing him and to appreciating him and to believing that it is he the almighty that controls the worlds if they accept it alhamdulillah if they don't it is temporary that's similar to the footballer who gets his Tranquility once he scores the goal and it soon disappears when he misses a penalty kick by the coach and Allah Knows Best the next question from the sister assalamu alaikum brother my name is Jamila mukri and I'm a primary school teacher I would like to ask you can you mention at least five ways how we can develop Sakina or Bill Sakina as Muslims five I think the time does not permit this is an easy escape from saying I don't know five but five time does not permit let's say first one first way of attaining Sakina your knowledge of Allah's presence with you if you are in a Calamity and you depend only on your sources on my wallet on my friends I can talk in the government in the police to take me out of this trouble on my reputation oh it's a Sheikh please I depend on my sources so I feel secure and I can feel the Sakina from this but there are lots of calamities of problems that nothing can help you except the knowledge that Allah is with you Allah is with you with his power with his knowledge with his mercy so the minute I believe in this wallahi nothing can shake you up nothing when you know that Allah is with you and he's controlling everything this is the first means of attaining the Sakina the second means is continue to make thicker so when you make thicker and you remember Allah azzawajal as in the Hadith we've mentioned When We Gather and make thicker or recite the Quran descends on us this is one of the most important means the third mean of attaining Sakina is reciting in the Quran and this is different what's the difference you share her trying to make excuses to make them fight no it's it's a different category altogether the authentic Hadith by Hussein may Allah be pleased with them one of the dignitaries and he's the main cause of getting into Islam was reciting night prayer Quran and night prayer in the bukhari and Muslim he was reciting in other books he was reciting so we have two big and beautiful surahsara he had the horse tied with two ropes and he had his son Yahya sleeping a child six years five years old and we were talking about 2 am approximately after the middle of the night and he's reciting Surat al-baqarah or Surah Scholars like even say that both incidents happened to him it's not a different incident both happened in the story goes that he as he was reciting the horse started trembling and kicking and doing things that are not natural for him so he stopped and that horse calmed down and he started reciting again and the horse was trembling and he was afraid that the horse would step on his son so he stopped and after he finished prayer he looked up and he saw lights candles in the sky so after Fajr prayer with the prophet Allah he went and he told the Prophet The Prophet said recite the Quran he said oh prophet of Allah I did but I was afraid from the horse on my son the prophet said recite the Quran twice and three times and he said o Prophet Allah I did but I was afraid the prophet said that was the Sakina what you saw the light was the Sakina in another Hadith authentic that was the Angels those were the Angels which means that Sakina descends with the angels the angels are bringing it from Allah azzawajal so these are the means of getting Sakina whenever you are in distress wherever you're feeling blue sad depressed whenever you have problems all over you covering your head you don't know how to treat your mother-in-law we have lots of problems with mothers-in-law you don't know how to treat her you don't know how to take with your children they're sad with you they're angry with you they're cursing they're not upset I don't like you Mommy I don't like your daddy you have problems you don't know what to do open the Quran recite it asking Allah azzawajal for relief for calmness for Sakina this is where the zakira says and I think my Chairman's telling me freeze enough we have run out of time for the question and answer session so a big thank you may Allah reward you immensely for your talk on asakina [Applause] foreign"
