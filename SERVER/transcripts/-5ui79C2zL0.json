  "transcript": "Sonia sent us an email saying while I'm still in the state of harm for Hajj is it permissible for me to have a bath to change clothes and to come my hair or do I have to be in the same dress till the Hajj is complete in India and Pakistan people say we must be in the ROM throughout the Hajj and not take a shower and not to come hair etc first of all do not follow the culture when it comes to religion religion is not taken from the elders or from what the people say religion is taken only from the authentic sources of the Quran and of the Sunnah which means that this eliminates the possibility of people manipulating you or claiming things that are not from the religion and this is one of the biggest problems at the Muslims face they feel confused people toss them right and left like children playing with a football and they don't know what to believe in who to follow there is the Quran and the Sunnah that will never change there are preserved until the day of judgment you follow them you are on solid grounds so what the people say to you that you do not change or harm you do not take a bath you don't come your hair all of this is baseless where is the evidence that prevents it does Islam tell us to stink and to smell out of Allah what is prohibited for a person in the state of a harm is to apply perfume but the Prophet himself as a Muslim took a whistle before commencing she to the Kaaba to do historian say so cleaning yourself washing and having a shower or a bath while in the state of a harem is totally permissible and recommended even if you take two or three showers a day no problem but don't apply perfume no dude runs nothing changing your garments of a harm or your dress is totally legit you can do that once twice or any number of times during the day or during your journey without any problem combing your hair is also permissible even if some hair would fall because there is no prevention of that in the Quran or in the Sunnah what is prohibited is to shave your hair and coming it is not shaving it therefore Sonia there is nothing wrong in all of that insha'Allah"
