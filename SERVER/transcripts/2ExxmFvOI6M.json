  "transcript": "I'm sorry but she says that we have a problem that when we were invited to a wedding here in Saudi Arabia you know the culture and the people are a little bit far away from Islam though they are Muslims but they're not practicing so most of the weddings have music dancing and at the end of the night the the groom and his family the father and the sons they will enter to the women's section and they will take photographs it's all of this is totally baseless and not related to Islam so sure so she says what should I do should we go to keep the ties or should we refrain definitely the answer is you must refrain you cannot attend such prohibited celebrations or parties which may include videotaping music mixing all of this is Haram now if it's someone who is really close to you and you fear like a brother like a an uncle and you fear that if you don't show up they will cut the kinship ties in this case you may go at the very beginning of the night before this these activities begin and give your congratulations and gift etc and bail out but if it's from the very beginning it is starting then this is totally not permissible for you to go even if they get angry with you and cut the ties of kinship they are the wrongful people"
