  "transcript": "I'm al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad in Huaorani he go sahbihi ajma'in mr b√∂ck assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato we move on to hadeeth number 93 is it and who will volunteer to read it for us yes brother narrated abu qatada al ansari roseola one Allah's messenger sallallaahu salam was offering prayer and he was carrying oh mama the daughter of zina roseola won the daughter of allah's messenger sallallahu wasallam and she was the daughter of oz even a Rabi even up teams when he prostrated he put her down and when he stood he carried her on his neck Sahih al-bukhari this is a mistake by those who translated the hadith the name of the husband of Zen is a Balazs in arabiya not alas Abu alas even a beer in this hadith we learn that the prophet alayhi salatu salam had other grand sons or other grandchildren than a Hasan will Hossein because we know it has an Shan where the sons of Ali and Fatima but oh mama was also his grand daughter from his daughter's enum and her husband was able awesome nella beer may Allah be pleased with them and a lot of the Muslims don't know that the Prophet s-salam had a son in law in the name of Abu Lahab nor a beard and he was a mushrik yet he was very peaceful loving and respecting to the prophet alayhi salatu salam unlike the previous son when laws of the Prophet are a solution because we know that Roja anam consume were married before - when the mic up elapses Abu Lahab son and we know that Abu Lahab was the uncle of the professor so two of them were married to two of the prophet's daughters a laser Salam and when the Prophet announced alehissalaam that he was the Messenger of Allah they divorced and separated his daughters so one of them was married to earth man and when she died earth man married the other daughter of the Prophet area so Salaam zeyneb and of course we know that all the daughters of the Prophet as Salam word from his first wife khadija bint who a lead may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet loved Khadijah so much it's beyond our understanding the true love if you want to see to love look at the love of the Prophet Elisha Salam to hadiza may Allah be pleased with her I will ask did not accept Islam yet he did not force his wife to reject Islam and this shows you how great man he was though he was a mushrik and when he was captured by the soldiers of Islam after some time when after migration he sent Zeinab to the prophet alayhi salatu salam because she's a muslim and he's not so she went and accompanied her father salallahu alaihe salam in medina and after a while he was captured among the other soldiers who were captured and the prophet alayhi salatu salam requested that they would pay ransom so that they would free themselves zeyneb when she knew that her husband or ex-husband was among the people she sent a medallion a necklace that her mother Hadiya may allah be pleased with her gave it to her on the wedding day and she sent this medallion to the prophet alayhi salatu salam as ransom when the prophet sallallaahu are you are you selling them so the medallion he broke into tears and he remembered Khadija may Allah be pleased with her and the Prophet said alehissalaam all people by Allah I did not know about this and this medallion came as a ransom for a below us and if you wish you leave I will ask for me and if you don't know he is like all other prisoners and the people immediately said o prophet of Allah he is for you and he is to go so the Prophet re-subscribe said a Balazs fee the man went to Makkah as a merchant he took all the things that he was entrusted with because he was an honest man the deposits he gave it back to the people the goods he gave it back to the people and then came to Medina and accepted Islam and embraced Islam so the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave him back his wife may allah be pleased with them all and from this scholars concluded that if a woman accepts Islam while her husband is still a non-muslim and they separate but she does not get married again even after 10 years if he accepts Islam and they want to go back again together they can without making a new marriage and that is why the Prophet gave I will ask his wife without renewing their marriage contract however if after separation she chooses to get married again Palace the marriage is over and she can marry whoever she wishes to marry the hadeeth we are studying today is regarding 1 the simple or minor movement to carrying an impurity because a child would usually not be as clean as an adult they urinate defecate without knowing so they're wearing their pampers or they're wearing their diapers and we do not know if there is an adjuster or not so what's the ruling on that first of all let's address the issue of Natasha is it permissible for me to carry an impurity in my pocket while praying meaning that if I go to the hospital and they request a sample of urine so I make this sample of urine I make wudu and I put the sample of urine in my pocket in the prayer time it's called so I go and pray before submitting it to the laboratory is my prayer valid the answer is no if I know that it's in my pocket it's not valid because one of the conditions of my prayer being valid I am in the state of purity in my body in my clothes and in the place I'm praying in now if I'm carrying a child if I know that the child has an impurity my prayer is invalid but if I don't know the default is that the child is pure so before praying do I have to check the diapers or do I have to smell if the child is pure or not no as long as it appears to me that the child is pure there is no apparent Natasa then I can pray but if it appears to me that otherwise there is an ijazah apparent something is leaking or the smell is overwhelming then I cannot pray secondly the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam is leading the prayer while carrying his granddaughter what would you do if you saw the imam of the masjid carrying his child and praying you probably make takfeer this guy's kafir is he's renovator he's doing and this is because of our ignorance and not having sufficient knowledge the prophet alayhi salatu salam had a lot of mercy especially to his children to his grandchildren it was reported once that he was giving hot ba on the member on the public and he saw al hassan porter hussein three years old walking and falling on his face because of the long dress child the Prophet came down and carried the child and embraced it and kissed it and then went up again and said Subhan Allah Allah Aziz Allah says in the Quran in the mamalu Kamal Adham fitna this is a test from Allah your wealth and your children and when I saw my child walking I could not tolerate but go down and kiss him and by Allah my son this son of mine meaning it hasn't he is a saying it he's a dignitary of his people and Allah will reconcile between two big groups by him and this is what happened as we know from history so the Prophet had great love Ali saw some to his children one of the nomads one of the tribesmen saw him kissing it has an order Hussein and the man said you the prophet of Allah do this he said yes what's wrong he said I have ten children by Allah I had never ever kissed any one of them the man is proud of this is a tribesman I've never kissed any of my children the Prophet said I said do I can I help you if Allah has taken the mercy of your heart something I cannot do so the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to do this carry his grandchildren or tolerate them in one narration he was once leading the prayer in the Masjid and while prostrating he prolonged the prostration to the extent that one of the Companions raised his head because he thought that the Prophet has expired he night he took so long frustrating and we're waiting waits for honorable Allah so he's not finished so he raised his head because he thought definitely the Prophet type and he found that Al Hussein was on his back so he went back to prostrate prostration until the Prophet SAW solemn finished the prayer and then the Prophet addressed him and he said that I was prostrating and my grandson came and mounted me as a beast as his right so I didn't want to bother him look at the love the Prophet Allah saw some had for his children and grandchildren however movement in prayer because the hadith states that whenever he wanted to prostrate he would what put oh mama on the ground prostrate and when he stood up he picks her up again so imagine how he would do Luke or and refer from rock or and she moves from one side to the other so this is movement so is this part of the movement that is permissible in salat or not this is inshallah what we will learn after the break so stay tuned assalamualaikum and welcome back the types of movement that are permissible in salat or let me rephrase that the types of movements in salat are as follows one movement that is forbidden such as movement that is considered to be a lot without any reason and you've seen so many such movements next to my house there lives a young chap in his early 30s maybe late 20s one for prayer after the fire I had to talk to him because from allahu akbar till a salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah and he has been doing this as if he's putting makeup and throughout the whole prayer not in just the recitation even with Luke or even and raising his head from record is doing this and after prayer I started looking and staring at him when he said anything wrong and the guy looked at me he smiled and I said ah hey it's my duty to tell you your prayer is invalid you have to go and pray again because the movement that you have done duly finds your prayer it is uncalled for there is no reason for it so scholars say any movement that is considered a lot and without any legitimate reason this nullifies your prayer so conditions a lot and uncalled-for no legitimate reason the second type of movements is the movement that is not a lot but there is no legitimate reason for it so they say that this is my crew this is and they go there watching the time they're looking at the time so this is little but there is no reason for it so this is my crew it doesn't notify that prayer a friend a dear friend of mine was praying next to me once and his mobile rank so he took his mobile from his pocket while in prayer did this and he was short vision so he had to do this in prayer he's next to me and then he hung up and then he deleted that it's something and put it in his back pocket again this is definitely some of the things that are not recommended if not making your prayer invalid but this is little without a reason so it's makrooh the third type of movement that is little movement but for a reason and this is permissible for example and sometimes it can be recommended on I'm in prayer and I get this itching in my shoulder now if I don't eat it's gonna remain with me until I finished my phone records which will may not make me have any who sure in my salon because I have the urge to it should I cannot so the scholars say no it's highly recommended that you H it so that it would leave the rest of your prayer valid and and possible for you to have to short rather than fighting it without any legitimate cause likewise if someone in prayer needs to fix like we Saudis have this a lot of the time when you raise your head you have to fix it like this so this is a minor movement and it is called for because otherwise it will occupy your whole a prayer one say why do you originally wear it when you pray because this is the customs of the people you have to do this in order to pray not that it is related to the validity of your prayer but it is for the people you have to as they say when you are in wrong do as the Romans do I cannot go and deliver Jew Mahatma wearing Afghani dress Afghani clothes why because this is not the way that the people dress so the people expect people like them to give them hospital Gemma so you have to be dressed like them in a proper way as long as it is inshallah permissible the fourth type of movement is legitimate movement such as if I'm in the row and in front of me there's a gap is it permissible to walk yes it is permissible and recommended if a man fainted in front of me who is going about to fall should I leave space for him so that he would slam on the floor and fall and maybe break his head or should I hold him you have to hold him this movement is for something that is legitimate so any movement whether it is for the sake of prayer like moving forward to fill a gap or for protecting yourself a scorpion a snake is coming to attack you what to do taste or for lost or for lost or for Allah please go please go please go no you have to kill it the Prophet told us even if it comes to you in prayer kill it and this movement is not affecting your prayer on the contrary it is rewarded because you're doing it for the sake of prayer and - Allah this granny would do the job we open the floor for questions Faisal in this this subcontinent we have a special salon in as-salatu 'this b which is prayed during the nights of lailatul cut wherein the recitations are also very different you have specific number of some kalamata is it proven from sunnah salat Odessa B has an issue of dispute among scholars sheikh al albani has authenticated the hadith as well as shekel or note may Allah have mercy on both of their souls shaykh al-islam and lke event a mia and also share members have been FA mean in all the nine yards they all consider it to be a fabricated hadith along with Muhammad and by the way it's a lotta Tessa be was not reported neither by an imam abu hanifa malik northerly mama Schaffer the only one who ever spoke about it was Reema Muhammad he's the last of the Imams and he said that this is fabricated we do not know any origin of it and the format of the the prayer is weird a strange nothing is like it in the standing position after reciting the surah you say hamdulillah subhana Allah but I think 15 times and then you do that again in your record and you do it when you say semi Allah even happier and you do it when you salute and you do it between the two such days and this format is similar to nothing in Islam and that is why the scholars say if Imam Muhammad did not know about it and all the four three Imams did not report it and none of the Companions had ever done it and we have only one hadith which is editable a bus may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet said I saw me at bath yeah or uncle of the Prophet Allah Salim should I tell you should I give you and he told him this hadith and he taught him this format so the scholars say that it is not an authentic hadith besides that the reward of doing it once in a lifetime or once every year or once every month or once every week or once every day is the same so the scholars say that this is not like any other form of worship and that is why it's fabricated Kaleem a shake if there is a scenario that we are playing at home in the hall I mean in hall and someone is ringing the door ringing the bell at the door can we move and is this movement permissible to open the door and get back to the sila the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once opened the door for Aisha may Allah be pleased with her while he was praying so some scholars say that this is permissible others say that this is only permissible and voluntary prayers in mandatory or for prayer it's not permissible and they failed to give the distinction so the majority say that whatever is applicable in voluntary is applicable and mandatory prayers and therefore it is permissible insha'Allah for you when praying to turn off the air conditioned to turn on the fan it's this movement is minor the Prophet as you recall used to pray and mount the member and go down to prostrate and this is a movement and he used to do this re he a salatu was-salam our key shift is it not true that the sahabas when they went to give the hour to different countries they went with their own culture and their own the way they dress and it wasn't be a Roman in room but we the way you are and also vice versa if supposing salman al-farsi rodillas allah knew if he came from Persia to Arabia didn't he dress like the Arabs while he was there or like try to imitate prophets of us this is an issue that needs to be widely discussed because it depends on the benefits if I go to a country that I know that they are hostile to the Arabs or to the Muslims and I wear my normal clothes and I try to give Dawa this might not be the best idea it might be better to blend in and give now an according to the Quran Sunnah but by wearing things that are acceptable to them while not doing something Haram however the Companions when they traveled for Dawa bear in mind that they Arabs all used to travel like this and the majority of the people's dresses and costumes were almost similar that is why the Arabs in Arabia the prophetess I'm used to wear clothes from Yemen and he used to get clothes from Rome from the Byzantium sand and etc so the clothes were there that were generally used not specifically for a certain people for me it is forbidden to wear a particular clothes that only worn by the disbelievers so for example if I wear a Texan hat this is Haram because no one wears this except this believers generally speaking I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
