  "transcript": "Uh question is that if someone uh he has from the past when he used to memorize Quran he has knowledge of the because his teacher taught him that and now whenever he reads the Quran or reads the people in uh he just inevitably he whenever he reads Quran he knows he's reading he can't control it the only option is he reads in Mawi style all the time which is very difficult or uh to read in whatever style he once you just read and say so what is the ruling on this can you read just like that there is no problem in reading the Quran in the mat this is what most reciters do however when the recitation of the Quran simulates a song and the people listening to you think that you're singing not reading the Quran this is what's haram this is disrespecting the Quran But to use the makat, the sevenat or sika or the the likes in reciting the Quran without simulating it to music, this is permissible."
