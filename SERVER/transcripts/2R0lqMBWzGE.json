  "transcript": "the most important thing in Islam is al-qaeda without it you cannot be classified as a Muslim because al-qaeda means your belief so if you don't know who your Lord is as the origin if you don't know what are the things that you command it to do if you don't know your messenger sallallaahu idea where you sell them even if you pray 500 records a day even if you fast not only Ramadan the whole year all of this would not help you a bit at all therefore any we thought that during this last month of Ramadan we go through the basics there are technical books in a peda that may confuse you a bit according to your level of knowledge but this is the common mistakes that Muslims do when they try to jump the ladder two steps at a time and sometimes they just want to go to the top without taking the basics this book falafel soda is one of the basics that students of knowledge learn it gives you an insight of what your beliefs should be like children in Islamic environments in so many countries not only in Saudi Arabia also in Sudan also in Nigeria itself they study this book and memorize it by heart since a very young age alongside with Alcoa hi dad our ban which is very very little in short alongside with heater Bhutto heat and so on and these great publications were written by the late Imam Muhammad Abdullah happy Allah mercy on his soul one of the great reformers of our times who did not invent a new method he was a ham body by faith and he did not invent anything new in a leader because he was almost identical to shake for Islam even Tamiya and if no play here may Allah have mercy on their souls but he faced a lot of hatred due to the fact that he came to take the people out of what they were used to for so long and that is worshipping idols devoting robada to other than Allah and hence he was met with fierce resistance from the super Sufis from the idol worshippers the grave worshippers from the lava and the Shia because he brought the people back to the basics to the Quran and to the Sunnah purifying their Arpita from any impurities that were attached to it throughout the years of ignorance so this book is sha Allah would open our eyes and I presume that most of you know what we are going to talk about but it is more of an eye opener in sha allah to all of us I sincerely don't know how long will this take us but with this lockdown hamdulillah what better time to be spent rather than in seeking knowledge and getting to know allah azzawajal better so we begin in sha allah azzawajal by brother Nasir reading the English text and if needed we will comment on it Nalani as budgeted a bismillah r-rahman r-rahim in the name of Allah the most gracious most merciful this is known to the scholars and the students of knowledge as attest Nia bismillah in Arabic it is Jo and I'm not gonna going to grammar because this would take us more than drama Donna Shalala but the to sum things up they say that bismillah means in the name of Allah and then there is a verb that depends on what you're doing so now we're about to read so when we say bismillah man the Rahim this means that in the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful I begin reading if I want to eat I say bismillah while I intend by saying bismillah I'm going to eat I'm beginning to eat so having the name of Allah inaugurating and beginning every act we do this is seeking blessings from Allah Azza WA JAL and this is done in so many things when we enter the message when we have intimacy with our spouses we say I was after them when we start to slaughter and animal illa Allah Akbar and the list goes on so rarely you'll find people beginning their talk their books their lectures without bismillah yes a lot of the scholars and there is may begin with and Hum Dil I have a bill I let me know so allah wa salam ala kind of you know hamlet yet there is a hadith it's a different opinion among scholars whether it's authentic or not that any subject that is begun without bismillah it is cut so to complete your subject you have to begin with the name of Allah Azza WA JAL and I won't go into the meaning of a man which is a name of Allah a soldier that can't be used with anyone else but him we find the people in the subcontinent in the UK the name is laugh man they drop on the LA or add under Brockman so they call people hey man what's happening this is totally prohibited there are names of Allah as knowledge and that can only be used on him and the first utmost name of Allah is Allah all the names go back to him so when someone says what is Allah nobody says a lot man over him rather when someone says what is the meaning of our heel you say it's the name of Allah what's the meaning of a man it's the name of Allah all names and attributes go back to Allah so Allah is the name and you have to know that man is also can only be given to Allah there are names that can be shared so for example Raheem can we call someone and Raheem Peres hey what were you having lunch tomorrow no problem Aziz Allah described Yusuf in the Quran as elaziz or as he saw misery there's no problem Hakim my name is awesome and Hakeem again there's no problem as seen here Alba see all of these can be shared but there are names that only allah azzawajal can be called with an illusion knows best yes he know me i'ma have me a new that we are obligated to the land for matters first okay first of all he says no so Sheikh Muhammad Nabeel hat is addressing the students and he's using this kind way of addressing them by bringing their attention by saying no and then he says Rahim ik Allah what does raha Mokelumne it means that may Allah have mercy on you and it is always good and great to make duaa whenever you speak to someone I remember that for so many years and Arabic I'd say this a lot whenever someone does something for me I usually tell him along well they cuff on Allah or that way of Allah with Chuck all of these means to me Oh forgive your sins may Allah have mercy on your parents may Allah give you brightness in your face and people are amazed so shall you say so many good things I never pay attention to it it's just a habit instead of faint saying thank you or jaeseok Allahu Allah I make dua for people and they love it when you say may Allah have mercy on your parents they love it so it's always good rather it's always excellent when we make dua before addressing people this increases the positivity when you go to people and start pointing out their mistakes they will feel offended but when you give them duaa and you come to them and you show the good things in them and then you point out their faults they would tend to accept this so the chef says there are the majimak Allah No may Allah have mercy on you that we must learn for basic matters I'm reading for from a deaf a different translation but it's the same thing and it's close by so don't worry is the same textbook so there are four matches that the share the imam wants to bring our attention to that are essential that we learn and know so the first one no sir yeah the first one is them infest knowledge which means awareness of Allah and awareness of his prophet and awareness of the religion of Islam based on evidence okay so the first most important matter that you have to know is to know Allah as the WA JAL and to know Allah subhana WA Ta'ala is not something theoretical so when someone asks you who's your Lord Allah okay what do you mean by that that is Allah no you have to have the conviction in your heart that Allah Azza WA JAL is our Creator is a provider is our owner is the giver of life and death is the facilitator of all our affairs so you know Allah Azza WA JAL with your heart a knowledge that makes you submit to Allah's commands and this here we have a huge gap between what is supposed to be and what is the reality so most people say yes I worship Allah oh yeah I know Allah but when you come and examine and scrutinize their lives you will feel that this can't be a Muslim all the things that he's doing goes against Allah's will and he doesn't submit his will to Allah he doesn't feel like a servant to Allah he may complain and say why Allah have you done this to me why do you hate me how can you dare and speak to a like this yeah sure he said there are so many times I asked allah for so many things and he never replied to me subhanAllah now can we classify this brother to be a real Muslim it's just the glimpse of what true knowledge of allah azza wajal we require and to know his prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam his messenger so when someone says I know the Messenger of Allah as The Watcher so the Lord is Allah okay what do you know about him we find zero do you find did you know the name of his mother his father you know his daughters his sons his wives you know about his battles his suffering in Mecca for 13 years he do know his biography his seer and the people's in unfortunately not do you know Cristiano Ronaldo or Mohamed Salah have liver food oh yeah man I know that his daughter is called Mecca and I don't know if he's gonna get another daughter and called her Medina and maybe the third one is called of course you know everything actually but when it comes to your prophet is a certain whom Allah ordered you to love more than yourself and your parents and your wife and your children you're ignorant you know nothing and then you practiced it yeah I'm a Muslim subhanAllah the first matter you should learn is knowledge knowledge of what knowledge which is to know Allah know Allah through what through his signs and creations to know the prophet of Allah are you salat wa salam and do you know the religion of islam with supporting evidences this is the first matter by the way huh and by the way you have to know these questions because you will have to answer them in your grief when you're set and light in your graves they will come to horrible angels and they're intimidating they're frightening they're scary and they tell you who's your Lord what is your religion and who is your messenger if you don't walk the talk in this life and know these things and act upon you're in deep doo-doo you are doomed because only those who walk the talk will be able to answer and we will get to get to talk about this again in Sharma yes he second acting on this so the first is knowledge the second matter is acting upon this application of this knowledge I could go to Harvard I could go to Yale and I could see PhD holders knowing maybe more than I do and they can write books and theses and essays about a Peter about the knowledge of Allah and the Prophet Isis Allah and the religion but they do not walk the talk they do not implement it and act upon it like the hypocrites they know but they don't act so this is something that is essential for you learning at either to know and also to act upon okay yes not now sell it's not coffee break yet we have probably trouble with the Internet's okay and Italy rejoined by Nasser the third is calling people to edit what is meant by Internet is fine okay uh come along here so can you all hear me and see me yes that's good thank you okay so the third one is calling people to its old I know Allah Azza WA JAL the Prophet a sermon my religion I act according to my religion and according to the commands of Allah and the Prophet s of Salaam there is a third thing that is needed which is to call people to it it's not sufficient to be selfish to be a monk in a room or in a temple on top of a mountain worshipping Allah is the Woodyard and neglecting everyone else no you have to walk the talk you have to go down and you have to call the people to what you believe and this is the benefit of knowledge if I were to sit with someone and talk to him and he asks me four or five questions and then I would feel inferior I would feel agitated because I'm unable to answer him and I start swearing at him maybe attacking him this is from Shaytan why because Shaitaan is utilizing my ignorance to make me look bad but if I have knowledge I can call him to Islam and this is the message and this is the role of all prophets of Allah they knew they acted upon and they call their people and they called everyone to what they believe to share this greatness with them number four are you with us no sir yes I'm with you now number four patients with the harm that befalls default that befalls due to its so okay so in short to be patient why because when you have knowledge and when you act upon it and when you call people to it they're not gonna leave you alone they're gonna abuse you they're going to harass you they're going to attack you look what had happened to all messengers and prophets of Allah since the beginning of time all of them were attacked harassed accused of being crazy accused of being soothsayers the poets all of these bad things that were attached to them simply because they called the people to worship Allah such panel so if you are on the straight path you are definitely will need to be patient and to accept the harm that will come to you because if people don't harm you there's something wrong in your tower if everybody is okay with you if the superpowers are okay with you if the non-muslims are okay with you and they're sending you gifts and invitation cards huh there's something wrong with your tower you're not calling to the right Islam because the Prophet himself alayhi salatu salam suffered greatly throughout his years 23 years giving Dawa at the end Madonna as you said he could only pray while sitting down because of the problems and the things that the Muslims and the people brought unto him he was so tired and worn out because of that so nothing comes easy and this is known from the life story of the messengers of Allah The Witcher Oh careful the proof of this is Allah saying what I saw in this and interfere in Edina MN worm it'll slowly hurt you whatever so will happy what else always shuttle so this you have the translation yes in the name of Allah the most merciful the destroyer of mercy by the time verily mankind is lust except for those who believe and perform righteous deeds and advised one another towards the truth and advised one another towards patience so these four things are crystal clear in this magnificent surah subhanAllah all the people on earth if way if they were to collaborate and just bring us one surah of a number of words they cannot it cannot be but divine from Allah so this is the word of Allah Almighty sums it all up in well us by time allah azza wajal swears by any of his creation we cannot swear except by allah subhanaw taala so Allah swears by time man is at or in loss by default mankind is in loss except so this exception is what we had just talked about knowledge in the Lavina amman belief is knowledge well I mean oh sorry hats implementing and acting upon what you know well what I also been happy they call people and recommend one another with the truth this is calling people whatever so be supple and they advised one another and recommend to one another to be patient and tolerant and this is what you will see read the Quran if you're fortunate to read the Quran you will find for example in the store that all Imams usually read in federal prayer of a Juma they read in the beginning Stuart in the second Karaka they eat short an instant and the end towards the end six seminar verses before then Allah says in Nana's ineradicable an Athens dealer we that Allah have revealed unto you the Quran you would expect that after this ayah Allah would say so very grateful be thankful show your gratitude know Allah says first barely hook me up a beaker be patient to her Lord's commands meaning that Allah is giving his messenger heads-up that due to the Quran that we revealed to you you will suffer and people will show their enmity and hatred to you so be patient so this beautiful surah if I'm Jeffrey What did he say Imam Shafi said may Allah have mercy on him Sadie had Allah no sundown approved to his creation other than this surah that is such an awesome it would have been sufficient for them so mmm Jeffrey says and believes that this sewer is so magnificent that it would have sufficed humanity if only they will ponder and contemplate apart well why it is a short surah that we lazy amends whenever it is moderate we just read it because we want to get the prayer over with there are soldiers from Allah what work so short so beautiful people when they hear the MMS in well the house of this yes but if you hear him say and if me and this is yellow we're doomed man why because we don't have the knowledge the knowledge of Allah the knowledge of the religion the knowledge of the Prophet Isis I am had we had had me known allah azza wajal we would never feel fed up or tired or even bored from reciting and listening to a large beautiful words yes sir so now yes him sit of course I'll buy you all know that he is imam hamid evidence my idol Buhari the compiler of sahih al-bukhari the most authentic book after the quran on earth which muslims rely on and believed to be the most authentic book after the quran what does Aemon Buhari say in his book now remember so he had Buhari is not a book of people's words him a Malik said he Muhammad said and then looking into the different opinions of scholars known the Buhari structured his books are according to chapters so the chapter of the chapter of bedell wahi chapter of the Eman chapter of salat chapter of tafseer chapter of jihad etc and he would bring a title then a hadith or two maybe more maybe less and then he moves on scholars say that the knowledge of Imam Bukhari because this is not something he's writing for himself he's just narrating reporting Hadees they said that his knowledge his fake is illustrated in this title so before he mentions an ayah or a hadith in Buhari he goes to tell you that this is my favor so before he narrates or reports the hadith he puts to you what the tell Gemma therefore they say Buhari you feet away give me the knowledge the fear of Buhari is in the Tajima so what does a Bihari stick he said in this chapter knowledge comes from knowledge currently for speech and action why he brought the verse of Allah Allah Allah say it's far Elam and know either in work was thoughtfully them big so know that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and seek forgiveness for your sins so he began so we began by mentioning knowledge before speech and action so what does this mean a melon Bihari looked at this ayah Phelim let it be no o Muhammad that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and then seek forgiveness and seek Allah's forgiveness for your sin and those who following an evil Buhari looked at this ayah and said o Allah made knowledge come prior to acting upon it and this is why in the format as we spoke about the first matter is knowledge they said second matter is to implement it and to act upon it so even remember how he looked at this ayah and made this as a title for this chapter and he went on to mention that knowledge is more important than action because with knowledge you have the driver to act upon it while actions by themselves without knowledge may take you to help look at the monks look at the priests who worship allah azzawajal for days without end by on what unfold scooter they have gone astray because they do not possess the knowledge that is needed I think we should stop here and answer yes yes and take questions take questions of Shama Charlotte right Allah so good curing a session and then address some few questions so this one is acts in Aslam o alaikum what is the ruling regarding of a moot in whitter it did before or after okay the most authentic opinion is that Knut with the tap and that with a paw when you say O Lord o and there is O'Connor in at the end there is a farm in Arabic pop means to despair from Allah's mercy and this is the major sin while who note with a slight T a root means or has two meanings one to prolong standing in prayer Allah says were humu lillahi qanitin' stand - alas Dajjal in silence do not speak do not talk because this is salat and the Knut here means also to prolong reciting the Quran for long hours or long time maybe not hours the other meaning of Knut is the dua which was not ever reported to us that the Prophet had done it on his salat WA Salam in winter so if the Prophet didn't do it in whichever why are we doing it well there is an authentic hadith that al hasanat Nally may Allah be pleased with him and at the time Al Hassan was like seven eight years of age and he came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam asking him to teach him a dua to recite in Knut and this hadith is mind blowing a child of seven or eight even nine years of age coming to his grandfather to ask him for money to buy babji or to ask him for permission to go to the fun fairs no al hasanat Natalie was one of the great Amanda some even classify him as the fifth caliph because he reigned for six months and he was the Haditha after his father ready and then he gave up the throne to reconcile between the Muslim factions and allowed Muhammad necessary melodies when the man with his father to rule the Muslims so this young boy is an imam and the Prophet acknowledged this when he was young so he said teach me so the Prophet taught him how to say you cannot which is Allah madam if a man had eight what - if a man have a what a well then if he meant they were late what buddy Keith him a fight was initially tebab an hour to highlight that's and now people had taken this and made a long hours of duaa based on it the door that was taught by a prophet as somewhat short so they said oh it's okay to add something because it's a place for Dora so I said okay add something so they added a phrase or two along with some other majestic a matter how to behave in any way no mercy beautiful from the hadith then they added to three more doors then another ten then in another fifty and nowadays we find people in taraweeh in which er you time it and it's about 20 minutes of what are you doing you broke my shoulder saying I mean I mean the Quran you recited was full who Allah and it will be cooler cook what I always beautiful words were four sentences and now you're giving 20 minutes in the last 10 nights of ramadan after the Hatem of the quran or what they call laila the cutter it may go to 35 to 40 minutes and this is extremism this is not from the sermon going back to your question should it be before the record or after the record the best majority of scholars say that it is done after you rise up from reporting Sunday Allah will you mean Hamidah combina when I could have a la medida and if you do it before a record this is applicable and possible with some schools of thought but this is not the most authentic and Allah knows best and the second question Sheikh what is the what is more vicious Tara we ought to hide gypped what is more now sir what is more what okay I think we've lost Nasser no problem aji there is an umbrella this is called night prayer underneath the umbrella there are branches of it such as nah we have to hide jute and the hatchet is usually trade after sleeping usually but if someone does not sleep then he can pray to hide it then the best time of tahajud is the last third of the night so if you have from sunset till I found a feather of 9 hours so the last third would be three hours before fetcher now also we have something called taraweeh and then a week is not prayed except during the month of Ramadan in congregation if women want to pray night prayer in Ramadan home it's not culturally it's called nitrate and this is why it is best that you prayed you're telling if you're praying at home at the last third of the night so nowadays we have locked down when do I pray taraweeh I do not pray it after Isha I go to bed wake up before fetcher Thani so I offer my taro my taraweeh which is night prayer Tahajjud and I also have circle the pre-dawn meal and then we prefetcher so the umbrella of night prayer underneath it is Tahajjud taraweeh which they're all called night prayer or TR mullah heel yes sir now what is the ruling on a woman praying with her feet open well I mean she's not covering her feet with her feet openness yeah no matter okay this is an issue of dispute the vast majority of scholars say that the whole of women during trade is Allah except for their faces and their hands that's it the feet are also our and they're specially our when she goes out of her home because all of her body is our with the difference of opinion where that the face and the hands are or not during prayer this is Shalala no difference or great difference that she's allowed to uncover her face or she's obliged to uncover her face and hands the feet is an issue of dispute some scholars say that it is not part of the hour others say it is part of the aura and I'm inclined to the latter opinion that it is our and women must cover them when they pray or when they leave their homes Allah knows best Michelle I think the next question is if there is no male in the house and a woman lead the taraweeh prayer if there are women in the there are men if there are men in the house but they are maja and there is a mother and her sister and her daughter and they want to pray Jumeirah congregation women only there's no problem with that whether there are men or not if there are none in Muharram men then she should not raise her voice because and then Muharram must not hear a woman reciting the Quran but if there are only her mom's husband father brother then there is no problem in a woman leading only women a woman cannot at all lead a male worshiper where does a woman stand she stand in the same lining of the other women men usually stand in the front the Imam and behind him the congregation with women no they all stand in one line and their Imam is in between them on her eyes and her left there are worshipers yes sir mashallah second this question is what is the ruling of a cyst on her period carrying a Koran note reading displacement the majority of scholars say that holding the Musa the Arabic for an the book for a woman in her period or in her menses it's prohibited this is the opinion of the majority of scholars even has him different Scheffel Albani followed and it's safer to stick with the vast majority of Muslims now having said that if she wears gloves and she holds almost half there's no problem with that because there's no direct contact with it if she reads it from a mobile or from a PDA or from a computer or from a book of tafseer because the seer the Arabic Quran but alongside it a lot of words that are not from the Quran then in this case she's okay to do that without any problem and on the nose best I'm sure this one is accent now how do I explain myself to a non-muslim that Allah is one with a clear evidence do I need to put more effort if you want to give downward to a non-muslim to explain to him that Allah is this one this non-muslim either he's a Christian or a Jew or following other religions if he is a Jew then you have no problem Jews believe in the oneness of Allah if he is a Christian also you are mainly not having any problem because the vast majority of Christians acknowledge that Allah the Creator what they call the Father in heaven is one and the majority of them don't believe that Jesus Christ who was a human who was born to a woman who was crucified as they believe we do not believe Muslims that he was crucified they don't believe deep down that he is God or the Son of God they are confused and it's difficult for them to believe though they say it there she's three-in-one he is the son of God that God was him and he was this and that him if you ask them random questions you will cast doubt in their hearts that way they will never be able to get over that so you have to talk to them and see tell them if they're Christians if Jesus is God there who was in the uterus or in the you and the womb of Mary the Virgin if they say it was Allah then who was running the universe so no no no it was Allah and it was a father how can it be if you say that Jesus is the Son of God so do you mean to tell me that he was born said yes said okay before he was born what was he he wouldn't find an answer see if a God is born he cannot be God a true God must not be born he's not born does not beget it's not be gotten let us assume that he's the son of God now if you have four children three of them rude abusive and disobedient and one of them is kind loving obedient and a coolness to your I would any man be considered to be sane to kill the good child the good son so that he can forgive the other three or would you kill the other three how dare you say that Allah crucified his beloved son for the sins of the son of Adam why would he crucify the good one and leave the bad ones this doesn't make any sense and the scripture itself says that the sole claim Jesus when he was crucified he was shouting that why have you forsaken me so who was he shouting to to his father why would he shout he's God he can release himself and if he was crucified for the sins of mankind what about the sins before him from Adam to his time who will have redemption of it it's there are basic there are logic logical questions not only to Christians no normal people that you can ask and you can take them out to believe that there's only one creator one god of this universe Oh monstrous no sir my god are you guys listening when this is enough m'kay okay and Allah does take one too more question and then we end for today's session in sharla inshaallah and the next question is do I have to follow a particular math have the issue of meta and following a particular man have depends on the person asking if someone says to me share I am totally ignorant I don't know the difference between Quran and hadith I have no knowledge none whatsoever in the basics and I'm a blind man I don't know what to do such a person we tell him that you follow one man huh or follow one ship that you trust that you believe he's righteous and practicing and that he knows what he's doing and whatever he tells you you do with because on the day of judgment allah azzawajal knows that you're not capable of finding the truth free by yourself but if you're someone who's a little bit knowledgeable has the ability to search whether the hadith is authentic or not in this case you cannot follow the particular method because Allah tells us in the Quran to obey a Allah and to obey the message arises an and those of knowledge or of authority of us what Allah amra me so obeying Allah is to follow the Quran obeying the Prophet a son is to follow the Sunnah and if you know that the method have you're following is going against the sooner instead of justifying it for your met her follow your prophet alayhi salatu salam in what he had commanded you to do this is what any Muslim should do in Allah knows best I'm sure the next question is please is it allowed for someone to lend the Holy Quran with mobile application such as for unlights is it allowed to what now sir is it allowed to learn from mobile apps yes of course a he the mobile app I have on Quran upon my mobile is the the word of Allah but it is in digital form so it's X and zeros or eyes ones and zeros once I turn it off there is no Quran if I go to the bathroom with it there's no problem providing I don't turn it on once I turn it on Hamas it becomes prohibited for me to use it because the Quran is visible so you can learn the meeting is being recorded thank you Microsoft so it is permissible to read from the Quran and to use it during Temari so when I stand in taraweeh I read the Quran when Jews or to choose oh that's totally permissible and to learning to memorize the Quran from it and allah azzawajal knows best I shall not vertically shake do you mind we take one extra and we end I don't know but where do you go and I who asked a question and you go get your coffee it's fasting time for another shake then it looks a bit terrible down here that's right but now it's good ok give me a question Isaac assalamualaikum can we literally look at a hard copy to recite the Knut in the width well I will look at the book to attend to Knut why were am doing our solder the winter okay first of all we've stated that connote itself is not something that the Prophet I son used to do all the time actually it was never reported that he had done it but he taught his grandson hasn't how to say it so if you want to only read the short version which he thought hasn't no problem but if you're going to bring a book and you start flipping the pages and read like for 10 minutes or 15 minutes now this is not at all recommended say the drive that you memorized and that would be more than sufficient and enough insha Allah who asked soldier none next question in this quarantine period Shaykh we pray Jamaat at home or non jama ats masjid five daily prayers Masjid is it is it recommended to pray in congregation if yes are we to create a tool the Taraka out of Juma operator super prayer normally well if you are in Nigeria or in Saudi Arabia where I am or in the Gulf or in Malaysia which is the Muslim country then if you do not pray more in the message you prayed for in your home there is no problem in collecting your brothers and praying for for Rekha's in congregation home but you do not pray that you mwah because the Jomon in Muslim countries require the permission of the the Muslim ruler who is the the great imam and allah awj knows best the best rating woman becomes pure the night before or in the midnight and take a bath and also did Twitter for support on waking offer further can you fast for the day is the fast quality if she bath after fajar let's say 8 a.m. is how fast valid so what counts is the knowledge of her purity was it before fetcher or after fajar if a woman found out that she is pure from her menses seconds before they identify her and she intended to fast her fast is valid now so the nun is given she had not taken her whistle no problem she's fueled so the the fasting is valid but if a woman went to bed before hogr saying that I'm not sure if I'm pure or not but if I'm pure I will fast she wakes up an hour after Adam and fetcher and she finds out that she's pure we asked her are you certain that you became pure before the advance she said no how would I know I was asleep in this case she cannot fast and that that day is not counted out of Ramadan so I said what if my menses was passed 15 days was your feeder the menses cannot exceed half of the month so if a woman period is prolonged once it reaches 15 days in total she must perform Woodson she must fast and pray but she predict performance would do after every event after cleaning herself and she can pray as long as she wants until the time is out no drama near Akkad is recommended for touring did you say last question this way the last question is how many guys I've been counting you said last question this is number 5 who's come what is the number of raka this is an issue of dispute among the scholars some take the extreme opinion saying that it must not go or exceed over 11 because the Prophet Isis am according to later I shall on huh in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere that she told someone who asked her how many records did the Prophet perform in Ramadan she said he never performed in Ramadan or outside Ramadan more than 11 recognized but there is another hadith by high issue herself and Bible advanced the Prophet used to pray 13 degrees and when a man came to the prophet I saw Sam asking him in front of all the Muslims o prophet of Allah tell tell me about night prayer so the Prophet told him night prayer is prayed in twos and twos two by twos and if you feel fair offer one raka of whitter in this hadith the man is ignorant and he came to be taught by the Prophet that he saw the salam who told him the format which is two by two but he did not set to him the max which is 11 according to what the other party says which means that if 11 was the best and one should not go over that the Prophet would have told him but due to the fact that the Prophet did not tell him this means that the sky's the limit it's up to your preference you are pray 11 to be safe that's great you want to pray 23 so that you would shorten the amount of time needed to stand for prayer while reciting more Quran this is also perfect and legitimate and there's no problem it's not 11:23 or 47 or whatever done in the sky is the limit it is open for you to choose whatever you feel comfortable with and of marzo generals best masala turmeric Allah before me we for those there's a controversy going on here without the Q&A about the woman's voice so maybe you can answer that today or tomorrow a lot you want it today yes if you can shall they were end with this okay the voice of a woman is not our no one had ever said that a woman should not speak actually in the or an allah azza wajal addressed the mothers to the believers are mothers the wives of the Prophet Ursula that when they speak they must not soften their voices so that a person with illness in his heart would not be tempted which means that women by nature have a soft voice and so holla my wife always makes an issue out of that and she says whenever someone calls you on the mobile for questions I know if it's a man or a woman so I said how do you know that he said by the way you reply to the Salaam so if it's a man you say nam or they could Salam Allahu Allah and if it's a woman you stick now when it comes to them and of course this is your Eastern I do not do this actually the sisters that call me know for sure that I don't give them any slack and I don't take it easy on them because Shaitaan is there sometimes this is called just to vent or to complain of their husbands or of betrayals or so on and they need someone to talk to they need a shoulder to lean on and this is where Shaitaan comes this is why I don't open the door at all to such incidents but this is what the observation of my wife is so generally speaking yes the voice of a woman has an impact on men and this is why Allah told women not to softened their voices when a woman talks normally there is no problem sisters daughters call me on the phone all the time asking questions no problem sisters called telephone operators they call the hospitals doctors they call asking for groceries they talk to the driver they talked to the pharmacists no problem so speaking is no problem when there is a legitimate reason for it but when a woman comes and recites the Quran she's not gonna say hello bill [Music] like the old shoe of how we used to be touched by their beautiful recitation though some cultures will say Oh what is this kind of recitation the women was going to say in a beautiful melodic voice that would turn men's head around this is not permissible so the most authentic opinion is that the competition's that we see on TV or in videos where women come and recite the Quran in front of men this is totally not permissible and this defies the purpose of true and really a job and Alonso Jenkins West Charlotte
