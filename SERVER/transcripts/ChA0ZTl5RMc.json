  "title": "Moving the finger in tahashud",
  "transcript": "well the question is should I only be moving the front tip of the index finger during t or the whole uh index finger and should I start moving it at the beginning or after the or after the Shah now to answer such a question we have to know what exactly was the prophet doing when he prayed I didn't see him I wasn't there sallallahu alaihi wasallam but the companions were there and there are two hadiths one by may Allah be pleased with him where he says that the prophet whenever he sat down for he used to point out his index finger and he used to move it praying with it or supplicating with it the second Hadith of abdah pleased with him and with his father said the same Hadith but he said without moving it and Scholars have different opinions regarding these two hadiths the first Hadith is more authentic and it has an e an extra bit of information and that is why Scholars take that and refer to theith of abdah Zu to be a lesser in power and authenticity it is like if two come if two people come to you and you're the judge one says I saw Ahmed steal the wallet from the drawer and the other one says I did not see Ahmed steal the wallet whom would the judge take the testimony of he the testimony of the person who saw it because the other one who did did not see it maybe he was looking the other way around maybe he was asleep maybe he did not look maybe he's blind but the one who puts an affirmative statement and he testifies to see something has more information than the other one and that is why it's they they took thei of may Allah be pleased with him and uh approving that the prophet used to do this it doesn't say that he used to move his finger after the or after the shahada it stated that whenever he sat down he pointed out his in finger and he moved it and Scholars this end the move mement so some say that what you should do is let me put it in this way okay this way you put the middle finger with your thumb and you hold the rest as in the fit as in in the case of a fist and you point your index finger like this and you point it moving it some say you move it up and down and may Allah have mercy on his soul used to say that you move it up when you mention the name of Allah because this is part of supplicating So when you say to the end of of the and also but this has no proof to support it Alani may Allah have mercy in his soul says that any Arab reading this Hadith would simply Point his index finger and he would move it like this in its place as Imam Ahmed was asked do you move it and he said yes a lot so you just put it point it like this and you move it and you don't move it up and down you just just curve it and move it like so in its place shaking it as you are shaking it or as you are shivering this what appears to be the most closest description of moving your index index finger from the minute you sit down until you end up up your uh until you finish up your prayer or until if you're praying more than two and Allah Knows Best [Music]"
