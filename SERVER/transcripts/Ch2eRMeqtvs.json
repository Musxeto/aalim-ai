  "transcript": "how are you alhamdulillah my question is I have come across a verse which says Those Who come to Allah with a pure heart will be saved could you please elaborate this Ayah for me that what it means with a pure heart in this one this is in reference to ibraim peace be upon him when he's warning the People by saying that no one wealth or children would benefit him on the day of judgment except those who come to Allah with a pure heart with a healthy heart and the scholars say that a pure or healthy heart is a heart that has no shik in it so a Muslim or a non-muslim who comes with with shik being committed he's he will go to Hellfire for eternity and those who come with a pure heart Muslims who come with a heart that does not have any shik in it rather it's filled withed if they have some Innovation they will be purified in Hellfire for some time until they are clean and then they will be admitted to Jenna unless Allah Wills otherwise and those who come with a heart that is healthy and pure from sh and an evation but they have major or minor sins in it most likely Allah would forgive that if he wills and if not they will be purified for some time in Hellfire and then they will be admitted to Paradise for eternity and I hope this answers your question"
