  "title": "Can Muslims in Sweden(Scandinavian countries)break fast according to Saudi Arabia - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rockman from sweden says that it's very long too fast in sweden in the second Scandinavian countries and we tackled this issue three or four days ago but I will repeat it for my brother Abdulrahman he alonzo gel in the quran mentioned to us that fasting begins from the break of dawn which is a horizontal white thread when the night is black once you see the white thread meaning that the day time a sign once you say once you see that the break of dawn is there then you have to refrain from from eating drinking and intimacy and this continues until the night comes the night falls which is by the sunset so this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran Allah did not say whether this is 11 hours or 20 hours he simply stated that when you have day and night and you can recognize the day from the night then you have to fast the whole of the day now the fatwas you are referring to are totally bogus and unfounded they're baseless because they're telling you to break your fast according to makkah will they also ask you to pray mother a prayer when the Sun is in the middle of the sky because maca prayed Madrid at this time this is no you have to wait until it the Sun sets Touche so what are you guys doing so ok there is no excuse none whatsoever Allah so they'll prescribe fasting upon all Muslims all over the world as long as you can distinguish between daytime and nighttime you must fast the daytime and according to changing the schedule no this is not permissible when it is permissible is when you have to four hours of nighttime or 24 hours of sunlight and there's no night at all like in the Arctic probably in this case yes you have to look to estimate the timings of salat the timings of fasting according to the closest country that can distinguish between day and night"
