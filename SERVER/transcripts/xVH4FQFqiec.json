  "transcript": "about Batman says how should I control my Neffs this is a very generic question how do I control my soul myself and why would you want to control yourself or your soul usually this is asked when a person loses control either by doing sins or by abandoning mandatory acts and he wants to put a stop to that first of all in order to control your your soul you need to seek refuge in allah azza wajal and ask him for assistant you ask allah for assistance because the Prophet used to say either his salat WA Salam yeah hi oh hi um bill hematocrit Steve and he used to call Allah by his beautiful names and attributes and seek refuge in his mercy that Allah does not let him to himself so so many times people say you can make a difference you convince yourself that you're able to do this you are strong and no one can put you down you are the man and they encourage you to depend on yourself rather than directing you to depend on allah azza wajal and this is a serious offense we are unable to take an inhale a breath without a Las permission so when you tell someone and I met one of the Diaries who had leukemia and he said that I managed to recover from leukemia by self convincing and I trained myself and I did tell myself that you'll get over it you have the power and I kept on doing this and until it's gone I was shocked in your a diary what are you calling people to tutto Heat this is not the heat you're asking them to depend on themselves yes you have to depend 100% on allah azza wajal also do the necessary means to get your healing process ongoing while depending on Allah not by depending on yourself and believing in yourself and thinking that your breathing pattern would give you strength and power and you neglect Allah as though gel all together this is wrong so you have to ask Allah Azza WA JAL to assist you and to help you and to support you rather than let you be your own judge and be the one in control give your control to Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala you have to also in order to harness your self whether evil or good you have to follow the Quran the Sunnah and once you manage to follow the Quran and the Sunnah to the letter you have to do this while submitting your own will to Allah so you don't try to logic things Allah said do this you do it you don't say what is the wisdom show me the justification for that no Allah told you to do something the prophets Allah Allah Allah prohibited you from doing something you adhere and say Salmonella Aparna you have no other option we obey and we hear and listen so by submitting your will to Allah following the Quran the Sunnah and by reading the biography of the Prophet Allah so al Stram if you read the seal of the Prophet al Assad Salam you get a lot of power from Allah Azza WA JAL to control yourself and to compare your life to the life of the Prophet s term and the companions by going through the life stories of the of the self of the scholars of the righteous predecessors such type of biographies and life stories would strengthen your Eman and give you a boost to control yourself and evil thoughts and finally among the things that would help you control yourself is to look at the consequences it is fun to play around to neglect salat to go out with the boys and party all night long it is fun to indulge in sins and to live the life of celebrities without any fear of the day of judgment but it is not as much fun as you think when you think of what's awaiting you if you are in a race car in a sports car a fancy Porsche or a Lamborghini and you go from zero to 100 in 3.4 seconds and you do your quarter-mile in 11 seconds and you do like 300 kilometers in so much or so many or so little seconds it's fun the agilent is pumping in your veins it's beautiful feeling but when you think of the people you might kill or injure or the accidents you can do when you think of the fine you have to pay or the jail time you have to spend the lives you might destroy it would make this beautiful feeling fade away likewise if you see a nice sandwich and it is tasty smells good filled with lots of good things but you know that there's poison in it all these nice-looking nice smelling and nice tasting would become detestable for you and you would not like to touch it because you know the consequence of it and likewise when you give your soul and you unleash it you give it whatever it wants and desires if you think of the consequences of the punishment in the grave of the punishment and Hellfire and before that the exposure of your sins to the people and they know you the shame you feel after you're exposed such feelings gives you a lot of control with the grace of Allah upon yourself and Allah so gel knows best"
