  "title": "Experiencing Burnt Out when praying 12 Rawatib sunnah, how to motivate myself #allah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I've been regularly performing dual fora prayer for some time but I feel but I feel mentally and physically exhausted when praying or finding motivation to pray. I feel like I I'm exper I'm experiencing some kind of burnout. Are there any steps I can take to prevent burnout during prayers or any other form of worship in general? How many how many hours do you pray? Like uh 30 minutes plus a day. Uh yeah. Uh that's the sunnah, not the part. Okay. But 30 minutes a day, there's nothing to be burned out from. I don't understand your question. the total amount of time that we pray throughout the whole day divided on five um prayer times doesn't reach even one hour. So why would anybody be burnt out unless there is something wrong in what they're doing? Meaning that when they pray they repeat certain phrases and words because Shayan is messing up with their head and saying that oh no no you did not say and they repeat and repeat and then they go to In this they repeat the prayer over. This would burn you out. And if you have this then you have a problem that needs fixing through a counseling session."
