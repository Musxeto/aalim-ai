  "transcript": "in sram from australia says can you tell us how to perform sujudu tilawa when we're not praying very easy i am reading the quran i pass by an ayah and when i reach the mark of the star which means that the ayah is over and this is where i should make prostration i say allahu akbar without raising the hands and i go for sujud subhanallah subhanallah and then i raise my head and stand normally no takbir when rising up and no salam when ending up and if i did not mention this in the beginning and no standing in the beginning some people while they're sitting they pass by an ayah of chilawa they stand up and then they say allah they go for sujud no this is wrong as you were immediately you just say allahu akbar and make your sujud you can make that to other direction than the qibla so if the qibla is to my right i just say allah and make sujud not to the qibla because this is not a prayer where i must face the qibla do i have to be in the state of wudhu no i can be not in the state of vodo etc"
