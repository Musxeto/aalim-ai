  "title": "Saying 'Wallahi' & Swearing by Allah's Name - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is not taking a less name in vain so if there is something that you would like to reiterate you swear so you I swear to say the truth nothing but the truth so help me a lot no problem you can swear because when you are in a court the judge says to you swear so that I can tell that you're telling the truth when someone is not believing in what you say you say wallahi i said the truth so there's nothing wrong in swearing when there is a need for it what is not permissible is to swear on every tiny menu thing this is disrespectful to Allah so someone asks you did you do excuse me Oh as an avalanche iPad fell on my surface pro we had a problem at Hyundai la Houston we're safe so someone asked me did you do this or do that something trivial and it's a world law I didn't do it and I keep on swearing on every single thing that I do or don't do this is not permissible because this is taking Allah's name without any benefit without any real need for that Allah says in the Quran and protect your oaths but follow ie Manickam so we cannot use or say or swear like this without any justification"
