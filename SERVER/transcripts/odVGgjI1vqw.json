  "title": "How can we go to Hajj faster ( Hajj permit ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question is about how to ask the decisions to get pets faster so first first first of all this is something way above my pay grade of course because you know I am a little civil servant I'm not I'm not the government to my knowledge this is not something that the government has a role in it is according to the quota that the Saudi government gives to different countries according to the population of the Muslims in it and Saudi Arabia does not favor a country over the other so it gives more to Americans and less to Indonesians no they have numbers and they have a capacity because matka is is this small so if you allow 10 million to come they will not come out so they have to put a certain percentage to the people and mashallah here is 250 million compared to Malaysia 20 million so Dakota is is very less so one option for you is to go and migrate to another country you will get it faster but the good news is Allah is most forgiving most merciful Allah prescribed Hajj for those who can afford it and are physically able if you apply and you could not get your turn on time and you died will you go to hell no alhamdulillah so Allah is most forgiving most merciful you apply your name when it comes alhamdulillah if it doesn't come alhamdulillah you still can come for umrah"
