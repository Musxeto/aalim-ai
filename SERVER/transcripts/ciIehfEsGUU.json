  "transcript": "action our women encouraged to let go of their rights and inheritance of course not that's weird and strange and totally unislamic Allah azzawajal is the one who himself divided these wealths Over The Heirs of a deceased it was not done by the prophet Allah it was done by Allah he is the one who divided the who said you should take care of us again this is unislamic it's a misconception unfortunately among the Muslims that owe the brother is obliged to provide for his sister this is not true where did you get this from oh I heard the Sheikh saying that the brother is obliged to provide to her sister no this is not true a brother is obliged to provide for his sister if the conditions are fulfilled what are these conditions number one his sister is Stone broke she doesn't have any to uh any money of her own but if she inherited if she's working if she has savings I don't give her a penny second condition is that she doesn't have someone who blocks me from inheriting her such as a father so if she has a father then I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's poor because this is the responsibility of my father if she had a son it's a responsibility of her son thirdly in order for it to become an obligation upon me to provide for her is that I have extra than what I what my wife and my children need if I ha I can barely go even hand to mouth I don't have uh the necessary means to fulfill my own needs and requirements let alone someone else I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's stoned broke or uh I inherited her this is not mandatory because I can't this is all what I have and I have to feed my wife and children first if I have extra and the other two conditions are fulfilled then I may give myself I may give my sister therefore coming back to your question it is not recommended at all to give up what Allah has given you this is your god-given right okay Sheikh but if I do this my brother would boycott me and may not speak to me till the end of time so tough luck for him he's the one who's going to hell insha Allah for sivering the ties of kinship over something that is not his if your brother is a thief he's a crook for asking you to let go your god-given right who gives whatever about him let him go this is not something that people could twist your arm and force you to do something when Allah is the one who graced you with it and Allah Knows Best"
