  "title": "Giving money to professional beggars (Muslims or Non Muslims) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "india says so many times we go on the streets and we see beggars who pretend to be muslims and the same thing you can see those in europe and especially in england in london you see gypsies wearing the black abaya and covering their hair and and body and with abaya and they pretend to be muslims and they beg well the norm is that beggars are professionals whether they're muslims or not and the money that allah has given you is supposed to be put in the hands of those who are truly in need of it and deserve taking it so i would highly recommend that you neither give those beggars on the streets anything and every time like some people do every time they go out and they encounter beggars they take the money that they wanted to give to the beggars and put it in a box and then once it's collected after a couple of weeks they take the whole amount and they look for truly needy or poor muslims who do not beg who are concealed in their homes rarely you will find people knowing about them this is the best instead of giving those professionals"
