  "title": "Can we love ❤️ Kafirs (Disbelievers) but hate their Kufr (Disbelief) #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "My question is regarding Alwala Albbara. So we know that we must love Muslims for their faith and hate them for their sins. The same way can we love disbelievers who have got family or relatives or wives for their goodness and kindness while hating them for their disbelief? No problem in that at all. Otherwise, how would I marry a Christian wife that would be the mother of my children? I love her for worldly matters. I love her for her good looks and for her good cooking and taking care of me and my children, but I hate her kufur and disbelief. This is no problem in that. None whatsoever."
