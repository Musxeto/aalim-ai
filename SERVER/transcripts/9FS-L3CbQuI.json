  "transcript": "to ask so there is this um uh business which you can do it's like um you upload pictures of um pictures or text which the company then prints on shirts or mugs and then give and then if someone wants to like buy it you can like uh buy it so like I if I uh submit a design but I don't own the shirt or the mug but but it's like print on demand so whenever there's a demand for it um the company prints and sends it to the person so is this something like a selling which you do not own no this is not selling what you do not own because you own the design so if you yourself own a particular design and it is halal design whether it's text or a picture or a photograph of something that is halal and someone approaches you and says I need a t-shirt colored blue with this design of yours if you're the owner of the job meaning that you are fabricating it or making it for them there's no problem you say okay you have to pay me $20 and when they pay you $20 you contact the company you send them the design they make it for you and they ship it to you or to that buyer directly without any problem in that this is called you're making something you're producing something so this is not selling what you do not own because you are producing it and making it and Allah Knows Best"
