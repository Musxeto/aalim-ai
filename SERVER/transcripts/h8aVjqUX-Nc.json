  "transcript": "um if a woman mistakenly thought that she was supposed to wipe instead of insert a piece of toilet paper into her private parts before when she's determining her purity and she did so at the end of her period and then started praying and then she found out that she was supposed to insert instead of wipe and she also inserted when she was checking for her purity at the end of this same period but she doesn't remember anything on the toilet paper so is her host valid or like because she technically kind of she didn't know if she was pure if she saw the white thread-like discharge through wiping at the end of her menses this is sufficient the issue is if she did not see the white thread like through wiping and she did not insert a piece of cotton to ensure that she's totally dry from the inside this is what is debatable and i would highly suggest that she repeats her hustle but if she saw without inserting anything the white thread like discharge that would be sufficient inshallah"
