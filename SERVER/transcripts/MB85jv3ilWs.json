  "transcript": "he says that they have a trend saying that a person will not be accountable if he wears new clothes in ramadan and i don't see where this originates from because even if you wear new clothes other in ramadan you're not accountable has given us this these clothes so that we can wear them and thank him for his grace and favor upon us and that is why whenever we wear new clothes we praise allah azzawajal and the prophet used to even name clothes and give them names so this is one of allah's favors and blessings upon us so a person is not held accountable whether he wears new clothes in ramadan or other than ramadan maybe this is a fabrication of a wholesaler a person who has wholesales in clothes and he wanted people to buy clothes in ramadan for eid and so on so he fabricated this hadith and allah knows best"
