  "transcript": "jaggery in ordo gur is made in very big kadija that is a big pot and these pots are not covered and not washed sometimes dogs lick these pots and again jaggery is made in these unclean pots is this jaggery permitted to eat i heard dogs saliva is navak or najis so i think that the questioner is asking about a meal that is prepared in big pots and these pots are usually uncovered and never washed and dogs come and lick from these pots so is it najis is it impure the answer is yes the greatest impurity is the impurity of the dark saliva when it licks in a pot or a dish or a plate in utensils this is the grand impurity why because you have to wash it once with soil and seven times with water while normal impurities such as urine you simply wash it squeeze it and that's it and the minor impurity is the urine of a child less than two years of age who is breastfeeding and did not eat and it has to be male you don't have to wash the urine of such a male child you just simply pour water over it sprinkle it and that's it you don't have to squeeze it and and do that again so such a meal this made in or this jaggery is prohibited for you to eat because the pot and the food in it are all considered to be impure and you have to throw it out abdullah says"
