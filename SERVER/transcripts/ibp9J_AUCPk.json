  "title": "Would you shake hands or sit on same table with people who raped your mother, sister Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and now we see what's happening on the arena when you abandon tahit people would come up with allegations that we have to compromise we have to let go some of the old guard schools so we have to let go of some of our beliefs and convictions time changes and this is not true would you ever shake hands with someone who raped your sister or mother would you join forces would you sit with them on the same table with a big smile on your face hugging them kissing them taking selfies of course not you won't be a man you won't have a spine let alone be a muslim if you do such a thing nowadays people are doing worse we've seen muslims so called quote unquote given condolences to the israelis whenever an israeli or two are killed regardless if this is a terrorist attack or not regardless how you look at it when you give your condolences to the enemy who occupied your land who kicked your muslim fellow and raped your sisters and mothers and nobody dared to say a word nobody gave their condolences for what they had done the crimes they had done yet when one or two israelis are killed whether a person was defending himself or not we get so quote unquote muslims giving their condolences condemning such attacks and turning a blind eye to all the atrocities that are happening to their muslim brothers where is the hate there's nothing i still hate and if you ask these people most likely they would reject islam but they still keep a muslim name muhammad ahmed mahmood why they have no problem in shaking hands and kissing and embracing and maybe going to somewhere else with the enemy may allah protect us all so all of this shows us that the tahiti that the messengers were sent with is not being practiced and people are neglecting it as long as they neglect it there's no prosperity and no victory there will be no success for the ummah until they go back to the basics until they abide by the tawheed why tawhid has a lot of advantages first because allah ordained it second because all the messengers preached it thirdly because with tawheed allah sins and this is our main and primary objective on this earth to erase things to gain good deeds to end up in paradise allah says in the hadith o son of adam were you to come to me with sins nearly as great as the earth and were you then to face me ascribing no partner to me that is tahit i would bring you forgiveness nearly as great as it even if you kill if you steal if you lie as long as you come to allah with pure tau heed and pure hate would rectify all of these sins will make you repent will make you ask for forgiveness will fill your heart with remorse to hate is the first thing you're asked about in your grave imagine those sitting in the parliament of this so-called government and they're sitting with other relate religions and feeling cozy about it and having no problem with them having no issues with passing a law that allows selling alcohol or legislating prostitution in the in the land they have no problem in signing it the first thing they'll be asked on the day of judgment is the heat the three questions who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you do you think that they'll be able to answer no even if they have long beards and big turbans and they call themselves mawlana or mufti they will not because they did not live until heat hence they will not be dying on it or succeeding in answering the questions about it allah says in the quran allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word in worldly life and the hereafter and allah sends astray the wrong doers and allah does what he wills to stay firm in this word world which is in your life in your grave when you're asked this is only given to those who had lived until heed and if you manage to live until heat you will die on tahit and if you die until heat you will end up in paradise allah says indeed he who associates others with allah allah has forbidden him paradise and his refuge is the fire and there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers there is no possibility for other than people with tawheed to enter paradise there's no way those who associate others with allah those who ascribe a son or a wife or associates to allah will never be admitted to paradise the paradise is not mine it's allah's and these are allah's words worship him alone only believe that he's worthy of being worshipped then you will be able to enter jannah otherwise you have no hope this is why it is important to have to hate this is why you have to cleanse people's conviction and beliefs before moving forward to anywhere because this is what counts at the side of allah if you fail in promoting to hate calling people to hate making this your main objective then you're not on the right straight path you have to call for the heat even if you get looks of resentment even if you get critiques even if people ridicule you it's not what the people want it's not a show where people call and say i'd like to listen to this song or watch this clip and he said okay some out there giving dawah this is what they want it's a survey what do the people want okay you want to talk about the controversy of the quran you want to talk about authenticity of hadith you want to talk about the reliability of aqira we can do that subhanallah this is what they are looking for number of followers are they acknowledging me as a sheikh are they acknowledging me as a celebrity a professor an academic or not this is my main objective this is not what a muslim should look for this is not what the messengers and the prophets used to do they would only preach tawheed"
