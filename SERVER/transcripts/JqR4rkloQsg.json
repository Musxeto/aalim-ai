  "title": "Making Hijra to a Muslim country - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "- hell says what is the ruling on making Hazara to a Muslim country in the present scenario so hell I don't know what scenario you're talking about but generally speaking a Muslim living in a non-muslim country has a choice between staying and migrating to a Muslim country if you have such a luxury and you are able to choose definitely going to a Muslim country would be a plus and a better choice people would argue and say but share if we live in the West in a kafir country we have social security we have good roads we have discipline we have policies and procedures that are practiced and not simply put there for PR reasons we have justice and fairness and all are equal under the eye of law of the law we have better education better health care better freedom of expression and the ability to be treated as human beings which in so many Islamic countries Muslims lack we would argue against this by saying that even if all of this is true though I beg to differ even if it's all true this does not constitute a small percentage of the benefits of being a Muslim in the lands of Islam nothing beats being a Muslim walking on the streets and hearing the event and seeing people saying Salam aleykum you reply waalaikumsalam in in knowing that the meat I'm eating is halal I don't have to doubt it so all restaurants are halal for me to eat in feeling that those around me share the same a peda they worship one Lord whose Allah the Almighty they follow the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you feel the tranquility the peace where you live at the same time you rarely see someone dying out of hunger or someone that is homeless in Muslim countries because they come together and they give food to those who are needy unlike other countries you may find people starving to death because it doesn't say anything in our religion to help others in Islam it is built on helping others and sticking with the community so if you weigh the pros and cons nothing beats being in a Muslim country even if you are in the Scandinavian countries or in highly modern civilized countries as a Muslim this is not your place you do not fit and this is not racist by the way this is something that is related to our conviction and belief would I allow my child who's 10 12 14 years of age to go to public schools where they force them to have their physical education class mixed together swimming in a swimming pool wearing bathing clothes would I have my child go to such a school where they don't have halal and Haram we're free mixing is permissible where it is ok to have relationships kiss hugging dating sexual intercourse would I take my children to schools where they teach them that homosexuality is a normal thing to have a relationship between a man and a man a girl a woman and a woman is totally legit to be heterosexual to teach them how to use condoms and how to refrain from STDs etc would you be laughs at an early age I expose my child with my own hands touches to such filth and expect my child to grow up to be a practicing Muslim this is unbelievable so living in such kafir countries has its merits no argument in that but at the same time it comes with a very high cost a very high price which real Muslims would not be willing to pay they would not jeopardize their children's Islam and safety just for a passport well while they can stay in their Muslim countries yes maybe a bit poor I'm not that highly educated the infrastructure is awful so much corruption in the government so much insecurity in the terms of justice etc but still you are a Muslim living among the Muslims in the West you try to discipline your child he there's something wrong it is part of our religion to instruct our children to pray when they're seven and to spank them when they're 10 if they refused to pray to beat them lightly that is if you do this they'll take your child and give it to social welfare or whatever and and and they'll give it to a Christian family what for you know what's best for my child more than me this is hypocrisy and then when the child does something heinous or when the child grows up to be a teenager and starts shooting people in a mall and and they say well this is due to videogames know this is due to your rotten way of upbringing your children there is no discipline there is no respect there is no order in how you up bring your children or what you care about is feeding them clothing them and letting them follow their desires but this does not make a healthy society nor a healthy person therefore again nothing beats moving to a Muslim country despite all what they say and look at some major and great and superpower countries people could easily die on the streets because they don't have Medicare they don't have medical insurance why because they can't afford it so where is the justice where is fairness you cannot have you don't have money you don't have insurance you die or spend the rest of your life pain in Muslim countries alhamdulillah there are government facilities hospitals and you can be treated for free so don't believe everything you hear but at the same time nothing beats living among the Muslims for the Muslims themselves and a large surgeon knows best"
