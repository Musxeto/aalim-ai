  "title": "Our attitude towards Yazeed Ibn Muawiya - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the u.s says what is our stance towards yazid is from the tabi'in he is not a companion and it would be unfair to go and indulge in stories and narrations that we were not witness to and it is totally unacceptable to take sides by saying no no we are with yazid and not with hussain al-hussein may allah be pleased with him definitely ibn ali is one of the masters of the youth of paradise he's the grandson of the prophet he is the son of fatima the daughter of the prophet ali his virtues and attributes are well known to all however through history we believe that yazid only instructed the army to prevent al-hussein may allah be pleased with him from entering iraq and the culprits and the evil elements in the army missing pert interpreted that and went further to attack and execute and kill al-hussein so it was not the doing of yazid and yazid was reported to have cried and honored the family and the companions that were with al-hussein and he escorted them back to medina where and he did so many things trying to prove and show that he had no ill intent to this great companion nevertheless we don't go to the limit of praising yazid as we don't go to the extent of saying that he's a kafir and that's like the shia say no he's a normal person had his prose and had his khans had lots of good things in him as a khalifa and also had lots of bad things as a sinful muslim and he is to allah to judge so it would be immature and illogical for us to indulge in judging a person we had never met and through stories that are not authentic and not well established and allano's best"
