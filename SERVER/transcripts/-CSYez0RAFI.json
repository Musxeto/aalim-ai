  "title": "Is a woman required to wear hijab when watching Islamic lectures on TV? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "shaukat says a woman in her living room watching islamic lectures so if a woman is watching Zaid TV or hooded TV at the moment and she's watching my program is she obliged to be wearing the hijab I guarantee you I cannot see anything so it's a one-way communication why would she wear hijab one says or it's part of modesty this is not logical what modesty are you talking about see the problem is this concept is found in many Muslim countries that are not following the Quran and the Sunnah they're following their peers they're following their scholars their Maulana their culture and I get hundreds of questions on regular basis of women telling us that we cannot that they're asking they said share in our culture we cannot heat the event without wearing the hijab so I ask what does this have to do with that so whenever that is called it's compulsory to cover our hair even if we're alone in the home when we go to the bathroom to perform Woodill we cannot go with our hair uncovered we have to wear the hijab when eating they do the same this is all baseless and innovation in thinking that you're getting closer to Allah by doing this is sinful therefore show cut by if a woman is not in the company of Nan Muharram in the room no one is watching her no one is looking at her except other females or Muharram relatives of hers there is no need for her to wear the hijab once she is watching a lecture or anything permissible on TV"
