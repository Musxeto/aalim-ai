  "title": "Mourning period - Iddah of a widow who is Pregnant - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "asks a question he says that we know that morning a deceased is limited to three days and nights only this is what the prophet sallallaahu seldom ordered us to do so and this was displayed by um habiba may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers when her father Abu Sufian diamond-hard died she mourned him for three days and on the end of the mourning period she ordered her servant to bring her some perfume and she put some perfume on her hair and head and she told those around her that I have no need in perfume performing a perfuming I have no need in perfuming myself and adorning myself had I not heard the Prophet Allah so salam say that it is not permissible for a woman or for a person to mourn any other person for more than three days except a woman mourning her husband now when a man dies it's a different story however it is not as brother Shamim mentioned that the mourning of a widow is always four months and ten days this is when she's not pregnant when she is pregnant it's a different story because the mourning period ends when she delivers her child so if she is one month pregnant her mourning period extends another eight months but if she is eight and a half or nine months pregnant the man dies a 10 a.m. and she delivers at 10:15 a.m. meaning 15 minutes later after his death she can remarry at hypothetically 9:30 or immediately after birth because now she is out of her mourning period therefore this is not something that is logical but rather this is something that Allah has tested us with to worship Him through it like when the cat that the Qibla of the Muslims while they were in Mecca was to Jerusalem to beit hamikdash when they went to Medina they were instructed to change the direction from the north to the south 180 degrees and allah azzawajal told us that this is merely a test so that it would be a parent who are those that believe and comply and who those who do not believe and comply are who reject the instruction of Allah therefore this is something from Allah so again we have to obey and say Samina what Aparna and Allah says Allah knows best"
