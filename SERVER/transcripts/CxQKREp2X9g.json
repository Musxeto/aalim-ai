  "transcript": "um first of all i would like to thank udativi and uh may allah bless you all with the highest place in paradise and um secondly i would like to know what is the difference between hidayah and toffee these two terms are they the same or is there a difference okay okay the terminology itself they're similar and close hidaya in arabic means guidance and tawfiq in arabic means that allah would help you do something allah would make you successful in doing something so they are similar but they're separate guidance is from allah and guidance as we know is divided into two types guidance that only allah has which is to make people worship him and to make people do good things but there are or there is a different type of guidance and that is that is given to us as individuals such as the guidance given to the prophet says that you guide to a straight path now the guidance of the prophet is showing you that so the prophet merely guides you to the direction if you take it this is guidance from allah and that is why when it came to his uncle abu talib who died as a non-muslim the prophet was sad about this so allah told him in the quran do not guide those whom you love meaning that you showed them the way but you cannot do more than that and the guidance is at the hands of allah the almighty"
