  "transcript": "marish says for those traveling by plane from America to Pakistan it will be night most of the flight on the way back it will be day throughout the whole flight the flight will be about 14 hours and I'll ask the crew to wake me up for fetcher however does this mean for about 14 hours I don't pray anything well to my knowledge may wish when you are flying eastwards eastbound you are chasing the Sun and you're racing with the Sun so you will see time flying like crazy so if you depart before sunrise before fetcher by mid the mid of your journey or by the the two-thirds of your journey Sun would set the whole day would elapse while you are on the plane if you're going eastbound which means that you have to follow the position of the Sun to know when to pray your fetcher meaning that you look from the window the moment you see that the dawn has broken the break of dawn then you have to prefetcher before the Sun rises and just before the Sun sets you can pray the hora Nasir combine two raka raka and once the Sun sets you can pray mother of three rockets and Asia two Rakas and then whatever you land there is no problem if you go in the opposite direction and there is westbound this means that you are going against the Sun which means that the time seems to be standstill for example I travel from kuala lumpur to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia my flight usually takes off at 12:00 noon which is the lower time and I reach Jeddah approximately if I'm not mistaken by 2 or 3 o'clock so this means that as if my flight took 8 hours yet the time elapsing was maybe 2 or 3 hours due to the time of difference between the regions which is 5 hours etc so when you're travelling westbound the Sun seems to be stationary not moving because you are travelling in the direction of the Sun and hence you may not pray except the hora Nasser when you arrive and you may not even pray that so there's no problem it what counts when you're travelling by an airplane is the position of the Sun to you in that plane so the minute you see from the window that the Sun has set this is time for mother for you and the minute you see that the break of dawn is clear between the white thread and the under the black thread the time of Roger for you has begun and the time in between can be estimated as well"
