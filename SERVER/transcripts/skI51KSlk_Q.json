  "transcript": "earth man says his in his question if all is predestined why do anything very short question that requires a lecture predestiny is one of the six pillars of a man of faith that no Muslim can be a Muslim without believing in them so the last sixth pillar of it all is to believe in predestiny to believe in what Allah had ordained whether it is good or other than that now people are usually confused so they ask is everything written down of our future yes my spouse yes my children my provision whatever is gonna happen to me until I die that is yes the Prophet told the sorry salat WA Salam when Allah the Almighty created the pen he ordered the pen to write and the pen asked what should I write Oh Lord and Allah said write the destiny of all of my creation till the day of judgment the Prophet tells us are in sosam this was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so this was before creating the universe as we know it fifty thousand years before everything is done and over with so now the confusion lies if Allah has predestined everything is going to happen in my life so why do anything so do you mean to tell me if I hold the pen and I decide to let it go it's written in my book it's written in the preserve the tablet in the low hell my food said yes so if I drop it it's written I said yes if I decide not to drop it it's also written so whether you do or not do everything is written so I've dropped it it's written fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation it was written that on the specific day at that specific moment I will drop the pen so earth man is asking then why should we do what we do well usually people think of the consequence of the result and they say okay I'm sick is it written that I will be cured I said yes if not is it written that I'm going to die I said yes then they asked then why take the medication why have the doctor operate on me why don't I just leave it okay you are confusing the result and you're confusing the means that would lead to this result meaning is it written that I will die of starvation maybe I don't know but let's assume it is written though we don't know if I do not prepare food if I do not eat if I go on a hunger strike this is also written so whatever you do in regards to the means this is written and the result and the consequence is also written so why only focus on the end result why do you always complain I'm unable to find a job Allah predestined upon me that I do not get a job how do you know what Allah predestined that for you said I'm not getting any job said yes because you're not working hard you have to knock on old doors until Allah wills it then opens the door for you then you will find the job you want likewise someone sitting home and says if we'll sit I'll get at a righteous pious child said yes but you have to get mad at first I said nope if Allah willed it it will happen this is not how it works this is not how Allah told us to do he told us to act and then a larger wills what happens likewise Indra my child is sick make dua for your child said why should I make door why should I make rope here if Allah predestined it he will be cured said yes but your dua is part of the process of getting your child cured and Allah ordered you to make drawn and if you refuse to make dua Allah s anger is angry with you Allah will be angered with you and this shows the arrogance in you and refusing to humiliate yourself in front of Allah so that in certain show your need and poverty for him besides allah azzawajal is the owner the sovereign owner of everything in this world he demands that we show our submissiveness and our poverty to him through asking him because we do not know what lies in the future for us so we have to do our due diligence we have to exert all efforts possible to reach where we want to reach and if it happens at hamdulillah happened with the grace of Allah if it didn't alhamdulillah Allah willed something else and that something is better for us analyze well knows best up"
