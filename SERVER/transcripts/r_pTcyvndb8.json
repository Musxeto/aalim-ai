  "title": "I stand up for National Anthem & Flag at school, is it shirk? Do istighfar? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah how can I help you alhamdulillah sh in my school in the morning time uh they play the national anthem but when they tell us to stand up for it which is sh I know I just I just don't pay attention to it and do my so am I still involved in it and is it syon me first of all standing up for the national anthem is not shik nobody stands up to worship the national anthem or the flag so this is not shik it is imitating the disbelievers because we don't have such things in Islam where when the national anthem starts everybody stands up and some people put their hands on the uh right or maybe wakanda forever what is this we don't have these things Islam is an identity Islam is a way of life and the prophet clearly told us whoever imitates a people he's part of them this is why we don't stand when they play the national anthem even if they say oh you're disrespecting the flag what is the flag the flag is a piece of cloth we wash cars with it we do things with it what it's a cloth the appreciation of the country of the values that it carries is in the heart not in standing up or doing these things when a a catastrophe or um War happens or someone dies or when an earthquake they have it half mass or whatever they call it this is ridiculous this is imitating the disbelievers we don't have this nonsense but it's not shik so if you were forced to stand up stand up but what's the problem you're forced you need the marks stand up and say Subhan Allah and there's no no shik on you inshallah"
