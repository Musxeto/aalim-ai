  "transcript": "used to buy his mother gold and he gives her as a gift and she kept on telling him that when I die all of this gold must be returned to you my gift is for you and for your children Etc so when she died his sister took the gold and gave it to him is this permissible or not the answer is no this is not permissible unless all of those who inherit your mother would approve of that because the prophet said there is no will acceptable to someone who is inheriting so if I before dying say I give my wife onethird of my inheritance this is my will the minute I die this is cancelled if I say I give my son I give my daughter I give my father I give my mother these people will inherit by the law of Islam so giving them giving them something extra as a will this is totally prohibited and it's canceled so for your mother the gold she appointed and she told her daughter to give it to you this is considered to be a will she didn't give it to you while she was alive and you received it it's not a gift it's a will so after her death we will see who will inherit your mother it's your siblings she doesn't have a father and a and a mother definitely then only you guys will inherit so if all of your siblings said we're okay with that and we are accepting it and we allow you to have the gold as our mother wished and wanted this is totally permissible but if one of them said nope then in this case yes you are not allowed or not entitled to have this"
