  "transcript": "uh our final uh questioner mahdi from bangladesh [Music] aura it echoes sometimes like like like this and in case of iron uh sometimes when it is uh it is with uh sakin uh i i sometimes i i do like this and in case of swadh uh especially in tashahood i pronounce this uh pronunciation so i uh i i learned i lent in it for some time so is my pronunciation okay no it's it's not okay per se in the sense that it's not perfect but it does not invalidate your your salat so you should try to perfect it and likewise you and this you can repeat it outside of salat a thousand times a day until you get it perfected in your throat and al-saliheen you don't say al-saliheen this is too much but it does not invalidate your prayer why because anyone who listens to you knows what you wanted to say in sha allah and it does not change the meaning and allah azza knows best"
