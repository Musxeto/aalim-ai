  "transcript": "um there is an eating disorder called a pica and it's eating non-food things such as clay mud and chalk and stuff and there are YouTubers that make ASMR really use uh eating chalking stuff so whenever I watch such videos I want I have a feeling to eat clay and chalk and I don't I don't know exactly whether I have that disorder but would it be permissible to eat such thing in Islam first of all first of all we have to understand that anything that is halal and that is not harmful is beneficial and and is permissible for us to eat so if someone eats seeds flower seeds this has no value most likely but it spends time and it tastes good there's no problem in eating it but if you eat mud but if you eat chalk or if you and have known relatives of mine who used to dip chalk sticks into ink and then they chew it and eat it with all their teeth in blue and it was so funny it was hilarious I don't know whether this is dangerous medically or not most likely it is it would harm your kidneys it would have negative effect among other things but I'm not a doctor you have to go to doctors if the doctors say no this is not good definitely then it's totally prohibited if they say it's safe then it is permissible not logical a bit weird but as long as it is safe there's no problem in that the what's more important is for you are Aisha to realize the impact which is very negative upon these YouTubers of these YouTubers and influencers on you now who in his right mind would spend a few minutes let alone hours watching such irresponsible people and picking up their bad habits and you never know tomorrow you may wear a cross because lots of them wear crosses or maybe have a crush on having a tattoo on your arm and this is not at all permissible for Muslims to waste their time watching such people who are not related to Islam and most likely they're disbelievers even if they're Muslims they are worthless they have no value to Islam or to the Muslims we have to value our life our time much more than we what what we're doing at the moment in llano's best use"
