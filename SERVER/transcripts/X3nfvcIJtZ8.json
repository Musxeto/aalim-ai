  "transcript": "last time I asked you about hunting rabbits without their appropriate licenses I want to ask if selling the fur and profiting from it would be considered as Halal earning what are you selling the fur of the rabbits the what it be the fur do you hunt these uh rabbits yes without license it's illegal yes I asked you last time if I could uh H but uh now I want to ask you now I want to sell the far no most likely this is Haram because you are in a country that you applied for a Visa correct I was born here I didn't sign okay you are born there and you are obliged to abide by the laws of the country you live in yes you may not be committing a sin but if you weigh the pros and cons break the law in something that is halal for your religion which is hunting and selling the fur after hunting it this is halal in our religion but if it goes against the law of the country and the consequence of such an action would be that you will be called and labeled in the news outlets as a terrorist as an extremist as breaking the law as Islam phobes would use this to highlight the fact that the Muslims don't abide by the law don't do this don't do that no this becomes Haram regardless whether the act itself was Halal in our religion or not and Allah Knows Best"
