  "transcript": "I am a revert Muslim I really wanted to learn more about Islam I'm trying uh my very best to be a good muslima I don't know where to start and to whom I will ask I wanted to go to Medina for omra but I don't know the requirements first of all um it is is not part of omra to visit Medina omra is limited to offering ta and and then shortening your hair and this is your full and complete of course after having the intention and wearing the from the mik ETC now for a you as a new muslima it varies Where You Are and what people are surrounding you if there is an Islamic Center or not so I would advise you first of all that you look for an appropriate Islamic center next to you that is following the Quran and the Sunnah on the uh methodology and uh on the ideology of the Sala and there are so many worldwide so I don't think inshallah you'll have any problem um finding such a place and the second stage would be to download yourself lectures of trustworthy uh Scholars and Di who you know that people say about them that they are on the right path and following the Quran and Sunnah and um their allegiance is only to the Quran and Sunnah third of all I advise you to look for practicing sisters because the prophet told usat wasam that the wolf attacks only a stray sheep from the Sheep of uh from a herd of sheep meaning that the wolf usually does not attack the whole herd he Waits until there is someone out of the herd and then he attacks them and this is exactly what Shan does when you are with a group with a group of sisters they're practicing you pray with them they check on you every now and then they ask you about Salat and you ask them about ramadan's fasting and you encourage one another usually Shan is far away from such people because they are united but once a Muslim or a muslima are on their own then this is when the Shan attacks and finally you should preserve your forms of worship and protect them meaning that you have to observe praying F on time on time all the other prayers on time you should also devote some of your time every single day for reciting the Quran contemplating and pondering on its meaning reading the translation learning your Dean you have to assign time to do this throughout the day and by that inshallah you will progress slowly it does not come in a day or in a month or in a year it may take you at least six or seven months of dedication where until you reach the level inshallah of uh uh comfort and relaxation that you've learned your religion in an appropriate way and Allah Knows Best"
