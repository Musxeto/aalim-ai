  "title": "Can we pray behind an imam whose aqeedah is not clear to us? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what's the ruling on praying in a masjid where the imams apida is not clear it's ambiguous salheim this is a very a tricky question because it is part of the people of innovation to judge other people's akida so the takfir and al-hijrah which appeared in egypt like 35 or 40 years ago maybe more they used to label anyone who's not part of their cult to be kafir and they would immediately label people classify them have no problem in killing them taking their wealth just because they don't believe belong to their jamaa then appeared a lesser in extremism a group lesser in extremism and they used to be called a tawakov with meaning that they don't label others to be kafir but they don't label them to be muslim as well until they determine through questionnaires through investigation whether they're muslims like them or not and this is also part of the hawari because the default is whoever prays our prayer and faces our qibla and he's from our slaughtering sacrifice or animals than he is from among us to go and refuse to pray in a particular message why i don't know if the imam is an ashari or a murtazilli or a sufi or a hawari or this or that okay what do you want to do so i have a crash test i have a quiz a multiple choice quiz he has to answer these questions before i can pray behind him this is ridiculous this is what do to me any person who claims to be a muslim until proven otherwise i can pray behind him yes but they're involved in some buddha like mulit like congregational dua after prayer all of these are innovations true but they do not nullify their islam i refrain from praying behind someone who nullifies his islam through a conviction or a belief but such little innovations are major sense and they have to refrain i can advise them it does not impact the validity of my prayer and allah knows best you"
