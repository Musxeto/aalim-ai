  "title": "Imam immediately sat down (made error trying to rectify his mistake), prayer valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is um uh we were praying in the Masjid ones uh also repair and Imam made a mistake and he missed his first attitude and he just stood up for the third raka and he was a straight standing and I was just I was saying subhanallah from the behind and I saw him immediately sitting down and continued his prayer and he just gave two uh frustration of forgetfulness before Salam so my question is in this case is the prayer of Imam or hour is valid because like he was standing straight but he just stayed back actually most likely the Imam was ignorant of the ruling and ignorance does not invalidate the prayer on the contrary it's a legitimate excuse to tolerate so many of the mistakes that happen people may talk in their prayer as in the Hadith when a man sneezed during the congregation and His companion said to him Allah and the companions were all outraged by this so they started looking at him during the prayer so the guy said why why are you looking at me like this during the congregation so they started padding and clapping on their thighs when the prayer was over the prophet called The Man and told him that it is not befitting of the of the prayer for you to speak and the prophet did not say to him go and repeat your prayer why because he did it out of ignorance now if I during the prayer was doing my praying and said oh more than um turn down the AC it's too cold the disadvantages my prayer on the spot I'm not ignorant I know the ruling so your Imam most likely was confused maybe he knew the ruling but he did not think of it so he out of uh his reflex made him sit immediately when you said subhanallah or he was absent-minded whatever therefore the prayer is valid inshallah unless he says yes I knew the ruling but I thought that I have to sit for your sake for example then his prayer would be invalid your prayers would be valid because you did not know of his intention and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
