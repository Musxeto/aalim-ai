  "title": "Creating a Product or Designing a Software that can be used for both halal & haram - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "can i work on a software project where i develop a product and that product can be used for halal means and also haram means that is ribba will the money i receive for selling this product be halal this is a bit generic but if we give examples and this is what i always tell the brothers ancestors kindly give examples and me be more specific when you ask a question so if a person is developing a program let's assume it is word for a writing documents this can be used in halal and it can also be used for haram contracts and transactions i don't know who is going to use this so working on such a project is totally halal now this is different if i were to design something for a particular company and this company is ripa based or a financial institution or a bank conventional bank in this case i'm collaborating with them on haram but if i design a normal software that can be used by a school by a factory by a company and by a bank there's nothing wrong in doing this because i am not responsible for those who buy it from me or what they got to do with it because it's not designed to serve them it's rather a general product and allah azza knows best"
