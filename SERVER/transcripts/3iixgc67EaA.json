  "transcript": "a lot of the Muslims think every now and then when we say he converse with Allah communicates with Allah and they say why should we well first of all because allah azzawajal instructed you to do this where he says but your own e s toshiba lacombe call on me and i'll answer you so it is an instruction of allah and our biggest problem is a rock no Afghanistan no Palestine know what is our biggest problem anyone any suggestions just to wake you up so that I can wake up myself no communication of with Allah close no cigars it is ignorance of Allah we do not know allah azzawajal why were we created to worship Allah soprano to Anna are we doing this full time inshallah inshallah a lot of the Muslims think that worshipping allah azzawajal is only prayer but I pray only five times a day if I'm a good Muslim if I'm a good practicing Muslim some would think that worshipping Allah is only giving sadaqa giving charity fasting Ramadan while the perspective of worship and Allah is far greater than this playing football can be worshipping Allah that's nice I'd like to worship all all the time if you have a good intention why are you playing so that I would break my friends leg know so that I would win when I bet with him over a can of Pepsi no so what is the purpose because I'd like to be fit strong so that i can use and utilize my health in worshipping allah i can pray for hours without end I can fast without feeling hungry I can be ready to serve my religion whenever that is required so if we know allah azzawajal we would have this channel open between us and him subhanahu wa'ta'ala and the greatest form of conversing with you with your Lord is how what is the greatest way to converse with Allah so much as a lot of the Muslims call it namaz and I don't know where this word is but it is salat it's either salotto prayer see their English or Arabic so salat and what is the importance of salat first of all it is the second pillar of Islam and we have how many pillars of Islam five okay okay that's good I was in the message in Saudi Arabia and I was giving my lecture and it's an old habit of mine as an old teacher whenever I try to say a number i give the wrong number with my fingers so I was saying and as Muslims we have pillars of Islam they are and elder people would white beard sing for and everybody was looking at them even those who knew it was five were doubting five and they started counting subhanAllah so that's good we have this we have someone who's awake so it's the second pillar of Islam prayer is so great and important that everything in Islam was mandated was revealed to the Prophet I racism on earth except Allah it was revealed to the Prophet re so Sarah on the 7th heaven it was not on earth it was given to the prophet alayhi salatu salam on the 7th heaven and everything was given to the Prophet Alice awesome through gibril peace be upon him the Ark Angel except Salah it was given directly to the Prophet Elisha salam from our Lord Allah as a virgin so these are the things that you may ask your friends about the specialities of salat and with the grace of Allah at the very beginning Allah mandated how many prayers five no see got you there alonzo German dated 50 prayers and when he came down he met Prophet Musa and he told him what happened he said Allah gave me 50 prayers said go back to Allah 50 your people will not be able to pray those it was reduced five by five but imagine if Musa peace be upon him was not there and Alonzo gel kept these prayers as 50 players a day in a 24 hours day that means that every half an hour you have to go to the masjid and perform prayer would life been easy no allah azzawajal with his grace and generosity made it five with the reward of 50 and even these five they're too much for us a lot of the Muslims say come on yahoo give us twenty percent discount fechar is too early i can't do that others say 20 you're crazy make it 40 answer is also it's the time where I sleep another say no Alicia is too late so most of the Muslims only pray for her and maybe maghrib and the rest and hamdulillah it's a wholesale and this is a big problem and one of the great characteristics of this great form of worship Isola is that whoever vanden it cannot say proudly that he is a Muslim if you don't pay the car you're still a Muslim if you don't fast Ramadan you are a very bad Muslim but you're still a Muslim if you don't perform Hajj you're a Muslim but you have committed a great sin yet you're still Muslim you'll go to hell a year a thousand five thousand years and then eventually Allah when he wants to have mercy on you it will take you out and put you in paradise because you're a Muslim but if you do not pray at all the five mandatory prayers if you do not pray at all you are a Kaffir even if you say from today until the day of judgment Allah muhammadun Rasulullah some of my heart a reseller even if you pay a charity if the only thing in Islam if you do not do it you will be considered a kafir is so not the prophet sallallahu wasallam said in sahih muslim the separation the partition between us and them is so large and innocent and in the same book and I'm a Muslim the Prophet says what translates exactly to the pledge between the US and them and in a narration Boehner gradually was shaky I will go for between man and this belief or associating others with Allah is abandoning salon so this is the thing that separates a person from this belief and that is prayer and that is why allah azzawajal said in the Quran in surat al mood death fear when the people of paradise go to paradise and they overlook the people in hell they asked them what made you enter hell the first thing they would say is Paulo lambda communal mousseline we were not among those who used to pray the first reason for entering hell is not praying so Panama so don't think that there are things that are considered to be more important than prayer prayer is the most important thing the length of your beard does not affect the acceptance of your prayer so if you have a very long beard ma sha Allah this is good mashallah that doesn't make you a good Muslim because if you don't pray on time you are the worst of Muslims even if you have a big beard Fidel Castro has a big beard but he's not a good Muslim so it is part of Islam it is part of religion to grow a beard because it these things it makes a difference between us and others and this is why the Prophet told us as salaam that honor your beard grow your beard let go of your beads it's a sign but it is not everything also the Prophet said that a stellato Sam the hadith in sahih bukhari whoever prays our prayer and faces our fibula and eats our slaughtering this is the Muslim that he has the pledge of Allah and the pledge of the prophet alayhi salatu salam praying our prayer facing our crib Allah eating our slaughtering he is a Muslim you don't have to go into what sect he's following you don't want have to go to his intention you don't have to go to his who are the mess the people that he prays with and what message does he go to does he have a label no he prays he's a Muslim colors if we deal with the brothers and sisters with this attitude we would have no problem but we have problems of labeling people thinking that this guy is in Jenna and the rest are all in heaven and hell and if you're not following what I'm following you definitely your inhale and this is wrong and this is serious stuff the Prophet tells us alehiwassallaam in the authentic hadith illustrating the importance of prayer on the day of judgment the last people to exit hell are those whom allah azzawajal wills it and he addresses the angels and he tells them get from hell anyone who says la illaha illallah and who does not associate others with Allah so they go into hell and they tried and who did not do any good things no good deeds at all but they believe in allah azzawajal and they don't have to associate any others with Allah so they'll go and search in hell and they allocate these people the Prophet tells us are a solid wassalam and they recognize them by the traces of prostration how many limbs and parts of our body do we offer our prostration on for okay not stronger answer it's 72 a feat to knees to arms and the forehead and the nose so these are seven limbs the Prophet says awesome I've been instructed to prostrate on seven parts of my body so the hadith says that the hell fire consumes and burns everything in a human being except the places of sujood the places of prostration so these are the last to exit hell which means that they definitely were among the worshipers if they did not pray the Angels would not have recognized them and they would have stayed there for eternity may Allah help us all now prayer is very important allah azzawajal mention this in the quran in so many different places but just to highlight the importance of frustration in Islam Allah says in surat al hajj didn't you c or c you not to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on earth who's this Oh pitches to whom Allah surgeon now listen carefully and imagine your position on this earth a lot of us feel arrogant strong fit vicious rich powerful influential deviant devious satanic we have so much in us we're so strong we can do things we can change the whole world you are nothing with all due respect we are nothing if you imagine yourself and take a picture of yourself photograph digital Sahara it's ok now if you go a little bit higher in a helicopter you'll find yourself in the middle of Birmingham if you go a little bit higher in a balloon then you'll be a sir and probably you would have virgin airlines but let's assume you go up you will see UK where are you standing very negligible very small and go up you see the whole of Europe and if you go up you see masha'Allah earth and if you go up a little bit more you suffocate and die but hypothetically assuming you will see the solar system and if you go up you see the Milky Way and if you go up you see the millions of different galaxies and you're already dead if you were there but imagine where am I among all of this I'm nowhere Subhan Allah so Allah is telling us now wake up this is a wake-up call to allah azzawajal prostrates whoever is in the heavens and who's ever in or on earth also the Sun prostrate to Allah the moon the Stars and the mountains and the trees and everything that walks the earth that the web any living creature Beast etc whatever and then Allah says and many of mankind and may allah make me in you among those who prostrate to Allah am I saying that we the believers the Muslims we join hands with the rest of Allah's creation we prostrate to Allah even the snakes prostrate to Allah even the beasts prostrate Allah even the fish in the oceans prostrate to Allah soldier we when we pray we are in unity with this universe worshiping the only Allah Almighty azzawajal but then Allah says in the Quran but there are many men on whom the punishment is justified meaning that they do not prostrate to Allah social and whomsoever Allah this gray says none can honor him whom so ever Allah disgraces which means that if you're not with Allah Allah will disgrace you and no one can honor you no wealth no health no power no position because it's all in unless hands but sometimes I go with my friend here because he's mashallah well built and he can give me protection can he give me protection only unlock and can provide this for me if can he give me honor if Allah displaces me so many people were disgraced by sin you look at them you can see the sin in their faces they're so far from Allah they don't pray to Allah they didn't Reba they did in her arm everything is in lie and their lives is not satisfying a larger and they're never happy they they are among those whom Allah has grace and you will find no one to honor them now a lot of those whom allah azzawajal disgraced are those who do not pray so if you see someone who does not pray at all at own and he tells you I don't pray I don't believe that prayer is is important give me the logistic the logic behind bowing and prostrating in the direction of Arabia I don't believe in that yet he claims he's a Muslim he's not a Muslim he's a kafir a lot of those whom Allah has disgraced like this person don't know why they are living and due to their ignorance don't know that they will end up in hell so many Muslims when we come to them and say okay let's go and pray why don't we go and pray over her why don't we pray answer they feel agitated by what you're saying as if you are insulting them why is this is this from a lava from Japan if I tell you okey I have a hundred pounds that I took from you a year ago and you forgot about it here it is how would he feel agitated no I can't take a hundred pounds that I lent you a year ago or he would feel happy can you feel extremely happy if he is someone who smokes and I say he have a fact he would be happy if I tell him these are the tickets for Manchester United and whatever he would be happy but if I tell him okey let's go to pirate to paradise let's go to pray a stuff together he'd be angry with me the majority of Muslims don't like people reminding them about sawa why because they have been overwhelmed they have been controlled by our fierce enemy tripping out regime he's playing with them like kids play with football always cricket he's doing this so do you know that no matter what good d you do if you do not pray well Allah will not accept this from you the Prophet says our institutional the first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the day of judgment will be what his prayer okay what would happen the prophecies are it's a lot o sanam if he if it is sound that is a prayer if its sound he will be successful and if it is lacking in any way he will be doomed so if you come on the Day of Resurrection the day of judgment with fasting with charity with Hajj with being kind to people with being honest masha'Allah very good thing for you but you did not pray all of this would be in vain but if you came with bad things here and there yet your prayer was sound was on time and in the messaging every single day five days five times a day seven days a week on time mashallah but you had bad things in you eventually it will be corrected by prayer with the grace of Allah yet Allah would forgive a lot of things because you have observed and preserved the prayer on time as he instructed so when you go to prayer when you want to convince converse with allah azzawajal be sure that it has great weight in Islam prayer is the most important thing in Islam prayer in congregation is one of the most important things in Islam to the extent that if you recite the Quran you'll find that even at times of battle allah azzawajal instructs the Prophet isaam and his companions to pray in congregation even at times of shooting and bombing and gunfire and peep casualties people are dying Allah does not tell you pray on your own he gives us the format of what is known as the prayer of fear where the army is split into two one prays with the Imam and the other is watching and shooting and when they finish one raka they retreat and those who did not pray pray with the Prophet at a solid sanam one raka as well and then both of them conclude their prayers on their own even at times of war yes this is what mentioned in the Quran now to talk about prayer there are so many ways of doing this but unfortunately the time is limited we have like what two hours approximately how much them season till nine no that's so much around by that okay there are so many things you can talk about prayer the description of prayer the supplications of Prayer how the prophet has a salam did it and so on but let us talk about one angle in prayer now the Prophet Alice salatu salam said that I my satisfaction has been given to me or I find my satisfaction in prayer now this sounds this hadith is sound and an authentic do we have the same feelings meaning that when I stand in prayer do all my worries go and all my fears fade away and all my wishful thinking and hoping in a large though L magnifies or not usually that is not why because the heart is not empty if you have if you have a cup of tea full of Chi can you put something else to that can you just cream no you can't milk no you can it's completely full there is not a single drop that you can put in there so in order to put something else you have to empty it and in order to find the taste of salat you have to empty your heart for the sake of allah azzawajal and I'll give you an example what is the first word we say when we pray this is quite true Allahu Akbar beautiful word right how many how many times do we say it in the day you'd like to calculate how many times does the move in say it in the day I'll make it easier count get your calculators and start counting do I get a figure 15 or 15 30 this is only in a van what about the comma another 20 so it's this is true then well then says Allah ho Akbar in the day and night 50 times and we never pay attention to that Allah Allah well what does it mean well not only that how many times do we say it in the prayers how many records do we have throughout the day and night in the five prayers hi is this calculus is mathematics what what is this this is a lecture about conversing with Allah is asking us took to counter we barely can add and subscribe how many we have 17 la cara per day right too far for the for answer for Asia and philemon room these are 17 dark eyes almost about without going into numbers 6 Baraka so this approximately is about 100 plus x you yourself as an individual say Allahu Akbar in the eighth how many times does the Imam say Allahu Akbar in the first record seven and then second five this is only to start with it how many times you say Allah Akbar after every Salah when making dhikr 33 how many times you say a lock but before we go to bed do we yes you do who see this is again the Prophet told us and I saw something the hadith of Fatima and daddy when he went to them and found him i said profit when she fought him i said to the prophet areas of saddam I needed servant what work made in my hands and the Prophet came to them and he told them I'll tell you something that is better than a servant say before you go to bed subhanAllah 33 times al hamdulillah 33 times Allahu Akbar 34 times and this completes the hundred and this is better to you than a servant shakily slapping Tamia we all have mercy and so he says that whenever I go to bed I say this and if I don't say this my power the following morning would be cut off and it gives you it boosts your energy and power by saying this before going to bed so how many times do we say that Allah Akbar during the day and night in prayer no see I'm making it difficult in prayer and add on in the cave before going to be a lot yet we never pay attention to what it means so if I say what does allow for mean allah is the most greatest ok but this is a superlative form of arabic some in translated into allah is great and some say allies greater than and they don't mention what he is greater than so you would usually say that this is a sin than this this is superlative so the arabic word is better than accent akkabarr shorter than up so this is the same a way to say it so Allahu Akbar means Allah is greater than any thing that could cross your mind this is the word that the prophet used to say that is awesome whenever he conquered a village as in the case where he conquered the village of high bar when they broke all treaties and they betrayed him so many times for a second and a third time he conquered them and said Allah Akbar destruction will fall upon the village of hyper and also the Prophet erased a lot was salaam used to say Allahu Akbar also had a lot whenever he saw something that was strange or something that calls for his administration admire a shin that is now whenever I want to pray to Allah the last thing I remember is saying assalamualaikum warahmatullah and i do not recall anything from my prayer why because I'm negligent I don't know who I am praying to if I want to have a similar prayer to the prayer of the prophet erase errata salam i have to know a large anymore without knowing Allah you are not a Muslim you are not a proper Muslim a lot of the brothers spent hours and hours since i came to to to England i SAT with the number of brothers in up north without mentioning the place in various places and all the things that they talk about is groups sex this scholar and that scholar and how differences they have chair take this link take this DVD watch what this guy said about this guy innocent you are wasting your time on things that have no value to us as Muslims what has value to me is what is my position on the day of judgment which level i'll be in paradise how many verses of the quran have i memorized how clean is my heart towards muslim what is it filled by this is what counts at the sight of allah azzawajal therefore when I come to prayer I find that there is no taste for my prayer I pray for our cars I leave I feel like an empty shell I feel that there is emptiness in me because i do not know allah as ocean you know what is the greatest verse of the Quran what is the greatest I and the Quran Allah so this is the surah but it's not so what it will fight you I'm saying I verse not a surah ayatul kursi Allah huda illaha illa huwa l high you'll call you Subhan Allah the hadith of obey Him niqab may allah be pleased with him he was the leader and the master of all reciters of the Quran he was the best among the scholars and reciting the Quran the Prophet gave him this status he met him once sallallahu ala salama said a bellman there this is his nickname obey they been camp what is the greatest ayah in the Quran and obey said allahu allah allahu alem allah and his prophet knows most so Larson and the Prophet repeated the question again a bell wonder what is the greatest I in the Quran now obey near the Quran by by heart he was perfect not only that in one incident in authentic hadith the Prophet recited in the Salah or an and after the solar concluded obey said o prophet of Allah you dropped this i er you did not recite it and he said subhanAllah why didn't you remind me during the salon why didn't you say it while we were in prayer so that I would have repeated I forget so this shows you how great he was with Quran in the second time when the Prophet told him i sir am what is it then he knew that the Prophet is checking his knowledge so that he is entitled to give it a try not that he didn't know he had it in his mind but he does not have any evidence to support it so in the first time when he was asked his eight afraid is it a la hora su Huan er I can't talk in your presence but when the Prophet asked him again he knew that this was from the Prophet the go ahead and say what you believe immediately what did he say he said ayatul kursi allahu allahu allah who will hire you which means that he did not think it over he had it in his mind because those who decide the Quran learn the Quran to benefit from it not only just to recite it like a parrot without understanding it and the Prophet was very happy and he said Leah a nickel I am calm under me maybe you be congratulated for this sound knowledge that you have what was the ayah iho al kursi he did not tell him halal and haram verses of the Quran and there are so many of them he did not tell him versus of divorce he did not tell him versus on the ruling of chopping the hands or flogging the other fornicator or the banning of a hammer he did not tell him about the description of Jannah the description of hell he did not tell him about the stories of the previous messengers or the description of angels what did he tell him about ayatul kursi which talks about what does it talk about it talks about a large soldier the greatest I in the Iran talks about a massive Hana Hana and not only that in the authentic hadith in a Bihari and elsewhere there was a man who used to lead prayer for his expedition at the time of the Prophet Elisha Watson but every time he recited in fact he ha he would read another surah and then the end he would conclude it with all who Allah who I had a la who summit lemme le dwell amulet what am I akula ho cool for one ah so his companions came to me say listen you reciting to sue us either recite the first one or beside all who Allah had alone but why I combined them both he said listen this is the way I pray you like it el hamdellah you don't find someone else to lead the prayer I don't want to be a remap and they dwelt among themselves that he's our best man he's the most righteous person he's the most knowledgeable person so they went to the Prophet Alesana and complained o prophet of Allah this man who leads a prayer does this the Prophet told them go back to him and ask him why do you recite it so they went and they said the Prophet says this in this and that so he said he justified by saying because it contains the description of allah and i like it and i love it for this so they went to the Prophet I haven't told them this the Prophet said your love to the description of Allah made you enter Jenna and another narration he told them go back to him and tell him that allah loves you because you love this what did it contain the description of allah so your most important task in life not your school's not your home chores not to buy a big house or to drive a fancy car your most important mission on earth is to know allah azzawajal if you fill your heart with the knowledge of allah nothing can harm you nothing can stop you nothing can worry you nothing can intimidate you and this is why when we stand in prayer and say a law a kebab you have to understand what this mean what does this word means it's not the hell out what Allah cuz my love my gosh and it's over no you have to know Allah who but Allah is greater than what then everything very easy word to say you have to say it in details you have to believe in it in details so if I ask the brother is Allah greater than everything said yes definitely can a la solve or proper all problems he said yes what about your nagging wife you've been complaining for the past six years oh this is big this is vehicle Subhan Allah what about the debts you always worry about what about your children who are always you sit until eight o'clock crazy 91 cheating time what about all these things that are burdening your shoulders I said oh I never thought of that I know that Allah is greater than everything but when it comes to details the devil is in the details esha say when you say Allahu Akbar everything that worries you believe that Allah is bigger than that so when you say Allah is greater than my worries is greater than my debts is greater than my fear of my wife or is greater than my fear of my husband is greater than my husband's abuse is greater than my in-laws a frequent attack verbal and physical it's bigger than my worries at work my boss is controlling over me it's bigger than everything that is why when you see Allah Akbar you are focusing you are fully contemplating and you have the full submissiveness to seek a las diversion and it is difficult to have this it's not something that is not like steroids are you just take an injection couple of weeks time mashallah you're carrying a balloons in your hands no you you have to work hard for this to know Allah to love Allah thick think I met one brother in Saudi his study and I was chit chatting with him mashallah he prays in the message and he says okay I pray in the message but I don't love allah ya think before you speak seriously I fear a las wrath and I fear hell but I don't love Allah you you're insane how can you not love someone who has given you everything what what has he given me what has he given me a one of the righteous predecessors of the scholars saw a beggar begging people for money and he's asking all share horse-collar give me one girl hum so the sheriff said ok would you take 100 thousand dear ham and I'll take your I know you crazy ok will you take 100 thousand and I take your hearing would you take 100 thousand and you give me your hand both of them your feet your health your ability to speak and every time they are beggar is saying no and scholar said subhanAllah you're begging people for one dirham while you are carrying hundreds and thousands of their humps a new not appreciative of that yeah he don't you look at the blessing in the favor of Allah that you have I've seen people attending my lectures in the UK on a wheelchair they cannot walk they go all the way all the trouble just to attend a lecture and you have feet aren't you grateful to allah azzawajal yes yes yes but some people have bicycles I have only my feet and those who ride bicycles say yeah but others are favored by Allah they have got motorcycles harley-davidson or suzuki or kawasaki or whatever and those who have these motorbike say yeah but others have cars and the one who has car has a car says yeah but this guy has a Porsche and who gon was a Porsche the other one has an r8 and the one was an hour 8 says oh the guy the other guy has a Bentley supercharged and the other one says it well if I have a Bentley my friend here has an airplane I cannot beat that and if he has an airplane that I want you would never be satisfied because you do not know Allah has ocean so many blessings and favors of Allah upon you so before you say Allahu Akbar learn who you are communicating with allah azzawajal in the authentic hadith in sahih muslim just to give you a glimpse and Allah is greater than this the Prophet tells us since I had a Muslim on the day of judgment hell will be dragged in front of the people it would have 70,000 leeches is it leech or chain or whatever the thing you draw it from and each one has 17 thousand angels they're just dragging one creation of a pathogen all of this to imagine a las greatness and a las wealth subhana Allah and you cannot imagine that the Prophet tells us at Islam that albay till mon amour is equivalent to the Kaaba on earth it is in the seventh heaven every single day since Allah created the creation seventy thousand angels enter it and never return to it again how many angels does Allah half soprano Diana imagine seventy thousand a day and they never return to it in every single day another new 70,000 and all of these are angels of a larger version if you try to figure out how many leaves do we have in that tree how me it's impossible for us to count it it can be but it is quite difficult how many trees mashallah you have in in Birmingham how many trees you have in Scotland how many T's you have worldwide in the jungles of the Amazons in here in there trillions and trillions and trillions of trees were lying not a single leaf falls except it is recorded at the sight of Allah as erosion and Lala knows when it will fall and how it will fall and where it would land everything we do Allah knows about this so Hannah Tyler not only that imagine one of the blessings and favors of Allah upon us which is the eyesight how many eyes you have met such a good cancer we have two eyes how many people do we have on earth say billion six billion x 2 12 billion eyes on earth and the Americans and the bridge and the Russians and the Europeans could not manufacture one single I is that true and Allah created how many 12 billion eyes existing and what about those in the making the wombs of pregnant women so give two or three billion extra what about the eyes of the ants the eyes of the bees the eyes of the fish eyes of the insects the eyes of the birds the eyes of all living creatures whose creating this the Angels know it is allah azzawajal so when you stand in submissiveness facing a lots of hannah wa'ta'ala in your prayer you say Allah who a kabob know who you're talking to and then this adds value to you when you finish your prayer because then when I go outside in the open on the streets I know that allah is watching over me and allah is watching me in whatever i do if i turn on something that angers him subhan allah ta'ala i would not listen to that because I know that he's hearing what I'm hearing and then if i ask allah if I am in that state if ask allah allah hoo answer me in if I seek His forgiveness he will forgive me and if I seek his provisions he would provide to me no matter how hard things are no matter how bad the calamity is only Allah can relieve you from it and only Allah can answer him when we call him and allah azzawajal knows best wallahu alam solution of our economy or Sri nabina muhammad your accident is very difficult to understand can you please repeat that what was the question i said 'no well if you know allah this means that you have portion of what is needed to become a Muslim it is like if you for example have something that requires other things to complete if you have a game for example if you have the board itself without what goes on top of it you cannot play a game so you need the full thing in order for you to play a game and likewise for a Muslim you have to fulfill the conditions of being a Muslim and obstacles that prevent you from being Muslim should not be there and that is why we say la illaha there is no God this is covered by itself this is this belief when you say la illaha and you do not continue you have to continue and say in the law except Allah which means that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah so without these two you cannot become a Muslim and if a person believes in the existence of Allah but he does not believe in the prophet alayhi salatu salam he's not how Muslim if a person believes in the existence of Allah and believes in the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam but does not believe in the Quran or rejects one verse of the Quran or believes that it is permissible to have more than one God or to have another prophet after the prophet alayhi salatu salam he is not a Muslim and we can go on and on I can confuse you until it's a time but is not appropriate well this is called in Arabic tests we've tests we've meaning that i will and you put you feelin fill out the blanks a lot of the Muslims whenever you tell them okay this is wrong he said yeah i know i will repent i know a brother Subhan Allah for the past 15 years he's practicing his beard marshal I praise in the masjid 15 years ago he used to smoke and i met him in trauma bond and i told him how hey this is wrong this is haram he said well why you're right inshallah after ramadan i will quit and it's been 15 years every year i meet with him and I say mashallah all that is not over yet is it not on sovereign hatch has come sono in the midterm oh and summer and he keeps on going and going and going you do not know when you will die do you know anyone one who died when he was in his 20s raise your hands please okay anybody that you know who died in his thirties okay 40 50 you know a lot I know children who died when they are six and seven years of age so no one knows how long he will live now if you have a carte blanche if you have a permission from Allah and you know exactly when you will die make the best of it have fun do whatever you want and just like a day or two before dying repent to Allah and a/c forgiveness colostrum dilla but you don't this is the problem you may die why while switching from channel to channel with your remote control and this is how you will be resurrected under their judgment with your remote control in your hand this is what the prophet seer son your shovel marrow o Muhammad Ali he will be resurrected on the day of judgment exactly as he died so if you died smoking under the stairs so that your parents would not find you this is how you'll be resurrected if you died taking doing crack or pot or marijuana or whatever this is how you gonna be resurrected if you died frustrating in the middle of the night asking a lot for forgiveness and weeping this is how you would be resurrected if you die while performing Hajj the Prophet tilde tells us as oh sanam that you will be resurrected on the day of judgment with your harm saying labbaik allahumma labbayk everybody's they're watching they will not say who's this crazy man saying labaik allahumma labbayk is the day of resurrection there is no ha refer their is no mature Medina no they would know that this is among those whom Allah has favored because on the day of judgment Hughes be you be doing this so when you want to repent do not postpone it do just do it just do it this is no I don't think I use what you have to do that you have to repent don't postpone it don't delay it and always be wishful hopeful that Allah will accept you but if you say that I'll wait until Ramadan then you're not sincere and out of experience so many people who waited a lot of the sisters who said I'll wear the hijab when Ramadan comes Ramadan had Joshua everything comes and goes and nothing changes if and why doesn't it change because Allah social disgraced you if Allah honored you he would have guided you if Allah wanted well for you he would have guided you so you make the choice you make the decision and whatever you make Allah would help you and this is a boring from Allah if you find out that every single morning I don't pray for sure except after sunrise every single day yes I came here I found a lot of practicing brothers masha'Allah but I've noticed that they skip fudger four times a week each other simple logic because you know as such it is early it's not like we're you have it in Saudi Arabia it's like 330 it's a panel know this is early what time do you sleep said well I 11 30 two o'clock why don't you sleep early I've chef watching the news and sitting with the kids and answering emails and you sometimes I watch a documentary on BBC four Subhan Allah is a new script Sabha for this and you call yourself practicing what is the limit of your practicing is having a shortstop this is it the most important thing in Islam is prayer if you don't pray might as well say goodbye to everything else so you have to give yourself a wake-up call you have to repent today before it's too late and do not look at others we have a problem of looking at others so I ok you have to repent ok what about myself me know your business you will have to repent no don't look at others look at yourself look at your own shortcomings what write a list of the bad things you have in yourself and tried fixing that now before Ramadan comes so that when Ramadan comes in sha Allah you come with a full repentance and true and sincere remorse and Alonso gel would forgive my sins and your sins with the grace of Allah yesterday I was in Keithley i think and i had a lecture there and i was talking to the the brothers and the Imam was next to me and I was you know shameful of how the Muslims have reached this low level of e man and I'm saying that subhanAllah you find practicing brothers that do not come to fetcher and I was asking him how many do you have in figueres is 505 much hot water bottle are much more than us in Saudi in Saudi the majority of message you have only two or three rows anything sure i'm not talking or throws i'm talking about individuals I hope shocked the match it was packed she's only five people said they are maximum sometimes three sometimes four for individuals and what about the rest are they Jews where are they I see the machine almost 200 people where are they at pfizer time ah sheriff sleepy everybody's looking at the ground move suspicion I'm not me it's not me and what is this this is a sign of hypocrisy if you don't pray on time if you don't pray foreign message it then you should be fearful for yourself that you are a hypocrite maybe a full fledge maybe comes he comes up half half but this is providing that you live within the vicinity of the message and how would I know if I live within the vicinity of the masjid the Prophet Arizona gave us the the means of measurement when he said to the blind man do you hear the event and he said yes he said you have to respond I have no excuse for you so the scholars say that to know if you are within the vicinity of the masjid we have to ask someone to call for the event manually no loudspeakers he has to be on top of the masjid and shouting his throat out there are people mashallah loud voices how much would the sound travel to scholars say that approximately average of three kilometers diameter so if your house is away from the masjid about three kilometers give or take half a kilometer then it is a must for you to attend the salah in the mess you if you live further than this there is no masjid you live like five kilometers away from the masjid it is not mandatory it is recommended but it is not mandatory you would not be sinful I hope this answers your question mr. from the back salam blah it it is always healthy to look down at your good deeds because then you become more appreciative and earning an eager to do more see in life we have two things one thing we have to look down and the other thing we have to look up the Prophet tells us a little Otto sir I'm the authentic hadith that when it comes to worldly matters always look down because then you're appreciative of what you have so if you have a wife don't look at someone who has to and say oh yeah I'm in a big problem i have only one he has two wives how lucky he is because you will not be appreciative of the favor and blessing of allah that he has granted you so if you have a wife always be grateful and look below you and you'll find people who do not have wives and maybe you'll find someone who has a wife but he has a nagging wife creaking is it is it ok and so on so if you have a job don't look at those who don't have a job but they have a steady income look at those who do not have a job and they are living on welfare or there begging people if you are healthy don't look at our nachos who is mostly and you know strong and but look at those who do not have except one leg or can barely walk or can't do this or do that now this is in worldly matters when you come to Dean when you come to Islam to believe to a man to knowledge don't look down always look up and shoot for the stars because if you pray five times a day at home and you look down and say and someone tells you why don't you pray the message it you should look my neighbor praise only four times a day and a co-worker praised three times a day if you pray three times a day and somebody tells you why don't you pray five times a day this is the pillar of Islam you say okay I'm better than my neighbor he only plays juma and if I go to him give him advice ok I'll leave you I go to your neighbor Salaam alaikum hey why are you praying on natoma you should pray five times a day cydia he be grateful I pray jumma but the other neighbor does not pray at all so you go to the other neighbor and give him no see huh give him that one happy you have to pray why aren't you praying at all he said yes listen I don't pray that's true but I'm better than our neighbor he does alcohol he drinks every night until he's wasted I go to other neighbor the whole neighborhood is corrupted weather is this you have to move so I go to the other neighbor and he said listen I'm better than our other neighbor he does drugs and if I go to the one who does drugs as I day I do heroin and cocaine and if I go to that one he says yeah see I am better than my other friend his Christian at least a Muslim by name I go to the Christian give him down Virginia Here I am better than the Jews the Jews killed Jesus Christ I go to the Jews as a yagi with better than those who worship camels and cows it never ends that is why when it comes to Dean to Islam to believe to virtue to good deeds don't always be satisfied with what you are and looking downwards no always be discontent with the level you've reach and say no okay well I only know one jiuzhou of quran inshallah I'd like to be like that person who knows true and if you remember eyes too I say I'd like to memorize half of it and if you do then i would like to be like that other one who memorized it all how about your night prayer our liar i offer only free rock I with her before fetcher I'd like to make it seven like this one or 11 like that one how many times you recite the Quran per month per month you crazy I decided one maybe I finish it may be or not and I've heard this a lot here can a Muslim skip finishing the Quran once a month this is the minimum that the prophet has some instructed us to do to finish the Quran from page from cover to cover once every month if you don't do that and then you claim you be practicing may be practicing basketball and practicing football not practicing proper Islam you have to go back to the basics to the Quran and to the soon clarify things to yourself and to those around you purify your heart fill it up with the love of Allah with the knowledge of Allah and then inshallah while being afraid that maybe Allah would not accept it so what do I do I will not do anything colossi will not pray maybe I'll not accept it I'll leave prayer and leave Islam i'll take another religion know maybe i'ma would not accept it so i will try my best and go out of my way to do more good deeds so that Allah would accept as much as possible for miles from my side so that on the day of judgment I would come and say oh Allah I did my best now if you accept it and hamdulillah if I don't if you do not then this is my best I cannot do more than that and Allah knows best final question which I've got myself is if a brother or sister leaves here who wants to pray but doesn't know how to should they wait until they learn how to pray or can they do actions in this immediate in time before learning to pray and there were people who accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet re salatu salam yet did not know how to recite the fatty huh the fact you have for Muslims is very easy it's the main chapter it's the greatest sewer and the Quran and every rakah every unit of the prayer we have to pray it but when you come to someone who is an an Arab or even an Arab who whose memory is not that good and you say you have to say al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen of rama navami medichini can Abu do I can assign the gases hmm I don't know to do so what'd you do we cannot tell him listen take a couple of weeks off try to memorize it and come up no you have to start from today to pray like the Muslims pray so what do I say say whatever you can from the Quran or as a prophet instructor that is awesome praise Allah by saying Subhan Allah alhamdulillah Allah ho Akbar these are very easy even to non Arabs they can pick it up just like this or even better more if you write it if you write the transcription of it in English and when you pray you just say on hungry we go like this and you read it this does the job for you but never ever skip prayer even if you don't know what to say you have to pray you have to have the connection you have to have the recharging of your heart so that whenever the charging is less Shaitaan overtakes you the devil overtakes you that the doubts the thoughts that the controlling of this enemy of ours but as long as you are praying and maintaining that God inshallah you will stay strong"
