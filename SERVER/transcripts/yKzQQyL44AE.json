  "transcript": "Sahdev says my question is can we ask from alumns meaning scholars those label themselves as they know what is going to happen in the future and what is the actual reason why her husband's behavior is changed by his knowledge according to Islam is this allowed first of all scholars are people of knowledge and not all the scholars are alike there are three categories of scholars as Sheikh Ibanez Amy may Allah have mercy on his soul classified them there is the scholar of the state whatever the rulers want Simon Says and said okay we make it halat he said make it how about it okay we make it Haram and they speak exactly in accordance to the women desires of the state and these are the worst of the worst these are complete hypocrites because they change and alter the Deen the religion for the masses but the masses know that these are phony number two scholars of the nation and the scholars of the nation they simply go to whatever attracts the masses so they come and say okay what do you want us to talk about this topic okay and they make great lectures and campaigns etc they say okay we've shifted from supporting this country in to this particular issue so they shift depending on what the masses want so they are people of the nation not according to what pleases Allah as a little but what pleases the vast majority of the people and the third type of scholars are the scholars of the religion so the Sharon Athenian Arabic says eylem the Ola alum uma alum Miller and the scholars of the religion care less about what the state says or what the nation says they are only concerned of what benefits the Ummah through the Quran and the Sunnah so they only portray the knowledge they have in accordance to what pleases allah azza wajal now this type of alum self is asking is not of the three categories because this person is an impostor he's a soothsayer he's a fortune-teller he's a person working with the jinn and a servant of the jinn they come to him and they cast to him some of the things that we failed to see but they are able to see and people believe that this person knows the unseen going to them and believing them nullifies your Islam whoever goes to a priest or a fortune-teller the Prophet says Alice Assam and believes him he has committed qu4 and disbelief of whatever I was revealed to so you make cover of Islam and whoever goes to a priest without believing just for the fun of it then forty days his prayer of forty days would not be accepted he has to pray but these prayers he will not get any reward for as a punishment therefore no one knows the unseen except allah azza wajal and whoever believes that someone else knows and seen other than allah is an apostate he has committed one of the things that nullify his religion"
