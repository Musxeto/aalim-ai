  "transcript": "please join me to welcome sheim for his talk on the topic no Lord no [Applause] peace ald [Music] corrections I am not a doctor Dr Muti is a doctor I'm not a doctor I'm just a patient correction number two I've held the position of an for the past three decades that was 10 years ago so people get old may Allah make us old in worshiping Himel to begin my topic there's a Hadith narrated by Abu D may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallah alai wasam said is any one of you unable able to recite onethird of the Quran in one night they said how could anyone read onethird of the Quran the prophet saidat is equivalent to 1/3 of the Quran we are not going to speak about the Quran however how can this short Surah be onethird of the Quran Scholars explained they said that the Quran is divided into three types or it talks about three topics number one about legislation rulings regulations do and don'ts number two about reward and Punishment and all that is related to it such as the stories of the prophets those who rejected the prophets and those who followed them what happened to them and thirdly the Quran talks a lot about the beautiful names and attributes of Allah Allah created us for one purpose and he subhanahu wa ta'ala told us about it that he had not created the gin and the humans the man mankind except to worship him so the reason of our existence is to worship Allah and I will not speak about the definition of worshiping Allah because this is not limited to praying in the Masjid or fasting Ramadan as so many people think it's a wider and a broader definition and meaning for the word worship tolerance is a form of worship smiling in the face of your brother providing it's the same gender is a form of worship so if Allah created us to worship Him are we doing this as Allah ordered us how can you worship someone you do not know the vast majority of us as Muslims we claim that we know Allah yet if you give someone a piece of paper and ask him to write the beautiful names and attributes of Allah that he knows he will fail to go beyond three lines and this is problematic for you as a Muslim because you claim that you worship Allah yet you do not know anything about the one you worship when asked which is the most noble branch of science in Islam without any doubt it is the knowledge about Allah it is more important than than than Hadith knowing Allah is what drives you to prosperity and happiness but who is Allah how would I introduce Allah to someone who's coming to learn about Islam when he tells me what is Allah I as a Muslim raising the flag being proud of being a Muslim am I able to explain to him who Allah is Allah is the name of the creator of the heavens and the Earth the name of the facilitator of our Affairs the name of araz the one who provides for us all creatures in this universe need him while he needs no oneel to him all beautiful names and attributes go back to the name Allah and no one had ever used this name before him do you know of any similarity to him yet sometimes people come and say prove Pro to me that Allah exists how can I do that it is not a laboratory that we go and make an experiment subhah Allah's existence can be known through three types of evidences one instinctive evidences something that is built bu within you even if you're an atheist even if you're a non-muslim you still have this in you that you believe that there is a lord who created the universe there is an entity that you run to when you are in trouble and this is only for Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala when you fear something you run away from it if a lion comes and you see the teeth showing don't reach out for your mobile phone to take a selfie the lion is not smiling he's about to eat you when you fear fire you run away from it when you fear Allah you flee to him when you are in distra you call him and this is why even those who do not believe in Allah at times of trouble they reach out raise their hands their hearts is directed to Allah subhana their hearts are directed to Allah seeking his help and this is why the prophet saidat all newborn are born on on their nature the nature to worship Allah not that they know how to pray rest four no they have this inclination to worship to submit to a Creator how they need guidance but they know this by Instinct that second type of evidences are tangible evidences things that you can touch if you look around you and you see that the world is changing so many things so many events happen in the world how do these things happen who is making them happen everything around you trees rocks humans Earth Heavens Skies oceans rivers who made all of this it blows your mind when you think about these beautiful things an organ simple organ in the human body which is an eye no one can reproduce this make this eye no way all the powers of the world they cannot come up with a living organ of an eye how many eyes do we have on Earth 14 billion who made them Allah and no one can else duplicate that how many eyes are in the making in the wombs of the pregnant women another four or five billion what about the eyes of the fish of the animals of the birds of the insects trillions and trillions of eyes only designed manufactured and made by Allah subhanahu wa taala so this is tangible I can see this one would say nature did it nature did it bring a pile of wood and put it in a room and close the room for a th years will you ever open it and find a kitchen table will you ever find a piece of furniture made through nature never this is illogical nobody believes in this so definitely all these great creations of Allah that have been here for thousands and millions of years were created by Allah Asel and finally the third type are religious based evidences that prove to us the existence of Allah all religions state that there is a Lord that is knowledgeable that is wise that is merciful all religions of Allah prove this then this is why as Muslims we believe in the existence of Allah Asel not only that we believe in his beautiful names and attributes and we call him with them we acknowledge that Allah Asel alone is the Lord the Creator he is the provider it's not me that goes to the office or to the company and get the paycheck at the end of the day this is Allah who's providing for me he's The Sovereign the controller the all knowing the all wise he is the everliving he never dies he's the sustainer of all that exists he is the all hearing the old seeing and this means that when I'm on my own watching something that is Haram listening to something that is Haram acknowledging that Allah is all hearing and seeing makes me think twice before falling into such a sin subhanahu wa ta'ala he is the subtle and the courteous he is the all aware the most beneficient the most merciful the ever forbid the ever forbearing the oft forgiving Allah the almighty he is the comp the of pardoning the most gracious the most strong and the all powerful the inventor of all things the bestower of all forms Muslims know this and they believe in it and take it for granted they believe in the verses of the Quran that they read which strengthens their IM of Allah and this is why the the more you recite the Quran the more Tranquility you get and the more knowledge of Allah you gain and the closer to him to him belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the Earth in his hand is goodness and he's able to do all things beautiful names and attributes only belong to him to him belongs the best of names when it comes to Divine will he does what he pleases and he rules as he wishes Allah Asel says and your lord creates whatever he wills and chooses when it comes to people of wealth when it comes to people of power and Authority Allah says so say oh Allah owner of sovereignty you give sovereignty to whom you will and you take sovereignty away from whom you will you honor whom you will and you humble and humiliate whom you will in your hand is all good indeed you are over all things come competent when it comes to time when it comes to place Allah is the ultimate subhanahu wa taala he is the first without a beginning he is the last without an end subhanahu wa taal he's Above All Things Allah says he he is the first nothing is before him and he's the last nothing is after him he's the most high nothing is above him and the most near nothing is nearer than him and he is the old knower of everything everything o on Earth and in this universe was created by Allah even our own Deeds the Deeds that we do Allah has created them there is no other Creator than him subhanahu wa ta'ala therefore do not fall into the common mistake that some people say I create my own destiny I create my own sins Allah is the creator of all you do not know what was written in the preserved tablet so that you can decide all what you can do is feel humble and feel in need and express your poverty to Allah because he subhanahu wa taala is the granter of all good subhanahu wa taala said in the the most important and the greatest verse in the Quran Allah there is no deity except him the everliving the sustainer of all existence neither drowsiness overtakes him nor sleep to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on Earth who is it that can intercede with him except by his permission he knows what is presently before them and what will be after them and they Encompass not a thing of his knowledge except for what he Wills his kury extends over the heavens and the Earth and their pres preservation tires him not and he is the most high the most great Allah is not like us we may stop our ourselves from giving I may not give you some of what I have if I do not like you if you do not respect me if you do something that may annoy me but Allah gives all and he gives without account and there is no creature on Earth but that upon Allah is its provision who gives gives you the power to breathe and inhale who gives you the power to Exhale who allows the blood to run your veins not only you but also in the veins of those who disbelieve in Himel Allah has favors and blessings upon us without count and he gave you from all you asked of him him and if you should count the favor of Allah you could not enumerate them with all our sins with all our shortcomings if our account was to anyone other than Allah we would have been doomed but alhamdulillah he holds us accountable and indeed Allah is pardoning and forgiving he is one subhanahu wa ta'ala say he is Allah who is one Allah the Eternal Refuge he neither begets nor is born nor is there to him any equivalent this is the Lord we worship and this is what we miss when we stand in pray prayer why don't we find why can't we perfect our prayers why do not why don't we benefit from our prayers immediately after we give Salam we engage in sin and go back to the vicious circle that we recognize to draw us away from Allah this is his Reign s y these are his attributes this is his creation this is his blessing upon us only him deserves to be praised and thanked only him deserves to be worshiped whoever acknowledges Allah's beautiful names and attributes he would not be able to sit idle without praising him with his tongue with his heart with his organs praising Allah Asel for who Allah is praising Allah in his lordship acknowledging that he is the creator no one creates except him that he's the provider that he is the sustainer of our Affairs that he is the one who gives life and takes it if we acknowledge Allah's beautiful names and attributes and believe in them we will not ever devote any type of worship other than to Himel you will not find people worshiping Graves or swearing by other than Allah you will not find people offering sacrifice to other than Allah you will not find people legislating other than the Shar of Allah the vast majority of us brothers and sisters unfortunately live thinking that they'll never die look at our routine on daily basis we work hard or some of us at least we work and we have a focus or a we have a Target in mind to become rich to become famous to become wealthy to become a person with authority so that people can take selfies with us but we depend entirely on our knowledge on our education certificate we depend on our wealth we depend on our Authority and as they say it is not what you know it is who you know so we have a wide range of connections with people and this is the exact reason why we fail to find tranquility and peace of mind this is the exact thing that we're being tortured with in this life so if you love your spouse 110% Allah will torment you with your spouse if this ever exists but hypothetically no one loves his spouse 110 but if it exist it will torment you if you love your job it will humilate you if you love your money and wealth it will enslave you you will never find true Tranquility true peace of mind except when you believe in Allah when you know Allah Asel when you trust depend depent and rely fully on Allah Asel only then you will not have the burden of thinking day and night about your loans about the future of your children about the job you're about to lose when you have this conviction of Allah and you believe in Allah and you know his beautiful names and attributes even if you're fired from your job you still have the peace of mind because you acknowledge who's the razak Allah who gives provision and risk to the trillion of insects to the birds to the animals to the fish Allah created you and favored you upon all of these creation creations of his don't don't you think that Allah will provide for you then trust him depend on him and then you will find that the whole universe is serving You by his grace and this is why if you look in the Quran you will find that even the mountains and the birds used to praise Allah with the peace be upon Him Allah says and we subjected the mountains to exal exalt us along with David and also the birds so my talk is focused on knowing Allah your lord without knowing him don't consider yourself to be living and you cannot find tranquility and peace except in knowing his beautiful names and attributes and this is your road to the Eternal peace the prophet saidat Allah has 99 Names 100 less one whoever learns them will enter Paradise brothers and sisters if I give you a paper a piece of paper and ask you to write the number of names of Allah that you memorize would you a be able to reach like 30 40 and where is the rest then we have a deficiency in us we know the names of football players we know the names of the latest movies and songs and celebrities but why do we fail in knowing the source of tranquility and peace and that is the names of Allah why do we fail in studying our Quran why do we fail in knowing the companions of the prophet and his beautiful and when you ask people who are the 10 heavenbound no one will answer you if you ask them about the year that the Battle of or the battle of the trench took place rarely you will find someone who would answer you and if you tell them do you know they will laugh is this a name of a individual a human being his father is aqua what is this and he's and he's it's a he or a she his name is Sal and this is our failure it is our own shortcoming because we are the ones who failed in learning so where do we go from here in order for us to reach the Eternal peace which is Jenna we have to first of all learn the beautiful names and attributes of Allah asael we have to implement his beautiful names and attributes in our lives and this would give us with the grace of Allah Asel Asam and would make us reach I pray to Allah that he makes us among those who learn the beautiful names and attributes who Implement them and I pray to Allah Asel that he grants us the necessary and needed in our Salat and to grant us the peace and Tranquility that we uh uh seek after in this life and in the Hereafter m"
