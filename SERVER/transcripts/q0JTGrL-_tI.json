  "transcript": "his second question is that i have a friend who does a particular sin let's assume that he masturbates and he's complaining to me it's difficult i can't quit so would i be exposing my sin if i said to him i know how you feel a couple of years ago i used to do the same thing and now alhamdulillah repented and i quit it and i'm fine would that be exploding the sin the answer is yes allah can seal this nobody knows here that you used to do this sin now you've exposed what allah has concealed your intention is good but this intention does not justify you exposing your sin let us assume that i used to do a particular sin let's assume that i used to smoke for example so i see someone smoking and he said well pray for me i can't resist smoking and i i'm unable to kick the habit so i said no problem i know how you feel i used to smoke myself and i did this and i did that and and the guy goes around writes in twitter writes on facebook sherhasim used to be a smoker he used to be a chain smoker he did this he did that he smoked like a chimney he drank like a fishy whatever so imagine he puts all of this online how would i feel i would feel outraged because i would feel violated well i shouldn't because i'm the one who exposed myself so you get what you deserve so do not expose your sin to anyone as long as allah has forgiven you as long as allah has protected you and concealed you keep it keep the lid on"
