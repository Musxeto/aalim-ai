  "transcript": "and then I'll just have a quick question in regards to leaving the prayer so I understand don't worry that I'm aware that you follow the opinion that uh you know if someone prays sometimes he's not a cafe but I just wanted to know basically uh I've made a bit of research on this and I've seen that basically throughout history there were two opinions one opinion that was chosen by the majority of the that uh you know by the hanafies the medication you know the one who doesn't pray at all is not the catheter but made a sinner then you have the other opinion uh which is you know mostly chosen by the Contemporary sculptors that are actually the one who doesn't pray as a bisbanever but what I and both parties bring their evidences and what I've read and correct me if I'm wrong that the majority of those that say that dealing with the prayers of disbeliever also say that actually leaving off one prayer is called Akbar and they also bring the evidence stuff I think it was my husband he said that uh basically they were almost a consensus a consensus consensus among this Harbor that uh leaving off one prayer and apparently this was also the opinion of oh um so in like this how do we support the opinion that actually no the one you press sometimes and it's not about character but a major Sinner and uh what are some of the evidences you know apart from uh the difference between Salah and assalam you know this is a long topic uh sufyan and I was fortunate and honored about maybe 12 13 years ago to have a a Circle of Knowledge with my brother Dr Abu Amina Bilal Phillips in Green Lane Masjid in Birmingham about 12 13 years ago and we did a sort of a debate but it wasn't a debate it was scholarly conversation but it wasn't the Masjid in public on this particular rule whether a person who leaves the Salat is a cafe or not and I think it's on my YouTube channel and elsewhere by the name of the great debate so I would refer you to go there however in a nutshell if Abu hazim uh uh IBN hazim may Allah have mercy on his soul the Imam of the vahi school of thought mentioned that the consensus of the companions is that whoever abandons one Salat is a kafir this is totally bogus like Imam Ahmed may Allah have mercy on his soul said whoever mentions the consensus of people then he has lied how does he know that someone in this country or that did not differ with this consensus so I could sit here all day long and say the consensus of tabirin the consensus of XYZ without having tangible proof to back this up and there is no consensus because if there were such a consensus among the companions we wouldn't have any issue this is an Evidence by itself but there isn't abandoning one single prayer makes you a cafe this is not true at all and the difference between the scholars is revolving around an issue which I always mentioned that is theoretical and practical on the theoretical part yes who does so and so is a kafir on the Practical part is to implement this rule on a specific individual ah we have to fulfill the conditions and ensure that there are no obstacles blocking this ruling from being implemented and this is not possible it did not take place almost since Allah knows when therefore the issue is not as simple as one plus one equals two you have to look into the holistic way of collecting the evidences and scrutinize them and understand them as a package not as individuals and then you will find out the way insha Allah"
