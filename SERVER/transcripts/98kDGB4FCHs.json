  "title": "Do I have to pay zakat on money I loaned & what about money who borrowed? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if I borrow someone money and uh they want to use the money to to buy something and the price uh increased so uh she saved the money and now the money is being uh with her for more than a year and uh the money reach to pay Saka on it so does she have to pay Saka on it because I don't require her to pay me for another maybe three four five years and or do I have to on it because it's still my money even I don't have it with me it's an issue of dispute what I follow and I believe is that number one you the lender have to pay zakat every single year as long as that individual has has the ability to pay it and they're not broke my brother comes and says I need 100,000 to do XY Z and I said here you go and I give it to him now I know my brother is earning and he has savings but he needs extra cash after one year I have to or when my zakat is due I have to give zakat on that ,000 why I don't have it yes but if I say to him give it back to me he would immediately manage to do something and give me back the money he's not broke he's capable of paying it and I did not put a time limit to it so one year two years 5 years 10 years no problem I have to pay the zakat yearly now if my brother took the 100,000 and stat in his bank account after a whole year of borrowing it if he still has the money or whatever is left of the money he has to pay zakat on that what why would he if the owner paid the zakat why would he pay the zakat again because the money is in his hand and when the prophet used to sendat his officials to collect zakat from those who have crops from those who have cattle from those who have trades they used to come and check how many camels do you have give us x amount of zakat without interrogating them or questioning them are they all yours or did you borrow some of them they would take whatever is found and whatever they see this is why zakat is due upon both and Allah Knows Best"
