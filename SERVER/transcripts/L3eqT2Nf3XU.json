  "transcript": "the emails sajid says is it permissible to offer salah while wearing a surgical face mask for both men and women in the current situation with the coveted 19 the answer is yes it is permissible if not it is highly recommended because the hadith of the prophet alaihim stated that it is not permissible to pray while wearing your cover face like this this is called litham so if i cover my face like this this is not permissible providing it is without any legitimate reason but people nowadays wear these surgical masks for a reason and a legitimate reason and hence there is no problem in doing that and allah azza knows best"
