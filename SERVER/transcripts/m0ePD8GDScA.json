  "title": "How to debate, respond & give dawah to disbelievers / non muslims? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she a few days ago I was having a debate with my boss at work and the debate got to the point where I was telling him that life is a test and to earn the respect and love of God you have to be patient when you suffer and he told me that he would not accept a God in that way because it's like him my boss whipping me with a belt and telling me the only way I will love you is if you accept this uh this pain and that that's the only way I will accept you and I did not know how to respond to it okay first of first of all we have to to establish that not every statement I have to counter it because sometimes it is illogical to engage in a debate or an argument and reply to every statement that is a a a a waste of time if you remember in the Quran in Chapter 2 Surah Bak when Allah told us about ibraim debating with anud the king of a region there and ibraim was displaying and presenting to this Tyrant King who Allah is so he says Allah gives life life and takes it so the king said I give life and take it and he brought two prisoners and he sentenced them to death he killed one of them and spared the life of the other so he said okay I can do that ibraim did not answer him or tried to refute his illogical claim of giving life and death rather he shifted into another concept by saying okay my Lord Allah brings the Sun from the East you bring it up from the west and this is when the disbeliever was beaten and could not answer back the same concept when you say to your boss that life is a test and who's testing there's a difference if your boss belts you and asks you to tolerate his punishment and pain this is illogical because you are human like me I can beat you up and I can do to you things that no one else could do but when it comes to Allah who is Allah compared to a boss Allah is The Giver of Life and taker of it Allah is the provider Allah is the facilitator Allah is the creator of all what is in Heavens and in Earth so how can you compare him to others this is illogical so first of all when you talk to these disbeliever belies you have to establish the existence of God of Allah and his attributes once you manage to do this without telling them about of worship no we speak abouted of lordship establish the existence of Allah and his beautiful names and attributes through his lordship that he's the Creator that he's The Giver of Life and uh uh uh death that he is the provider that he's the facilitator that facilitates everything that he's the one who owns everything that he's The Giver of provisions and drain Etc then when he establishes that in his heart we can talk about other things and Allah Knows Best"
