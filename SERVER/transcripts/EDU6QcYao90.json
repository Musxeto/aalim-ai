princes in the corruption and the mixing with women and men and it is awful nothing in edged is good except passing and a varsity right and they said but Marashi local cuisine you have our neza and we have Breda Eliza they have dishes satellite dishes on their houses I've seen people smoke in the state four aneesa is this is cloud there is no no Islam except here in Breda yes it is right then abu saleh says but a Russian even in Breda the neighborhood next to us they are not completely doing what they should they are not attending classes they're not attending Mahama reduce they're not making taffy look at their children playing in the streets every time nothing in Breda is good except our street would you and I did brush it says the law you're right and then Abu Saleh goes on and saying even our street rush it you know all those people are newly comers to our neighborhood to all street the only people who live here since 20 years and stay masha'Allah binding to Islam is your house in my house and a brush it says do you write and then napisala says a mirage it your prayer is not that good the moral of the story is this is exactly how we feel against everybody else at the end of the day I am Abu Saleh and everybody else is have a rush it and this is wrong as I said in one of the lectures before I don't know which one that I look at someone who's older than I am as mashallah his age is much older than I am and he did so many good deeds more than I did and I look at the small and young child I say masha'Allah he doesn't have as many sins as I have this is the way I look at people now I don't have to say this to you when I come to use it I am sinful I amber please please slap me on the face no this is something between me and Allah this is how I think myself but in front of everybody else no I ma sha Allah the good practicing Muslim I'm striving to do good and I'm striving to please Allah so as you're going back I don't know where but anyhow yeah going back to the verse of the Quran so Allah says that you have to urge encourage the believers to fight and this was the beginning if there are plenty of you who are patient standing they must fight to beat 200 so one man to everything man so if you were attacked by 10 you have to fight them to the day if they were 11 you have excuse to run not to escape but to regroup and Allah goes on to say and if you were 100 you will have to fight a thousand this was at the very beginning and then it was obligated by the verse that followed it immediately Allah said that Allah has lightened your task for he knows that there is weakness in you one to ten maybe it's a little bit too much for some of you but a lot of you can and a lot of the Companions did this panis aromatic may allah be pleased with him went to a room with his brother al ba ba eben matic was sitting and do you read about Bob Malik you know him not a lot of people know about him but I dramatic was chanting poetry yeah he's making the sheet of course no sound effects huh no drums nothing is just chanting now that nowadays nasheeds a lot of it is haram because it's exactly similar to music same effect and when you hear the background you say this inner Honor this is human effects what's you man i was going to guitars and by lens and pianos it's another human human ish if you don't know they have this way of doing it this is how long has the same effect so the law was chanting is making his singing but changing is permissible without any doubt as long as it doesn't have any musical instruments so i just came and said you the companion of the prophet he's doing this now abella his older than anas anas his younger and albaraa looked at him and said what what are you afraid of brother you think I was dying as a nun Muslim you think that I will die as a non-muslim and you're afraid that allow changed my heart by Allah I have killed one hundred warriors in a jewel except those are killed during the battle what's a jewel 121 in the beginning of every battle he was a feast warrior he is the one that they carried over a shield and throw over the fence of aliamanu for a fortress with masala mercat that to open the door from the inside how many were inside the and he opened the door but was sick for more than a month because they found that more than 80 stabs were with him one of us is you know an injection he cries six days seven nights because of that this guy was you know stabbed 80 times it was also reported that Holly delete himself was his nurse for a whole month he used to visit him in the morning in the afternoon taking care of his wounds so this man is saying that are you afraid I killed 100 by myself except those you know the 5000 you know what I was well chop his head they killed this one killed that one and he was known to be among those who Allah answers their call mr. job of Dawa and the battle of an island against the Persian very very fierce battles they had the elephants they had things that God is not see the first day they almost lost the second day they almost lost and they said Baba supplicate MacDonald so said oh Allah grant us victory and grant us their necks and they were defeated and Allah third day almost to be defeated and they said but big dong it's an easy way out is it oh Allah grant us victory and make me among the first to be master today and he died so one man could kill not only 10 give even more because what are you afraid of you want Jenna but you have to follow the right way to Jenna you can wrap yourself with explosive and blow yourself you will go to hell immediately what is why I'm doing it for Islam don't know another you are killing yourself whoever kills himself goes to 2 now to fire potential I want generally you're wrong way you're going against the way that the Prophet is a son you do not kill yourself you do not do terrorist attacks you do not do this this is this all of these are listed by the Prophet himself Allosaurus enough not to kill a child not to kill a woman that took ill and elderly not to kill a priest so whatever is being done nowadays has nothing to do with Islam the enemies of Islam are making it appeal that Muslims are doing it but Muslims told that this is not Islam he Lester his obligation please give us their business there is nothing like this in Islam show the verse was made lighter instead of 1 to 10 Allah has those are with his grace made it one to two so this is obligation so now one fights five people and says I do not want to go back so no this was obligated if you don't there's a possibility that you are defying a las instruction who wrote about this knowledge a number of people a number of scholars wrote about in a second module and you have to know that most of those who wrote about nazerman sooo are scholars of hadith because you need to know the dates and who is the best to know the scholar of hadith and also the scholars of fit because it involves obligation of rules so who knows better than the jurors themselves so patada a sidhu see a beam she had azubu is one of the Taba and one of the famous narrators of of the hadith I am I didn't handle is well known and does not need to be introduced about the wood also the compiler of sudden Timothy the compiler of sudden a burro beta cos him as I said before he is one of the greatest scholars to compile on Omicron though he died in 224 very early but he is among the first to write and compile and do this work McKeon Abby Paula Ebben hasn't a robbery the compiler of all the imam of the valley school hymnal a lobby al-maliki and there are two even alara be there in a min al arabi and there is given how to be without him an alibi is a deviant person who a lot of the scholars say that he is not a Muslim because he's part of the botany said but in anatomy is one of the imams of the natick a school abu faraj given and josie and he's different to ignore IM amine and josie is different to even I email Josia people mix them up this guy is a different person and of course so UT who died for five centuries ago conditions of NASA are there any necessary conditions one the total length must contradict if we can combine the two or work a way out there is no need to obligate why when you obligate you completely abolish you completely cancel a ruling so if we can combine this is a win-win situation if it's not any possible then obligating it would be applicable for example when Allah says that you should not approach prayer when you are in the state of intoxication can we combine this with in the Mocambo or may see what ensemble as la more assertive anomaly shape are you vegetarian you have to stay away from it you have to avoid it can we combine the two if someone says yes he says meaning that ok it's ok to drink after Asia and get drunk but before frigid you have to be sober so if you say yes this is what it means but definitely it does not is not possible the the ruling is final first an e-book meaning not only not drink it avoid it and avoid being in its circle of all being in the place that's why Allah and the Prophet has I'm cursed 10 dealing with with wine those who go with those who make it those who buy it those who sell it to who those who carry eight those who pay for it those who it's been paid for etc so it has to contradict second condition it must it isn't wants to know which preceded the other we have to know the timings if we have to evidence is contradicting then we cannot combine we have to look into the timing so they we know which one obligated the other but if this is not possible can we abrogate if we do not know the time it is impossible for us to abrogate not necessarily the time in the year for the time of the hour but which came first thirdly both rulings must be from the Quran and Sunnah as stated before HD had pyaas do not obligate so we cannot come to a PS push the heart from two or three scholars and say yes they r HD high obligated this verse of the Quran or this hadith it cannot be the obligation must be from either crime or from shanna it is clear eshala eshala I think this is an easy topic and rest inshallah we will finish very soon what are the sources of a nasa an immersive quran and sunnah so we have quran abrogating the Quran itself yes this is insulated mujibur I think you can see it is Sharla where Allah so Allah says yeah I you her latina a minus banana j2 rasool ugh d mu beta a day that welcomes olika the soul oppa danica hydraulic oh wat ha so Allah Allah is saying that if you are demanding or needing to communicate with the Prophet one-to-one basis because in menasha is something that people would not here with Eric and that's why a la serda says in nashua min a shape on Leah's well Idina Amman what is this nashua is when three of us are in a room and to talk secretly without the third this is Nashua and it is this is forbidden unless he gives you the con the consent so why because this throws regret and soul into his heart if both of you are talking in the room and laughing and I don't know what you're talking on comes and says they're talking about you they're laughing about you and this ruling does not only apply for three it applies for five against one or ten against one but if they are 10 against to vanish if it's one no you have to involve him or seek his permission and also this applies for the brothers when they come and pick me up and they speak in Tamil and I'm sitting there I don't understand what the same that is why when I usually go in a car or in a place where an Arab is next to me he doesn't tell us that English and I'd like to speak to a person in english i would say can I speak to him in English he says yes and I do I have to seek his permission so this is a ruling the Prophet the voters to this is the word of yeshua so when a companion wanted to speak with the Prophet Elisha Sarah Allah instructed them to first pay Sbrocco this is the first thing to do and only I Lee may allah be pleased with him as we mentioned yesterday did this and then it was abrogated allah so allah says shocked oh and to put the move any other energy welcome sauropods are you worried and afraid what I don't know it translates to yeah are you afraid of spending in charities before you your private consultations if you do not fail mpfi do whatever lavar a compaq him solitaire to Jakarta wotty or allahu allah allahu allahu allah ma tefilin Tamaran so all of this was obligated so this is Quran my Quran which obligated the first verse the first the verse that followed it so Quran my Quran Bonanza mean I Atene I wouldn't see her naughty beside him in hialeah whatever verse we abrogate or make you forget we will replace it with something similar or better then we have the plan abrogating the cinder and in this what was the sooner the sooner was when the people were in Mecca and the mandatory prayers were made mandatory to them they used to face Jerusalem which was to the north and when aggressive Allah it was easy for them because if they fished north and this was the Kaaba and this was Jerusalem they were faced facing both they had no problem when they move to Medina this was a problem because if they faced Jerusalem this means that they give their back to the Kaaba to Makkah but this is what the ruling so allah azzawajal obligated this ruling of facing Jerusalem with the verse of the Quran that you see which is Piniella Lou Bava chica pis'ma fenelon well en- identical peloton baha for Willie whoa Chaka Chaka Lama su dilhara this obligated abrogated what what is the Sunnah facing message laksa so this Quran obligated the sooner because we don't have a ruling in the Quran saying face Jerusalem illumise's laksa it's only the Quran the sooner that the Prophet instructed them so I I hope this is clear there are lots of evidence is but there is not enough time to go through them this scholars have an argument saying the sooner obligating the Quran how is this because Allah says man and salmon I Athene out uncia native a demeanor whenever we obligate a verse or make you forget we will replace it with something that is better so is the sooner better then the Quran some scholars said no the Ferraris muta water this one is not Quran is Karim Allah the Sangha is not it's an inspiration it might be 250 maybe that opv and they have a dispute on this but the most authentic opinion is that the sooner does abrogate the Quran as long as it is authentic pen the evidence is that when our Allah Allah says it's prescribe you see como la who theological Linda carry me through how will unveil me and ayah of inheritance this was aggregated because in it it a la sol gel is talking about the bequest which is nausea and with the will show in this allah says states that it's okay to have our senior and to write it to a diverse I've coated first"
