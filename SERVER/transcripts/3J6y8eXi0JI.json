  "title": "Why do people insist music is not haram when there are hadiths proving it? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Jan uh yeah I just wanted to ask um why do so many people like to insist that music is not Haram when there is a Hadith that states that uh instruments are Haram like because music is beautiful music is fun music fills you with happiness and it changes your mood when you're sad and you listen to cheerful music it flips your mood and when you're cheerful and you listen to love songs it makes you depressed it manipulates you this is why they cannot swallow the fact that this is Haram that it is addictive addictive and that it transforms people and makes them do things that are not logical why would people so many people insist on smoking why many women insist on exposing their body parts and showing off their uh when there are so many verses of the Quran and vers Hadith of the Prophet it is following your whims and desires each one of us has his own demons and they that is the demons control us and maneuver us and those who say that music is not Haram they're not known to be people of knowledge and those who are known to be people of knowledge are definitely followers of Satan I've been to countries in Southeast Asia where their diis their scholars attend music festivals and they sit in in in in Gatherings and a musician comes and plays the guitar and the Sheikh is going right and left what is this and they say that well there's nothing to support that music's Haram Subhan Allah no Quran verses no authentic in and elsewhere no agreement and consensus of the four schools of thought is fine with them yeah yeah because I've read a scholar of XYZ in Tasmania or somewhere I don't know uh he said that it is Mak who's the scholar um I don't know I think his name is XY Z I don't know but he said it's Mak so I'm following this and all these great Scholars and Companions and the Sal who said it's Haram you're not buying it it's following whims and desires may Allah protect us"
