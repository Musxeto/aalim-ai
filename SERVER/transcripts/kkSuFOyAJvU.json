  "transcript": "says what's the ruling on defensive jihad we know that jihad is divided into two types defensive and offensive the offensive jihad is not applicable at the moment it requires the strength and the power of the muslim ummah defense of jihad is when someone attacks you so you defend yourself nobody says just stay there and let them slaughter you like sheep no you have to defend yourself but there is a limit when defensive jihad is illogical in the sense that there is a hundred of us and a thousand of them we don't have to fight what to do run but don't fight in order to get killed because this would annihilate islam in that area listen to these two verses from the quran in chapter 8 verse 65 and verse 66 allah says in suratul and o profit motivate the believers to fight if there are 20 steadfast among you they will overcome two hundreds and if there are 100 of you they will overcome one thousand what is that issue one to ten so in the beginning this was the ratio you are a hundred and there are a thousand you cannot run away fight till the death allah says in the following ayah now allah has lightened your burden for he knows that there is weakness in you so if there are a hundred steadfast among you they will overcome two hundreds and if there are and if there be one thousand they will overcome two thousands so the ratio is one to two and you cannot run away you have to fight and remain steadfast till the death so when we come to a region and all those who fight are maybe 200 500 a thousand and the enemy army is a hundred thousand and they have tanks they have guns they have cannons they have the whole nine yards the air force is with them and you have nothing but stones or ak-47 with a number of rounds only or a handgun this is definitely not the right time to fight because you are fighting a lost battle and that army would loot and kill and rape freely in that village or that country or that region of yours because there is a legitimate reason for him to do so fighting insurgents fighting the rebels trying to allocate them so i hope this answers your question"
