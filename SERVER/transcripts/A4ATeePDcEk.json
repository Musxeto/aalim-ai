  "transcript": "assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh it is unfortunate that the AC is not working it seems that every lecture every course has a specific taste to it mine has a taste and a smell so we pray to Allah Allah that it makes it a pleasant smell for those who shall Allah of us so this course is about the introduction to felt and usually this course is a full two days course eight hours eight hours but the time is limited and the lecturer or the one who's presenting it is also limited in knowledge so we try to minimize it as much as possible but inshallah I'm waiting for so you can open your notes please in in few seconds short and long we will be on our way please the definition and scope now if we would like can I continue if you'd like to define in Arabic language there is a definition in Sharia in general there is a definition and to be technical there is another definition in Islam usually you have two definitions linguistic and technical so in fact any book of fact will open you go to the chapter dealing with salat it says salat linguistically what does it mean dora salat in Arabic linguistically means duaa but technically it is specific narrations and actions beginning with takbir concluded with Salam for the sake of Allah this is a technical definition so everything in Islam usually has these two definitions linguistic and technical when you come to flip you find that phil has three types of definitions in a sword the linguistic is understanding comprehension allah as allah says in the quran women shake it illa yusabbihu bihamdihi lot of power let us be happy that everything on earth praises Allah Azza WA JAL glorifies Allah Azza WA JAL but you do not what you have to continue because I have to make sure that you're not sleeping mrs. Phil it's very rigid and tough if you don't understand it it's not like storytelling Rama did this and then I'm the LA did that and they Danny had a fight no it's something that you have to be very quick and you put your effort to it so again Allah says as though as yet everything and there is not a thing except that it exalts Allah by his praise but you do not understand well I can let of a whole so everything praises Allah glorifies Allah even this desk even the ants even the fish they praise Allah but we cannot compete not it not here we cannot comprehend this is what we're talking about the linguistic meaning of comprehension of Allah says family a family holiday opa-locka dunya ahora hadith and drop yes hoon so what is the matter with those people that they can hardly understand any statement now the second type of definition of FEHB is the general Sharia type what do you mean by general Sharia type when the Quran was revealed the Arabs in the hadith when the Prophet referred to fill it meant the knowledge of the deed Allah says azza wajal for there should separate from every division of them the believers a group remaining to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people so this isn't sort of the Toba Allah Allah says in the Quran Leah toughie ahoo fifteen to gainful indeed to gain 15 is it the one we're talking about technical no this is the general understanding Allah say at the alehissalaam Donna Mae Yuri dealer who be here hi Alan what you off it Dean whomever Allah Azza WA JAL intense good for him Allah would give him the understanding of Dean what do you mean understanding of demon scholars say meaning that the selling of tafseer understanding of hadith understanding of understanding of the most important knowledge of our science of Australia of all which is the most important branch of indeed no heat this is the most important so this is what the shed he our definition of linguistics understanding Sharia definition is a comprehensive of all the religion anything related to religion we use fill with and this is why Imam Abu Hanifah he compiled the book it's called alpha and aqua grant cup and if you look into it it's only about repeater so his understanding of was that relates to the most important thing in religion in the sciences of religion talk now we come to the technical part which deals with what we are doing at the moment what is fit I'd like to become a student of knowledge okay you have to study from what is define it for me scholar safe up is the knowledge of the practical legal rulings pertaining to actions which are derived from detailed Evans evidences now this definition the jurors scientists of pepper and acid alpha and also the tough seed and masala had hadith when they give a definition the definition is so tight that each word is used for a specific meaning so when they say knowledge of the practical legal rule meaning that rulings on tafseer rulings on rápida is not included so let's go to the issue of understanding linguistic if I say I'd like to use the word fib when we referring to understanding how the mobile phone works this is the mystic Sharia are related or technical huh technical knows nothing see now you did not understand the meaning of technical yet my mistake my fault I don't have coffee so I'm still Danny but we will get to that let me finish the technical definition then I will start to ask you questions insha'Allah knowledge this is a technical definition it is not technical per se as into mechanics or electronics its technical in the sharira sense related to the science of trip what is the meaning definition knowledge of the practical legal rulings so my belief in Jenna and not and hell this is technical no this is Sharia related because it's not pertaining to practical legal understanding how my car works this is technical no this is linguistic because understanding of something wordly but when it comes to something that is Islamically technical knowing how to perform moodle this is considered to be technical but the project is of practical legal rulings pertaining to actions and not to athena which are derived from the detailed evidences what detailed evidences we are referring to or and soon each man consensus of scholars chaos technology these are the evidences so by this understanding we go into a quick refreshing questions knowledge of which medicine I should take to my high blood pressure this is linguistics to understand to have this is linguistic sherry are related or technical this is linguistic okay knowing when to offer to tsutsumu this is linguistic sherry are related and technical why is it linguistic because you have to understand why is it shaggy are related because of its Islam it's about Dee why is it technical because it is about the detailed and practical legal rulings so you cascade this to everything and you will find it is shahrullah easy to understand or we find this or any questions so some rulings effect you have the three definitions for example the description of eclipses prayer to understand and to have fifth in it it has to be linguistic what is the definition of eclipse I don't know so I explained it to you is that when the Sun comes in between the moon and Earth okay now I understand and what is the Sharia ruling Allah it is part of the deal because the Prophet and son did it and this is part of our sunnah and the technical part will the profit rate at once a day his salat wa salam the format is to occur in one regard to such that in one rocket so it's two raka units with four Recor and four salute this is the technical part when I come to explain it to you now the scope is the description and this is the scope of it and we've gone through this so what is the virtues of studying fill in your handouts the virtues there are general virtues of Sharia knowledge and there are special virtues of knowledge so in general when you come to Islamic Sciences you will find that whatever we know is not something that we have gained by ourselves and this is a common mistake we always do we always refer our successes to our own ability so last year I managed to bring profit to my company of two million dollars and I managed to minimize cost and expenses and I managed to secure few contracts this is all type of minor Sheikh because a my tributing almost favors to my own knowledge and ability it is not me everything that happens is from Allah Allah Allah says in the Quran and Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing when you when we came out to this world we had no knowledge and he gave you hearing sight and hearts that you might give thanks to Allah the importance and the virtue of knowledge in Sharia in general uplifts you Allah says Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge knowledge lifts you in this life and definitely in the hereafter if you have sincerity but in this life even if you don't have sincerity like me it will uplift you everybody respects you everybody says the share everybody when you come they give you preference sit in the front do this that I'm happy but if I added sincerity to that on the day of judgment you will find this being elevated in Jannah in sha Allah and if you read that or I from cover to cover you will never find Allah ordering his messenger alayhi salatu salam to ask for increasing in something except in in knowledge Allah does not tell his prophet alayhi salatu salam ask for increasing in your wealth in your health in your offspring no Allah only says Subhanahu WA Ta'ala walk or rugby Z Dini riddle men and say my lord increase me in knowledge so the more knowledge you have the more fulfillment of your role as a Muslim because you will illuminate you will give light to everyone no matter where you sit in a lecture room like this you see someone drinking with his left of he drink with your right please drinking with the left is haram knowledge whatever you see something wrong you corrected whatever you see something good you praise it and you encourage people to do it and those who know our favorite to allah azza wajal allah says say are those who know equal to those who know not and there are so many other evidences but we will not go through them all this is the general virtues of Sharia knowledge now knowledge itself is divided into two types so when you hear that the people who know the people who do not know or an alliance meeting knowledge one would think okay why do you insist that this knowledge has to be Sharia related why not being a PhD in physics or a dentist or even a vet Iranian a veterinarian event this is knowledge it's in no wait knowledge is divided into two types surely related and none shall be related the surely related is whatever Allah mentions in the Quran and the Sunnah whatever you find that Allah is praising those who know this is related to Sharia so to the sciences that we will come to talk about the none cheri the none Islamic not meaning that it is covered or that it is sinful the none is level that is not related or answer hadith etc this is divided into two types one type which is good if you're sincere and you have good intention Allah will reward you for that so if you have a good intention and you study medicine that's good if you study engineering if you study physics mathematics you have a good intention for Islam and the Muslims masha'Allah you're doing a good job but if you are not having that pure intention it's hella why are you studying medicine well let it it pays good to be a doctor you'll become rich that's good for you but you will not be rewarded for it now the other branch of the Islamic knowledge which is the Haram knowledge this is sinful so someone says I'd like to go to Music Academy and learn four years of acoustic guitar haha haha is it knowledge is knowledge one says I'd like to study astrology and the effect and impact of stars on our lives and destiny this is also knowledge but it is haram knowledge etc and this is why when you read in Coran you would find the knowledge that Allah praises most is the Islamic knowledge Allah says it is only those who have knowledge among his slaves that fear Allah it is only those who have knowledge that would fear Allah Azza WA JAL so a doctor a physician a mathematician may not fear Allah so this is not going to help him but a Muslim who has knowledge in the Quran and Sunnah and feels Allah then this is the thing that to be praised them and the Prophet said alehissalaam was termed whoever Allah in Ted intense good for him he will grant him what the comprehension in religion this is the Sharia the whole package not the specific so if you want to go to the best use of this special virtues of faith and knowledge what can we say the door you're studying here is related to fab but in general the back of the Sharia is very important but how important is it when we go to the technical part how important is knowledge in fact technically speaking it is the most or one of the most relevant to our lives because for example if you would like to study most powerful hadith the technical science that deals with the hadith is it connected is it multiple movement for more we would like to know the definition of methane the definition of a sanad we would like to know when it is weak when it is fabricated when it is authentic hasson sorry etc I could give it to you in less than one day the whole package it's very easy but it is not the essential if I'd like to give you the fundamentals of tough seal also looked have seen before you go to have see you have to learn all the fundamentals of it if it like to give you a solid strap this might take two to three days but again these are all auxiliary sciences not part of the mainstream sciences and animal asleep as they call it but when you come to fill can I give it to you in a week no you can I give it to you in a month no can I give it to you in a year maybe I'm talking about daily doses of why the importance and the virtue of the fact we would like to study is that it is the science that tells you the difference between hell and harem in every aspect of your life so without you cannot know whether the forms of worship I am offering is valid or invalid so you may pray for 10 years and you come and say  I've been praying like this is it all your prayers are invalid oh stop foolin why you have the template is there in your praying to the other direction and one of the conditions of the validity of your prayer is the value problem yeah but I didn't think it was okay all eyes everywhere a spa meter what do you mean unless every way yeah yeah you know what I mean yeah yeah if I pray here and there Allah no this is pertaining related to fit you have zero fit your remedy is invalid okay what about my transactions I went to the vault shop yesterday and I gave him a deposit so that I can buy a bracelet of gold for my daughter and I'll pick it up tomorrow Arriba whoo yeah she I just give them twenty percent of the amount I did not borrow or in this is liebe buying gold you have to be simultaneous give-and-take yes but I gave him 20% tomorrow I'm gonna pick it up and give him the rest Reba this is Feb so even your transactions occasion I married a woman tough luck I married a woman we met in University we fell in love so I said to her I marry you for the sake of Allah she said I give you myself for the sake of Allah Allah is our witness al hamdulillah but this is Xena yeah sure so I'm a practicing Muslim my beard reaches my belly if I bend a little bit so what what do you mean when my wife's beard is even longer so what what do you mean this is invalid without knowledge you will fall into sins into what kind of knowledge knowledge in fact so many people my father died ok mama has mercy on him we did not divide the inheritance so we thought that I'll keep it for 5 10 years I'll invest it and then I'll give it to my stepmother and then I give it to my graph it's Haram some say no we are all equal in it so we had five girls three boys one mother one grandson two cousins three siblings we divide it equal how I didn't know what to do share because you did not have knowledge so all of these things but is related to your life and it's not something that comes once in a blue moon I swore not to eat biryani in my friend's house when I came I smelt the Brianna who's very good I want to eat what to do expiate what how to experience you have to have faith you have to know how to do Roma you have to know how to fast when to break your fast when to make up if you broke your first wrongly and when not to make up all of this comes from what this great knowledge of fact that we need so what is the ruling on learning it as stated before learning it if we're talking about and we were talking about things related to the jurisprudence can be mandatory and it can be what a communal obligation in Arabic we call it found kiss Iowa what is obligation meaning that each and every one of you is obliged to learn so the knowledge in prayer how to perform prayer what is this it is compulsory it is about each individual obligation no one would say yes yes Jim I'm not included you guys learn how to pray I'm not why it's not now I just want to finish my course in fine and then I'll learn how to pray no this is an individual obligation each and every one must know how to pray you have no excuse it not knowing how to pray or in not learning the things that break your fast well as I thought only water broke my fast orange juice for Kula washer abu allah says drink I thought was mortar this is an obligation for you to learn every single Muslim in Siberia in Amazon de la amazon.com Amazon hey you have to learn this you have to know it okay there are communion obligation meaning that if I know it is sufficient all of you don't have to know it but if none of us know it we're all what we're all sinful we are going to be punished for us for that it's I'm talking about knowledge so now if I ask you distribution of inheritance obligation individual or communion now communion huh okay because not of every one of us is obliged to distribute now once once a person dies is not even obligated upon me I have to go and seek a scholar who knows but if no scholar at all knows they're all sinful likewise if someone dies are we all obliged to wash that person shroud him and bury him one person does it if I forego Elkie fire likewise in hatch is it an obligation no no it's not an individual obligation wide it's an individual obligation of the person who is going to perform Hajj who has money and who is healthy a person who's not going this year or next year or the year after and he said no hey give me the explanation of a fraud Quran and come a turn I don't know so you're sinful no he's nothing but when it comes to fasting when it comes to prayer he has to do it then it becomes so I hope this is understood each other although I think we're gonna finish the course in by now does that come lucky I think half an hour and so now we would like to know the stages of pepper because we have an unfortunate error in our learning system we'll all sue the some knowledge correct but we have students of knowledge that began from kg1 and end up and PhD but they're also all considered to be what students of knowledge our deficiency is in knowing the structure of our knowledge so each one that says ok what's the ruling on this it's Haram why because imam abu hanifa city's Haman who's even Eva Eva and me are the same what what is his evidence what what are you talking about so people because of their ignorance tend to put themselves in a level way higher than their pay grade so they should supposed to be janitors but they think that they're the CEOs so we would like to know the classification and the stages of learning of how did it develop so I'm not going to go into salat see ya Hajj no this is a detailed course that needs much much more time this is an intro to fit which means that you're supposed to after finishing this two-day course that you have a bigger understanding and value to fit and to our scholars now if I ask you about the scholars you may give me one or two names and they are contemporaries but if I tell you to go back in time probably you would not be able to do this and this is wrong in all of us so there are different types and classifications of the stages of how it developed to our understanding we'll choose one that is very yummy simple for us to understand and this classification of four stages stage number one legislation stage and this ended on which year year 11 of Hydra what commemorates that year 11 the Prophet died in the tents of hero huh so what is 11 Abubakar I participated hello are you with us okay so what do you think guys what is what happened in the 11th hit of your students of knowledge you should know the quran was compiled no close all of you are close Jim I'm stalling for time so I'm just we see time when did the Prophet die no the Prophet that is awesome died in the 11th eve of a job in repair oh well on the 12th when was hatchet avada how can I get daddy if he J is the last month he Allah will he died but then he came for her this is one of the common mistakes people have is their ignorance of the seer so when we talk about Syria and say ok that's what mucked up when did it happen smooth did it happen I thought it was next year 2020 you don't know okay well who participated with the prophet invested mortiser sir I don't know we're in the fact come on give us a break this is fat not serie not history my point is that this is our heritage by the way motor the Prophet did not participate he did not go only been three sahabas who died Jennifer maybe Pan Am's Aidan - and abdullah abdullah muhammad ali jinnah so you have to know this in order to be a real student of knowledge it's not just a crash course of three hours and you go and some of you don't maybe have lunch here lecture had you out of said the others can fast but if you have to pass a Saturday you must fast Friday before it all Sunday this is v again so coming to 11th year the stage of legislation is over why because no one can legislate after the piranhas sooner this is a well-known fact stage two it is the priest cause of thoughts stage and this was up till the Year 100 what do you mean by pre schools of any pre schools of Abu Hanifa Malik Shah theory and Ahmed so from 11 to almost 100 who was there Sahaba and a tambourine it is a very crucial stage of three the stage of the schools of thought and its extensions what do you mean by its extensions common a common mistake among people that they think that the four schools of thought the school of Imam Abu Hanifa Maliki Mohammed Amin increases sharply and Imam Ahmed Mohamed in Hamburg that it related and depended only on them and this is wrong all fools of schools of thought had a great army of scholars that backed the school of thought and built it so it's not only about anything it is not only shattering it is the students and the students of the students and this extends up till year 1300 1300 of Hydra then we have what the present stage where we have great scholars like imam hassan I don't know why you guys come but who cares I'm having fun so these are the four schools this is too slow we go for this of thought now the Islamic legislation began soon after the prophethood prophet-hood of the progress of salaam and continued till his death the future of these of this stage are illustrated by the following chart the legislation of Islam began from year 13 before his Rock and ended at 11 lemon field of Hydra so the period it was divided into two periods what McKee and Medina how long was it in Makkah 13 years how long was it in Medina 10 years so what are the features of the Mucky period the Mudkip II imagined that the Providence for 13 years administration how long do the break they have to please I just want to know so that I can exactly know where to stop huh 10:45 so we have good 16 minutes of drama so the Maki period if you focus on the serum you'll find that they did not pray five prayers a day this was legislated at the very end after the death of mother Khadijah when the Prophet Elisha had the it's lowered marriage the glorious night I think the code of the miraculous night the Night Journey and fasting no fasting zakat no Sokka Hajj no Hajj what did they do 13 years the focus was on what well what what do you mean by fundamentals of the team though he did Jenna nah angels the books which we as Muslims fail to acknowledge when we call people to Islam we call non Muslims Islam gold for many Elana women must cover their faces music which have a very important and that's it but who is saying hello Karen I don't know who am i worshipping Allah what do I know about a lot nothing what field do I have in my heart oh Allah very little what hope do I have I'm hoping that Allah gives me erase what trust do I have in Allah none only the doctor can kill my child okay did you make Dora did you make repair no no the doctor has the medication what should I do Duren rupiah pork these fundamentals of Islam we have zero of this is why you'll find a practising brother working in a river based bank you will find a practising sister wearing the hijab participating in Asia has talent Got Talent or whatever or in the voice and she's waking up masha'Allah using a voice system Islamic what is this because they don't have the proper occasion but when you have proper attire that is theoretical not practical you'll find people speaking nicely but when it comes to implementation you have zero so in matka 13 years the prophetess I'm spent building people these people the Muhajiroun they were the cornerstone whenever calamities took place they had his back of course allah azzawajal ordered him to do this and no one has your back except allah but this is something we all understand they are means of protection of the Prophet I am and of the Deen and then the one who spread the diamond so he focused on such fundamentals but there were rules little little by little of halal Haman and when he migrated to Medina now it was safer now it was time to establish to establish the government the society the community so started pouring the legislations the rulings halal Haram how to do this how to do that and people started gaining more and more and more knowledge so was the fundamentals neglected no it continued but not in the same pace because the foundation was laid in the 13 years of Makkah billion if you study that have sealed solute of seed or raloo beforehand you will find that there's a big chapter in the beginning talking about the difference between Mecca revelations and Metheny revelations like a master a dune fast-tempo am a 7 1 towards one to it but it is coming like lightning very strong with it shakes you will you go to madinah its ignore relax longer verses more of communicating to you the rulings the longest verse of the Quran in surah al-baqarah it's a whole page rulings I hated aim of the debt different when you come to a para bismillah pickle area holla holla holla Allah Allah Allah Karim Allah a nice animal any animal even the Muslims when they hear the Quran the the McKean period revelation has impact they don't understand this is this is too strong it's coming straight to penetrate your heart when you come to Matheny surahs yeah you holla Dena I'm I know you find it more relaxed you find more easy to go through fight in the times of the legislation stage what were the sources of legislation to Iran and soon them now do we say also there was consensus no because the reference was then the Prophet you gods you can say the consensus at the time of the Prophet was so ensured the legislation is only taken from the Prophet Allah muscle Lewis aluminum pipe what are the features that first of all this stage of legislation we said we have how many stages or four huh one is the legislation stage what are the features of this period one the legislation is confined to this stage no one can come nowadays what actually they can but they are not right nowadays we have modern scholars who come and change the religion this idea this was at the time of the Prophet s son but now this is inapplicable now we have much also the Sharia and they use big words and isn't the word of my part of the Sharia which is something recent it's not something from the old old scholars of the tambourine or even as to have a dog it's easy and it has some sense to it but not to the extent that it is used today now so-called modern scholars change the Koran change the Sunna by saying that well yes at the time of the Prophet it was okay but now a less thought son now we cannot also the Sharia dictates that we have to change nothing but the Quran and so thus we have to change it so they're abusing it and this is why it is always essential to go back to the basics always when you have any dispute in a company that is well structured you go back to the policy and procedures if you go to the HR Director or to the CEO they will make up policies said okay sign that you want me to do this so that in the future if any legal claims were up your signature would protect me is it not on that side you do what I tell you to do so no as long as it goes against the policy of the procedure I would not our policy and procedure is what Quran and Sunna Allah says in chapter 5 so that the main Alma metal Lacombe Dina Cutrone today I have completed your religion well at mum to a day come here Maggie and I've perfected your my blessings and favor upon you what a little accomplice never Dean and accepted Islam to be your religion so this was what at the time of the Prophet on Islam so what was not a religion then cannot be a religion today it cannot change the religion is as it is until the day of judgment no changes there might be some new issues that were not covered this is for the scholars to come up with a verdict but not too well I at the time of the Prophet erase a lot of said I'm drinking wine was Haram wine because people got drunk and they went and did Haram things and fornicated and killed and stole nowadays in Kampala we have locks so if I lock myself in and hide the keys and get wasted okay my part of the Sharia or someone goes to a new level it says wine is haram whiskey's not because wine has to be from grapes from fruit but if you do gin and tonic and vodka tequila and rum and all of this data so they said it's not what was mentioned the Quran so this is inapplicable because our religion is fixed it's very easy it's for the layman to know and this is why we're here to know exactly how to reach such verdicts and how did they reach it number two difference in opinion almost did not exist at the time of this period why because there was the Prophet aresome if you and I disputed we will not go to him and sharply mammography mm no we have the Prophet o prophet of Allah we did visit what do you say said yes or no why did we say almost because there was a difference of opinion but usually it was solved immediately by going to the Prophet Elisha watterson the easiest example the Prophet said allah so salam usually an atom in whom Allah Allah Allah FIBA new for Allah this was stated in would shield which incident album manage which battle which religion come on this was said in less what Al an exam ok any other name for Reza condom at the very end when they all went home there was the Muslims left with the Jews of money for Allah so the Prophet told the man is awesome la sala allah adam in common also none of you should pray ah sir except in Venezuela so they immediately marched in the middle of the way the Sun was about to set people said the Prophet said don't pray but Allah tells us to pray I said before the time is over half of the people prayed they said no no the Prophet meant that we should do our best to reach there early the other half said no he is the one who legislates so he tells us that we have an extra sixth prayer or tenth prayer no problem he tells us the five we cancelled it for today and we have one prayer he's the one who's telling us what Allah wants from us so they did not pray when they reached by the Cueva they went to the Prophet ISA they prayed defying your order and we did and they said they didn't pray until the sunset sun's whatever sad whatever whenever it went down so it was a difference of opinion what did the Prophet to is concerned no they cannot be both right definitely they cannot be both right one is right but because the one who was not right did their effort in reaching this conclusion they were both rewarded one two rewards and the wrong one one reward so there was no point in pointing fingers but when we analyzed it know who was right now I'm afraid because this is something fixed in the Quran it was not abrogated so they did right but the one who did it also well any rewarded for their effort done number three the legislation featured in this period that it was in steps so everybody used to drink in arabian allah azzawajal prohibited drinking all of a sudden no it was on three stages one they ask you about intoxicants and gambling say there is allah there is benefit in it and there is also a lot of sin and the sin outweighs the benefit by getting halal Haram you asked me I told you it's there is this and there is that so still some of them used to continue to drink because Allah did not say it's Haram second stage o you who believe do not approach prayer while intoxicated until you understand what you say so now the time of being wasted and drunk is limited from Asia to fagio that's the longest time if you want to drink after Maghrib is one hour door it's not enough to sober if you want to drink this only from Russia to Belgium so vast majority did not drink but they still wear those who used to drink and some of them were social drinkers so they come after mother between Marylebone Asia they drink little not intoxicated just a little bit this is coffee by the way it's black like my heart third-stage Allah says I saw a genuine Surat al-ma'idah in amman tomorrow L Mesa well on Shabbos la región Sun minimal shape and fudge steady boo the flame the word first any boo stay away from it some of the people who use their logic nowadays say Alma did not say do not drink he said stay away from it what do you mean so if we have a straw let's talk you crazy would Allah as though you tells you to refrain and stay away meaning not even if someone drinks it in the room you cannot stay in it not that you keep physical distance between you and Ed but some people are so crooked in their understanding Janna for example the parents in surah the extra chapter xvii when Allah says Isaiah gel falafel da Booma what oof do not say to your parents what oof oh this is my father says go and get the groceries from the car Allah says don't say this because it shows your frustration so someone reads the ISS and hamdulillah I can swear at my father I can spank my mother what do you mean she almost said don't say we did not say don't hit them what kind of understanding people this person does not have any of the three definitions of understanding of film neither the linguistic nor the Sharia related nor the technical this guy is an imbecile and a lot of the Muslims are a manifestation of ignorance today when they come like this and they decide that they are their own doctor finally so legislation was step by step nowadays if I see and Muslim and he wants to accept Islam shall I use this three stages with him no this was only at the time of the legislation period or stage at the time of the Prophet a son nowadays I don't say okay a fee of doing heroin no do cocaine and after three months you do marijuana and after six years we will talk about it he Sean no you have to stop palace refrain finally one of the features of this stage that it was a training course to the companions so the Prophet Isis Salam used to train his companions and ask them to give verdicts and teach them and this is why he when he sent more either manageable to Yemen they said okay all right now you're a judge what will you do he said I will look for problems in the book of Allah if not said I will look for solutions in the Sunna of the Prophet I sir if not he said I will implement my intellect and try to work problems out to find the solution the Prophet was happy and said alhamdulillah who guided the messenger of The Messenger of Allah to the truth so he's teaching them whenever they do something right he acknowledges but if someone made something wrong it wait this was wrong why did he do this may Allah forgive you so he teaches them and this is why it was like a training course for the Companions to learn the religion and to learn how to implement it"
