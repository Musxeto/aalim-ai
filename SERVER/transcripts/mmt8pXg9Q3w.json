  "transcript": "he says is it permissible for me as a software engineer to design a software for an investment company but this investment company actually provides services and investments that are based on haram the answer is no you would be collaborating with them on evil and on riba because when a investor gives a fixed amount of money so you give me ten thousand dollars and i'll give you every single month a hundred dollars this is riba because the hundred is an interest and the loan is the ten thousand dollars likewise if i claim that i'm giving you a percentage that is fixed from the capital not from the profit so the ten thousand dollars i'll give you 10 profit every month okay the profit the percentage is on the profit that is generated from the ten thousand dollars he says no the the percentage is on the capital itself which is a fixed 100 dollars this this is reba again and it is not permissible"
