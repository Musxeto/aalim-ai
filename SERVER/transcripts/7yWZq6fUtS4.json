  "transcript": "Shan from Sri Lanka was asking what's the difference between kufur and shik and we know that Allah mentioned in two verses of Surah Ana chapter 4 that he forgives everything to whom he wishes except shik so does this mean that kufur can also be forgiven the answer is no see shik and kufur are interl every C every mush is a cafir but not every cafir is a mush a mushrik is someone who Associates other others with Allah so he worships he acknowledges the existence of Allah and he worships Allah and someone else Idols people in their graves aah so he's a mush a cafir is a mush but he can be even worse when he says that he's an atheist or a pagan or no not a pagan he's an atheist or someone who does not believe in the existence of Allah so he's worse than a mushrik because a musri says I acknowledge Allah exists but this one says I don't acknowledge that Allah exists at all so the big umbrella is kufur underneath it you would find someone who does not believe in the existence of Allah you would find someone who's associating others with Allah you would find Hypocrites who claim to be Muslims but inside they plot to destroy Islam and to attack the Muslims so definitely a cafir a disbeliever anyone who does not believe in Islam is worse than a mushrik and he would not be forgiven and Allah AEL Knows Best"
