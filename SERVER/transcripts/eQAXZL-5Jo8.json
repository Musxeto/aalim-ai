  "transcript": "smell of Minerva he and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi woman today be Hadiya weston nabeshin that he Diomedes Emma Bardot dear brothers and sisters in Islam as-salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato one of the wives of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam one of the mother of the believers was an honourable woman from a respected family from Quraysh she was the cousin of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which clearly indicates to muslims that there is no prohibition none whatsoever even there is no kuraha or it being disliked in islam for a person to marry his cousin as the people in the West may consider it as incest in Islam this is totally normal the Prophet married his cousin the Prophet gave his eldest daughter Zainab to her cousin and he gave his own youngest daughter Fatima to his cousin Ali bin Abi Talib this was normal and totally permissible and Muslims disregard what the medical professionals may say there might be case but this is not the norm and when having trust in allah azzawajal and following the Quran and the Sunnah and what Allah has made permissible we cannot come to medicine psy medical science and simply scratch out what Islam says so if medical sciences come and say copying is harmful it can be infecting with diseases it does this it does that we say hold your horses you have no right to speak about something that is proven in the authentic Sunnah which the Prophet had done erase awesome not only that he instructed and recommended us to do it so we have to draw the line where we tell Medical Sciences to stop if things interfere with our Islamic practices we simply tell them stop and know your limits what is proven in the Quran and the Sunnah even if the whole world including the w-h-o say that it is wrong we don't with all due respect care because we have our Quran in the Sunnah that prevail over all so the Prophet married his cousin this honorable woman her name was zaynab bint josh Bindra Bob Guiney immoral SD her mother was Omaima bent Abdul Muttalib in Hashem the aunt of the Prophet Allison the paternal aunt her marriage has a long story to it and this is what she's remembered for mostly if we go back in time when the Prophet Alice awesome was married to mother Khadijah her nephew Hakim of Nizam gave her a slave boy and this slave boy was abducted somewhere in Arabia and sold as a slave otherwise he's a free boy from a free family and from the Arabs so she noticed that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam who did not have a son of his own as we know his sons all died at a very very early age and he only had daughters when she noticed that the Prophet Allah salatu salam took good care of him she gave it to him as a gift the Prophet Allah so Allah accepted that gift and he loved that boy as his own to the extent that he freed him from slavery and he was known among the people of Mecca as Zaid even o Muhammad so they considered the Prophet asked them to be his father through adoption and everybody knew that he was the son of Mohammed and he declared it alayhi salat WA Salam if I were to die he would inherit me in if he would to die I would inherit him and he was known they do maha-rathah to be the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as a son and his son osama bin zaid was also the love of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and that is also a different story for another time Zaidan Haditha grew to be a man so the Prophet Allah salatu salam wanted to get him married so he selected his own cousin Ali his salat WA Salam and it was well known at the time that there was this caste system which Islam came to abolish and to remove there's no racism there is no caste system in Islam and what would be best to practically prove that to the people than to marry a free slave to an honorable woman from Russia so the prophet Hollis asaram has some narrations say went to proposed to zina zeyneb accepted thinking that he was proposing to her himself but then he corrected her understanding and said no I'd like you to marry Zeb no Haritha and she was shocked and refused how would a woman in my status marry a freed slave so the prophet alayhi salat wa salam insisted to abolish racism and the caste system in islam practically so she argued with the prophet alayhi salatu salam as they were arguing allah revealed in the quran it is not for a believing man or a believing woman when allah and his messenger have decided a matter that they should thereafter have any choice about their affair subhanAllah this ayah rarely you will find Muslims referring to it it is obvious Allah decided in the Quran the Prophet Allah saw some decided in the Sunnah yet we tend to have second thoughts we tend to argue yes but why this by why not that and make our own decisions which goes totally against this I the moment saying I've heard this ayah me Allah be pleased with her she submitted her will to Allah and she said as long as this is from Allah then I accepted so the Prophet Allison was happy with that and they both got married unfortunately they both tried to make it work but sometimes hopes and wishes don't materialize Zeynep could not live with the fact that her husband is a free slave well she is who she is and her parents are who they are so there was always this resentment this sort of disrespect not being content which to xate may Allah be pleased with him he's not a blind my a blind man he can see he can sense and feel so he wasn't happy in this marriage he used to always go to the Prophet Alice or some and complain about what he's suffering from seeking advice or actually seeking approval for divorce because life cannot go on in such circumstances however they did not know that Allah revealed to his messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam that he would marry Zeynep after him and that Dana would be the mother of the believers so the Prophet did not a less awesome tell him this did not expose this and he kept telling him fear Allah and keep her with you so keep your wife and fear Allah and he kept on repeating this over and over again now it was 'unless plan subhana wa ta'ala the planner of all planners to abolish not only racism and this the caste system but also to abolish adoption and this is why in the beginning of chapter 33 sewer that as ab allah azzawajal prohibited adoption where i take a son or a daughter give them my name make them Muharram to my relatives as if they are from my own offspring and giving them a share of inheritance all of this was abolished was totally prohibited and banned in verse and in chapter 33 by the way sorted as AB is a lot about this incident and a lot about Zeynep may Allah be pleased with her so he kept on telling him do not divorce her do not divorce her until he reached the level where he cannot tolerate it anymore and he divorced her allah azza wajal revealed an ayah mother aisha said if the Prophet Allah saw somewhere to conceal any ayah he would have concealed this ayah but he can't conceal anything because this is from Allah and if he were to conceal anything allah azza wajal would annihilate him what was this ayah Allah says in the Quran and remember o Muhammad when you said to the one whom Allah bestowed favor and you stole favor upon who's that it was eight whom Allah gave him the favor and blessing of marrying someone as such as Zeynep and had many multiple favors and blessings upon him so when Zaid allah says in the quran when Zaid had no longer any need for her we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons so going back to the ayah from the beginning the situation was xate divorced his wife now it's your obligation o muhammad to marry his wife but she is my daughter-in-law according to the pre islamic ideology of jahiliyya well this is what Allah al wants to abolish so Allah says and remember o Muhammad when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor upon keep your wife and fear Allah while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose and that is she becoming her wife and you fear the people while Allah has more right that you fear him why did the Prophet fear the people because he was afraid that it will tarnish his reputation when the idol worshippers would say that look at this man he married his own daughter-in-law but actually he did it because she's not his daughter-in-law and this is what Allah so JAL commanded us and proved to us in the Quran and then when Zaid had no longer any need for her and Zayde even know Haditha is the only come Panty and mentioned by name in the Quran so you won't find Abu Bakr Umar Uthman Ali Paul ha any of the companions at all only xate subhanAllah his name was mentioned in the Quran Allah says we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need for them and ever is the command of Allah accomplished so the moment the Prophet married alayhi salatu salams inna it was over the thought of adoption was gone and there was nothing as such in Islam a couple are interested in a boy or an a girl to adopt they can do that but it's not called adoption it called its called sponsorship so they take the child in the custody the child is called after his own family father and family name if we don't know who the family name or what the family name is we give him any name that is not related to us he grows up knowing that he is not our own child he's not our own flesh and blood and he would not inherit he would not be a Muharram to my own daughter biological daughter because they're not related and he's not related to my wife either unless she suckled him before he was 2 years of age and he there are a number of conditions and rules regarding and governing this issue but the main issue is no adoption as known in the West at the moment so once the Prophet married her Elayne salatu salam it was known to all people that adoption is no longer existing that he's not his adopted son anymore and that they would not inherit one another Xena may Allah be pleased with her was one of the finest women of her time in terms of religious commitment in terms of generosity doing favors to the people in terms of fearing allah azza wajal and this issue of fearing allah azzawajal by the way it's extremely needed in our times yes you might find someone who's practicing with a long beard like myself and looks righteous and pious short rope praising the message but actually he doesn't fear allah and you can judge that through his actions through his interaction with others and one of the scariest things we read in the sunnah that one of the four characteristics of hypocrisy and there are so many of them one of the characteristics of a hypocrite is when he is at dispute with another he transgresses and I've seen this two Muslims used to being good friends best of friends and for one reason or the other one wants to break the other and they start fighting and saying wrong things backbiting even lying and manipulating things I would have Allah this is a clear indication that they don't fear Allah zina did not have this may Allah be pleased with her and I'll give you an example one of her characteristics that she excels when it comes to be compared with other wives of the Prophet alisov Salaam is that Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet as of Salaam from seven heavens from above seven heavens and she always boasts about this to her co-wives by saying that your parents your Guardians got you married to your to the Prophet as salaam I was married to the Prophet Aslam bhai the instruction of Allah the command of allah through gibreel the ark angel without any witnesses without any guardian without any Mahad all of a sudden the Prophet barged in the house as she was cleaning the skin of animals and this is known as tanning so she used to tan with her own hands the skins and sell it and she used to stitch things and sell it and whatever she makes she gives to the poor and this was one of the things that made people praise her more than any other of the prophets wives at least a lot with Sam so she was tanning her skin of that ship and the Prophet barged in and she was startled in the beginning but when she knew that it was Allah who gave her in marriage she was very pleased and happy with it and this is why most likely the Prophet threw a feast and prepared food that is not the usual for his other wives where there was she there was meat and and and lots of good food and invited the companions to feast with him the hijab was revealed in that incident the ayahs in surat al-ahzab chapter 33 of not remaining in the prophet's house at assalam after the food is over chit-chatting because this annoys the Prophet was also revealed at the day when the Prophet as Salam called the companions to eat the Prophet Allah saw some himself praised her but they did not understand except after his death when they asked him who among your wives is the first to die after you and he said the one with the longest arm in the beginning as we mentioned before soda was the largest in size so she was the longest in arm so they thought that soda is the one but they soon understood the meaning of the hadith when zeyneb was the first one to die because the Prophet was referring metaphorically to the length of her arm in giving charity to the poor and among what she's praised for is the compliment of other co-wives which is different and difficult usually there is this rivalry between the co wives so each one is jealous from the other which may cause them to cross the line jealousy usually leads to crossing the line and if someone does not have support from Allah to fix their own shortcomings they fail the test because they don't have the fear of Allah Aisha says that Xena was sent to communicate with the Prophet Allah sir I'm on behalf of other wives because he used to favor Aisha and the people as we mentioned before used to send their gifts on her day so the other wives complained and said o prophet of Allah this is not fair let the people send their gifts randomly not to specify the day that you go to our issue because then we don't get anything they first sent Fatima they sent on Salameh and nothing changed and then Zeynep came herself in the presence of Aisha to argue with the Prophet that in salatu salam and that is a different story but listen to what I described Zeynep of which she came she said I never have never seen a woman so religious practicing and righteous she was the only one from the prophets wives and it's awesome who was competing with me over the heart of the Prophet I saw meaning that the Prophet loved Fatima loved Aisha as his favorite wife but he also loved Xena due to to her beauty due to her lineage due to her relationship to him and so many beautiful things in her she says I had never seen a woman better in religious practice than Xena not pious as zeyneb not truthful as Zeynep not connecting to her kinship as Zeynep and she was huge when it came to giving charity now when these complements come to you from your rival from someone who's supposed to be envious you should know what caliber zeyneb was not only that in Haditha - if that's a very long story where the hypocrites slandered mother aisha an accuser of committing adultery with so phenomenal mortal may allah be pleased with him and the revelation stopped for a month and it did not give the Prophet as some any hint whether she was innocent or guilty and the Prophet could not judge he believes that his wife is innocent he loves his wife immensely but this is a case that needs evidence because we have accusations so the Prophet did not know alayhi salatu salam three of the great companions of the Prophet RSS Saran slandered mother Aisha being affected by the gossiping of the hypocrites and they declared it the hypocrites did not they just whispered among themselves these three companions fell in the trap of the Shaitaan they were must our Heavenly Father the cousin of Abu Bakr they were has San open up a bit the prophets poet and there was or the third was Hamner been Josh the cousin of the Prophet Oh Sam and the sister of Zainab ajosh she fell in the trap of the Shaitaan and she said that she fornicated with that great companion the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did not know whether she was innocent or guilty he used to ask people for circumstantial evidences so he asked I live now batalov he asked Sam Abney's aid he asked the maid then he sent to Zainab in josh and he said to her and she is the co wife the rival of aisha and he said to her o zaynab what did she do or what have you seen that meg might be suspicious of her YCJA Zeynep said o prophet of allah i protect my saying my eyes and my hearing i know nothing except goodness about this woman yes upon allah even at times where you can score a point her fear of allah azzawajal prevents her nowadays when we see men dispute or women you can tell there is no fear of allah they don't see it you can judge it you can tell that these people don't fear allah azza wa jal and subhanAllah she kept on living with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a happy wife and a mother of the believers until the prophet alayhi salatu salam died when she died she stayed about nine years or ten after his death being the first of his wife wives to catch up with him at his salat wa sallam and she is his wife in Jannah during these years she did not change a bit she used to work with her own hands whatever she sells she collects and she feeds the poor and she gives to the needy she had no interest in this dunya and one year ah romanovna Hoppa may allah be pleased with him the Caliph the second caliph collected money from the treasure of the Muslims and he sent it to Zeynep in what it was a big pile of money sure so she saw it as a burden and she said may Allah forgive her mark why didn't he distribute the money himself to the nine wives of the Prophet a system instead of authorizing me to do so so the messenger said o mother this is not for the rest of the wives of the Prophet s asam this is only for you and she said oh subhanAllah this is mine so she asked them to put it on a big plate and she covered it with a dress and she started to tell her mate get your hand inside take a fistful and give it to the house of stone so take another fistful and give it to the house of so-and-so and she cupped shake she kept on distributing it to her relatives the poor of her relatives orphans those in-laws of hers and she divided it until only little amount of it was left and when they uplifted the dress to see how much was left they found 85 Durham's which is peanuts compared to what was there when she saw that amount of money she raised her hand and said o Allah let this year be my last so that I won't have to see next year's gifts from Omar and she died that same year she was 53 years of age our mother zeyneb been josh whom allah azzawajal gave her in marriage to the Prophet Isis I'm from above 7 heavens had the will of Adam when especially in Malaysia Aslam was allah wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he was holy Hanna being a Muhammad why the ADI he was so happy here to me assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu huraira radi aallahu anhu said that a man came to the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and said o messenger of allah poverty has struck me the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sent a messenger to one of his wives to bring something for that man to eat but she said by the one who sent you with the truth I only have water he sallallahu alayhi wasallam sent to another one of his wife's to bring something for the man to eat but she said the same until all of them said the same thing then Allah is missing just sallallahu alayhi wasallam said who will take this one as a guest in exchange for a loss mercy a man from the unser said I will o Messenger of Allah so he took the man to his home and said to his wife treat the guest of messenger of allah well she said by Allah we have nothing except the meal for my children he said get the food ready and light the lamp and put your children to sleep if they ask for dinner then when the guest enters dim the lamp and make it seem as if we are eating and when he reaches for the food to eat then stand up to the lantern and turn it off she got the food ready turned the lamp on and put the children to sleep she then went to the lamp as if she was fixing it and turned it off then they pretended as they were eating and they both went to sleep hungry in the morning the man from the on sovereign to allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who said Allah has loft implying his acceptance to the deed from your actions last night then allah revealed his saying which means and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that reported by Al Bukhari and Muslim assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back our first question is from a brother who says can we pray funeral prayer of a person who used to not pray during his lifetime this is a frequently asked question and this is an important question because it helps me show you the process of the thinking process of Allison l-jamaa now we have a hadith that clearly states that a person who does not praise a kafir when Alma Yoshiki a Wilco free taco salad probably by Muslim between man and shark or ko4 is abandoning salat Allah had already been in Albania whom ocelot the pledge that is between us Muslims and them his prayer fermenter akka have occurred kafir whoever abandons it he is a kafir now this hadith and many more evidences state that a person who does not praise a kafir - Ali Sunnah wal Jamaa this is known as alko for or hokum Belko free al Rahman it's a general terminology now the people of deviancy like Al hawa rich they would say ah okay who doesn't pray is a kafir Heidi doesn't pray my cousin so one plus one equals su he's a kafir and this is wrong because when the Prophet says may Allah curse those who deal in Reba I don't go to the bank and say to people working in Reba and loans and say may Allah curse you may Allah curse she may Allah curse you this is not what the prophet has her son said he said it in a general term but to have it specifically implemented on an individual no this is a different story we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled and make sure that the obstacles are removed before confirming that this person is a kafir and this is why this is known as theoretical takfeer which is a piece of information and knowledge but to implement it you need to have the practical tech field and therefore when a person dies now we know that he did not pray how did you know that I had never seen him pray in a Masjid he could have prayed home his wife said that he didn't pray maybe he prayed when she went to the bathroom or to the toilet or to the kitchen so you cannot judge a person as easy as that and get him out of the fold of Islam if he was not tried and convicted if a panel of judges did not speak to him and address him that what he's doing is a major sin and it takes him out of the fold of Islam and he was defiant and insisted not to pray if this did not happen and he died then the default is that he's a Muslim which means that he can be inherited which means that he can be preyed upon funeral prayer and we can ask Allah for forgiveness for him this is the practical way of doing it whether he is kafir or not this is in Allah's hands unless it was proven in a court of law that he was labeled as a kafir he is considered to be a Muslim and Allah knows best Jenna says Allah always accepts my duaa and I am very much thankful to him he always accepts all my jurors very quickly is it something I should be worrying about the answer is yes if so there's a condition if you are not abiding by the hijab if you are not observing your salat carefully and on time if you're not totally beautiful and obedient to your parents if you do not watch haram listen to her arm if you don't do these things and Allah answers your dua quickly this means that you're a good person and this is a gift from Allah but when you are not abiding by the hijab not being dutiful to your parents watching how I'm listening to Haram not observing prayers and time and yet when you make dua Allah answers you this is what is known in Islam as Ystad ROG in a figure of speech this is like pulling your legs so that you think that you are okay and you're doing well and then on the day of judgement you will see yourself thrown in hell so you should be worried only if you are not a true servant of Allah who's practicing who is caring and loving to Islam and to the Muslims Mona says while making Woodill is it mandated to rinse your mouth and nose my nose is blocked most of the time and I'm not able to sniff water into the nostrils properly how should I do this during will do you should try your level best and this is more than enough Allah doesn't tell us to bring the hose and shove it up our nostrils and put the pressure of water to flush it this is too extreme Allah simply says to us that sniffing inhale water up your nostrils to the best of your ability if your nose is blocked so be it there's nothing else you can do Muhammad says it's punishment and mercy of Allah created or these his attributes we know that anger is one of Allah's attributes related to action so Allah gets angry when he wants like speaking like coming like descending these are attributes of action Allah does it when he pushes subhanaw taala and likewise these actions of allah the attributes of allah they're not created but what comes out as a result of them are created so the mercy of allah is not created this is an attribute of allah however there is a mercy that Allah created and the Prophet mentioned that in the hadith when Allah created mercy he created it into 100 branches or divisions keeping with him 99 and releasing one out of a hundred on earth with it all the people on the animals and all the creatures have mercy upon one another so this is created but it is not the attribute of Allah which is not created which is also known as mercy so son over says can we pray can we pay someone's loans through our zakat money this is a common question if the loan was taken for in SSAT someone had to borrow to pay for his wives surgery which he did not have money for someone got into a business and lost his money and all the debtors want their money the business was legitimate it was first major the warehouse was burnt to the ground and he lost everything someone had to reconcile between two tribes who were going to fight and kill one another so he committed himself to give them this much and give that those this much and maybe cook some food for them all of these are classified in verse 60 chapter 9 as allegory mean well very mean so they have that and we can pay their debts from the cat we don't not have to give it to them we can go immediately to the one who lent them and pay the loan off now not every loan we can give to the cat for example if I purchase a fancy car for five six hundred thousand reals in installments I can't come in Ramadan and say people I have a loan helped me pay it off if I'm building a big mansion worth of millions and I borrowed the money I can't come and ask for the cat to be paid off because this is not a legitimate source of borrowing in order to get the cat to pay off in Allah knows best what car says it is mentioned in the Quran about the arrival of Prophet ISA alaihi salatu was-salam but the question is will he come as a prophet or an almighty of Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu was-salam well once you're a prophet you're a prophet for life so if he was a messenger and a prophet of allah like 2,000 years ago when he comes after so many years when he descends from Heaven's and kills the Antichrist he would still be a prophet and a messenger of allah but he will not have a new message he will not have a revelation he will not have a new religion rather he would be a follower of the Prophet Allah so Sam's Sharia and he would rule the Muslims with the Sharia of and not a new Sharia but no one can deprive him of being a prophet or a messenger of allah a sister says i had a relationship with a boy now we don't have any relationship we don't communicate with each other i don't want any haram relationship but i want him as my husband in the future so can I pray to Allah all the time to get him as my husband if you have repented felt remorse cut all communications with him and I mean all capital letter bold and underlined not even communicating it with him through SMS or chatting or through Facebook or Twitter if this is the case and you're remorseful there's no problem asking Allah every day to make him your halal husband inshallah Sabrina says what is the ruling on her donation in Islam is it permissible what if we donate our hair for cancer patients wigs donating hair is problematic if you're gonna cut your hair and you're gonna give it to a particular cancer patient to make a wig of it this is hella giving it to banks or companies that claim that they will do this for cancer patients is not permissible because we do not guarantee that what they're claiming is true a big possibility is that they make fifty percent wigs to those who underwent chemotherapy and lost their hair and other 50 percent they sell so it is not permissible to be assisting them when it is doubtful and dubious Romar says I heard of a hadith where a woman went to the Prophet iris awesome to make dua for her to cure her illness but the Prophet said Salalah Hara Selim to her that if she would be patient instead she would get Jenna can you please explain this hadith does it mean that it is best to be patient and not to seek medical help this is an issue of dispute is it mandatory to take medicine and to get treated the majority say that this is not mandatory it can be recommended and it can be permissible and sometimes it's not recommended so when the chances are 50/50 of recovery leaving it is best because you're trusting Allah when the possibility of recovery is 25% then it is not only best it might be mandatory for you not to go for it because the risk is far greater than the possibility of recovery and if the recovery rate is higher like 80% 90% then it is highly recommended to accept it and to get treated unless if you don't get treated you will die or have something serious happening to you in this case it becomes mandatory so if I'm bleeding and I'm refusing to treat my wound to stop blood from continuing to come up and out and kill me if I don't do this I'm sinful it is a must for me to treat it if there's a need to amputate one of my limbs otherwise it will cause my whole body to be affected and die as a consequence then it is a must to get treated and to amputate that organ but if it's a normal 50/50 chance maybe maybe not this is up to you it's to do it and if you want to refrain then this is permissible the hadith brother amar is referring to is the hadith of a black woman who used to have seizures so she came to the Prophet Alice awesome and said o prophet of Allah pray to Allah that I recover from my seizures so the Prophet looked alehissalaam to the rewards knowing that if he makes dois she'll be recovered but if he doesn't make dua and she is patient her seizures would erase all the time sins and give her good deeds so he gave her the choice if you wish I'll ask Allah Allah for you but if you are patient and I don't make dua for you Allah will admit you to Jenna so the woman said okay prophet of Allah I'll be patient I want Jenna this is what I'm living on earth for this is my final destination I hope so yes don't make draw for me but when I have these seizures I fall down and my clothes may expose my aura because I'm unaware of what's happening to me so pray to Allah that when I have my seizures that my aura is not displays displayed or exposed so the prophet made dua for her scholars say that this is an indication that tolerating pain for the sake of allah azza wajal is something that is rewarded something that is recommended and that seeking healing and cure for your illness is not mandatory as we've stated in the beginning and Allah knows best and Allah says in the Quran Allah says he does not burden a soul beyond his capacity and it's also said that Allah tests whom he loves and the more Allah loves a person the more he tests does that mean that the people with more problems in their lives are more beloved to Allah generally speaking yes providing providing that they are patient and tolerant of the liveness road may Allah be pleased with him visited the Prophet Isis um once when he was sick so he placed his hand on his chest and it was almost boiling it was hot so he said subhanAllah o prophet of allah we companions talk among ourselves and say that when you get sick you get sick on behalf of two men so the Prophet said yes the most severely in testing are the prophets then the righteous then those who are below them according to their righteousness a man is tested according to his Eman to his belief and faith so if his faith is strong and a lot Allah would increase his testing and if his Eman and faith is weak or fragile Allah would ease his testing but you have to understand that testing can be through illnesses poverty and calamities as well as it can be through health wealth and well-being Allah says in the Quran one abukuma surely well hurry fitna well Elena told John and we test you with bad evil things such as poverty illness etc and we test you with wealth and health and good things and to us you shall return so don't think that only those whom Allah is testing with bad things are beloved to him and those who are tested with wealth and being rich are not beloved to him it all depends on the content on the tolerance on and on how you appreciate and show your gratitude to Allah and Allah Sojin knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you fear Manila wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
