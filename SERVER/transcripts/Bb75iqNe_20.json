  "title": "How to fix the Bride's Mahr (Dowry)? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "it states that I want to know what is the permissible way to fix a bride's mahara that is the dowry of a bride from her husband and what is the ruling to calculate it we know that in Islam there are pillars of a marriage that without it the marriages void and invalid and there are mandatory things that are part of the marriage and there are conditions and the morrow or the money given from the groom to be to his wife before or during or after the contract which is agreed upon both of them this is a woman's right and it is part of the obligations of marriage so it can precede marriage and it can be within the contract and it can come afterwards depending on the availability of the money with the groom and on their agreement is there a fixed amount the answer is no so would it be possible that a man marries a woman without naming maja a dowry the answer is yes and what happens afterwards afterwards the man is supposed to give her maja but because there was no prior agreement there might be some dispute he might give way less than the average so the scholars say that it depends on the average of the dowry in the community she lives in it is an issue of supply and demand so if he comes and proposes and they accept his proposal he says I'm going to give you X amount of money they may say no this is too much give us less than that or they may say we accept or they say this is too little we want more so it is not what the man gives and it's not unquestionable on the contrary it depends on the approval of the girl if she says she's fine with it the hamdulillah and of course in the Sharia in the Islamic law it is highly recommended that the dowry is as minimum as possible and the more the expenses the less blessing the marriages and the lesser the expenses whether it's a dowry the wedding etc then the more blessed the wedding and the marriage would be as stated by the Prophet a son and also discussed thoroughly through the scholars"
