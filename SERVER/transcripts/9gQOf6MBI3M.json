  "title": "Shortening and combining prayers - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay I've got a question about shortening the salaah and can we shorten with that combining is the question the sooner for a traveler is to shorten prayer combining the prayers is not only for travelers it can also be done when you're residing combining the prayer is made as when it's needed for a Muslim so if a person needs to combine prayer and Allah knows the necessities not anyone if someone needs to combine prayers even if he was a resident he may do so and the clearest example is in the case of rain the Sunnah if it rains in a city and it's raining heavily the Sunnah is to combine asar to Lahore at the time of the whole or to combine Asia to marry at the time of Mahadev so it has nothing to it's not specifically for traveling it can be for both but shortening prayers is for traveling and the sooner that you pray each prayer in its time unless there is a necessity for you to combine then you may have this permission from Allah"
