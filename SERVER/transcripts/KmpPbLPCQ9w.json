  "transcript": "I know that Riya and Valerie is the good deed if you intend it from the beginning or you don't Ward it off but my problem is that even then I still get this feeling like when I'm making will do and I'm putting water in my mouth or I'm saying Allah when I'm praying and uh I spend five to six hours a day uh answering the call of nature appearing purifying myself and praying so can it be forgiven for me thank you where is the uh Ria in this uh Sami I didn't get your question like for example if I'm ranging my mouth to make sure that it goes from right to left where is that what is the meaning of ria showing off okay who's you who are you showing off you're on your own in the toilet um because like um sometimes you know someone might walk in and they see me making though there's no Ria in Itachi don't mix apples with oranges Ria is the intention to show off otherwise you would not have done it so yes if I am doing something in front of people and I'm doing it to have them impressed by me otherwise if I were alone I would not have done it yeah that would be considered Ria so all what you're mentioning and talking about is just simply Whispers of shaytan in your head over and over again I tell people when they come to me for counseling sessions and I have hundreds like you and when they speak Unfortunately they don't hear themselves so my job is to open their eyes and make them aware of what they're saying Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity is what you're doing related to ease in Simplicity the answer is no so definitely shaytan is messing up with your head what to do Sheikh when I have OCD simple five-letter word ignore but I can't it's compelling it's not compelling just shrug your shoulders and move on if you insist then it's you who's causing this not shaytan shaytan has no control over you Allah mentioned in Surat Ibrahim Chapter 14 verse 22. shaytan declares it in hell and says I had no control over you except to call me and to call you and you responded and answered me simple as that shaytan has no control over you no one has so it's all your own doing you have only yourself to blame as shaytan stated in this ayahu don't blame me rather blame yourselves"
