  "transcript": "is the prophet aliveat in his grave and to answer this question we would counter this with another question if we were to dig the prophet out would he come out and live with us and he's alive like us and the answer is no definitely because Allah said you are dying you're dead so he's not alive like us meaning that if I call himam alaykum he would not raise his voice and Shout from Beyond the wall and sayum he does not eat and drink like we do he doesn't go to the Laboratories he does not have intercourse uh uh with his wives because he is in a stage where it's with where it is known as the stage of Al it's a transitional phase between this life and the Hereafter and all those who die stay in this phase until the day of judgment and everyone would be resurrected so his life is different than what we know we know that his body is unchanged because all the prophets of Allah when they die their bodies do not change so we know that he is his soul is in paradise and it has a connection with the body in a means that we don't understand and we cannot comprehend because it's a different world and a different life remember in the night Journey the prophet Alam went to the grave of Moses near the Red Hill and he found him praying there when he reached Jerusalem Al he led him in prayer there and when he ascended to the seventh heaven he found him in the sixth or the fifth Heaven he found M MSA so he found him in three different places at the same time because it's a different phase a different world than ours does he respond to us when we give him Salam if you're in China and you give Salam to the prophet Alam Allah has appointed an angel who would tell the prophet Alam that so and so has given you Salam does he know what's happening in the world and the answer is no and that is why on the day of judgment in the the prophet saysat that scores of my um come to drink from my pool and the Ang angs uh uh prevent them and block them from doing so so I object and say oh Allah my um my um and then I am told you do not know what they have innovated after you and I would say uh uh destruction destruction uh to those who have innovated after me and you have to underline here that he they tell him or Allah tells him you do not know what they have innovated meaning that the prophet in his grave does not know what is happening after him and Allah knows best though"
