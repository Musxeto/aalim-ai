  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] Al this is the fourth year of Hijra the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam with the grace of Allah managed to kick out the Jews from the tribe of bad because of their betrayal and their attempt to assassinate the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam on this year and in the fourth or fifth month of the Islamic calendar the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam heard that the tribes of M and they are all parts of the big tribe ofan were preparing to invade him so he went sallallahu alaih Al wasallam and he went throughout n the center of Arabia traveling here and there trying to find anyone to stand in his face and to uh uh uh fight him and they all were all scattering all over Arabia trying to escape the the prophet sallallahu alaih alam's Army on the same year in the month of shaan it was the rendevu with the poist Army you remember after the battle of uhud Abu sufyan the leader of the poist army stood up and said that we're going to come on this particular date to that particular location next year so be there and we will fight you so because of this date set by the pothy the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam took 1500 of his men and went to that place on the same date and the pothy also came out but with 2,000 men and it's a little bit strange why the number was reduced but if you look at the way they felt it you could understand that now they were in the Battle of uhud with 3,000 men yet they were almost ready they almost they was they were this close from being defeated and they had so many casualties among them and wounded so when it was next year and after they heard that the prophet Sall wasallam was still strong was still sending troops to patrol Arabia and to attack the tribes that were trying to attack him when they heard about what happened to the Jews of bad and how they were exiled they were hesitant to go out and meet the prophet Sall wasallam again so in a sense a lot of them chickened out Abu sufyan who was among them in the middle of the way was also hesitant to go and fight but he was the leader of the tribe he was the leader of quray he cannot tell his people well I'm afraid then this would be an insult that cannot be erased so he was going with these people and his people also were you know having cold feet they they did not want to fight but they gave a promise that they they have to fulfill it in the middle of the way Abu sufyan made a decision and he talked to his people he told them this year is a year of famine and drought there was no rain and our camels and sheep are unable to eat from the grass so I believe that we come next year when it's Greener and we can eat the meat of our cattle and we can drink the milk of our cattle I I I suggest we go back and to his surprise no one objected they all agreed and they went back from the middle of the way to their rendevu they went back the prophet sallallahu Ali wasallam however and his companions stayed in what is known to be bad the second bad he stayed in that location where they were supposed to meet for eight days waiting for them and the whole of Arabia heard about this of course and they were anticipating this fight and when the people of quray went back they knew that the Muslims are far stronger and their reputation has been restored the Muslims stayed in that location for eight days and people from Arabia came to trade with them because they did not only go with their weapons they went with dates they went with with merchandise from Medina so people the bed ons and and the tribes came and the Muslims with the grace of Allah won and eded in making profits of 100% so whatever was costing one din they sold it for two so they made 100% profit and they went back to Medina prosperous with the grace of Allah so that was a shame to the qur to leave the battle and and go back of course this was an extreme insult to them but when you put it in the balance you'd rather be insult insulted or dead we have a saying in Arabic and and it's it's a colloquial saying it says that 100 times being labeled as a coward is better than once being prayed for may Allah have mercy on him in the sense that he's dead so it's always better to to in in their point of view of course not in our point of view as Muslims because when death comes as Fighters for Islam let it come this is what we've been anticipating so they went back to Med in to to Mecca with being disgraced and labeled as cowards while the Muslims themselves went back Victorious alhamdulillah with a a hefty margin of profit for the merchandise they had sold in that particular year the fourth year of uh Hijra one of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam closest Companions and cousins Abu Sal died and Abu Sal is the brother of the Prophet Sall wasallam through suckling and he is also his cousin his his mother is the prophet's aunt and her name was Al mutalib and also in that particular year one of the prophets sallallah alaihi wasallam grandsons died and he was Abdullah IBB afan and his mother was R the daughter of the Prophet Alat wasam and he had six years of age and he died and the prophet Sall wasallam felt uh uh uh very sad for his uh passing away on that particular year also on the fourth year of uh Hijra the prophet Alam married um Sal who was the Widow of Abu Sal his cousin and if you analyze the marriages of the Prophet Alat wasam All Those whom he married or most of them were widows of his beloved friends so the prophet Alat wasam married um Sal he married Zab B Kusa and also she was widowed he married ha B Omar who was also a widow because her husband died in the battle with the prophet Alat wasam and so on so his marriages essentially were to get his companions closer to him and he would marry these women who were women in distress in in the early days of the building in Medina and the the the developing of the the nation what did the the women play as a role if it's anything recorded they played the role of a woman in the sense that she is taking care of half of the society in her own world in the sense that she used to take care of the house where the husband used to fight at the side of Allah used to go and learn Islam from the prophet Alat used to trade in the market to put the food on the table while women used to take care care of the horses of the man used to serve the man in his house and used to bring up the boys the children and the girls uh uh in the proper Islamic way women did not work or mix with men except in the very beginning before the verse of hijab came so they had boundaries they had limitations they did not mix with men in the sense that they could uh uh work with them or fight with them or uh intermingle with them as the case nowadays on the contrary Islam tells us that we should separate them but this did not mean that they were isolated from the society they used to pray in the Masjid with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and they did not have any partitions between them yet the prophet indicated to them the limitations that should be uh uh uh noticed he told us that the best rows of men are those at the very front and the best rows of women are those at the very end and the worst rows of men are those at the very end of the men and the worst rows of women are those at the very front which meant that separating men from from women was in indeed something of importance in Islam so they lived they went to the market and you remember what happened in uh uh uh the Expedition and and in uh the event of where one lady went to buy from their market and they tied her dress to her head because she would not reveal uh her face and this what caused uh uh them to attack the Muslim brother who defended this lady and then the prophet s wasallam ordered them out of their Village and he exiled them from Medina so women and men they are inseparable but they may not mix you have your sister you have your mother you have your wife you have your daughter you have your aunts they're all women surrounding you but you would not allow them to mix with other men that are not lawful for them to mix uh I believe we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we will be right [Music] back I say that the translation has been indirectly influenced with Israel everything we haven't faced any problems in our preparations we can call it uh the uh wise uh HUD Egypt you have a huge amount of initiative going on in terms of developing uh qualifications in different parts of the system reading helps you um gain knowledge but Serv the it doesn't help you at all they are all uh welcome to uh participate in the discussion and the debate about the development of qualification what types of books our children do or should read join me for further discussion to focus Point Huda a light in every home [Music] alayum and welcome back fourth year of Hijra the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married um Sal and the story of her marriage is quite astonishing she tells us that when Abu Sal passed away she recalled a supplication that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam taught the Muslims the prophet told told the Muslims that whenever someone receives a Calamity or a catastrophe something bad happens to him or to his property or to his loved ones if he says that we belong to to Allah and we are returning to Allah oh Allah I ask you to substitute me with something that is better um Sal said when Abu Sal husband died I thought to myself who could be better than the than Abu Sal but I supplicated I said this that I said that we all we all belong to Allah and we are all going back to him uh uh oh Allah reward me in the Calamity that took place uh uh on me and substitute me with something that is better and she just said it because it's a supplication that the prophet Sall Ali wasallam taught us to say and a short while afterwards after her morning period was over the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent to her that he's proposing to her in marriage she's an old woman and the prophet wasam is also old he was at the time about 56 years old so he wasn't young but marriage is not only about relationships Intimate Relationships it's it's about building a family it's about getting people closer it's about your in-laws or keeping a family together of course and it's about your in-laws so when you marry a woman you don't marry a woman just for the sake of the relationships and and in bed but you look at your in-laws so that you have two families getting together with a relationship that is so sacred and honored so um Sal sent back to the prophet Alat wasam and told him that I'm an old woman and I have a lot of children and also I'm a very jealous person so the prophet s wasallam replied to her by saying as for your children they're under my custody so don't fear Allah Allah will give them Provisions as for your jealousy I will pray to Allah asael that he will turn it away because the prophet had wives so she is a jealous woman and this tells us that if a woman is a jealous woman she may not marry a man who's married before or or she is it's not advisable for her to be a co-wife because this would destroy her life and her husband's life but if she is a tolerant person and she knows that having a man a married man is better than not having any man if she knows that this way of marriage is far better for her than not being unmarried because she would have time enough time for her to do her own things when her husband is at his other wife's house then this is a different case and the prophet wasallam married um Sal and she became the mother of the Believers and she also reported a lot of the Hadith because she was close to the prophet alham as we can read in the books of Sunnah now with time is a little bit calmer than usual there were no attacks at Medina and it was a time of safety security and stability but this unfortunately lasted for few months only of course who didn't like this Hypocrites the Hypocrites didn't like it but among them the last and final tribe of the Jews they've seen being exiled they've seen b being exiled remained Banu and they did not like what they saw so an invoy of 20 men of their Elite of their masters of their dignitaries left Medina and started making their diplomatic tours they first went to quray and they started reminding them of what happened to their loved ones they started reminding reminding them of the problems they were facing throughout their trading routes and they started provoking them and encouraging them to go and fight but the people of quray were afraid how do you want us to fight we've tried that before and we always lost so the Jews came up with this devilish idea they told them that you and the tribe around you your allies come with an army and we will go to the tribe of gfan up East and they will come with their own Army and we from inside of Medina will be behind the prophet Alat wasam so we will attack him from three different fronts the people of quray like the idea because they were tired of going on their own and losing on their own so when you have a coalition Force then this would reduce the efforts the efforts and it would reduce the meaning of defeat and usually it would add value this Envoy of Jews the dignitaries went also to the tribe of gfan and they also ask them to participate in the war against Islam and the Muslims and Banu fuz Banu Ash Banu Assad different tribes all collaborated to formulate this Army the Army was set and ready and the Army had 10,000 soldiers now look at the jump in bad they were 1,000 in uhud there were 3,000 and now there are 10,000 armed men coming to attack this small village small city of Medina alongside with the Jews in the southern and western area of Medina inside of Medina itself the prophet Alat wasam had he not been notified earlier this Army could have easily annihilated Islam and the Muslims if taken by surprise but with the grace of Allah and after that with the smartness and intelligence of the Prophet Alam he got the information that these armies are preparing and coming your way so he mobilized his companions and actually he mobilized the whole of Medina and he asked his compan Ians what do you think what should we do 10,000 it's even greater than the number of the population of Medina including the children the women and the elderly they didn't have that much so what to do now Salman Al farise and you know Salman Al Pharisee Salman Al farise is a different line of work himself Salman and I think we cannot go on without mentioning the story of Salman Al fary may Allah be pleased with him Salman alari was from Persia from Iran or what they call Iran I don't know why they call it Iran but it's Iran so Salman's father was a prominent priest who was responsible for keeping the fire on and the people of Persia at the time were fire worshippers and he kept his son as a servant of this fire and the son did not very much like this but he had to do it it was a time when he left his house once going to the farm where he met a group of monks who were worshiping and he saw what they were were doing and he liked it he thought that this is far greater than what we're doing because they were worshiping one God without making a long story uh uh too long he went back to his father his father knew about this he handcuffed him put him in shackles and uh uh confined him to a chamber in the house and would not let him go he managed one way or the other to escape Cape he went with a convoy and he asked where are the best people to worship Allah on the same manner he was instructed to go to Sham to the northern part of Arabia he traveled there he worshiped god with one of their priests or monks for a long time and he enjoyed believing in one God only and when the man died he was not a very good man was not a very good monk he was actually a thief he would collect the money from the worshipers and he would put it in his house for his own using when he died he exposed him so they took this priest dead body and crucified him and did bad things to him so he went on and moved to one good priest and he worshiped Allah with him he served him he stayed along with him until the man was about to die and just as he was dying he instructed him to tell him what to do who where can I go and worship Allah with righteous people like yourself and the priest told him that there are no any there are no more righteous people like us but it is time now for us to have a messenger from Allah the time is right and we believe that there will be a messenger coming out from from an area among mountains with lots of palm trees so he asked and they told him that this fits Medina so he hired a group of Arabs to take him to Medina and he paid them and in the way they enslaved him they took everything that he had and made him as a slave and they went to Medina and they sold him to a Jew and he worked as a servant and a laborer for that Jew he is a slave he's not getting any money he was deprived of everything after being the son of a prominent person seeking the truth I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program when we meet next time inshallah we will continue to talk about Salman Al faresi and the Battle of Al and and until then alaykum [Music] oh [Music] m [Music]"
