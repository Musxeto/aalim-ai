  "title": "Can I gift my female relatives dresses, jewelry..They may wear in front of non mahrams Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "um can i send gifts like dresses jewelries makeups to my non-hizabi relatives because it could happen that they will wear them outside of the house or in front of non-mahram or it couldn't happen so what will i do this is something that you have to calculate the pros and cons i could give someone a box or a container of ice cubes he can use it with cold water and he can use it with his gin and tonic maybe i don't know so what do i feel if i feel that if i buy this dress to my sister or to my uh aunt and i know for certain that she will wear it without the hijab in front of nan mahram's it becomes prohibited for me to buy her such a dress if it is if i'm certain that she will not wear it in front of none for certain then it's totally permissible to buy her if i'm doubtful the default is that it's a halal dress and it depends on the person wearing it whether sinful or not depending on the occasion and the circumstances so if i give my mahram or my friend or my relative something that might be used in halal might be used in haram but the default is that it should be used in halal it's their sin if they were to choose otherwise and i'll give you an i'll give you another example my younger brother i don't have one but allah says you might have one i give him for eat a mobile phone 5g and there is a possibility that he may watch something that is haram on it but it's a phone it's used to make phone calls and to do many useful halal things you can put an app of quran so what's the ruling the default is that he's a muslim and he knows what he's doing and i'm giving him a tool that can be used mainly in halal things if he uses it in haram it's not my fault it is his he is an adult he has reached the age of puberty and he he's accountable at the side of allah therefore there is no problem in giving it to him and i hope this answers your question"
