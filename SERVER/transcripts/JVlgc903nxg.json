  "transcript": "Shahana raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam o allah carla hardy he water saudi he amin nabina muhammad in water and he was happy ajma'in i'm bad assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato we move on to hadith number 117 the hadith which jabbered Nabila may allah be pleased with a man with his father reported that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said he who eats garlic or onion should remain away from us or from our mosque and stay in his house a Kittel was brought to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which had cooked vegetables in it he smelt offensive odor in it on asking he was informed of the vegetables he said take it to such-and-such of his companions when he saw it he also disliked eating it upon this he does the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said you may eat it for i converse with one whom you do not converse and the following hadith is also reported by Jabbar may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said he who ate onions garlic or leeks should not approach our mosque for the angels are harmed by the same things as the sons of adam from these two hadeeth we learn that it is not permissible for a person who has consumed garlic or onions or leeks because it contains an offensive odor it is not for him to attend prayer in the Masjid and the prophet alayhi salatu salam justified this by saying that the angels are offended with the same things that the believers the Muslims are offended by and scholars from these hadith differed some of them said that prayer in the congregation is not mandatory and if some of the Muslims perform it then this is enough and sufficient why they said because these things eating them is permissible yet the Prophet RA salatu salam forbade those who eat them from attending prayer so this means that attending the prayer is not mandatory and this is not the authentic opinion of scholar because there are exceptions there are things if you do them you are exempted from praying in the Masjid for example if dinner was served and the Akama was called you are obliged to sit and eat if you have the urge to answer the call of nature and the hama has been called you're obliged to answer the call of nature first this does not mean at all that prayer is not mandatory on the individuals the overwhelming evidences that back the opinion that it is mandatory upon the individuals are far greater than these Hadees also we learned from these two hadith that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam the word is you energy and nature is the secret conversation that takes place between two and that is why allah azzawajal forbade this among us and he said in surah the Mujahideen ax in managua Meera Shaitaan that secret conversations from Chapin why so that he would sadden the third person who is not joining with us in that conversation and that is why the Prophet forbade from it and said that in salatu salam it is not permissible for two to have a private conversation in the presence of a third unless it is by his permission and this happens a lot of the time it happens sometimes with me if I'm travelling in a car and the people and the car are speaking their native language and I'm the third one so both of them are speaking their own native language and I do not understand it is this permissible for them to do no because I am the third and this is considered to be naswa and that is why the Prophet said re his salat was salam to his companions who also did not like to eat from that Kittel if you did not eat why why do you want to sue it or prophet of allah the prophet justified this aria his salat wa salam by saying that i converse with someone you do not converse with so the Prophet erase salif's Allah meets gibreel and talks to gibreel and gibreel comes to him peace be upon him and that is why his breath should always be fresh Saleh Ali of Salaam do we understand from this that it is not recommended to eat garlic or onions at all there's no indication to say that it is not recommended and that is why scholars different some of them said it is not permissible to eat garlic or onion when it is time for prayer because this means that you're going to skip prayer others say no it is permissible it is recommended if you wish to eat no problem and this would be an excuse for you to skip prayer however it depends on your attention so if my intention that every day I come from work at 6 o'clock or 5:30 Supper is served I instruct my wife to put a big onion and some garlic so that when I eat I skip Maghrib ination every single day scholars say that this is the doing of the Jews who were forbidden to fish on the Sabbath and subhanAllah only on the Sabbath the fish would come and the rest of the week it would not show so they dug trenches on Friday so that the fish would fall and they will catch it on Saturday in a large there was L cursed them for doing this and turned some of them into porks and to monkeys etc and this was a specific tribe not all the Jews so it's wrong to call all the Jews you are the grandchildren of the monkeys and the pigs it is wrong because those who were transformed into monkeys and into pigs did they have an offspring no the Prophet told us at insalata SEM whenever Allah transforms a nation to a different animal or the different species it has no offspring so that tribe that nation would expire and it has no relation to the monkeys and to the pigs we have today so it's strong to say that the Jews are the grandchildren of the monkeys and of the pigs this is completely baseless and wrong however if a person was served a meal that contained garlic or audience and he felt the need or the desire to eat it though there is a prayer afterwards is he advice to do it the answer is yes as long as you desire it and it's something halal and you're not doing it so that you skip tomorrow's feature sometimes you eat chicken with garlic after Asia and the garlic is so strong that even the following morning in fetcher you can find the smell of it so you skip fetcher so is it permissible to do this yes because it is once every blue moon not every single day or not every other day and that is why scholars say it is as long as you desire it you may consume it inshallah there's nothing wrong in that but you have to skip the prayer as long as you have this smell in you the prophet alayhi salatu salam pointed out to us the justification for not attending the prayer what was that he said that the angels are offended by the things that the humans are offended by as well so anything that offends humans also offend the angels and we know from this hadith sometimes we face people coming to pray with us in the message and they are Labour's they are labourers who work under the Sun or farmers or construction workers they work for six or seven hours and they come for lower prayer dusty muddy and smelly and it's not your everyday order it is so bad it's not an order it's an oh dear it's so bad that whoa what is this and it's so repelling so when you talk to the brother of he this is the house of Allah you should not come with such a form he says are you preventing me from praying say no the Prophet is preventing you from praying eyes of Salaam because whatever offends the humans this offends the angels as well so you are instructed either to have a special garment for prayer when you come or to clean yourself purify yourself so that you would stand in front of allah azzawajal in the best of form and even worse those who consume forbidden things such as smoking tobacco cigars pipes whatever they smell awful when they come to the Masjid their smell is also annoying the worshippers if you pray next to someone who is a chain-smoker his clothes his big well he wouldn't have a beard usually his clothes his hair his body is so bad the smell of tobacco is awful and a lot of the people who smoke say it is not harm it's not mentioned in the Quran nor in the Sunnah subhanAllah this is extremely strange Allah described the Prophet Allah saw him in the Quran by saying that he would make pie EBIT Halong things that are good he will make them lawful and the thing is that our Haditha and things that are bad he would make them forbidden and ask any child what do you think of smoking and he would say that it is part of her bath is it as good as an apple is it as good as water or any good food no it is also not a natural thing you would never find a father allowing his child to smoke or approving his child to smoke though he smokes himself we have a short break after that we will continue to talk about cigarettes so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back just before the break we briefly talked about smoking and to explain this a bit further smoking is prohibited in Islam Islam prohibits anything that is harmful to you and even the non-muslims the doctors the surgeons they all agree that smoking is hazardous to your health you will not find this warning of theirs on a can of juice or grocery shop when you buy apples or bananas but you'll find it on a packet of cigarette and it is satanic smoking is from Shaitaan how is that if you bring a child who is 8 or 9 years of age and you give him all the soft drinks all the juices that are available he'd love them all because they're sweet they're nice you're tasty but if you give him a cigarette and ask him to smoke it or inhale it he would start to cough and feel that he's out of breath and maybe throw up and sometimes some of them faint why because it is very bad it's not natural and look how Shaitaan manipulates people and he changes their fitrah their instinct their nature this which happened to that child 10 years later you find those who smoke find nothing more tasteful and joyful than smoking and if you ask anyone who smokes what is the best time in your life he would not say when I'm standing in front of the Kaaba praying or when I'm drinking cold water it is when I have a cigarette after lunch this is the best time of my life because the nicotine kicks in and a lot of the people are addicted to it and they claim that they are unable dope they are convinced it's Haram they're convinced it's bad though they are convinced that their wives don't even want to get close to them because of their smell yet they say we cannot kick the habit because we're addicted to it and this is nonsense if you ask a lot as it was L sincerely and you stop Allah will help you how do you stop smoking in Ramadan for 16 hours it's very easy because you believe in a line you think that's mandatory for you to fast and that's why you do it and that is why you should stop smoking immediately this is something that is causing you a lot of sins it's annoying the Muslims in the Masjid sometimes it's preventing you from praying with the congregation it's annoying your family it might be a cause for your wife to cheat on you if you are not fulfilling her rights by this awful smell of yours and it is an indication that you are insane why because you are actually bringing a banknote some money and you're burning it every time you smoke something and no matter how high they raised the price of cigarettes people still continue to smoke because they're brainwashed by what they see in the media in the films you know the movie star uses the cigarette as if it's a source of healing as a source of means to bring his calmness and peace of mind and this is all nonsense it's an addiction it is an illness and it is a sign that you have to revise because it is indication that you're not in your full state of mind we open the floor to your questions if you have yes brother it's not cheap and I'm sure I don't know what do we call it in English but the least I know it is called it is a cylindrical instrument in which sometimes tobacco is present or something maybe some flavour is present and they inhale the smoke of this instrument so is it allowed without tobacco is it allowed with tobacco it will be prohibited maybe without Abaco is it allowed there are a number of variations of what is being smoked at the moment we call it shisha some call it hubbly bubbly some call it mash sill and all of the variations they consider to be a long pipe with a water container so that it would reduce the nicotine and the tar or whatever either you put tobacco or you put some mixed fruit that has been rotting for so long added to it some nicotine and it's with some tar or tobacco in a sense even if the smell is good ask the physicians ask the doctors is this dangerous immediately we tell you it is this is a main cause of heart attacks of cancer of so many disease you name it they've got it and therefore the name itself is not a determining factor you can have it in Arabia you can have it in India you can have it in the Red Indians in and the north of America when they smoked their pipe of peace this is also forbidden God knows if there is hash or whatever drugs they consume so it's all prohibited it's all dangerous and the doctors say that it is not healthy and therefore it takes the ruling of Haram anything that causes illnesses or causes to die we know that a person who commits suicide will be punished by committing suicide in hell with the same instrument so if he has in the hadith of sorry Muslim if he consumes poison to kill himself he will be consuming this poison in hell and if he stabs himself he will be stabbing himself in hell if he throws himself from a mountain he'll be thrown from mountains and mountains in hell until the day of judgement this is his punishment so likewise who kills those were killing themselves by smoking they will fall under the same category may Allah protect us all yes what is it permitted to destroy intoxicants like cigarette or alcohol without the permission of the owner yeah this is a good question is it permissible for me to destroy intoxicants or forbidden things by force without the permission of the owner and the answer is no unless you are the ruler you are the governor of that place you're in because the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam told us that whoever sees vice whoever sees evil whoever sees something that is sinful he must change it with his hand and if he's unable he must change it with his rhetoric by talking by his tongue and if he can't then he must change it with his heart and this is the least of Eman scholars explained this and saying that no one has the authority to change by hand except upon those whom you have authority over for example you have authority over your children so if you see someone smoking you can take the cigarettes and you can destroy them and throw them in the dustbin if you see your wife going out without wearing the Islamic niqab or hijab you can prevent her from going sin you don't go out unless you're properly dressed if you see your employees in the office smoking you can tell them you should stop smoking this is my hand or I will fire you but if you see someone who you do not have control over your neighbor for example you see him drinking do I go and break into his house and take the drinks and break them or put them in the garbage no he will call the police and they will put you in jail this is not - your responsibility so what can I do I can always talk to him my neighbor what you're doing is Haram this is a major sin it's not permissible to drink intoxicants he doesn't listen I send him SMS is I send him messages I speak to him every now and then if this is also not possible why because my neighbor came to me with a gun and said to me if I hear you speak one more time about my drinking problem I'm gonna blow your head off so I can change it with my hand I cannot change it with my tongue in this case whenever I see him drink I have to change it in my heart by despising it by hating it by praying for him may Allah guide him so it is not permissible for us to change evil things with our hands it is not permissible for me to go to nightclubs and say oh this is great evil drinking mixing fornication I throw a bomb inside of it and blow it up what did you do I did jihad no this is not jihad this is a major sin that you have done and it is something that you should be punished for because you are doing something that's not your role you're not supposed to do this you're not supposed to break musical instruments you go into a restaurant and you find that a group is playing music you don't like musically if music is Haram you don't like it leave but no I go to my car and I'm my hammer or what whatever there is a tow bar and I go and break the drums and guitars and synthesizes and pianos and so and this is all for the sake of Allah no this is not for the sake of Allah you are disobeying Allah by doing this because you are creating more evil than what was anticipated I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
