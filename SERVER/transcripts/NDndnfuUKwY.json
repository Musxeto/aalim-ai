welcome to la and welcome to lessons in fill we continue what we've discussed last time we met which is the first hadith in the chapter that deals with Sutra and Sutra means the screen or the object you put in front of you before you pray brother Fatih can you read this hadith again please narrated by abu Jahi McMath harris may allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said if the person who passes in front of another person in prayer knew the magnitude of his sin he would have been better for him to wait for 40 then pass in front of him and another narration of Al bizarre he said 40 years so he identified the word 40 by saying it's 40 years in this hadith it tells us that it is highly recommendable to pray to a screen and it doesn't say that clearly but it tells you that you as a person who is not praying it's forbidden for you to pass in front of a person who is praying of course we will come to know that what is meant is that in the case that this person is praying to a screen you may not pass between him and the screen this is completely forbidden and it's a major sin as we will know insha'Allah and the reason behind that is that when a person is praying he is contemplating with in his prayer and he is talking to Allah he is talking to the Almighty and praying to him supplicating to him asking for his forgiveness so that is why it is unlawful for you to break this bond to break this connection by passing in front of him and this is what this is one of the benefits of the screen of the sutra that it makes you observe your prayer and it it does not allow you to gaze right left or center because you're concentrating you have this object in front of you and it consists the borders of your sight so usually people don't look beyond that line or that position and because it is so sacred that a person is praying to allah azza wajal that is why it's forbidden for us to destroy churches and places of worship is that true is it true that it's forbidden for Muslims to destroy churches and places of worship yes Mustafa I think you can't destroy churches if they're built under a Dimi rule if there are demons and they build new churches I think you're allowed to destroy these Church now I'm talking about existing churches boo Malik well according to destroying it only goes back to the Muslim leader and you can only do that if it's against them or some walls but generally speaking if you are outside of the Arabian Peninsula and the this country has a church or a place of worship is it permissible for Muslims to come and destroy it no these are places of worship people are entitled to worship their gods there to practice their religion providing they are outside of the Arabian Peninsula because in the Arabian Peninsula it's a different situation it's forbidden for them to practice their religion in public of course they can be Christians and Jews in their image peninsula as the case now and they worship their God they worship they practice their religion in private not in public because in public it's against the Islamic law and they may do this in private and again what is drawn is to pass in front of a person prayer praying but what happens if you are sitting down is this wrong so sometimes I finished prayer and I look behind me and I find this person praying to me so is this a sin a man is sinful no because I'm his screen I'm his Sutra at the moment so if a person was sitting down or lying down or even if a person was standing up and there's another one behind him praying to him and considering him as his Sutra this is allowed and there's nothing wrong in that the hadith tells us Mustafa okay if there's someone praying can you actually go and pray behind him and like with the intention that he is your sweater what do you think Mustafa it's simple you can do you can consider anything to be cetera providing whether it's an animal a human being or any object you can consider it to be a Sutra and pray to it but passing through is not acceptable because then it distracts you and it's in and it's not considered acceptable brother Fatih sometimes during Ramadan you know when we were in Mecca it's very very crowded and it's hard to stop people from passing by so when you stop them they say that the ruling for Mecca is a different ruling is this true or false now this is a different story because Mecca and other scholars say Medina have different verdicts to them Mecca the ruling is different because it doesn't have any pillars it's an open plazas and open area usually and it's so crowded that you know if you want to avoid passing in front of people praying you'll dig zag and probably end up closer to the Kaaba rather than leaving math so scholars say that yes Mac has a different story you may pass in front of people because there is no other way around it some scholars say no it is exactly like any other message such as the this is the verdict of imam al albani may Allah have mercy on him say he says that no you have to stop you may not cross or pass in front of a person praying bin baz may Allah have mercy on him say it's okay for you to do this only in al Haram so we should try our best like if we were going straight direction and there's someone praying just to be as much as possible outside the Reading area for yesterday yes of course you should try this your best brother Mustafa because what you said before can you think anymore any type of any action or yes even if it's a donkey yes even if you take an animal as a donkey to be your Sutra his accept is acceptable though there is a hadith that tells us that there are three things that interrupt your prayer and I don't want to go into this because I think it's going to come later on but yes the answer to answer your question at the moment yes providing that the animal is not passing through is not passing in front of you if the animal sitting then you may pray to it what is the verdict on Sutra is it the Sunnah or is it a watch if it's a issue of dispute among scholars some say and this is the majority it is Sunnah it's not obligatory others say no it is Rajab and if you don't Textron cetera then you consider to be sinful and I I think more comfortable with the the verdict of the majority which says it's sooner because there are hadiths that reported that were reported that the prophecy salams trade in Mecca and there were no screens in front of him and the people used to make Tawaf in front of him and this did not affect his prayer of america yes in Medina the Sahaba if we go back to the two rakahs newspaper for mother it they used to go to you know like the pillars yes and if you know like this it could be because if you go back to Mecca we could say Mecca has a you know and its own strong case I didn't get you now the hadith says that the Companions whenever they prayed the Sunnah they used to go and pick a pillar and pray to it so it would consist or or make a Sutra for them this doesn't say or doesn't at all imply that it is obligatory well one has to have the evidence saying that you must pray to it otherwise your prayer is invalid because if the Prophet says you must pray it and you do not then it becomes invalid and again in in the case of Mecca the prophets are solemn could have put anything in front of him though he did not have a pillar but you cannot argue and say he could not ask a person to sit in front of him you cannot say that he could not have a saddle and put in front of him or any object as in the case that he used to go for the masala for eight whenever he went out to the open to pray eight he used to have what we call aniseh and he used to put it so not putting it and there are other hadees that we will come through with the sha allah that explains this a little bit more tells us that it's not obligatory and we cannot make things obligatory and make things difficult to people who that's how having a sound evidence and strong argument that you know that could pass so i I personally like the I feel more comfortable with the verdict of the majority of scholars nevertheless when I pray I always pray to something I always pray to an object to our screen to a Sutra even if I am in my own room even if there is no one else in the I prefer to pray to the Sutra just to be on the safe side and secondly to protect my site from going here and there because the minute you have something in front of you it it increases your submissiveness it increases your contemplation it increases your awareness of the prayer while when you pray in the open you your sight may go here and there and and this would not be acceptable now in this hadith again it tells us that passing by is not permissible and there's a great burden for those who pass and remember that we talked about passing by close to the person prayer praying but if a person is praying where I'm sitting at the moment and he's not praying to a Sutra now is it possible for you to pass in front of him like two or three meters away is it a sin no it's not is it possible to pass away from him a metre away if he's not praying to a Sutra it's okay it's his mistake it's the person praying a mistake for not taking a Sutra what's not permissible for you is to cross the area of his praying which is from the from his feet - till the the point where he puts his forehead when he prostrates this is completely forbidden whether he is praying to a sutra or not if you cross this area your sinful but if he does not have a sutra it's okay you pass away from that point now when he has a sutra then this is completely out of the question and it's a major sin we have a short break so stay tuned Oh Medina our beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW Salam and his companions faced lots of troubles and difficulties and enmities and obstacles in the way to Medina before the Hegira to Medina from Mecca also allah subhanaw taala has assistant his beloved prophet and supported him in order to complete his mission and to to emigrate to medina a la sfera allah has granted us this great prophet and his companions now the question why the emigration to Medina the head of rasul allah and his companions was a turning point in the history of Hydra and the history of Islam my dear brothers and sisters what are the sacrifices that the Prophet mussalam has faced with his companions some of these difficulties insha'Allah we will learn together and we will focus in some lessons what are the lessons that we take from these incidents insha'Allah in our program route to Medina my dear brothers a stay tuned with us insha'Allah in this great event of Hejira we will inshaallah focus on some of the lessons of in this program road to Medina may Allah make it easy for us and accept our good deeds and gather us was our beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW salem engine and salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back the following hadith hadith number 181 will be read by brother nor their rated by Aisha may Allah be pleased with her Allah so messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was acts in in the expeditions of Tabuk about a Sutra of the person who is offering the prayer he said it is something like the back of the saddle so this hadith the messenger of allah sallallahu wasallam was asked about the sutra in the sense that what is it how does it look like so he indicated the Prophet SAW some time that it should be as or similar to the back of a saddle and the back of a sublet is about 2/3 of an arm length so it's almost a foot or so a foot or so this high so this is the back of the saddle if you want to do to pray you're supposed to put something in front of you or you should pray to something that is at least as high or like the back of a saddle and from this hadith we learned that a sutra or the screen is sunnah whether you're traveling or you're residing whether you are in town or out of town it is a Sunnah for you to take and scholars have you know different opinions of regarding the height and some of them like 'mom i might went to the extent to say that if you could not find anything then just draw a line and consider that this line is your cetera there is no authentic hadith backing this up but it's just an opinion of a scholar of Islam in case that a person does not or cannot afford to have a Sutra you are in a place that nothing there's nothing all in the open so what should I do he says just draw a line to indicate that this is yo Sutra we move on to hadeeth number 182 narrated by Sabra Binney mahmoud al Juhani Roger Allam on allah's messenger salallahu alaihe salam said late one of you who is in in prayer put a Sutra in front of him even if it is in error okay now this hadith it was regarded by some of the scholars to be not authentic but the meaning is it's correct because it tells you that you should take a Sutra even by erecting an arrow and this is similar to erecting the Ana's ah huh you remember the Anitha which is the short stick like like a spear so this is the Sunnah and it is recommended that you do something no matter how thin it is because an arrow is very thin so it will not cover anything in front of you but it will help you to focus in your prayer and not exceed this area so it would be like borders for you and it will be good for your psyche not to exceed the this arrow or this line or this object and look what's behind it and this can be easily understood when you look at people praying now the Sunnah is for you to look where Fatih while praying the place of sugu the place of prostration at the place where you put your forehead on which is the place of prostration this is the Sunnah when you stand up in prayer you should do this now I as an imam of a mosque when I finish my prayer the Sunnah is I turn around and face the people praying and I see wonders believe me I see wonders because the people that did not complete the prayer with me and had still have two or three records to finish once they complete their prayer I look at them as I make my supplication at the speed and dhikr and I look at them and I find people at the end of the Masjid at the very end side of the Masjid looking at me so it's you're talking about a forty-five to maybe 60 70 degrees and I look at the person and the guy is looking at me and the minute he sees me look I got a mr. goes and I give him like a couple of seconds or more and I still looking at him and he goes and he finds me looking at him he goes back again what kind of prayer is this what kind of prayer is this there are so many people when they pray they don't contemplate it in their prayer they don't have the who shoe or needed didn't look at the position where they are they should prostrate and you find them gazing left right and looking upwards and doing this and watching others and and and this is a clear sign that their prayer is not completed and we always give the example of a wax train a wax airplanes you know the rate the one with the radar is because they always do this look around left and right this is not prayer that is playing most of them when he prays he does not move he looks at the place at the ground where he puts his forehead and he contemplates it with his prayer and has kosher but when he looks around and looks at the people passing by this is a clear sign that his prayer is not complete and he should work real hard on fixing his prayer we move on to the following hadith narrated by abu dharr a fairy allah his messenger so allah never seldom said in case there is not before him an object like the back of a saddle and muslims Salah prayer would be cut off by the passing of woodland a donkey and the black dog had conclude the black dog is a devil now this hadith is a place of dispute scholars and the most prominent scholar that disagreed with this hadith is do you know mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet Ali salatu salam when she heard this hadith she said oh my god may Allah forgive you you have made us women in the same category as dogs and donkeys this hadith tells us that if a person is not praying to a sutra he's not praying to a screen he is not praying to an object like the back of a sudden in front of him his prayer would be void if one of the three paths in front of him if a woman a dog or a donkey pass in front of him so it's an issue of dispute among scholars now the majority of scholars say that nothing voids your prayer and they say that it only decreases to adjure the reward of it so if you allow any of the three to pass through in front of you this decreases the adjure you have and some of them said well nothing cuts or interrupts your prayer except the black dog and they said that women and donkeys are exempted from this why because there are hadith that tell us that it's okay or so they said for example I assure may Allah be pleased with her reported to us that she used to lie down in front of the Prophet SAW said Allah while he was praying and whenever he wanted to perform prostration the area was so narrow she had to you know tell her to move a bit and she would take her feet away and he would process Allah sallam and once he stood for prayer she would put her feet back again so they say that women do not cut or void your the person's prayer when they intervene or come in front and as for the donkeys even have baths may Allah be pleased with him Emily with his father's hadith that he came to Mina while the Prophet was in the congregation with the companions and he left his donkey and the donkey used to go in front of the rose while he was praying so the donkey was rooming around and it did not cut anybody's prayer but scholars came back and said well this is different now we said about passing through so I sure was not passing in front of the Prophet so it's okay to lie down to sit or to stand passing is not acceptable as for the donkey the donkey did not pass in front of the prophets Allah Allah it passed in front of the people following the prophets of Solomon prayer which means that the Sutra or the screen the stream for the Imam is sufficient for those behind him so it's okay and this is a general fact known to everyone so again this hadith though it's a issue that scholars have disputed on yet the authentic verdict is that these three do interrupt the Salah and they avoid the Salah and Aisha's objection may Allah be pleased with her is not acceptable because the person who said these things is the prophet sallallaahu I am and one would say okay but Aisha should have known better well Aisha may Allah be pleased with her had her own conviction and this is what she thought but this was not the opinion of abu huraira abu dharr of the law M Nomura fell and three of them are from the Companions of the Prophet and three of them narrated the same hadith which means that this is what the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said now why this is not to us to decide some scholar said well the a black dog we know that it's devil so it cuts the prayer the donkey we know that the donkey is related to Devils it's not a cousin or so but the donkey does ba does his brain that a donkey brays when he sees a shape on you know a dog barks and a donkey brays so that when I don't keep Bray's it makes his sound he only makes this when he has seen a pond or a devil and the profits are seldom told us that and we know this by fact that Satan's or Devils have the ability to transform so they may look like a dog they may look like a donkey they may look like a black cat or so on and finally a woman interrupts your prayer not because she is impure not because she is an ijazah or anything but because she's beautiful and she may lose you and she may tempt you and that is why in prayer she's not allowed to speak or say subhanallah the only thing that she's allowed to do is to clap her hands because her son her her voice may have an effect on some people most of all we have 35 seconds go ahead I think a better explanation for the woman part is that this narrated by a Buddha would NSA even they said that the world she has to be menstruating for her to cut the prayer no when they said that she has to be menstruating meaning that she has to be she would have reached the age of puberty not that she has the period or misread she's in the state of Missouri a child would not invalidate your prayer I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next Fei Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
