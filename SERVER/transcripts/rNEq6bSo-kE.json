  "transcript": "so the question is if an Islamic Bank issues a credit card without any interest even after the grace period is over which is 40 days however they charge you an annual fee is this permissible the answer is if this annual fee is within reason in Saudi we have like 200 real a year very minimal and it's not something regarding the how much your limit is because if it is related to how much limit you can spend and your fee goes up this is not permissible the fixed amount 200 R 300 R is the annual fee for the card and expenses it's not for how much you borrow and this is interest this is okay inshallah and there's no problem in in that providing it is something that is within reason Allah Knows Best"
