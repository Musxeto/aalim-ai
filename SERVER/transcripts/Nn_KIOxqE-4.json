  "transcript": "uh yeah so she um I had a question uh which a friend wanted me to ask you uh I kind of know the answer I feel you're going to give to this but I'll just ask in case uh still um and so the question he asks is and I quote uh what should I do if my fiance says that she wants mahendi and Barat instead of just the nikah and the WMA function she wants she want she wants what he wants uh his fiance wants the mahendi and Bar function what is the bar function there these are just two um extra ceremonies which take part in the Indo par subcontinent and he only wants the nikah and Thea but I think the fiance wants those two extra functions as well okay first of all the mahindi is a gathering I think where they decorate the bride and the groom with h and decoration on their body if there is free mixing all or mixing between the groom and other women who are non Maham or the opposite this is totally prohibited but if it's only for women and they only follow a cultural thing that has nothing to do with the Hindus it's a cultural thing that even the Muslims do and they have pride in it has nothing to do with the Hindus no men are admitted no n Maham would ever see her in her H and decoration this is permissible the Barat thing I don't know about it but the same concept applies now if you as a groom don't feel like doing it you just simply say no I'm not going to do it I'm just going to do the wi this is my obligation in Islam you want to do the other two functions according to the Shar your father has to pay for it or you pay for it from your Mahar and Allah Knows Best"
