  "transcript": "is it okay just to read only for the last two and as well as and the last of and should the first two be longer than the others remaining raak it's a bit confusing because I would have expected the the question to be is it okay to read only in the first two because we know that the first two and after that you recite a Surah however the last two the sunah is to recite F only and you may add to that some Surah so I would rephrase the question what is the ruling on reciting a Surah after the fa throughout the whole prayers the answer would be it is to recite the Surah after the first two of and and the two and and it is permissible to recite the fa after the uh it is permissible to recite suras after the fa in the last two of and and in the last of as well it is permissible meaning that if you don't recite a Surah this is okay because it's up to you so this means that the Surah itself being sunah to recite in the first two raas and being recommended means that if I don't recite any other Surah than the in the four of or my prayer is valid and correct so I I hope this inshallah answers your question"
