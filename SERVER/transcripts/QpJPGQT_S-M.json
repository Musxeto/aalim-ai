  "transcript": "abdullah from canada he says how would we continue to be better than the day before of ramadan and to continue our perseverance throughout the whole month this is too generic abdullah yeah any i could spend an hour talking about so many things and maybe some of them would hit the nail on the head and some of them is just any um hot uh air rather than anything beneficial if you want to be better than the day before you have to have a system of monitoring your heart and your actions you have to start to count your sins before you go to bed every night and to hold yourself accountable before the day of judgment where allah would hold you accountable you have to check whether you are getting closer to allah or getting further away from him this is done by learning allah's beautiful names and attributes this is done by blocking all the means that facilitate sin such as your um pda your mobile your tv set the radio everything that distracts you and fills your life with sense you have to block it all you have to surround yourself with righteous practicing muslims who encourage you when you feel a little bit lazy after breaking your fast after fator they call you and say let's go to tarawih together let's go and attend a lecture between after taraweeh in masjid so and so so and so is delivering a speech they send you texts with lectures and with beneficial links it's it's a full package but it requires a lot of searching implementing and scrutinizing your life this is something that i'm saying maybe you're you won't benefit from it maybe someone in mozambique would benefit from it they said oh the sheikh said something beneficial because allah azza wanted to guide him not because what i said was beneficial so you have to sit down do your due diligence write down the things that get you closer to allah write down the things that you feel that they are hurdles in your way to paradise so that you would eliminate them and remove them and remember when you ask a question and you don't act upon it it becomes proof on you on the day of judgment and you would have wished you did not ask because now you know and allah would hold you accountable to what you have been answered"
