  "title": "Is Bitcoin / Cryptocurrency halal in Islamic point of view? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh brother LeBron says I'd like to know the details how Bitcoin tends to be Haram according to a point of view despite the fact that uh cryptocurrency might probably be accepted as a legal tender and medium of [Music] exchange the issue of Bitcoin is a recent one which means that it is not found or discussed by scholars in the past and unfortunately with such new events evolving some of them are to some crystal clear and some to to others may require the collaboration of Scholars economists and people involved in such issues to deliberate and to come up with a conclusion basically speaking Bitcoin is something that is recent and new and there are a lot of serious concerns when it comes to dealing with it whether it is from the origin where it came from from whether from from the aspect of sustainability and security it is known that it was found did in 2007 2008 by someone that is unknown and they say that his name is satosi Nakamoto and this person later on who was supposed to be Japanese the person with that name denied having anything to do with it then another person came from Australia or Canada claiming to be the one who founded it but generally speaking no one knows where originally it came from not only that when it started I think it was like 0.1 cent of a dollar so one Bitcoin was equal to .1 Cent something that is negligible in couple of years it jumped to $35 as of today if I'm not mistaken one Bitcoin that was .1 Cent now is equivalent to $111,000 plus this is ridiculous what is this this is not something that is physical you can touch it's not a coin it's not a bank note it's not a deed it's not a certificate it is something that is virtual it all is dependent on the peer-to-peer the blockchain and the logarithms that govern it which is known to only a handful of people who control it and who are Anonymous and no one knows who they are you cannot complain about it you cannot pretend that there is Justice or Injustice there's no one to talk to so it is as if you're throwing your money in a vacuum not knowing whether it will increase or decrease but most people don't care because all what they're looking for is quick profit and gain you remember the pyramid schemes the networking schemes that have been in the past and still ongoing today selling you a commodity that costs in the market a a single Euro they sell it to you for â‚¬200 claiming that there is only 5,000 pieces in the world of it and then after you pay that huge amount of money you qualify to Market it to others and you will get a percentage whenever someone enlists in the same Ponzi scheme it is all bogus it is all a hoax and they consume people's money through that man by Nature likes quick profit if someone with a long beard comes to me and says she give me money and I invest it for you and I'll give you Revenue that is beyond imagination and you will sustain a happy L I will trust him not because of his beard but because of the gain and the quick profit that I may make out of it Bitcoin is something like this and there are I think a lot of similar virtual currencies they're virtual you cannot touch them and ethereum and and and and so many 60 May some may make them up to 100 and they are on the right and it's not logical the fluctuation of the price now is it a currency or a commodity this is something we still have to look into because it is not a currency it's not backed by people it's not backed by government it's not backed by central banks or normal Banks so you cannot say it's a currency because no one deals with it except a handful of people country-wise only I think Germany Japan maybe Austria uh uh allow it because there is benefit to them from it taxations monitoring Etc and the biggest loophole in it that the price goes way up and it can also come way down so it's like a bubble waiting to be inflated and this what will happen soon now we all know that there is only a limit for the Bitcoins that is 21 million of it and once they reach the 21 million what will happen also we also know that it remains Anonymous when you deal with it so it's only a code that you given no one can trace it which means that it's an open uh gate for money laund ing drug laundry Drug Money uh Haram money you can just put it there and no one can trace you and this is Subhan Allah probably why all hackers when they do cyber crimes and they demand a ransom The Ransom has to be paid in Bitcoin so the the pirate of the Caribbeans the Disney move movie that was uh hacked and and they demanded ransom for it in Bitcoin also any Cyber attack any virus attack or threat can threaten your wealth and can take this currency so-called currency down to the ground so there is a lot of ambiguity if I have dollars and you have Euros we would like to exchange this is permissible in Islam with one condition and that is that it has to be hand to hand it has to be physical I cannot say Okay I accept this transaction I'll give you the money after half an hour this is Haram the transaction is void it has to be simultaneous give and take in Virtual currencies you don't have this the transfer is not simultaneous and you don't have anything uh uh uh physical to hold on to so this kind of ambiguity makes Bitcoin Haram in my opinion and Muslims should not get involved in such dubious transactions simply to make a quick Buck to make a a quick profit this is not uh an Islamic concept and one of the reasons of a lot of transactions being prohibited in Islam is the concept of ambiguity that there might be some sort of Deceit or uh ambiguity in knowing the end result of this transaction Allah Asel Knows Best"
