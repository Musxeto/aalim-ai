  "transcript": "Sonia says there's this tradition in Pakistan where when a girl gets married her brothers or uncle's hold the Koran over her head while she's being seen off to her husband's house is this from the Sunnah definitely not anyone who claims that this is from the Sunnah or related to the Sunnah or even something that is recommended is asked simply to provide us an evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah did the Prophet ever do such a thing so la la hora Salim the answer is no did the Companions ever do such a thing may Allah be pleased with them the answer is definitely no so if the Prophet didn't do it the Companions didn't do it who are we to do it when we say share but it's a blessing a blessing to hold the Quran over the head of a bride while she's walking until she reaches her husband's house or until he takes her this is humiliation for the Quran you're insulting the Quran by using it like an umbrella so yeah but we want the bell at the Baraka the Baraka the blessing is not attained by holding the Quran like those ignorant people holding putting a copy of the Quran in the glove compartment of their car masha'Allah - what kinda you have a Quran you read a lot you know I never touched it I never even opened it then why are you keeping it in your glove compartment he said it's for protection this is shirk if you think that the copy of a Quran would protect you physically this is shirk some of them put it under their pillow before they sleep this is humiliating the Quran this something that is not respecting the Quran itself by using it for such reasons so yes definitely this is wrong and in innovation"
