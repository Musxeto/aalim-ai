  "transcript": "foreign yes sir basically my question is a bit sensitive and at the same time it's very important to understand is it necessary to follow a particular mother or a sect because how I look at the situation is that I consider myself as a mushtahit and I'm interested in researching and finding out things okay are you are you are you a mushtahed in the sense that you know Arabic fluently you know yeah I I'm in a sense I that I have I'm interested in researching and finding out and analyzing things do you do you know Arabic fluently yeah I know Arabic fluently so if if this is the case and have you studied the Quran yeah I know how the rules and derivations is done in fig how are they how these things are derived I know that but the problem is that people tell that you cannot do it by at your own level you cannot interpret these things at your own level you have to particularly follow a mother or otherwise so I'm not a lame man I know how to have rules and derivations are done uh whether it would be fake or anything but the problem is that people didn't understand it uh uh yeah I what what I have at my own level understood that a person who don't have even the basic knowledge your namesake Muslim for him I believe that he should follow a particular mother because it would be safest okay I got your question is Han now first of all the brother says that he knows how to speak Arabic fluently and that he has done his basic studies and he knows the rules of us of the abrogations and the rulings of tafsir Etc if this is the case you are a student of knowledge and you can look into the different schools of thought and scrutinize them cross-reference them with the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations and come to a conclusion you're not obliged to follow a particular medhab providing you fit the conditions and this is between you and Allah if you say that you speak fluent Arabic allies your judge you don't care what people say or think you can follow whatever you want to follow because you have the capacity the ability and the know-how to know whether Imam shafri verdict over this issue is correct when it comes to touching a female whether it's your wife or your mom or your sister Imam shafri says this nullifies it doesn't which one to follow if you don't have the ability to distinguish you must select one Sheikh that you trust his knowledge his wisdom his religious practice and follow him all the way or a school of thought but if you have the ability and I mean the real Islamic scientific ability of knowing Arabic fluently knowing the Quran knowing the Hadith knowing the fake knowing then you can scrutinize these two opinions and reach a verdict without being"
