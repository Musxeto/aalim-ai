  "transcript": "the next question is uh what is expected of Muslims other than our prayers and charity towards the people of Gaza we don't have only the people of razza we have calamities all over the world but gazah stands out because the Injustice is so crystal clear that even the blind could see it even the disbelievers would join hands with with us and saying that this is unfair this is Injustice what's the point of a veto for the third time and the 36th time in the history of the United Nation against the Palestinians what is the message that you are siding by peace lovers democracy human rights all this baloney no this is a lot of BS and The Masks have been removed we know who the enemy is so yes as individuals what can we do nothing except to do pray Dua and to financially help in all means that we can because a penny matters and if you look at the way we spend our wealth lavishly W when we die nothing is going to help us in our Graves we won't be able to put a bul light can I have some light no it's dark it's lonely it's cold but whatever you give is going to be stored for you there the prophet says in a very beautiful Hadith on the day of judgment each one of you will be in the shade of his charity the narrator of this Hadith he says W not a single day passed except I would give in charity even if it's an apple if it's a donut if it's anything I just have to give something in charity every single day so we can do this Dua and don't think that Dua is something that is okay I'll make um 30 seconds Dua and that's it I've done my due diligence to Philistine what else do you want no you have to do Dua in every in between in the last third of the night when the rooster calls when it's straining when this when do select the times of answering your Dua and at the same time you have have to give thirdly you have to share their plight with the whole world to see these atrocities to know who our real enemies are those who are siding by Israel are our enemies we don't have to you be rocket scientists to know this and this is what they're trying for us not to abide and by and to believe we are Muslim Muslims we we don't have nationalities we don't have borders one brother in the east of the world is being tortured and killed he's my brother one brother in the west is suffering he's my brother they don't want us to do this no they want they to segregate us to separate us to feel that I am from this nationality I'm from that nationality we're different we better no we're not every time someone tells me about my ethnicity where are you originally from I said alhamdulillah my lineage is very prestigious and high and I I boast about that all the time my great great grandfather is a is a prophet he's Adam so what's the point who are you nothing it doesn't matter what document you carry what matters is what's in your heart what you do what you say how you believe how you feel towards your brothers so in a nutshell you can't do anything but to be peaceful but be vocal and according to the Quran and Sunnah don't exceed your limits share with the whole world their plight and may Allah make this our Jihad for their cause"
