  "transcript": "cancer he knows better that Camel mixed a camel milk mixed with urine yes so a friend of mine who was a chemistry teacher one of the best teachers in Jeddah I knew him for about 10 maybe 12 years we used to teach together I happened to bump into about three four years ago so I met the brother and he looked different you know now he's bearded and he looks practise saying not as before yeah so I said how are you have you been it's been like 10 years I haven't seen you he said well I unfortunately developed intestines cancer I was shocked panel law and he said that they extracted a portion of it surgically and the doctor said that there's no hope for you you're gone so I was sick I was devastated and then I got hold of a research by a professor in Jeddah Saudi Arabia who teaches in at university I think in the pharmaceutical college I don't know what they call it and her name is dr. fatten sheet and I he said I contacted her and she gave me dosages of milk mixed with urine of camels so I took this and for about five months on daily basis and then went and checked with my same doctor who was shocked and he said this is impossible it is all gone totally this appears and he said that this was three four years ago and Han bilder look at me and I said subhanAllah so I aired this story and I got like bombarded with emails everywhere asking me how to do that what are the dosages and I said I don't know I'm not an expert so I had to call the brother again and he told me about it and it is very simple the first three four days you take a mug of camel's milk only because this would disturb your stomach for the first couple of days until you get used to it and the funny thing is one of the sisters who called and asking me about it and I said to her for the first four days or so take only a mug of camel's milk she says female or male I said whoa you think a bit before you speak I said I said I never know that male camels have milk so no no no no sir I'm sorry sorry sir my bad so it happens it happens it's the old joke of what the cows drink yes so then after the third or fourth day you add one small teaspoon of camels urine and this you can ask whether it's female or a male but I have no idea I think there is no difference in Charlotte the second day you add two spoons of tea small sentiment in the mug itself and drink it the third day you add 3 spoon of small spoons of tea of urine in it and that is it to continue on this three spoons to the rest of the time so ever is just very little yes and it would not even you would not find that the taste is so offensive and and I asked him is it offensive the taste is it in the beginning maybe it's the fall it's merely the thought of you drinking everything is most of these medications you get pharmaceutical all sorts of things you don't know creatures eat also yes you know and he said that he nowadays drink it every now and then a couple of days three days he stopped doing it every day you have delays he's doing well and this was a prophetic remedy given by the Prophet himself a little of schnauzers mentioned innocent yes it's a hard Muslim to a group of newly reverted Muslims who came to Medina and fell sick so the Prophet told them to get out of the borders of Medina and go to the area where they collect the camels for sadaqa for charity for the count and to drink from the urine and from the milk and in no time they got well you know the thing you know sometimes people try to use these things against itself you know oh you're in this identity about drinking camel urine just because it doesn't sound right by the way if you go to India where the population is almost a billion it is a normal practice to add cow's urine to their food not to their medicine to the food as a delicacy and some get treated with a some wash with it so I mean in Islam it's not we have revelation from the Prophet that is the time to tell us that this is part of the religion here so no one Oh camel yes you know a lot of times you know the point is that when we know it is from the Quran Lucinda you know we should obey and not only that ok if you don't want to talk to you nobody's forcing you to drink it but the option is there so again when people criticize you have all the right to criticize whatever you don't like but to be fair look at the other aspects of Islam and compare Apple to Apple the pros and cons weigh them so if you tell me that mmm ok I looked into Islam and I found that 98% of it is excellent perfectly logical but there are these 2 percent that do not go down well my throat ok that's ok with me if 98 is okay with you this means that the to 2 percent that you are preceded unable to digest this is not because they're wrong this is because your thinking process is wrong and you should know that if 98% nothing on earth is 98% a false proof and excellent accept Islam"
