  "transcript": "say I have a question uh I said in the day maybe 30 times shahada because I think always that I make sh or kuur or something like that because when I say to for example to a disbeliever strong shot or maybe something like that I think this is praising the disbelievers and then I have was that this kufur what I make no it's not kufur it's not kufur and it is obvious my friend that you have a severe case of OCD that has been marinating for the past eight months to a year or more and shitan has finally reached the final recipe and now he is implementing it all of these doubts you're getting are nonsense saying to a CA good shot is not praising his kufur is praising his shooting ability or profession in his game there's nothing wrong in that there's no praising of his belief in Trinity or that Allah has an associate with him that would be kufur and saying 35 shahad a day shows that there is something wrong up there there are number of short circuit fuses that needs to be replaced so I would highly recommend that you book a counseling session with me if you can afford it or go to any Muslim knowledgeable Imam who would entertain your case and solve it for you inshallah"
