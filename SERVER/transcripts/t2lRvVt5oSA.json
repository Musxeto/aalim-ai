  "transcript": "um so by the way uh how can I start I am going through some personal issues and uh I've been making a lot of Dua for it and I've also I'm also following like the U etiquette of duas and I've read some of mk's work how to make Dua and everything and I try to follow you know the times where duas are accepted and everything but uh and I also do other things that bring me closer to Allah but the problem is sometimes when I back at home or the next day um you know the issues I make Dua for get worse and I'm I'm always unsure if this is now a test or this is Wasa you know what I mean yes I know what you mean Malik the Ohad sorry the issue is that when I ask Allah to grant me something and Allah grants me this is something I like and when I ask Allah some things and Allah does not give it to me this is what Allah wants so I prefer what Allah wants over what I want because Allah knows what's best for me so always be grateful for whatever Allah gives to you and whatever you ask Allah Asel to protect you from or to bring you and Allah does not do this and it becomes worse be content because this is best for you and Allah chooses only the best but you can't see this you don't see it because you don't know the future so keep on making Dua keep on thinking positive in Allah and be content and whatever is good for you will happen with the grace of Allah"
