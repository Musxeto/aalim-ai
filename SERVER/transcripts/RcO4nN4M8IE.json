  "transcript": "my question is regarding Miss prayers you said that if I miss a prayer and it is time for congregation I have to join the prayer with the intention of the M prayer and make up the extra Ras so my question is that what if I have missed P prayer and it is time for the congregation of Zar or jum prayer which prayer should I pray this is a hypothetical question Al is it not okay maybe Al is not with us anymore but yeah if someone misses F prayer would you expect that he wakes only seconds before thean of of of or the to be more precise this is hypothetical the guy has to wake up at 10 at 11 12 at the aan so if he wakes up at thean he should go and perform W and pray F in his home and then going to go attend the congregational prayer in the M but hypothetically if someone wakes up immediately makes W and attends the Masjid for because it's already has been given he may join them with the intention of F and once the Imam stands up for the third raak he remains seated finishing his uh and salutation upon the prophet offering Salam standing up and joining them in the remaining prayer with the intention of so if it is their third ra he prays the third and fourth once the IM gives Salam he prays his third and fourth and offer tah and Salam afterwards and Allah Knows Best"
