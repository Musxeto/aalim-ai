  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] Slavik manga raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu Salam of our economy booth matin Lena al-amin nabina muhammad in vara Ali he was happy as rain dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 16 in our series of valor benin no alia this hadith was narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him he tells us that a man came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he said to the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam i will see he give me a piece of advice counsel me so the Prophet said erase Auto Salam do not become angry and the Prophet kept on repeating it do not become angry do not become angry and the hadith was reported in the side now what do we learn from this hadith which is quite simple do not become angry what do we learn from it first of all we learn from it that the Companions of the Prophet re salat wa salam were very keen to learn about things that benefits them things draw them closer to allah azza wajal and that is why the Companions the great Sahaba did not think highly of themselves to the extent that we are perfect people with the best of the generations we don't need any advice we don't need anything extra no they used to come to the Prophet a little asar seeking his counseling seeking his advice and instructions and the prophet salallahu hari where you seldom did not give them one size that fits all he used to select what that person needed most and this is extremely important for those who counsel people for those who teach others it's important for a judge before giving his verdict to look into the circumstances and to evaluate it well it is good for a person who does marriage counseling to be extremely wise and careful when he gives his verdict or his advice a woman may come and say share my husband did this and that and the share without looking into the circumstances would go and say divorce him a man comes and complains of his wife divorce her share I have 12 kids from her divorce her class she's not good you have to look into the circumstances and to see what is fit for that person which might not fit another person and that is why companions of the Prophet Alice Oh Sam used to come to him and say advise me come to me he would tell a person that your tongue should be always frequently remembering Allah another one the Prophet tells him fasting is the best thing for you a third one the Prophet would tell him if you want to be with me in paradise you have to offer a lot of salat and you have to offer prostrations that is during Salah of course and in this case the Prophet looked at that individual and he knew that the best thing for him is for him not to become angry other companions the Prophet would encourage them to give charity if he feels that they are not that generous or to do this or to do that so the Prophet gives alayhi salatu salam the most appropriate advice to the individual that comes to him now for us we don't have this privilege anymore because the Prophet is that is a lot of Sam so what we can do is that we look into his advices look into his instructions and follow them maybe you pray a lot maybe you give charity a lot but when it comes to range issues and anger issues you have a problem so this hadith fits you like a glove you have to try your level best to fix your shortcomings in the light of what the Prophet is salat wa sallam advised us now let us look at the prophets advice sallallahoalyhiwasallam simple two words in Arabic La Tengo Baba in English do not become angry what is anger anger is a change of node where your blood boils and this happens because something took place in front of you or to you or you heard something being said to you or against you this was angers you and his anger considered to be something bad to avoid well there is good anger and there is bad anger good anger is the anger that pleases Allah Almighty so if someone sins in front of you and you laugh and say good job keep up the good work Allah is angry with you because this is a sin you should have been angered by it if your son does not pray on time and you're not angry if your wife doesn't wear the hijab and you're not angry if you see people being bribed or asking for bribes or dealing in usually or RIBA fornicating consuming intoxicants doing sin in general and you're not angered by that your sinful hear anger is recommended because it's a sign of your Eman when you detest such sins when you change from being normal into being agitated and angry of these filth being committed because it angers Allah soldier so here anger is recommended and praised and without anger we would be like vegetables someone attacks your wife or your daughter or slanders them or wants to harm them and you say to yourself hmm I will be peaceful I'll be calm I will not be angered by that this means that you're not human you're not a man this means that you are a vegetable anger is recommended here because it initiates self-defense it initiates feelings of protecting your loved ones so without anger you cannot have these feelings the anger that is not recommended that it is not permissible is the anger that leads to something that may be harmful to yourself or to others and this kind of anger is found in most of people you have road rage you have anger that is expressed on the streets when someone says bad things to you or when you have a dispute and you resort to violence that's why we have fights that's why we have disputes all because of anger and this is the negative anger that we are not supposed to have anger is something that leads to all evil and I'm talking about the negative anger and when the Prophet says adding is salatu salam do not become angry is he saying to us when someone attacks your wife don't become angry no the Prophet sallallaahu are you listening is not talking about the emotions that goes inside of us this emotion is uncontrollable what he is telling us actually is to control the consequences when you become angry what do you do next if you count from one to ten and try to control yourself that's good but if you explode if you become green and your clothes are torn then this is a problem that has to be resolved and this is why the Prophet advises you RA salatu salam do not become angry the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself became angry so many times was this positive or negative well if you look into the cases that were reported to us you'll find and learn that this anger was positive for example he once came out from his house and noticed that one of his companions had a ring in his finger he was angered by that he went to his companion he took the ring from his hand and tossed it away and he said why does one of you come to a fire stone wearing it in his finger and he left the Companions told the man the Prophet as salam forbade you from wearing a golden ring take it and give it to your wife or sell it and utilize the money the Prophet told you not to wear it but he did not tell you to throw it away the man said by Allah I will not take something the Prophet tossed and threw away and he left it the Prophet was angered because the man committed the sin by wearing gold men in Islam do not use gold at all because this is a sign of arrogance this is the sign of the disbelievers those who are arrogant those who love this life they wear expensive stuff like gold men are not allowed to wear gold in Islam we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back Thursday's provide in Britain we are facing one big problem that are you Muslim or burnish the space to talk in India back home ask are you a Muslim for Indian first and we Muslims should know how to reply how to turn the tables over the place to knock why Jim T cannot be regarded in that sense Father Son and Holy Spirit the opportunity to ask but if you agree that what the Christians say that he was

order [Music] is there anyone with courage and wisdom what is the truth and who has the courage trick poses because it's right watch truth prevail and lies perish in truth exposed by dr zakir naik next on peace TV Salaam alaikum and welcome back just before the break we were talking about the hadith where the Prophet Allah so lot sir I'm took the golden ring from his companions hand and being angered by it and we know that the Prophet Allah saw Sam as mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her told us that the Prophet erase a lot was never avenged himself at all no matter what people did or said to him he did not take that personally and he never avenged people for saying or doing these things unless there was a sin involved and if there was a sin involved and in this case he would become angry because people committed the sin not because something happened to him and he sort of said I'm wearing gold and drink by the way it is something that a lot of the Muslims nowadays are using which means that they're so far away from the Quran and Sunnah and that they're sinful for doing this especially when it comes to a wedding ring and wearing a wedding ring is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that it's not permissible because it has relationship or an origin from another religion the Christians use the ring when the priest comes and says in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost they call this as a sign of the bond of marriage in Arabia the Christians and also some of the Muslims they call it Memphis which means it's like a lock or something that locks the spouses in marriage and whenever you tell her brother take it officers know this would affect my marriage they think that taking it off affects their marriage I met a man from Arabia once who was wearing a golden ring and I advised him and I reminded him of Allah and he acknowledges it yes I didn't know that it's Halong now I know exact Allah here so I told him why don't you take it off is it I can't I'm married if I take it off this will affect my marriage so the sin of wearing gold is negligible to the sin of thinking that your marriage is affected by this ring because this is even shirk thinking that wearing a ring or taking it off would affect your marriage the Prophet Allah so Sam was angered once when he came from an expedition mother aisha tells us that a covered door in my house with a curtain that contained drawings of living creatures animals fish birds human beings it's a drawing so the Prophet came into the house at I saw Salam and when he saw the carpet he stood at the door and refused to enter and she says I said to the Prophet I still have some I seek Allah's forgiveness what have I done and the prophets face is unchanged and he was angry and he said Aisha didn't you know that the owner of these drawings will be punished on the day of judgement keeping a drawing a portrait is one of the major sins in Islam the Prophet tells us a lesson that the most severely tormented and punished on the day of judgement are those who draw these pictures of human beings of living creatures animals fish birds etc they're the most tormented on the day of judgement because of their drawings they are mimicking 'unless creation and this is a major sin so the Prophet himself alayhi salatu salam used to be angry but his anger is positive unlike the negative anger which a lot of the Muslims come now and complain about I receive phone calls from all over the world complaining and the common denominator share Salam alaikum I was angry that day and I gave divorce to my wife does my divorce take place Subhan Allah why were you angry he said well she didn't put salt in the food so I got a rage attack and I gave her divorce and they are trying to convince the person they're talking to that the divorce was due to severe case of rage and unfortunately a lot of the people who claim to have rage their rages selective and what do we mean by selective rage well they find it easy to express their rage to their children so they beat and abuse that kids and this is on Islamic this is Haram you're not allowed to beat your children in such a fashion some of them even go further to abuse their wives so he abuses her physically or mentally and he justifies this because he's got this rage that he cannot control and he's a big liar because if he's driving down the road and at a traffic light someone does something to him and he gets this rage attack and he wants to fight with that other person but when he finds him that he's 6 4 and he is bulkier than him and he is MMA fighter or whatever he has second thoughts and he gets back into his car with his tail between his legs why where is the rage I can do that with the kids and the wife but this man is so big he's huge he's humongous I can't stand a chance in front of him this rage is selective which means that you're a big liar if you wanted you could have controlled your rage with your children and with your wife the rage that is uncontrollable which is expressed even if you smash your face in the wall or fight someone who is twice as big as you and you know that you're going to be beaten up so bad yet you still insist on doing it this is uncontrollable rage that you have to try your level best to fix okay it's easier said than done how can I fix my shortcomings how can I fix this rage that I'm suffering from well there are a number of ways of doing this in the so he the Prophet Alice awesome was with his companions once and he saw two men fighting and this argument was quite heated up and one of them his eyes almost popped out and his veins are showing and his face was ready he's out of control and the Prophet looked at him at is a lot of Sun and said to his companions I know a word there is a sentence if he says it he would be relieved from what he's suffering what is that word irulu billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast devil or Satan so one of the Companions took this statement and went to the man and the man was still in his rage and anger he said to him that the Prophet says are in salat-u-salam that he knows the word that if you say Allah would relieve you from what you're suffering from I would obey Him in a shaytani regime now all of them are companions huh so one would have expected that the man would calm down and say how would we learn in a certain regime thank you for the advice brother but because the man was in he rage and anger he rejected the advice of the Prophet or a sorcerer he said to the man in an angry voice go away what do you think I am do you think I'm crazy what did the man tell you he told you just to seek refuge in Allah from Shaytan but look what Shaitaan made you do he continued to be angry and enraged and this shows you what Shaitaan can do to you when you are angered and when you are in such a case also one of the remedies is that the Prophet tells us Ali saw some when someone is angered if anyone of you is in a state of rage if he is standing he should sit down so whenever you're fighting in and find this region you want to do something evil sit down and if you have this feeling while sitting down lay down on your side some scholars say that wherever your angered perform you do because Satan is from fire and would do extinguishes fire so by performing woudl you would come down among the things that would oppress your rage and control it is to zip your mouth so many times arguments arguments nagging makes you more angry so if someone talks to you and argues with you zip it don't talk don't reply and this would help you immensely in getting calmer and losing this rage of yours also it is something that we should condition ourselves to as we go to the gym to workout as we run mile after mile to increase our stamina and fitness and agility it is important to coach ourselves to train ourselves and what helps us train ourselves in curing our rage problems and anger issues is to remember the reward that Allah has prepared for us Allah Allah tells us to haste to race for a paradise that is as wide as the heavens and the earth and this was prepared for those who oppress their anger so if you want a lot to forgive you learn how to oppress your anger and not to expose it and not to act upon it and this is what allah azzawajal said to abu bakr in surah 10 nor may allah be pleased with him when he pledged and swore not to spend a single penny on his cousin must I have a father who slandered his daughter Aisha his cousin is poor but how dare he slandered I assure the wife of the Prophet and my daughter by Allah I'm not gonna give him a single penny Allah Almighty told Abu Bakr in surah an Noor Fatiha for well yes Fajo and they should forgive and they should pardon don't you want a lot to forgive you and Abu Bakr when he heard this ayah as the Prophet was reciting it to him he said by Allah I want a lot to forgive me and to pardon me I make you my witness o prophet of allah that i will never stop spending money on my cousin and for you if you want allah social to forgive you and to pardon you then forgiving pardon your wives the children your neighbors your co-workers your next of kin your relatives if you do this if you oppress your anger Allah Azza WA JAL would forgive you and pardoned you this is all the time we have until we meet next time fear allah assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh [Music] [Music]"
