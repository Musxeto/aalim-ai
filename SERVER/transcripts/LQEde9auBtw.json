  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i don't have money so what should i do everybody's slaughtering everybody's offering the sacrifice well if you are able to pay it off there's no problem in borrowing and offering here now and pay it later on as in the case of a an employee who gets his salary on monthly basis so if you borrow to offer the odd here anticipating that your salary is going to come after a couple of weeks and then pay off your debt there's no problem if you can buy it through installments in halal way there is no problem but if you are truly poor and you do not have the means to pay your loan back then it is not at all recommended for you to occupy your self with a debt that you do not have the means to pay it off it does not become mandatory upon you not even recommend it so skip it and next year insha'allah allah will give you the means to do that [Music] foreign [Music]"
