  "transcript": "foreign oh the battle is about to take place but it never took place we're discussing the battle of al-hamduk or al-ahzab better known as the battle of the trench or of the different parties that came and collaborated to attack islam and the muslims the prophet alaihis was informed that the polytheist of quraish alongside with the polytheist of gratifan from the east of medina have collaborated to come and attack the muslims along with their allies and the surrounding tribes they came with an army of ten thousand men the only way that they could penetrate medina was through the northern part of medina so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was advised by his companion salman al-farisi to dig a trench alongside the northern borders of medina and this would make a barrier for the pulphus not to cross that area the prophet managed to do this and it took them between two to four weeks to finish digging this long and big trench the prophet sallam instructed his companions to take the the women and the children and put them in a fortress for bani harita called al-fari and so they did at the time all what the prophet sallam and his companions were worried about were the enemy of the polytheists of the disbelievers inside the medina well they were outside the medina they're coming so the prophet was inside the medina and he they were only worried about this army coming from outside of medina there were no straight face-to-face fighting because when the enemy army reached the north of medina they were surprised to see this trench and they said that this is not something that the arabs knew about it is something that was imported which also gives us the lesson that muslims do not restrict themselves to what they know they have to import knowledge they have to import technology and science so that they can apply this in the benefit of spreading islam and this is exactly what we're doing if we limited ourselves to preaching in mosques and in in circles of of of knowledge then our spread would be limited and our benefit would not exceed those who are attending but by utilizing the technology the satellite channels the the the filming and and these uh equipments accompanying it alhamdulillah we can manage to outreach our call to islam worldwide so if there is a limit then between imitating the non-muslims and taking their ways of of life and how they deal with each other all like the daily life the daily life basically and there's a difference between this and between taking the technology and how they are advanced more than us basically first of all it's not their technology because they took these sciences and this knowledge originally from the arabs it was the arabs who invented a mathematics it was the arabs who invented the zero if you look at their uh numbers and calculations they did not have zeros and to write a figure of 150 or 200 they had to write so many uh characters in order to say that this is a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand it was the arabs who introduced the figure zero the sciences of chemistry physics uh algebra and so on all came and originated from the muslims not only the arabs the muslims themselves so it's not their sciences it's something that is not attributed to a country it is revolving so islam tells you not to imitate the non-muslims in what is considered to be part of their religion or part of their own customs that identifies them from others but to copy and imitate what is good for you you have to have a heater in your house you have to have a boiler in your a bathroom for example when it's cold air conditionings cars planes these are not of their customs and it's not part of their religion so it is okay for you to take whatever you need from that what about the clothes well this would also make us shift from talking about seerah into talking about but also the clothes if they're identified with a particular set of clothes then we may we cannot use that but for example if a person wears a suit now wearing a suit like muhammad is wearing is not considered to be of the non-muslims because the majority of muslims countries wear such type of clothes so it's not an identity of the non-muslims it's a joint between all people therefore it's okay for us to use going back to the seerah when the enemy army came to the trench they were astonished and they did not know what to do and imagine there were 10 000 of them not 100 or 1000 so they went around medina and could not find a place to penetrate it from so the only way for them to go inside and fight was to go through the trench they tried to look for weak points but they couldn't find they were frustrated because they came all the way to fight and they are unable to do so the muslims were prepared and ready with archers so whoever wanted to come in they would throw him with their arrows and that's why there wasn't an actual war they did not engage one incident five riders of their uh bravest soldiers penetrated and managed to penetrate the trench and they were led by one brave warrior by the name of amr even abducted and wood or wood was one of their gods so this man he was very brave very strong he alongside with even and and he has no relation to um they all five of them penetrated the trench and went to the muslims to fight with them abducted challenged the muslims to send him someone to duel with him and they were all hesitant the only one that came out was and alibi may allah be pleased with him met hammer even close to the trench and he started cursing him and slandering him provoking him you know before the war he called him names and amr was mad as hell so he went to fight with ali ali was what 20 years old 22 years at max he fought with ali and they exchanged blows he was a fierce and strong fighter but ali may allah be pleased with him was even stronger and braver and at the end ali prevailed with the grace of allah and he killed amber abdul and the riders who were with him fled and went back to their camp eventually four of the mushrikeen of the enemy died throughout this battle only four and some narrations say ten and from the muslims some say five or eight died and also it was not face-to-face fights it's most of it was by arrows and among those who were injured at the very end of this battle sad ibn mahad may allah be pleased with him he is he was the master of and the leader of the house tribe of the ansar he had suffered an injury through an arrow that hit a vein or an artery in his arm and it kept on bleeding now when we go on to talk about this battle the muslims had only the northern front to care about but they did not know that the jews inside of medina were doing the tricks to undermine the muslims army's efforts to defend medina these efforts were led by who was a prominent jew he went to bani koreda and haye was from bernie nadir he went to bani koreva and he knocked the door of the master and leader of that tribe cabin asset and he told him that i want to talk to you now cabin asset did not open the door he said go away i don't i don't you're bad news i don't want to even look at you so he kept on begging him please open the door let me talk to you i have come to you with the honor and with the privilege that you will never ever regret and he would say you have not come with anything that is good go away and he kept on begging him begging him until he opened the door when he opened the door for him he told him what you want so yeah he told him i among the dignitaries of bani nadir managed to get the armies of quraish and the armies of ratafan stripe to come and attack medina and they have ten thousand strong men ready to launch their offensive on medina and annihilate the muslims so this is the pride and this is the time of your life to be part of that what was kaaba assets answer we have a short break and after that inshaallah we will continue he comes to you the truth and the attribute of the one who created you that he's one and alone running this universe that he doesn't become born he doesn't die he doesn't eat and go to the bathroom this is not god we've got problems here yeah this doesn't make sense who was jesus worshiping and this is recorded in the gospel despite all of the other issues about the gospel we put those aside we just say it's mentioned there that jesus worship god who protects us could not swallow what happened to him and his people after they were kicked out of their village of bani nader and he went to the leader of bani kureida kab in assad and he kept on begging him till he opened the door and once he got in he informed him about the current situation and how the dignitaries of bani nadir managed to collaborate the forces of quraysh alongside the forces of the tribes of najd khattafan and so on to come to attack medina and annihilate islam and he requested that the people of bani quraila deny and reject all the treaties between them and the prophet and attack the prophet and the muslims from behind because they were inside of medina at the beginning rejected that and he told that you are crazy we have not encountered anything from muhammad and his people accept faithfulness and fulfillment of their promises nothing we we have no bad experience with them so you're crazy so cap so hey insisted and kept on promising cab that you have to do this this is your life chance if you miss this then you're not going to be able to gain the powers and the influence you had over madina before the prophet sallam came this power is gone now everybody is following muhammad that is awesome and you are you will become a minority and a weak one and he kept on trying to convince assad until he succeeded and this was very unfortunate for kaab what qab did afterwards was to tear the treaty and to break all the promises he gave to the prophet this took place in the whole tribe of bani koreva with the exception of and they are a division of that they refused to collaborate with them and they went out of their fortresses denying and not approving of what their leader did which means that they're not all alike the jews are not all alike there are among them people of wisdom and of fairness now this was spread all over medina rumors were there the hypocrites were using this and frightening the muslims terrorizing them that the polytheists are going to jump on you they're going to kill you and the jews from behind you are going to do the same and the hypocrites themselves started spreading rumors everywhere and whenever they sat with the muslims they kept on trying to weaken their will by saying that your prophet sallam promises you that you will have the castles and palaces of persia of the romans of yemen and yet look at you you're filled with fear you're hungry you're cold and you don't have enough power to withstand the offense of the mushrikeen of the polytheist the prophet alaihis just to make sure had two of his companions saddha brahmath and said both from ansar one is the master of the house and the other is the leader of the hajj raj he sent them to verify the fact that the jews have broken their treaties with the prophet salallahu but he told them that when you come back don't be explicit don't tell tell me directly that they broke their promises and treaties so that the people would not know and then they would feel more afraid just hint that to me so they went to the jews and outside the gates of the fortresses they started communicating with the leaders and they told them we came from the prophet of allah the messenger of allah muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam wanting to verify the fact that you're still our allies and they answered them in a very bad manner they slandered the prophet alaihis they cursed islam they said what do you mean by muhammad the prophet of allah who is the prophet of allah he is no prophet of allah and they said very bad things about islam so the prophet allah while was he was with his companions came back and as soon as he looked at them they said abu and qarah and these were the two tribes that tricked the prophet allah and took ten of his favorite companions and kill them on the way they pretended that they were muslims in what is known as and the prophet sallam understood what they meant so now the muslims were threatened from three sites from the northern area from two sides from ghattafa and from quraish and from inside from the southern area from the behind their lines from the jews side the jews did not stand idle they wanted to participate in the defeat of the muslim army so they sent one of their spies to spy on the fortress of fire where all the women and children were so that if you could find a weak spot he would bring the soldiers and attack the women and children may allah be pleased with her the aunt of the prophet do you recall her son his name the cousin of the prophet you always have to connect the companions to each other to their fathers and mothers their cousins because they're all together in so many ways and this gives you a lot of recognition to their roles and to their relatives connection you spoke about him in battle of when the prophet said to him to his mom yes and and prevented her from seeing her brother hamza bin abdullah now sophia was in that fortress of al-fari among the children and women and alongside was hassan ibn thabit the poet of the prophet alaihis salatu and one of the companions but he was not a man of war he was he did not know how to carry a sword or to fight so he was among them and safiyah may allah be pleased with her so that jew spying so she told hassan go down and kill this man before he goes to the jews and expose our fortress to them hassan said by allah sophia you know if i knew how to fight i wouldn't have sat down here with you i can't do this so she being a very strong and tough woman went down took a poll that usually they built an erect a tent a very heavy one and went down and saw the man and killed him with her own bare hands she hit him on his head with that pole and the man was dead and she went up the jews once they saw this or found the dead of their spy they recognized and realized that there had to be men inside protecting the women so they did not dare to attack it now the muslims were terrified the jews were to the right to the south of madinah and the polytheist armies were to the north of medina and allah recorded this in the holy quran it says what translates to behold they came on you from above you and from below you and behold the eyes became dim and the hearts gaped up to the throats and you imagined various vain thoughts about allah the almighty in that situation where the believers tried the believers were tested they were shaken as by a tremendous shaking whose hearts is a disease now those hypocrites and those who had the disease in their hearts say allah and his messenger promised us nothing but delusions behold a party among them among the hypocrites said you men of yathrib you cannot stand the attack therefore go back and abandon them ask for leave of the prophet salallahu sallam saying truly our houses are bare and exposed though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away now this illustrated to us what the feelings were how the muslims were shaken and tried and tested it was a hard time and towards at the same time physical war and psychological war at the same time physical it wasn't because no attacks took place they were no engagement but it was completely mental now they were afraid they were petrified they were cold they were hungry and they were afraid for their wives and children behind him the hypocrites were bragging and saying that all what we were promised were delusions nothing had come to affect and they were also asking for permission to go back to their houses allegedly because they were exposed and they were not exposed as allah tell us a lot of the hypocrites would say o people of yathrib and gethrib is the name of medina but this has not been used by muslims and and this is a point that i'd like to point out that some authors may say well the prophet went to yathrib and in yathrib they did this and that and this is not permissible yethrib was the name of medina before islam when islam came the prophet sallam changed the name into medina or taiba or taba all of these are names of medina in the muslims era now it is not permissible for muslims to call it yathrib yet allah mentions this name in the quran because it was said by non-muslims the hypocrites they say you cannot withstand the attack so what are you doing you have to leave the jews kept on sending and supplying the polyphased army with food and provisions from inside medina they had their ways into trying to smuggle that outside the skirts of medina and back to the polytheist army in form of support and the prophet sallam realized this and he had about 20 camels intercepted with provisions from the jews to the polytheists i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time um hmm"
