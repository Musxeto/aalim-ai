  "transcript": "today I have a question about the masjids here because I know that a lot of announcements are actually forbidden in the mids but all kind of announcements go through our mids here I want to know if some of them are Hal or everything is actually forbidden for example here uh like the Beggars they will come in and when you are doing the zik that we start talking about the stories and everything please help me and all that inside the Masjid even if a politician is coming or something like that they will announce it if there's an Islamic conference They will announce it everything goes through the magic like collecting the money if somebody's dead and newborn somebody's going to meca an IM came back someone is sick vaccination period like everything goes through our Masjid here like the announcements and everything I just wanted to know if it is halal or Haram or like some is halal some is Haram and so on it is not permissible to announce announcements in the Masjid as per the Hadith where the Prophet saidat if someone loses an item and he makes an announcement so that people would direct him for it this is prohibited and if someone wants to sell something it is prohibited so in short using the Masjid for political reasons or to announce something that is commercial or to announce something that is not related to the Masjid to the Daw to the Islam and the Muslims is prohibited announcing that next week we have a scholar coming to make a lecture we have a conference about marital rights and responsibilities we uh are uh conducting a um trip for those who are interested said may they may register with the Imam these are thing related to the Masjid to the community to Islam and it's not commercial it's not to gain money to collect money collecting money for the Masjid and paying the bills or building it it is inshallah part of the Halal uh um announcements but it shouldn't be abused and done every single time rather one should select the time other than that begging or telling people about your story this is totally prohibited and Allah Knows Best"
