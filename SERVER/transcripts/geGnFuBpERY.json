and he'll be delivering another lecture and there's lectures every day here in until next Thursday all should be starting something like 6:30 to 7:00 inshah Brothers alhamdulillah the title of this talk is the walking Quran and I did not like the title very much though it is or it has been used by a number of D and Scholars before and the reason I did not like it because as you all know the of is that the is so it is one of Allah's beautiful attributes and hence it would not be appropriate to describe it as to be walking or to associate it with anything that might that did not come to us from the salaf and hence it should be kept away and respected not that it is not respected when we say this but it is not something yeah encouraged to uh uh call or say about the Quran so what is the origin of this title well before we go to the origin we would like to remind you and myself that Allah did not send any Prophet or messenger except am am I loud yeah because it goes on and off so my hearing I think just when you get closer to the mic it does that okay okay so Allah has sent a miracle with every prophet and every messenger is this correct or not it is correct do we see or do we touch or can we say for granted that this is the miracle of prophet Musa Prophet Isa Prophet uh uh no Prophet ibraim can we say that these are the Miracles and can we touch them no we cannot do we believe in them definitely we do because they're mentioned in the Quran and the prophet told us about them and this what makes our religion unique if you go to the Jews they'll tell you w our Prophet MSA peace be upon him had this and that and he has the stick he had the hand he had this snake that ate all the other snakes and so much mallah and he got the sea open and he crossed it and Pharaoh died and drowned we simply say we believe you but we we can't we don't see anything but we believe you because our Prophet told us so and we believe you if you go to the Christians they say mashallah Jesus used to Cur the uh H leopard he used to cure the deaf born deaf blind he used to give life to the death with the permission of Allah the Jews say sorry I can't believe you I can't see anything we as Muslims we say yes this is correct we we completely believe in that will we come to our prophet am the Muslims say yes we believe that the moon was split into two as Muslims does anyone dispute or doubt this the the moon was split at the time of the prophet and the pagans was were looking up we believe that the water used to Spring from between his fingers we believe that the uh uh tree used to talk to him the camels used to talk to him the Rocks used to greet him and offer him Salam the Jews and Christians say sorry we we we can't believe that we have to see it so what is there for us to show them we have the Quran we have the ultimate Miracle of all miracles we have the speech of Allah that is a miracle to the end of time it is a miracle that we can produce and give anyone who disputes it Allah says in the Quran and we send down from the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe by Allah Quran is a healing to our souls by Allah Quran is a healing to those who believe and it's mercy and that is why Muslims when they have a problem they turn to the Quran for salvation for healing for Comfort because they know that this is the word of Allah the walking Quran why is this title given to this lecture because there is a misunderstanding among some of the so-called Scholars and D the of may Allah be pleased with her when one of the approached her and his name Isam Oram I forgot and he said mother tell me about the character of the prophet wasam and she said my son did you read the Quran she said yes he said yes she said his character was the Quran Allah now this answer is quite ambiguous but it is General ambiguous in the sense that okay what does this mean the prophet was the greatest messenger of Allah and that is why Allah revealed his greatest books to him and that is why this great book REM will remain until the day of judgment and if you would like to explain how the Quran was the character of the Prophet you have to describe the prophet sallam may Allah have mercy on his soul he had a beautiful description taken from all the books of the Sunnah over the prophet Alat wasam he said The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam by far was the forbearing and the the and and the most tolerant person the most courageous and brave the most fair and the most modest and bashful sallallahu alaih Al wasallam he was the most generous he would never ever allow one dirham or one dinar to remain in his house and if it was overnight and he did not spend it he would go out of the house looking for any needy person to give it to him he would not save he would not keep money in his house the only thing that he would keep in his house would be the provision of his family for a whole year and what do we mean by provision barley grain dates and that is it he would keep it and the problem was that he never ever was asked for something and would not give those who ask him whoever asks him something he gives them and if he doesn't have he goes back to his houses takes from next year's provision and give it to those who are in need and that is why in few months time the prophet would be himself in need and that is why mother AA says may Allah be pleased with her the fire would not be lit in the houses of the Prophet for two consecutive months they would not cook anything for two months 60 days imagine this if I don't eat cooked food for two days I die it has to be cooked it has to be fried it has to be different types of food the prophet for 60 days he would not have this and they asked her oh mother AA then how did you live what did you eat she said nothing we had only water and dates this was our only food for two months in a row and the prophet never touched a woman never touched the hand of a woman that was not his Maham or that was not his wife or that was not his slave he would never touch any such a woman whenever he entered the house the prophet was like anyone of you she says mother and the prophet was the most modest and the most bashful of all men though he was was the complete and perfect man no man was ever perfect and complete as him s wasam he was so modest and bashful he would never ever look at the men speaking to him straight in the eye when someone talks to me I I look him into the eye the prophet was so modest and bashful he would he would look somewhere else he would listen but he wouldn't look he would not embarrass the People by looking them straight in the eye sallallahu alaihi wasallam whenever he was inv invited he would accept whether it's a slave or it's a free person he's invited he goes he would accept any type of gifts he would not feel arrogant and saying No this is too little even if someone gives him a glass of milk sallallahu alaihi wasallam he would accept it but he would never eat from charity charity does not beit the prophet nor his family he would answer the call of a slave girl the call of a needy whenever a young slave girl would come to him she would take her his hand and walk with him and he's following her and all the streets of Medina because she has a problem she wants to talk to him he would never say I don't have time I'm busy take an appointment sallallahu alaih wasam he would never become angry for himself at all no matter how bad you treated him or abused him he would never avenge himself only if a sin was committed he would avenge Allah he would be angry for the sake of Allah subhah wa ta'ala and if there was a need for the truth to be adhered to he would do that even if this brings harm to him or to his companions the truth has to be implemented one of his best friends was assassinated once and they found his body next to the neighborhood of Jews so definitely those who killed him must have been the Jews the prophet investigated but he did not accuse the Jews because he does not have evidence and this is Islam there is no uh uh um jumping to the gun there there are no there is no need for thinking or speculating no evidence that is it what happened the prophet Alam in times of need gave the blood money to the family of his slain companion 100 camels though the Muslims were in great need but this is something that as a Muslim he has to adhere to he gave the blood money to that slain companion and he did not do anything to the Jews the prophet Alat wasam used to be hungry like everyone else the companions used to show their bellies because they used to tie a piece of rock so it would stop the Pains of hunger the prophet would reveal his belly tying two stones two big rocks on his belly because he was as hungry as they were sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam that the Hadith tells us that he was never full for three consecutive days of the bread made of barley he would probably be full one day two days but three days in a row never this was the prophet wasam and he did not suffer because he didn't have he said Allah told me if you wish I will make the whole area you see ofb Makkah I'll turn it into gold and he gave me the choice would you like to be a prophet king or a slave messenger and he said no I'd I'd rather be a slave messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam he would accept any invitation to Aima he would visit the ill of his companions even if they live at the outskirts of Medina he would follow the funerals and he would walk alone without any guards among his enemies he doesn't need any guard he was the most humble among all people sallallahu alaih wasallam never you will find any signs of arrogance in his Hadith or in his description he used to have the most eloquent of speech but he was not long winded sometimes you find people who are eloquent but they speak for hours Without End the prophet you can count the number of words he utters you can count them this they're 10 they're 15 they're three and a great Hadith that was explained in all books of that's it these are two words and look at the number of volumes written on this rule the prophet Alam would not be impressed by anything on this D he would wear whatever he finds he would ride whatever he finds he rides a camel if not a horse if not a mule if not a donkey and he has no problem at all in having some of his companions some of his slaves some of his relatives mounting behind him on his right the great Hadith of ABB the young one I'll teach you words that will benefit you Abbas was 10 or 11 years of age and the prophet is addressing him because he was riding behind him and the prophet was almost 60 years of age yet he did not feel arrogant he utilized the time teaching this 10-year-old child who became one of the greatest Scholars of Islam he used to walk in the streets but sometimes he used to walk barefooted sometimes he used to wear a cloak sometimes without a cloak sometimes he puts a turban or a cap sometimes he does not wear anything on his head he used to love perfumes but he abhor and hated foul smells so anything that smelled bad he would be away that is why Anna says I've served the prophet for 10 years by Allah never a day I found a foul smell out of him sometimes we pray in this Masjid and the brothers next to you yeah I know Brothers have odor these guys have o dear it is so bad this is not a muslim's way you're always perfumed you're always showering always clean your ORS smell because this is what identifies you from the non-muslims your personal hygiene this is how the our Prophet was he used to sit with the poor he used to eat with the needy we find this unacceptable and that is why tomorrow you have a wedding of your daughter of your sister inshallah who do you invite if you have a list and write their annual income you will never find someone who is classified to be poor or needy they're all rich though you know some why I feel disgraced I feel humiliated these guys are Posh they have to have the prophet was not like that at all he used to sit and eat and socialize with those who are poor and needy and nevertheless he used to also honor the righteous and the pious he used to soften his words with the dignitaries even if they were not righteous or Pious because he's calling them to Islam he used to connect to the next of King he used to always bring them closer but not closer than those who are better than them in righteousness and piety he would not never be harsh to anyone never be harsh to anyone and I tell you I can remember tens and hundreds of cases of me being harsh to people today not in my lifetime the prophet would never ever be harsh to anyone he would accept anyone asking him for forgiveness so even the Hypocrites come to him oh prophet of Allah we for forgive us we did this we did that we couldn't go with you and he accepts it sallahu alai wasam he would joke with his friends but never say except the truth never lies but he was joke s wasam and he would laugh but not loudly his laughter is a simple smile he would see people play permissible kind of games and he would not detest it he would not object to it he would himself raise his wives ASA tells us may Allah be pleased with her when was the last time you RAC your wife one say I was running away from her when she was trying to hit me with the high he shoe but alhamdulillah she couldn't catch me this is not a race this is running for your life when was the last time you went with your wife and had this Quality Time Racing playing she's not only there for cooking and cleaning and receiving orders from you what to do and what not to do this is how the prophet used to be with his wives whenever he was with his companions sometimes there would come Nomads the bedwin who are or who were disrespectful to him they would raise his their voices in his presence and he would not say anything he would wait until they come down the prophet had slaves males and females sallallahu alaihi wasallam but he would not have an edge over them he would wear what they wear he would eat what they eat and he would command his companions to do the same with their slaves he would utilize his time so watch and evaluate the day of the Prophet Alat and you would find it 100% for the sake of Allah whether he's playing with his wives whether he's battling whether he's teaching whether he's praying whether he's uh uh fasting whether he is going to to reconcile between two who were fighting whether he goes to a slave man who was married to Bara for example you know Bara her husband was and they were both slaves and got the chance to buy herself out and she became free the minute she became free she had the option to stay with her slave husband or to get her freedom because now she is free so she chose freedom and she did not want her husband went to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah intercede I love my wife so much the prophet went to B and said B why don't you go back to she said the prophet of are you ordering me he said no I'm just interceding she said if this is the case I don't want him the story says that M used to walk behind her in the streets of Medina crying and weeping and his beard filled with tears the prophet is going to intercede for a slave man yes this was the prophet wasam he would never look down at any person whether poor whether in need whether sick he would never fear any King in his wealth and in his kingdom he calls both the poor and the rich the Kings and those who are not Kings and sallallahu alaih wasallam would not make a difference between them all this was the prophet where did he get this from mother says do you read the Quran he said yes his character was the Quran and that is why we find the the the distance between us and the Book of Allah it is so vast it is so far if you look at the companions may Allah be pleased with them did they love the Quran they left the Quran more than their lives abdah may Allah be pleased with him he's newly wed and after two weeks of his marriage his father abdah goes and visits his daughter-in-law and he says how is your husband with you and she said mashallah he's the best of the Arabs he's the best of men he prays all night and he fasts all dayah beautiful description was a smart man he understood what she meant he does not approach her until the moment she's still a virgin because if he prays all night and he fasts all day when is he going going to have any intimacy with her so he complained to the prophet Alat and the prophet summoned him bring him and the prophet said Abdullah do you recite the Quran he said yes oh prophet of Allah every how many days he said I complete the Quran Once a Night once a night he prays night prayer the not only thatan in an authentic Hadith may Allah be pleased with him in the season of Hajj you know the people in the season of Haj they're not very comfortable they're always wey and tired isn't that true because of the environment the man says I prayed in next to IIM and after we concluded the prayer I saw a man standing next to me and saying allahar praying on his own meaning he's praying probably sunah voluntary and I looked it was and he prayed one just before F prayer with the whole Quran from in one so these people had this love for the Quran a little bit like our love to it yet they show it more than we do abdah said I recite it once every night the prophet said no you have to do it once every month meaning every night you recite one so every month you finish the Quran so every year you finish it 12 times minimum he said I can do more than that see do it in 20 do it in 10 and then the prophet told him do it in seven no more s wasallam in another narration do it in three and no more they were fighting for more obligations and we're fighting for more freedoms Subhan Allah seriously okay what is anyhow um may Allah be pleased with him described the people that carry the Quran so we all pretend to be carrying the Quran in our hearts Mas says the person who who prays and who carries the Quran should be known by his night when the people are asleep he should know be known by his fasting when the people during the daytime are not he should be known by his grief why everybody is jubilant he should be known by his weeping while everyone else is laughing and he should be known by his silence while everyone else is speaking and talking and everything the companions may Allah be pleased with him with them they would not memorize the Quran full stop they would only take a selective number of ayas 10 ayas study it know what's in it implement it in their lives memorize it and then move on to another set we have lots of people who memorize the Quran but they're not practicing they're not doing what's in it so what use is it to the Islamic umah what use is it to you as an individual if you're reciting and memorizing an Ayah that curses you in the day and the night and that is why IB Omar may Allah be pleased with him one of the greatest Scholars of Islam memorized Surah Al Bak in how many years in eight years it took him to memorize Al Bak why because of the 10 a 10 a until he mastered everything single thing in it the prophet character was the Quran so now what would what do we benefit from all what we have heard we have to be like the prophet he used to forgive he used to Pardon sallallahu alaih wasallam not only that he used to honor those who do this to him now are we like this the prophet was walking with an us Allah be pleased with him with a very harsh cloak on his back and nothing underneath it's made of wool and imagine him walking and someone startling him from behind grabbing him and pulling him so hard that it affected his shoulder sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his neck not only that the man is saying a nomad a bidan yeah Muhammad give me from the manone you have you from the money you have it's not your money it's Allah's money by Allah someone does this to me I'll put him on the ground and jump on his belly for seven eight times until his guts are out crazy talking to me like this this is the prophet of Allah what does he do he does not even say harsh things to him he does not even frown in his face he smiles and tells his companions give him money Allah I ask you by Allah each and every one of you those who are married do you dare treat your wife like the prophet treat treated that bedwin I get so many complaints from the M from the wives complaining about the men W I had a complaint of a a woman who was married for more than 30 years to her husband her husband is over 60 and she said to me that my husband stopped talking to me for a year now and we live in the same house and we live on the same bed I didn't believe her her daughter called me she said by Allah my father is like this why my mother did something that is stupid in the house we could even remember it my father shut down and he doesn't speak to us anymore does this man know the Quran does this man know what's written in the Quran is he following the Prophet by Allah he's not the prophet did not only learn the Quran and implement it in his life also did the companions he used to have in his court only those who know the Quran only those knowledgeable AB Etc even the young ones was one of those who attended and his uncle alar one of the rude uh bed ones in Nomads said why don't you talk to Omar let me attend any put a word for me so Omar approved his attendance because requested it the minute this man came in the uncle of he said give us from the money you have by Allah you don't judge In fairness and you are not generous when you give now Omar was Mah Hot Blooded so immediately you know he started to transform to change you could see it in his face immediately stood up the nephew and he said says show forgiveness enjoy what is good and turn away from the foolish this is Allah's commandment in in the end of and this man is among the foolish what did om do immediately cool down and S because he the description of the story says he would never hear the Ayah of the Quran and go against it the minut he hears it it's the end of story three more minutes more five minutes five minutes there's this beautiful story of Abu Bakr I always use in my lectures you know that the the horrible story when the Hypocrites slandered mother AA one of how many were there among the companions three and the rest were Hypocrites they could not reveal themselves but those who revealed themselves were were three companions the poet of the Prophet Hass the sister-in-law of the Prophet h j the sister and his cousin by the way the third one was the cousin of Abu Bakr and he's slandering his cousin's daughter not only that she's the wife of the Prophet the mother of the Believers this guy was so broke when he migrated he was among the first to migrate from mekah so Abu Bakr took it upon himself to sponsor him to give him allowance because he had nothing and when he said what he said said by Allah I will not give him a single penny how dare he my cousin says something like this on about my daughter so he was justly just it was justified and he did what he did rightly after a while the prophet came to Abu Bakr and said oh Abu Bakr didn't you hear what Allah revealed he said what oh prophet of Allah he said Allah says and let not those among you who are blessed with Graces and wealth swear not to give to their Kingsmen because said W I will not give him okay Allah uh says afterward let them pardon and forgive don't you love that Allah should forgive you so AB Bakr is hearing this and the prophet is reciting to him and he said by Allah I would love Allah to Pardon Me and to forgive me I make you my witness oh prophet of Allah I will never ever cut M's allowance until I die what kind of behavior is this what kind of learning and implementing the Quran in their lives therefore I conclude my talk with so that you would not say I would conclude my talk by saying whoever is blessed by Allah whoever is favored by Allah to implement the Quran in his life whoever is truthful always says the truth whoever is honest does not cheat neither Muslims nor non-muslims he's always honest with everybody whoever is generous tolerant merciful whoever offers a lot of deeds in worship to Allah and is described by honorable attributes as mentioned in the Quran as the prophet used to do sallallahu alaih wasallam by Allah he is the person who is or who can be described as a person implementing the Quran in his life however those who do not those who turn away from the Quran those who put the Quran behind them and never look for guidance in it they are the ones that the prophet Allah Allah the prophet of Allah sahu alaihi wasallam complained about and it's a horrific thing that the prophet complains about you s wasallam when he says oh my Lord verily my people deserted this Quran so are you one of those who deserted the Quran this is the miracle of the Muslims this is the miracle of our Prophet this is the character of our Prophet Alat this is the first night of the week inshallah in learning the Quran learn the only thing that identifies you that distinguishes you from all other humans learn the the only thing that gives you Pride that gives you honor that is your way to Paradise learn it with the sincerity of Allah to Allah not to boast others I know this and I memorize this learn it to follow it not to brag about it and only then you would not be among those who have deserted it"
