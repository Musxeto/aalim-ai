  "title": "Expiation of masturbating while fasting in Ramadan, is it 60 days of consecutive fasts Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "from then denmark is asking about masturbation and we know that masturbation is a sinful act and when done during fasting and ejaculating this leads to breaking of the fast so he's asking if a person had fallen in such a filthy sin what is excitation of that the answer is this is a frequently asked questions because a lot of the muslims usually think that doing such a filthy sin during the day of time of ramadan would mean that they have too fast 60 days two consecutive months and this is a misconception if you break your fasting whether by eating drinking or masturbating you have to make up for that day after repenting and asking allah for forgiveness and showing extreme and sincere remorse but the 60 days or the two consecutive months are the penalty for a person who has sexual intercourse during the daytime of ramadan so this is different than masturbating and i hope this answers your question"
