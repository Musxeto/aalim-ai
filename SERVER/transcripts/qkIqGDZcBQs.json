  "transcript": "Khalid from the UK please who's this do we have Abu Khalid on the line hello yes sir what can I do for you um so we know that when you buy gold there's some conditions have to be met um I took it online and if you you check that you can't buy gold through online because it takes a couple of days to come so I'm wondering if you go into a shop and you pay by debit card uh can you get the gold uh by using a debit card in person that makes sense yes it makes sense okay the condition of buying gold via gold or via cash so let's talk about cash this is what you're talking about in terms of exchange the prophet made it crystal clear that it has to be simultaneous here's the money I received the gold online is not permissible because I'm sending you the payment by the time the shipment comes to me it's a day or two maybe more maybe less but it's not simultaneous I'm not giving and taking at the same time as if I'm in a shop the issue that you've raised up is going to the shop picking a necklace it costs 200 quid and I give my card to the shop owner now if it is a credit card this is not permissible because he will not receive the amount immediately and the amount would not be paid from my side immediately I have a 40 Days of Grace Grace Period and there can be many things that might go wrong so this is not permissible if it's an ATM card so immediately once I give him the card and he checks it the money is transferred from my bank account immediately to his bank account he gets an SMS I get an SMS so this is simultaneous it's like Cash There's no problem in that now if the debit card is the same as the ATM meaning that on immediate effect they deposit the money in his bank account this is also permissible if not if it's going to take a day or two this is not permissible and I hope this answers your question"
