  "transcript": "[Music] is means moving from a land of shirk to a land of islam it is obligatory upon this ummah to migrate from a land of shirk to a land of islam and this is everlasting until the final hour is established the proof for this is others saying verily as for those whom the angels take while they are even wrong whereby they are ringing themselves by not performing hijrah the anger will say to them in what condition were you and they will reply we were weak and oppressed in the earth the angels will say was not the earth of allah spacious enough for you to migrate therein such men will find their abode in hell what an evil destination except the weak ones among them and women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they able to direct their way these are the ones whom allah is most likely to forgive and allah is after paddling most forgiven okay keep on and allah saying in the quran all my servants who believe in me verily my earth is spacious so to me alone perform your worship may allah have mercy on him said the reason for the revelation of this ayah was due to some muslims who had resided in mecca and did not migrate to medina allah called out to them using the title of iman for them the proof for hijrah from the sunnah is the saying of nabi sallallahu alaihi wasallam hijrah will not cease unto repentance scissors and repenters will not cease to be accepted until the sun rises from where it's set that is the west so when okay that's uh enough inshallah speaks about hijrah and this is a side note because as you know we are talking about knowing our prophet muhammad ali and this is the third question you will be asked in your grave who is your lord what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you who is muhammad ali and we came to a point where the author is talking about the migration of the prophet allah from mecca to medina and as a side note he elaborated on the necessity of hijrah as part of islam and he highlighted this fact by mentioning some verses of the quran so he says the definition of hijrah and the word is stemmed it comes from hajjara to abandon and if you know a little bit of arabic you would find that in verse 34 chapter four surat nisa allah says and it means to abandon women in bed when they are rebellious and not obedient so the verse or the word hijrah refers to leaving a place of shirk and we know that shirk falls underneath this word everything that is not related to islam so kofor atheism other religions being agnostic all of these fall under the category of shirk yet shirk is usually identified as associating others with allah and one may claim and say okay if i'm an atheist or agnostic i don't believe in the presence of god i don't believe that there is god how would i be associating others with god scholars say that even those who claim not to believe in god they do believe in god and allah stated this clearly in the quran that they deny it yet deep down inside they know it's true so even those who claim that there is no god they're actually worth shipping their own whims and desires and following what satisfies them and this by itself is worshipping their whims and desires and what they want to follow anyhow so moving out from the land of shirk to the land of islam and this is a mandatory thing to do as the author said it is upon this to move to the land of islam and this remains till the end of time it's not limited to the time of the prophet alaihis salah as some may think it is continuous till the end of time as we've heard in the last hadith where the prophet said allah hijrah will continue and will never cease to stop until repentance stops and is not accepted and repentance is not accepted until the sun rises from the west what does this mean it means that hijrah migration for the sake of allah azza will continue until the end of time until the sun rises from the west and then the shaykh may have mercy in his soul coated a number of ayahs for example the uh three i as he mentions in surat and nisa where allah says indeed and i'm reading my own translation not the translation you have in the books which is from international indeed those whom the angels take in death while wronging themselves what does that mean it means that the angels of death when it takes their souls and these people who are about to die have wronged themselves by not migrating because they stayed behind among the kuffar the shirk the sins they see so the angels will say in what condition were you why is it that you are in such a state so they will say we were oppressed in the land we were forced to take off our hijab we were forced not to pray in congregation we were forced not to announce their eid and to circumcise our sons when they are born we were forced not to slaughter the uthria and to announce the rituals of our demon so we were oppressed in the land this sounds like a valid reason the angels will say was not the earth of allah spacious enough for you to migrate therein why were you confined to such a small area where you could not practice your religion wasn't it spacious enough for you to migrate for those that refuge is hell and evil it is as a destination so allah is telling them about the punishment of those who did not migrate and continue to live the life they were living and this is really scary then allah says accept meaning that there is an exception for such wrongdoers who did not migrate except for those or for the oppressed among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to away some people are truly unable to do anything about their situation what is the remedy for those allah says for those it is expected that allah will pardon them and allah is ever pardoning and forgiving so people with eyes can clearly read and understand and then evaluate their situation allah goes on to say in another verse which the imam quotes again all my servants who have believed indeed my earth is spacious so worship only me do not confine yourself to a country or a city where you are unable to worship allah azzawajal imam al-barawi may allah have mercy in his soul and he is one of the great imams of and the scholars of islam his book in tafsir and his book in sunna and many other books are highly praised by our scholars and imam bin baz shaykh in basmi allah have mercy used to always tell people to refer to tafsir al-bagawi because it's concise it's very short very easy to read and understand and it has the best um way of approaching things of akida according to the salaf manhattan so i remember he says that allah in this ayah called the people who were in makkah and that did not migrate he called them to migrate but he also used the term o my servants so he called to them and addressed the iman in their heart which means that they are believers and the hadith again hijrah migration will never cease to stop until allah does not accept repentance and repentance is not accepted until the sun rises from the west so let us take a look at hijrah is it mandatory to migrate well this is depending on a number of factors our scholars when they addressed the issue they addressed it from their point of view what does that mean always you will find in the books of bimbas benefiting that they talk about the ruling on traveling to the countries of non-muslim a people and we call it bilateral the countries of the of the far of the disbelievers what's the ruling on traveling to such an area such a place our scholars are answering people who are asking such a question who happened to be living in the countries of the two holy mosques so living in saudi arabia such as me being a saudi what is the ruling for me to go to england to go to america to go to france for any other for any reason so they usually give a standard answer which states that it is not permissible to travel to the countries of the disbelievers unless you have three things one that you have knowledge of islam and akida specifically that enables you to counter any doubts that the disbelievers may cast upon you so for example if i were a young boy 17 years of age don't know a lot about islam don't know a lot about even prayer i just pray because my parents ordered me to do but i don't have any knowledge about islam and some missionary comes and preaches me about islam about christianity that is and says that christianity is beautiful we have this we have the father the son the holy ghost naturally i would say whoa whoa we have only one god how come you have three gods and the guy says no no no you also have three gods in your religion says no no this is yeah i might be ignorant i might be an imbecile but no you cannot fool me like this i am a muslim we have only god we say are you crazy what is this so the guy says you in your islam say bismillah and this is the trinity that we have in christianity and the guy's brains are blown out he doesn't know wow bismillah i always thought that this is one now it's three and he's confused the missionary takes him to the church shows him how nicely dressed the priest is with a suit a tie very clean well shaven when he speaks he speaks with love and no shouting the church looks clean and there's nobody in there and it's quiet it's real and without you knowing it he has a scar in his heart about his appetite about his religion about his beliefs so no you must not travel the messiah the scholars say until you are well equipped with islamic knowledge long ago that was like 20 30 years ago we in our country had a very beautiful thing we used to send a lot of students to america and to europe to study their bachelor degrees masters and phd but it was essential that before they travel they take a three-day course in the ministry of islamic affairs where scholars and preachers would come and speak to them about what they will expect and how things are there so that they would build their line of defense and prepare them for what to come and these courses this three-day course was very beneficial because it gave the boy something to hold on to in such calamities number two a person traveling to the countries of the disbelievers must have piety must have righteousness that prevents him from following his desires and falling into sins so maybe yes i am knowledgeable i have good knowledge no christian missionary can fool me alhamdulillah but i am 17 or 18. i'm hot-blooded and like our people years ago we are not acquainted and familiarized with free mixing so if a boy goes there and he sees women in miniskirts and cleavages everywhere and not only that women approach him and says good morning said good morning good night what is this and he's not used to this and they're friendly to him why did you come over we have a party next weekend why don't you do this why don't you do that if he doesn't have righteousness filling his heart he will follow his desires he will drink intoxicants he will fall in fornication he will abandon salat he will do all what the kuffar and the disbelievers are doing so this is condition number two if a person has knowledge in islamic apida and has righteousness filling his heart the third condition must be fulfilled as well which is that what he's traveling for cannot be attained elsewhere what do you mean sir so if he's going to america to study what are you going to study my friend he says i'm going to study business management and i say are you kidding me business management is taught everywhere even in rich and poor countries even in countries that are fif uh uh uh uh fifth world or fourth world not third world countries so no you cannot go to kafir countries to study something like this but if he says i'm going to study a special field in mechanical engineering that is only taught there i'm going to sp to to study medicine which i need to gain the latest technology and uh professional uh views and this cannot be done elsewhere he said yeah okay this is a legitimate reason so scholars say that if these conditions are fulfilled then it is permissible for you to go for a period of time so even if i want to settle there he said no no what are you doing you go and do your studies and come back so what are the reasons that may allow me to stay permanently or for a while if it is for a while then studies is on the top of the list muslims need professional muslims who studied abroad and brought the technology to our country two medicine i have a chronic illness and hospitals in my country are not qualified nor equipped to do this so i have to travel to a kafir country thirdly trade i am a merchant and i buy goods and i manufacture goods i'm a businessman so i need to travel all over the world to get new businesses new agencies to help build factories this is a legitimate reason now sometimes your stay might be longer than usual so for example i get an offer sheikh hasan we need ahead of the islamic center in tokyo japan and it's a very far place it's a kafir country but we need someone in your expertise to stay there at least for 10 years so whoa 10 years a lot of time if my intention is to give dawah and to teach people there yeah i can i can go 10 20 30 years no problem because this is a legitimate reason a justifiable reason if someone says we need you to go to spain and to live among them know the traditions and report this back to us so that we know how to address them ah you mean spying no no no no no spying we have nothing to do with the government we just like to know how to approach these people for dawah because masha'allah they're very close to islam a lot of them are accepting islam in a rapid way we need you to learn spanish okay this is a legitimate reason now for someone who is a native of that country so someone says okay i am a european born raised and living in europe this is my country i'm a citizen all my family are living here so can i continue to live here i said okay let us look at how you are living there do you practice islam if he says yes alhamdulillah i'm a muslim my wife is a muslim my children are muslim we go to the masjid no harassment my wife wears the niqab no harassment my children go to muslim schools and they study the quran and they practice their religion freely totally i would say there's no problem in you staying in your country living your life as a muslim giving dawah it might be even better for you to stay there because you will be giving doubt to others but if he says to me well sheikh no i can partially worship and practice islam so we are forced not to pray jumu'ah because our workplace does not allow us to leave and pray with the muslims i can manage through that i have to jenny do some work but i can manage giving you a fatwa on that okay what else my wife is not obliged not she is prohibited from wearing the nipple as in the case in france and other european countries they will fine her and she has to pay a fine of like 120 or 130 dollars every time the police catches her whoa this is weird why is that because they want to abandon any religious symbols is there hatred to religion that much what happens if she wears the bikini they have no problem with that even even if she goes topless no problem it's a free country but when it comes to religion it is in their genes that they hate islam and we've seen what they had done to algerians before and what they're trying to do now to the lebanese and to the mali uh i don't know how to make an adjective malians maybe i don't know and anyhow this is not our topic so okay what else they teach my children in school homosexuality and that it is normal and that we should accept it and every where they go on the streets billboards and signs and all calling to infidelity to fahisha pornography nudity everything is is filthy here for a muslim and not only that in some scandinavian countries you cannot teach your children home you cannot give them homeschooling it's a crime they will come and take your children i was shocked i was with a somali couple speaking the other day doing counseling and they were telling me that we can't raise our children as we want i was with one of the brothers i think in uganda maybe apologies because uh power again was cut and this is quite strange alhamdulillah i know in some countries they get this often and they have generators as i remember in in abuja but here it's very rare and once it's cut alhamdulillah we have temperature of 44 centigrade celsius which is approximately 110 fahrenheit it's blessing from allah that we have 4g and we can continue with this so um one of the brothers he's scandinavian and he is a diary i met i think in uganda or somewhere and he was telling me that his 12 year old child boy must go to the school public school i said oh well this is problematic is it not only that it's a mixed school so this is even more problematic this is not only that they have to buy law take swim courses together i said what he said yes girls and boys must go to the swimming pool it's mandatory in the school now in this case the following step would be to work as a prostitute what else what is the remaining of the deen if my daughter 14 or 15 years old has to wear a bathing suit and swim with boys under the name of physical education and don't mention the lgbt movement and what they're teaching the boys at school in elementary school that gays are okay and uh uh to have parents both men is okay to have two fathers is okay to have two mothers is okay so if this is the case then migration is a must what are you waiting for the ayah is crystal clear i've read it to you and allah azzawajal made it plain straight and simple the angels will take you straight to hell when they take your soul because they'll ask you what were you doing why didn't you travel wasn't allah's earth spacious enough for you to leave if you refused then this is what will happen unfortunately now again the exception that allah mentioned in the quran which is except for the oppressed among men women and children who cannot devise a plan nor are they directed to away this is the exception someone says sheikh i can barely make ends meet if i travel no country will accept me if this is the case then such people do have a legitimate excuse and they will be pardoned as allah says for those it is expected that allah will pardon them and allah is ever pardoning and forgiving but for those who are able to travel but they just don't want to leave the comfort of their homes they don't want to leave the american dream they don't want to leave what they have been enjoying all of their lives then these people are in great danger okay so what is the ruling for me to travel all the way to the kafir country and not only that also apply for citizenship well this generally speaking is prohibited for a muslim who belongs to a muslim country so a muslim from bangladesh a muslim from indonesia a muslim from pakistan a muslim from jordan from egypt from morocco these are all muslim countries yes i agree maybe life is not as comfortable as it is in the west maybe the jobs opportunity and salaries are not as high but you are acknowledged as a muslim and you belong to a muslim country if a person goes to a kafir country and then he is forced to work there or live there for a number of years in order to attain citizenship and not only that maybe he is obliged to marry from that country and then he has to apply and give the pledge of allegiance to the kafir ruler or to the queen or to the crown or to whatever to the constitution this is not permissible for a muslim to do he is compromising his islam his religion for no apparent or valuable reason unless someone comes with a legitimate reason such as sheikh i am being prosecuted in my country because i'm a muslim our president is someone who hates islam yes she is a muslim but she is a blatant enemy of islam and she is prosecuting anyone who grows a beard she is prosecuting anyone who prays in the masjid she is arresting a lot of the muslims and killing old scholars for accusations that are not based 40 or 50 years ago and if this is the case and you're fleeing prosecution and there is no other muslim country that would take you in unfortunately because we know that politics is the dirtiest and the filthiest thing on earth and politicians are likewise unfortunately so they would not accept you to come to their country to my knowledge if this is the case and you find only a place like canada to take you in or anywhere else then this is permissible due to necessity if you are a muslim living in non-muslim country in a cafe country like india for example and they're being prosecuted they're being lynched they're being tortured they're being killed because of the uh prominently uh dominated hindu government and they're killing and torturing muslims though the muslims are almost 200 million but they are the majority the hindus and they are killing our brothers in broad daylight in this case yes you can you're a physician you're a doctor you're a cardiologist you're an engineer the people in the west would accept you go and migrate and take their citizenship there is no problem in that due to necessity however is it advisable you are the judge of your own self i've met in the west families where parents were crying weeping because one of the children or more fled the home he says to me my 17 year old year old daughter who we raised to be a muslim and to pray and to read the quran always rejected hijab and last week she ran away and she said i'm going with my boyfriend don't ask about me whenever i feel like coming back i will come back and she left czech we don't know where she is and we can't do anything because if we say anything or do anything the police would arrest us imagine sheikh in our islam we are told to reprimand our children and to bring them up to care for them now we cannot even spank them if they don't pray let alone if they go away and do drugs or uh fornicate we can't do anything if we do the children call 911 and they will come and arrest us so would you want such a faith for you and your children look at the muslim children worldwide living in such countries talking like them living like them they're animals more than humans unfortunately would you like a children to have such a fate well this is up to you anyhow i think i took more than my uh uh scheduled time so we will take a few questions inshaallah masha'allah uh sheikh the first question here which is i think is important and relevantly timely to the nigerian community at the moment uh the questioner is saying sheikh can we say that allah um sorry not this one not this one okay basically the person is asking about uh you know they are nowadays they are group of people who are saying that the one who saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and who does any blasphemy should be killed and what what is the son of islam on these the people need more explanation pleasure first of all there is a book that was written by sheikh islam in tamiya a big volume and it's called which deals entirely with this situation the ruling on those who curse or insult the prophet and this is an issue of dispute among scholars in terms of what to do so killing such a person is not at all an option for the masses and this is what counts to us so a person curses the prophet or insults the prophet says son should i take my gun and shoot him in the head saying that he did something really bad the answer is no why sheikh didn't he do something offensive that deserves death penalty i said yes and no yes because his crime is punishable by death but no because no one is permitted to carry out such a punishment except the muslim ruler otherwise i could meet any tom dick and harry in the street and because we had an argument i dislike the person i shoot him in the head and i said to anyone who asks me why did you kill him i said he cursed the prophet i'm a liar but who can object to that so the issue of a person who insults the prophet allah must be tried by a muslim court and the muslim court would ensure that the person is saying that all the conditions of apostasy applies to him that there are no obstacles that prevent it from being implemented once we agree in this case they take their resolution or their ruling to the muslim ruler and the muslim ruler is the one qualified authorized to execute such a verdict which is execution whether he is executed as an act of apostasy or as a person who had done a sinful act is an issue of dispute but death is his ruling after a court a muslim court rules it and the muslim judge or the muslim ruler executes such a verdict and ruling on allah knows western uh the next question is um is it allowed to have a boyfriend but just to talk to each other uh is it allowed for a boy to talk to a boyfriend is he allowed to have a boyfriend uh this is a lady accent but okay not talk to each other okay if he says where do you get these questions yeah these people are muslims you're telling me is it okay sheikh to take a glass of wine and say bismillah and drink it what is this this is kufr to drink wine and say bismillah and after finishing you say alhamdulillah this is kufur this takes a person out of the fold of islam so to to take a boyfriend which is totally prohibited in islam to chit-chat and to talk and to claim that this is in the cause of allah this means that you're worshiping the wrong god you think that you're worshiping allah if it's feasible this is shaytan that you are worshipping and this is in his cause fistability shaytan not fisabilillah and this is totally prohibited mashallah this person is asking what is the best solution for waswas or shirk this is very generic it depends and shirk is fought by the hate is fought by returning back to allah azzawajal acknowledging his beautiful names and attributes and the likes and swast is very generic it can be impurity it can be in religion it can be in divorcing and we conduct a lot of counseling sessions with such people with swash but i'm very expensive unfortunately so people cannot afford me because i my time is very limited i can barely get any afford an hour a day so if i make it free then my time is wasted and i don't make money so unfortunately this is expensive but you have to keep on searching and asking if you go to my website there are a number of questions and answers about whishwash that are very beneficial and will help you and it's free now mashallah this question is saying i have read a general fatwa in islamic q and a website about women to do jobs by going out of home why it is almost impossible to do job for a woman in our country by maintaining all the condition we have been mentioned there alhamdulillah nowadays many people are incoming sitting basically my question is the parents who don't have any son but have daughter in their old age who are responsible to take care for them in this case can the daughter go and do a job outside the the job is ruled according to the job description and the circumstances surrounding it so if a woman is abiding by the full hijab and she goes to work outside and there is no free mixing she doesn't chit chat with boys or with men she doesn't uh endanger her chastity or her safety this is permissible there's no problem with that but if her job involves chit-chatting with colleagues with men and flirting with them at some times i've seen here in saudi arabia women and men working in hospitals chit-chatting and laughing with loud noise in front of everybody without any shame and then the boy says i'm going for lunch should i bring you some sandwiches she said yes and put so some hot sauce and they're laughing and they're kidding and joking what is this these guys don't even know the essence of islam or the essence of shyness and bashfulness and haya so if this is the case no you cannot live and you cannot work in such environment even if your parents are dependent on you anonymous best uh the next question is our dad this is a from a female she wanted to ask if she can remove like facial hair and hair from the eyebrows as well she can move facial hair with the exclusion she cannot at all touch her eyebrows these are totally prohibited to cut shave or pluck she cannot touch those but anything on her face she can remove that without any problem uh mashallah and this will be uh our last question he said i i have quran split into 30 part it each part containing one because is it okay to recite each part as i do recite one part into for this or should we recite the quran only from the one whole quran no problem inshallah you can do that from the 30 or you can do this from your mobile you can do this from your computer you can do this from a book of tafsir all of it is the word of allah as it is beautiful having you until next week it"
