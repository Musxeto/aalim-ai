  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim (20) Dhikr & Dua in Tashahhud - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] one of the forms of offering salutation upon the prophet is to say allah muhammad [Music] send prayers upon muhammad and upon the wives and descendants of muhammad just as you sent prayers upon the family of ibrahim and send blessings upon muhammad and upon the wives and descendants of muhammad just as you sent blessings upon the family of ibrahim verily you are full of praise and majesty they translate it as offer prayers while actually it should have been and i haven't seen this myself but this is what i understand from the word to offer praise upon muhammad which means salutation from allah azzawajal is to praise someone and mention his name in allah's congregation among the angels salutation from the angels is to pray to allah azzawajal that allah raises and elevate the status of that individual so i would recommend that the best translation would be allah muhammad or allah praise the prophet muhammad and when we say sallallahu alaihi wasallam we say praise and peace of allah be upon him and so forth now we move on to the following chapter that is supplication said after the last shahood before the salam what's the significance of it the prophet told us that after finishing the teshahad and the salutation before the salaam we should invoke allah we should ask allah because this is a place of dua and this is why scholars like ebentaymia and sheikh abu nathameen and others say that before the salaam this is time for dua after the salaam it is part or place of zikr so what is the most famous dua we ask allah after the tasha and before concluding our prayer the dua mentioned take refuge in you from the punishment of the grave from the torment of the fire from the trials and tribulation of life and death and from the evil affliction of the messiah the jail or the antichrist or or the imposter christ these are four things that you ask allah azzawajal to uh um give you refuge from and also the following hadith is around this area where we say allah the punishment of the grave and i take refuge from you in or from the temptation and trial of al-masih and i take refuge in you from the trials and tribulations of life and death o allah i take refuge in you from the sin or from sin and death so sin and death are extra to the previous hadith what do we learn we learn from this dua that we are in constant need of allah's support for us wallahi we are like a person drowning in the middle of the ocean in nowhere without any life raft without anything to hang on to what do you think will happen to him how do you think he feels he is desperate he knows that he's about to drown so he has no hope other than in allah and he has no trust other in allah subhanahu wa ta'ala this is what we do as muslims at the end of every salah seeking refuge in allah azzawajal from these four things and more so we seek refuge in allah from the torment of the grave and we all know that this is something that all muslims have the consensus upon those who are from sunnah to al-jamaa they do not dispute in this unlike the murtazilah and maybe al-khawarich and they are negligible they're not part of allah so they don't matter the torment of the grave is mentioned in the quran and in the authentic sunnah and the consensus of muslims is upon it there is mutawater hadith about it so we believe in that and rejecting it after knowing that it is from islam may take a person out of the fold of islam what is the torment of the grave due to previous sins specific sins and due to failing in answering the three questions who's your lord what's your religion who is this man who was sent to you simple questions but if you did not live upon them you will fail to answer them then we seek refuge in allah azzawajal from the torment of hell fire why do we live our lives on earth simply to succeed in going to paradise and avoid hellfire my entire life is based on this worshiping allah azzawajal complying with his instruction and trying my level best to avoid hellfire otherwise i'm doomed i'll live for 60 70 years 80 years then what death and then what eternity either hell or heaven so my life on earth with the grace of allah and his mercy decides whether i'm to go to heaven or to hell i seek refuge every single salah in allah azza from the torment of the grave and from the torment of the antichrist or before that from the tribulation and calamities of life and death whatever you face in life poverty illnesses tribulation and whatever you face at the time of death of temptation of misguidance of misconceptions that come to you and prevent you from saying and also we seek refuge in allah from the tribulation of the antichrist which is something that all muslims agree upon the mahdi the antichrist and the descendants of jesus christ he's abnormal peace be upon him nobody argues about this and whoever does this is something known from religion by default and it's an act of apostasy to deny it and we also ask allah to save us and we seek refuge in allah from sins and deaths why because if you have debts on you and people are asking for their money you will lie to postpone and delay and reschedule and this would cause you to sin so we are in deep need of allah's guidance and assistance to save us from all of these things if we're saved from them then we have one imagine every single prayer we usually recite these duas but we don't contemplate upon them we just parrot them and this is why i'm telling you i'm being frank with you this is benefiting me more than you because when i teach this to you i incorporate it in my prayer when i go home and i would like to point out that there is a difference between my prayer and the masjid and my prayer at home at home i'm quite quick because i'm not contemplating a lot nobody's watching when i teach you this i teach myself so this is a beneficial lesson for you and for myself to begin with this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you foreign my foreign"
