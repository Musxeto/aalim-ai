  "transcript": "and knowledge is a lot there are so many levels of knowledge and it would not be logical for lay men like you and me to acquire specifics and little things that only great Scholars of Islam may have knowledge of but at the same time it is not at all accepted for for a Muslim to be ignorant of the basics of Islam Unfortunately today the basics of Islam are unknown to the vast majority of Muslims and this is sad in my counseling sessions I usually ask it's one to one so when people come to me I acknowledge and identify that problem so I asked them a question and I say what are the pillars of Iman 95% imagine the percentage 95% would say shahada Salah s and I think zaka what do you think of this answer right or wrong wrong and I say to them wrong answer this is not the the the definition of Iman this is the definition of the pillars of Islam and you missed one so pillars of IM I've never heard of this 95% of the Muslims say we've never heard of this what does this tell you it tells you that we have a problem in the basics that each and every Muslim should know I'm not telling you to tell me about the types of riba you may not deal with money in transactions so you're not obliged to know this it's not mandatory upon you I'm not telling you tell me now about the difference of and in she I'm not going for HJ ex my my slot comes in 15 years yes you're not obliged to know it I'm not asking you to tell me what is the threshold of zakat of corn or of a 100 cows or of 2,000 camels what's the threshold and what is the zaka I don't have any I don't even know a cow from a camel if I see one let alone to know what is zaka these are not mandatory upon you at the moment but but essential things of Islam they're mandatory such as to know in prayer what are the pillars what are the mandatory obligations and what are the Sunnah why is it mandatory so that I can know when to prostrate for if I prayed and I left home oh I forgot y I'll pray to valid invalid I dropped a pillar which means that the whole building has collapsed obligatory is different than pillars it's different than Sunnah these are some of the things you have to know among the things we must know is the Hadith of jiel when he came to the prophet Alat and he asked him he came in the form of a human being the companions were sitting they saw a man white clothes black hair no trace of traveling you no dust nothing and at the same time none of us know him they didn't have any hotels at the time so they should have recognized him he should have stayed with someone but this guy was unknown to them he asked Muhammad tell me what is Islam Five Pillars what is IM six pillars what isan one pillar these are the essentials because the prophet said afterwards do you know who that was they said no he said that was giel what did he come to do he came to teach you your religion which means that this is your religion that you have to know when we speak about Iman Iman is a tighter Circle the bigger circle is Islam all of you are Muslims in the sense that you believe in the shahada you pray you fast you do zaka you will perform Hajj inshallah these are pillars that we can see what's in your heart Allah knows about it the bigger Circle has an inner circle which by default all those in the Inner Circle of Muslims but because they are elected individuals they are also M they have IM but what is Iman Iman fluctuates goes up and down Islam is steady either you're a Muslim or I know it's early in the morning and some of you might fall asleep but try to wake up because I am more sleepy than you I'm over 60 and am I I take a nap every 5 minutes so if I doze off you guys wake me up so Islam either you're a Muslim or there's no middle way so I'm a seasonal Muslim no you're either Muslim or a cafir however when you go to the Inner Circle of Iman ah this different it fluctuates and this is why it increases with de needs that are good and decreases with sins what is the evidence depression or anxiety why do you need evidence because I have so many people on the internet on Tik Tok saying that Iman is one wholesome either it's there or it's not and these are the far extreme we have the you know thear thear is a deviant sect and cult they say Iman is one whole lumpsum either it exists you're a mmin or if you do one major sin if you lie if you fornicate if you do drugs if you drink alcohol if you uh deal in RBA this is a major sin your IM is gone you're not a Muslim and you are in Hell forever for eternity these are known as what on the far right or left there is another deviant cult and sect well known in Islam called Al Al says yes ISL is uh sorry IM is a whole lumpsum but it can never be dissolved or broken or diminished either you have it or you don't have it and we believe if you do anything on Earth even if you don't pray if you don't fast if you don't perform Hajj if you fornicate if you drink wine if you do drugs if you do the most heinous sins in Islam as as long as you have IM in your heart you're a Muslim you're a mmin the same concept that Iman either is there or not there but different opposite views who we are all part of believe that Iman goes up in Peaks and goes down in valleys and this is mentioned in the Quran any blind man can read it what why did not these two blind sects read it because when Shan tarnishes your heart and covers it you cannot see the truth you will be Blinded By the Light Subhan Allah Allah"
