  "transcript": "yes sir i have a question while making ramadan when we put mouth water in our mouth and turn the water in your mouth and nose and exaggerate unless you're fasting so exaggerating turning the water rinsing your mouth and pulling the water up your nostrils is a sunnah unless you're fasting because there is the chance of you swallowing in normal renzing and washing or rinsing your nose there is no possibility of you swallowing water put water in your mouth turn it right and left and spit it out put little water in your hand and put it up your nostrils not exaggerating and that would do it perfectly without any problem inshallah"
