  "title": "Praying Witr with the Imam in Ramadan - reward for praying the entire night - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "unless Han says can I pray taraweeh with the Imam and also to hedge it before suhoor and how to pray 200 if we had prayed which are already after taraweeh this is frequently asked question so listen to me and listen to me well the Prophet said RA salat wa salam he who offers prayer with the imam and he's referring to taraweeh prayer until he finishes and concludes all of his prayers then Allah would reward him as if he had prayed the whole night so this is hadith one meaning that if I prayed raesha with the Imam and I pray taraweeh until he offered with her and I offered salam with him then allah rewards me as if I prayed from Asia to Fletcher the whole night prayer the second hadith the Prophet said Allison that there are no two whitter per night meaning that if you performed Whicher with taraweeh you cannot perform Whicher after tahajud and there are a number of other hadees but these these are the the most important so to combine two anis if you pray with the imam until he's finished with his whitter then you go home and you decide to pray to hedge or whatever night prayer you want this is legit this is permissible you pray 2 rakaats salam tarakasura tarakasura as many as you want but you do not repeat the whitter one says ok then is it ok if the when the imam performs water and give salam instead of me giving Salam I stand up and add another raka so my total number of records that I've performed with the Imam would be even numbers the answer is yes this is permissible but is it recommended the answer is No why because Shaitaan will penetrate your heart and make others think that masha'Allah he offered an additional raka meaning that he is definitely going to pray home he is a man of righteousness and of worship so no no needful to do that the third hadith which I did not mention was that mother aisha said that the prophet Aslam after offering the witr prayer at the end of the night he used to pray two rakahs afterwards sitting down and it was light quick meaning that you can pray afterwards without any problem insha'Allah"
