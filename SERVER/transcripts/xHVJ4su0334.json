  "title": "Is it Makrooh to drink from a chipped cup or to dip your nail in the cup? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "um azan says a lot of people from the subcontinent say it is makrooh to drink from a chipped cup or dip your nail inside of a cup is this really makuu makrooh in english is this light something that if you do it you will not get a sin for that but if you leave it you will be rewarded and you will gain a good deed for that so she's asking if I have a cup like this one and it's chipped it's broken so can I drink from it it's an issue of dispute among scholars the reason is that in the old days when a cup was chipped or a plate was cracked they would not throw it away and get something new they didn't have that luxury in the hadith when Sophia may Allah be pleased with her sent some food to the Prophet SM on the night of Aisha and Aisha was angered by that may Allah be pleased with her and hit the plate and it fell and broke into two pieces the Prophet himself felassan stood up and collected the two pieces and put them together put the food inside and told his companions to eat from it so it is permissible to eat from a cracked a broken or a chipped vessel but is it permissible or not recommended or prohibited to do that when the chip is visible there is a hadith where the Prophet is Islam prohibited us from drinking from a cup that is chipped and the prohibition most likely is not for Haram purposes so the prohibition is not to state that it is prohibited or sinful to do so but it's not recommended and why is it not recommended scholars say one because you could easily hurt yourself injure yourself too it is not usually firm enough to hold the food or the water that you're drinking from so it might spill on yourself where while using it and thirdly because it is difficult to wash so hygienic Lee speaking the bacteria and all the other stuff bad stuff can collect in in that chip so it is recommended not to use it of course if the chip is here you can always drink from the other side that is okay without a problem Charla as for dipping your nail inside a cup who in his right mind would do something like that it is is it McCoy yes it is makrooh one should not wash his hand and then drink from the same vessel or dip his finger and he does not know where his finger was or what he touched with so this is not clean for himself and definitely not clean for others to drink after him but is there a hadith on this topic no I do not know any hadith relating to dipping your finger in the cup and Allah knows best"
