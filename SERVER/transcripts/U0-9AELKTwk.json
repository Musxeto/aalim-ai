  "title": "Can I force mum 2 stop her haram business that has music by refusing 2 enter my room assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign and the PlayStation is in one room in the block rooms where I sleep like she rented one room for me to sleep and in the other for for the games now the games have music in them and they are played and and the games are also played even the time for swaraj and the some of the games are not good for people to see like the musician all that so me as a person I I quitted from uh working there but now the issue is that the music pops up at any time like for five to eight seconds and I hear it well I'm in my room so my question is can I stay outside and refuse to enter my room telling her to to close the business because I tried telling her to reduce the the volume uh the voice of the but on the same day I still had the music again so so learning your voice doesn't serve any purpose so I I know that she may cry and talk some sweats on me but at least I'll make her quit the Haram business so can I do this or is it haram will it be bad for me to do this to her foreign the problem is that sometimes we exaggerate in our reactions if I have a mosquito that is annoying me if I kill the mosquito with a cannon the mosquito is dead but so is everyone else in the room because the cannon will blow up the whole place so was my action correct or not definitely not it was out of proportion and likewise forcing your mom to close such a business that is impacting you only for a few seconds a day and making her cry and make her her sad and being unduteful staying out and Allah knows what would happen to you as a consequence all of this is not logical I go to malls I go to shops I drive in the streets and sometimes people who don't fear Allah who don't know Allah blast music what do I do confine myself to my quarters and never leave no there is a difference between hearing and listening if I am hearing something I don't want to hear there is no sin on me but if I go and listen and I'm happy and tapping and enjoying what I'm listening to then there is a sin so I hope this answers your question use"
