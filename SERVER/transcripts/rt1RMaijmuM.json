  "transcript": "in Al hamdulillah was salatu salam ala rasoolallah voila he was happy as mine I'm about I was willing min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem bismillahirrahmanirrahim yes brothers and sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh i welcome you back to the second day of the seminar janazah the final rites I hope everyone's had a nice rest in sleep as we have an interesting day ahead of us where we are going to have a live demo on how to wash and shout the body will have and the next session will have brother Muhammad who will come in in in enlighten us with the concepts of will and the legal aspects of the process everyone has to go through when some of the relatives or the close ones are died in the UAE Lahaina rahim but hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik Abdi he wore a saline I mean maybe Ana Muhammadan wanna do Samia Jemaine I'm about assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today's course is going to be short so there's a possibility that we may finish in the first session maybe the second session we will try to prolong it as much as possible the reason we have four things main four things left and that is washing shrouding praying and burial and these things are not there there isn't room for putting something from your own pocket they are covered by a number of hadith and the rest is considered to be all from the scholars HT had they thought of it our this is best to do this we have to do that with the disease but generally speaking it's very basic how basic wash the disease and use water and siddur and in the last wash you do that you should do that three four for seven times washing it in the last one put care for so that it would stiffen the the body and make it harder the justification from the skull is not from the profit I saw some that is it how to wash it how to turn the body how to make the body sit have a position to clean the stomach all of this is from the scholars all of this from the people who practice washing the disease but if you don't do it that does not mean you have gone against the Sunnah and if you do it that does not mean you have innovated because the Prophet is salatu salam give you tips give you guidelines one or two titles the rest is for you to do that is why when you look for in the different schools of thought you find different methodologies when you want to shroud the deceased should I'll start from the right side or from the left side is it only three pieces of cloth for the man and five for the women or it's all three for both genders when you want to pray 99% is the same it's for takbir and you say fat you have to us a lot and liberation then supplicating to the disease well the the afterwards between the fourth appearance Salaam one Salam to the right do we have dua or not an issue of dispute is it for the Kabira five that birra eight takbir and nine that Vera's an issue of difference in authenticating the hadith we will get to this burial you put the dead person in the grave how many graves we have two types light and shock and then you put the sand and Hamas mess around course is over not necessarily but this is it it's not like yesterday yesterday there was a lot of room for you because it is something that we all pass through visiting that the the sick person what to do what to say what not to say how to deal on treat the person who dies etcetera who are those who are given good signs that they're ending is good insha'Allah and who are not there is room for a lot of expansion so here in the first session before the legal session insha'Allah we will speak about washing the deceased so bare with me and if we finish ahead of time prepare your questions in sha allah we will try to answer them to the best of our abilities washing the deceased person when first of all we have to know what is the ruling on washing shrouding praying and burial over deceased what's the ruling is it mandatory yes or no is it mandatory upon everyone of us the Prophet said that is Salah sturm he knew who wash him and he's addressing everybody so is he addressing actually everybody everyone says listen keep a place for me I want to wash the Prophet said little Sulu who all of you the scholar said no this is not logical Jonnie more than five people cannot wash the disease let alone a hundred each one says the instruction was for me this is what is known in Arabic as followed by a fire this is communal obligation collective obligation what is collective obligation the main concern over the collective or communal obligation is the act itself who does it nope this nut of our concern so what we focus on in communal objection obligation is the act for example you know what is is this car it's prayer for the rain it is communal obligation if two or three of the Muslims in Dubai do this the rest can sleep home they have no sin upon them likewise praying over a deceased if one prays over the deceased the rest of the population to 800,000 or the million living in Dubai I don't know how many are there how many other for 1 million 2 million not a problem they have no sin but if no one prays all of them are sinful what is the importance of this the importance is that in rural areas in areas with ignorance sometimes especially in the in the desert with the Bedouin within the village villages with the villagers they don't have knowledge and you go and visit a village in India for example and they the elders the elders tell you oh Allah he for the past 30 years we've buried over 2 or 3,000 children who died in their infancy five years seven years but we did not pray Jen as a prayer why this is why we didn't know their children why should we do what should we pray what did it that what do the scholars tell them they tell them one of you should go to the graveyard face the Qibla and pray funeral prayer for all the children who died in the past 30s and you did not pray gen as a pray for them this is one only suggest because this is communal or collective obligation so if one does it Campbell and this is what happens one of the men goes and offers generous prayer in the graveyards for all those who were buried without any Janaza prayer and this message are now in individual obligation known as far behind what is the meaning of I mean this is Arabic okay one in Arabic you have one word that refers to a number of variety of things and this is why Arabic is so rich it's so powerful if I'd like to describe something in English I would say one you one word if I describe it in Arabic the meaning is much more profound why is that because the English word it's the Arabic word is rich it has a lot of meaning in it and that is why Allah chose it to be the language of the Quran you read two ayahs or even one ayah with two or three words in it to explain it in English I have to write half a page just to convey the meaning to you and the word I in this particular word if you inshallah study fundamentals of people's energy hundred fundamentals give me something else you might've seen but anything with fundamentalism I don't want no fundamentals of filk is a science that deals with the basis of things in fact where you get the evidences and you put them in sections it is the greatest science for those who deal in thicker will do in Fatah because without it you cannot give fatwa you cannot you do not know without it you cannot differentiate between a verse that is general and a verse that is specific so if you don't have this knowledge you'll come to the half to the ayah holy Matata come on mater - what them it is made forbidden upon you the dead meat and the blood so if you don't have knowledge when someone gives you liver saying all this is Haram this is blood if someone gives you a fish you say is it Islamic you slaughtered ok this is a fish this sorry problem atari-kun we'll meet up this is dead if you don't slaughter it and say bismillah I'm not gonna eat it so without this knowledge you cannot combine between the evidences fundamentals of the soul now the world I'm is usually taught in this science to display the different meanings that a word can have so that you when judging a verse or a hadith do not fall into the trap of only having one meaning to it you have to know exactly what was intended so I'm definitely means an eye so it's the organ itself the eye - it can mean a spy the Prophet arizim in so many Hadees in the Selah he sent nine of salonen meaning that the spy is going there just to look report and come back it also means water spring when you have water coming from the ground easy this is called right even an Arabic everybody knows this it also means an item this I know a shape I know a telephone the the item itself they are neither entity of a person this is called ein as well and there is a letter in Arabic I so all of these different and they have different meanings the question is what brought us to this point I have no idea for the inside ok that's good ok we have people are awake and Allah so far behind individual obligation this looks and takes care of the act and the doer the communal obligation takes care only of the acts only we don't care who does it and that is why if we have a child I serve a 6 years old child whether a female or a male we have to wash that child it's an obligation but it's a communal obligation so if one of the sisters volunteers and she takes care of it and wash it and Allah that is done but if no one washes it then we are all sinful so this is the ruling on washing the deceased now the evidence is quite obvious when that person in Haram in Arafah was thrown of his camel back and was stepped upon and stumbled upon and died the Prophet instructed the Muslims here Zulu who wash him with water and siddur and see there is known as Lotus and I think ish Allah in the demonstration not demonstration the states here after the haurache Allah you will see it for you self it's a substance and it is something that is used to wash the body with can we substitute that with soap dough locks cami even fairy for the dishes anything that cleans scholars say yes you can't but it is not recommended because the Prophet erase auto salam instructed us to use Sidon did the Prophet at his time have soap did they burn oh did they yes they did have but it was not so balls as we know it it's called ash nan and it's a type of plant with small seeds that is rubbed and it becomes like powder it becomes like tide and etc I'm not doing a commercial for them they're not giving me anything but this is what we use in Saudi Arabia I don't know if you use this here okay the evidence behind the numbers of washes is there a specific number scholars say one is sufficient is enough three is recommended if you don't see anything but if you see a something five seven nine until it stops what do you mean by something we talk just the day that when a person dies what happens to his joints and muscles they are loose they let go and we all know that if you sleep you can wake up and go to pray without Google correct correct are you guys sleeping why can't you go and and and pray what do you have to make what do I didn't normally find my wood oh did I you don't know the Prophet said in the hadith had a salatu salam and this is the basic and Pajaro on purity the prophet said as salam that the eye and he's making a metaphor the eye is the rope that ties the anus so if the eye is closed the rope is untied so you might pass wind why because you are asleep if you're dead this is most definitely all the muscles are loose so if there is something in your stomach if there's stool if there is you real it will go so while washing it you try and this we will come to inshallah to make whatever is prepared to go out you make it come out because you don't want to carry the funeral and with the shaking and putting down and picking up and putting in the grave something comes out Danny this would not be appropriate for the deceased and the the the whole procedure of washing shrouding and and prayer and barrier is to honor the dead person and this shows you how important death is in Islam that we pay a lot of respect a lot of tribute to the deceased not Haris is a corpse yeah he throw him in the dustbin he's dead he's going to rocked he's God why should we do this no this shows you that the human soul even after departing the body that because it was in this body we honor the body anyone illogical localist not speak about Islam okay logical if an atheist is here he says yeah this is not logical a person is dead why do you wash him five times why do you put perfume and waste your money on perfuming him and after six seven hours he's going to rot he's going to smell why do you take so much care of him and carry him on your shoulders and put him in a special special way bed hole in the ground while he is going to decay and disintegrate or whatever so why do you do this we say because it's our religion honors the living and the dead it's not that he died Hawass throw him no he has relatives he has loved ones he has respect so because he was a respectful person while he was alive he is still respectful even after his death and we will come to mention more aspects of respecting him so we wash the deceased once three times four five times seven times until we know that he is pure they have to be in whittle and you notice that in Islam we honor whitter what is the meaning of whittle odd numbers and what is the meaning of even even numbers what is opposite of witted Scheffer a Scheffer will wit what is the meaning of Scheffer meaning even numbers and why do we use the word Scheffer you know the chef's are what is the chef are the inter session what's the intercession originated in Arabic if I know this person he is an influential person in the government and I need some favors he doesn't know me so I bring someone who knows him and we both go to his office how many are we we are two so I brought him to give safar to intercede for me in the presence of this government official and this is the origin of Shefford that instead of being alone you bring someone else and from there it went on to refer to all even numbers in prayer in which it this is not our topic Sheikh I know but I'm stalling for time in prayer we have a chévre well which er what is whitter in prayer one raka or three can we play five records with it can we play seven can we play nine with one salam nine records with one salam yes this is the doing of the Prophet Arisa Ladouceur he used to pray 1aqaq butcher and you need to pray for me and the common mistake that the people are our beloved people from India and Pakistan do is they pray three records as McRib and this is due to they are following the heart of he must have push is not wrong to follow the hand of the map but it is wrong to follow other than the prophets instruction and the prophet instructor is so some to pray with you but not to simulate it with mockery so you have to pay first raka stand up for a second raka stand up don't for to jihad and play fredricka and sick fetish a hood so the Prophet used to do this Harris salatu salam Silica's in a row one salaam but only one tisha how did the last and third raka five records the Prophet used to pray one two three four he does not sit and the fifth he sits and mikdash a house and gives Salam seven records the Prophet used to play the first six records without sitting the last seventh lokahi would make the Shah hood and he would offer Salaam nine rak'ahs the Prophet would pray seven broca's without sitting the eighth he would sit give the first assha hood the ninth we would sit give the final to shout and then offer seven our topic is not prayer of whittier but this might come handy someday sha allah when someone asks you does the Prophet prays five seven because my records this is a hadith of Amana Aisha may Allah be pleased with her okay when you wash the deceased the Sunnah is to wash it with cedar and as I stated before siddur is a greenish substance it's a plant that is crushed and made as powder one glass of tea now one if I have an Englishman maybe here is good a monk no no a small glass you know the Arabs have a very small glass of tea this glass is sufficient for four liters of water but how do we do it usually you bring the glass of siddur and you put it in a little amount of water this much and you like whip it and turn it harshly until it has fallen in it because we're going to use the fall and you we're going to use the water with the cedar in it once it has a large foam we add the water to it so we have a big bucket of water with siddur with this much foam and the water is underneath of it with the city welcome to that Hashanah the Sunnah is to wash the deceased three times first two times with the sitter last time the third time we should put what is known as I'm don't know him I'm pronouncing it right comfort comfort oh yeah we call it Kapoor in Arabic so it definitely it is originally an Arabic word and Carrefour is a form of perfume but it is not perfect or say it is something that helps the skin to be tight and it has a feature in itself that prevents insects from coming to the body it repels the insects and it's also extremely good for healing the wounds and stopping the bleeding and out of experience when unfortunately not all deaths are natural a lot of the deaths are due to accidents injuries burns so sometimes when you wash the disease it's not an easy job meaning o dilemma my brother died my friend died my cousin died or shame and no sometimes you can have cuts on his body it's painful sometimes he's completely burnt you wash it the skin falls maybe they meet those as well maybe the bone is exposed sometimes you wash and the wound keeps on bleeding what to do when you put the comfort Subhan Allah it immediately stops it prevents the wound from continuing to bleed besides it has the other features as stated before among the things that should be done if the woman has braided hair usually women braid their hair into two or one great or plated the whole head like in the brothers from all the sisters from Africa they would have like 20 or 30 of them what to do now if a sister is having hustled for menses after finishing or for sexual impurity for janaba if she has these rates is she obliged to undo them for Russell the city's scholars say yes scholars say no is an issue of dispute but authentic opinion is that she does not have to do that because this is something that's happening every night or once a month and it's tiresome it's it's difficult for them to undo them and do them again the Prophet I saw some said you don't have to do this but of course when washing the body you have to make sure that the water reaches the skull and you have to wash the blade itself but you don't have to undo it and make sure that it goes inside each and every one of them this is not what the Prophet instructed I saw some in the case of the deceased Norman do we have to am i speaking a different language brothers and sisters older still asleep it's morning yes you have to undo them because the Prophet instructed them when they washed his own daughter zeyneb may allah be pleased with her so you have to undo the blades you have to wash the hair very thoroughly and and well and then we would come back to what to do coming the hair after washing you have to come the head and this is an issue of dispute the origin of the dispute is is the word mentioned in the hadith authentic or not Cheryl Valle authenticated it that the Prophet cetera so Salaam you undo the braids and then comb the hair and braid it into three place it into three braids so the Prophet said calm the head the scholars who say no no this is not authentic who made this hadith or this edition wife or weak justified this by saying that the hadith to us is not authentic first of all second of all logically when a person dies if you calm the hair you may tear the hair and this is not acceptable when you die your head is not gonna fall off how awesome depth if you pull the hair it's gonna come in your hand if you pull the nose it's gonna come out you know it's not Lego this is still Yandy the guy is still a human being and it's still intact so calming the hair is not gonna affect it maybe one or two or five hairs with fault so what this is not bad and besides as we said we are honoring the dead so we have to give him the respect and the formalities of making him look well by doing this so this is a shala permissible and part of the sunnah seventhly to make the hair of a woman into three braids to plate it into three braids and how we do with this you have one from the top from the front you have two from the sides after you braid it you put it under the woman's head because she'll be lying that all the dead will be lying on their on their back when we wash them in the grave they will be lying on their right high a right hand side facing the Qibla and we will come to that in sharma 8 you should start with the right-hand side of the body and the places of moodle and this is an issue of difference among scholars some say in the majority do this you have to give the deceased boo-boo so you start by washing his hands washing his mouth and nose as we will describe this inshallah because is that that don't open the mouth and put water and how he's gonna do that he's not going to do that you shaked this is not gonna happen and you are not supposed to put water in his mouth because the muscles are loose whatever you put will go inside and then what's ever inside will come out so this is not appropriate and that is why we will come to the procedure some say you put cotton in his nostrils and his mouth so that when I washing nothing goes in and some say"
