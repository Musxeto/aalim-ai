  "title": "Can Quran be installed & recited in a phone that has Haram stuff like porn, music etc Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "in this digital era mobiles contain music movies and also quran some even contain pornography can quran or any islamic content be stored on the same phone that contains music and movies and is it permissible to recite quran from the same phone now the question sounds or seems to many people as redundant what what use of this question but it's a valid question the confusion the confusion may arise because we have so much appreciation to the quran and we value the quran to the extent that we don't want anything to tarnish it but here is where shaytan comes in we agree that movies are haram we agree that pornography is totally sinful and listening to music is sinful as well but shaytan should not come and deter you from reciting the quran or uploading the quran app on your phone just because these haram things exist rather you should eliminate the haram material and keep your phone sinless if i can use this expression now you don't want to remove these haram stuff what the ruling on putting an app with the quran there's nothing wrong in that you're sinful for the haram stuff but you're rewarded when you recite or read the quran from the quran app isn't there any confusion in mixing the two sheikh the quran with pornography no you're not mixing them they are in a separate folder and it's exactly like when someone memorizes the quran and he has vivid memories of pornography or haram music or movies etc would we say that you have to split your brain into half or do something or forget the quran so that you would not become sinful definitely not and this is not the case and our last question"
