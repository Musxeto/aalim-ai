  "transcript": "um she I am facing one of the biggest problem of my life right now and that is doubting Islam not Wasa actually doubting and I don't know how this started it just started with this question that came popped up in my mind that um Allah knew everything what was going to happen before he created the universe so why would he create the disbeliever if he knew they were going to hell and I know Sheik asking this question is so wrong and doubting Islam is kufur and a sign is okay I I understand you manah listen because we don't have a lot of time first of all I would highly recommend that you book a counseling session with me if you can't afford it if you can't afford it then also try to book and we as allocate a free uh uh counseling session for those who are poor and needy and can't afford it secondly why would Allah create the disbelievers if he knows that they're going to be thrown in hell why not the creation is his if he throws them all in Hell who can complain or object this is Allah's creation these all belong to Allah so we trust Allah's knowledge We Trust Allah's fairness and uh uh uh being uh uh uh knowledgeable and capable we trust that Allah owns everything and Allah does not do any Injustice if you believe this then you believe that whatever goes into hell it is because of Allah's Justice and knowledge and mercy they chose this for themselves Allah knew what they were going to do and Allah gave them the way out and Allah showed them the way out but they insisted and I'll conclude with this because we're out of time Satan was ordered to prostrate to Adam and he refused out of of arrogance and envy and he said I'm better than him Allah destined him to hell so instead of asking for forgiveness he said well if you destined Me to Hell give me time so that I would set them astray Allah gave him time till the day of judgment now let me ask you this question does Shan does Satan know that if he were to seek Allah's forgiveness and ask for repentance today that would forgive him yes or no of course if he asks Allah for forgiveness and repents Allah will forgive him what's holding him back you tell me so he doesn't want to he has the means this is the way out he doesn't want to so try your level best to block these thoughts and Trust Allah and think positively of Allah and you will be safe with the grace of Allah with this"
