  "transcript": "can a single woman live alone by herself whether she's a widow or a divorcee or a divorced woman or a student living in a hostel that is totally segregated the answer is yes as long as it's safe and it's culturally accepted there's no problem some cultures may look at it in a very negative way in this case no a woman should not do that for example in a muslim society if a woman lives other than where her parents and family live on her own without any legitimate reason this is tarnishing their reputation so people come to them and say okay how many kids you have masha'allah where is your daughter and so well she lives away from us why is she married no she lives alone single this is very um insulting to conservative families who pride on their unity and being together but if there is a legitimate reason and it's safe and there's no fear on her there is nothing wrong with that inshallah you"
