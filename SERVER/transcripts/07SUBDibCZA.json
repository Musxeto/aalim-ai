  "transcript": "Amina says can we celebrate our marriage anniversary by giving each other gifts and going out for dinner and not throwing a party the answer is what is the origin Amina of such exchange of gifts on that particular day the answer would be it is something that we had a adopted from the disbelievers from other cultures and it's not part of our Islamic belief nor part of our celebrations and the prophet Alat wasam prohibited us from celebrating other than the two eids and and of course on weekly basis we celebrate Friday so these are the legitimate celebrations in Islam we cannot celebrate Mother's Day we cannot celebrate independence day we cannot celebrate uh the day of the tree or Labor's day or Thanksgiving new years's Christmas and the likes because or even birthdays these are not part of our culture our religion our beliefs so we stay away because it falls under the AY and it also falls under thei where the Prophet says the of may Allah be pleased with the man with his father whoever imitates a people he's part of them and to tell you the truth a real devout spouse would not celebrate his marriage once a year every single night is night to remember so the compassion the love the mercy is all over the house filling their life with joy not to dedicate it once in a year and to just try to fool one another with exchanging gifts and the likes and Allah Knows Best"
