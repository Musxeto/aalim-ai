  "transcript": "from tunisia he says what is hadith ahad this is a technical terminology known to the scholars in terms of defining the hadith what is the hadith and they classify it to hadith muttawater hadith that was narrated by bukhari and muslim which is one of the highest levels after the mutawater and a hadith that is mustafir that is so widely spread but doesn't reach the level of mutawatyr and then they come to a hadith that is known as ahad a hat comes from one which means that the levels and the stages of narrators each stage and and level has not reached the level of tawatur of having so many people in one level so if the hadith was narrated by one companion they consider this to be ahad though it's is so famously accepted and well known yet they label it as a hat it's a technical terminology now latecomers and people of innovation like el mortez and those liberals and those secularists and those who want to discredit the sunnah as a whole they use this technical terminology to tarnish the reputation of the sunnah so they come and say no no no we will take only because quran is mutawater we will accept the hadith what do you mean by that the mutawater a handful so few so so yeah ahad is not necessarily indicating that it is true and gives us the certain knowledge of its authenticity it might be it might not be and this is not the way of the salaf the prophet islam the companions the tabian the tabi at tabi'in may allah have mercy and be pleased with them all they all accepted hadith and to show you that these guys want to only tarnish the sunnah and discredit it so that they would dismantle islam from the foundations you go and read the sunnah itself when the people of cuba were praying fajr and one man came from the companions and shouted at them that last night a verse was revealed to the prophet assam that the qibla has been transferred and changed from jerusalem to makkah to the kaaba so it was 180 degrees while they were praying none of them said okay this is a one person can we implement his narration which is ahad or should we wait for five or ten more witnesses to confirm this no they immediately acted upon it when the prophet used to send messengers he used to send one person not a handful of people just to confirm one another which means that this is totally not kosher nor legit"
