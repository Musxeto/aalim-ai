  "title": "Suppressing wind (gas) during wudu I paused to ensure I washed properly, wudu valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is one time I was dealing with the and I was about to wash my left foot actually I was watching my left foot and then I had the arch to pass wind and I told myself like quickly finish washing the left foot so that I suppressed the wind and then I did that I tried to wash my foot and I suppressed the wind and then after that was like by now everything is wet without checking I was already inclined to say that everything is wet my foot is wet so if I see witness How will I know this is the water that I put on it or this water from the sink so I took some extra time to think and I repeated washing the whole food again and my concern is the time I took of thinking and the time of suppressing the wind will become an interruption to the voodoo so I will never be valid yes the voodoo is valid"
