  "transcript": "[Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y [Music] [Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of the signs of the hour one of the signs of the hour is something that a lot of us may feel that it is a bit strange had it not come in the Hadith maybe we would not have accepted it but because the prophet Alat wasam told us about it we embrace it and we believe in it and we see it in front of our own eyes the prophet saysat wasam in the Hadith among the signs of the hour is the boasting of people the showing off of people with the their masjids so the prophet is telling usat wasam that there will come a time that people would show off by building masjids by decorating them by beautifying them and one would think that this is a good deed yet the prophet is telling usat it is not IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said that you will decorate your mosques your masjids as did the Jews and Christians with their synagogues and with their churches and may Allah be pleased with him when he was the CIF and he wanted to expand the Masid a bit he told the one responsible for the construction work that protect and shelter the people from rain and do not use red or yellow paint so that you would not Shock the people you would not make the people wonder about this beauty and this would become a FNA for them this is what Omar said at that time may Allah be pleased with him and it is surely and definitely a sign of extravagance because when people pay so much money in building these masjids in decorating them in putting so many beautiful calligraphy that cost a hand and a leg they put chandeliers that one of them may with the cost of it help in building another Masjid in another normal or poor country when you see the amount of marble being used and the type of carpets and the air conditioning and then you compare these expensive and extravagant masjids with the Masjid of the Prophet Alat wasam which had no carpet People Prayed on pibbles it had no roof the only roof it had were were the leaves of palm trees so whenever it rained the whole place was soaked with rain and they used to prostrate in mud as the prophet did so many timesat it didn't have fancy Gates it didn't have even lighting it did not have any lights no lamps nothing it was pitch dark in there some say tamim madari was the first one to bring the these uh uh lanterns and put them in the Masjid and light it and the prophet was happy with it but this is a weak Hadith but nevertheless look at this Masjid that may cost nothing and look at the masjids the lavish and luxurious masjids we have around the Muslim world and look at the men that came out of this Masjid and look at the men that came out of our masjids there is no comparison and none whatsoever why because we focus on the quantity rather than the quality and the prophet Alam and his companions and the previous favored centuries the three favored centuries they were focusing on quality and this is what we lack people just think about how much they pay how big their masjids are and how luxurious and they put their names on top this is a message of so and so businessman oh masallah very good and this is another businessman this is a a rich person and so on and and you when you come to scrutinize these masjids look into them you don't find those who built it praying in them I Know Places I know masjids that the owners of the masjids don't pray fer in it though they live next uh next door why is that because sometimes Shan comes to you and say I've done enough I've served the Masjid I've built it I've taken care of it so this compensates for me missing a Salah or two or three and this is extremely dangerous because Allah told us in chapter NBA that the pagans they say that we construct and we build the masjids of Allah and we honor the Haram but Allah tells them that this is not how it should be inhabited this is not how it should be taken care of taking care of it is to pray in it to worship Allah Asel in it to announce the AA of of monotheism that there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah the creator of the heavens in the Earth this is all what we want from the people to believe in to believe in the one of Allah and that no one is worthy of being worshiped except him that's why when you come and enter the masjids worldwide other than in Ramadan if you enter in fajer prayer you will barely find one row maybe two rows praying fer but when you come in Friday the whole mid is full and outside the streets are also filled with carpets and prayer mats and people are praying Friday prayer there where were these people 6 hours ago when it was F time they were asleep they're neglectful of the most important far of the week which is the F prayer of the Friday prayer this is why our masjids are not as fruitful and productive as the masjids of of our predecessors because their their masjids were built on fear of Allah and the love of Allah and on knowledge our masjids are built on concrete and decorating the masjids is a sign of Destruction isn't this a little bit too far no it's not the authentic Hadith the prophet tells usam when you de at your masjids and beautify your copies of the Quran destruction would fall upon you imagine this Hadith was authenticated by albani when you decorate your masjids so now you're you're concerned with the quantity not the quality you're not concerned of your prayer and that is why if you just take a glance at people praying in any mid you will see the majority looking at the chandeliers and reading the collect graphy and reading the verses of the Quran and looking at the beautiful Marbles and decoration but not concentrating on their prayer if you decorate your masjids and beautify your copies of the Holy Quran and try to put things in gold and write the words in different colors and put them on papers that's so expensive and sell copies of the Quran for so much money the prophet tells us then the destruction would fall upon you you and what do we see in the Arab world what do we see in the Muslim world destruction we see the Muslims are humiliated governments Muslim governments have no power have no uh uh uh credibility their people do not believe in them the outer uh uh people the non-muslims don't believe in them they're abusing everything so why is this because we have diverted a lot from the straight path instead of following the Quran and the Sunnah doing what Allah wants us to do we've diverted in a very wide angle and we have only the light the the label Muslim that we abide by so may Allah make it easy on all of us and restore the Muslim umah back to the straight path among the signs of the hour is a death wish the prophet tells usat wasam the hour would not be cold until a man passes by a grave and then he would address the grave and says I wish I was in his place people would wish for death and this definitely has happened it brings tears to my eyes and it makes my heart bleed when I watch sometimes very rarely the news and I see interviews with a woman in Iraq or in Syria or in Burma or in Afghanistan or in Palestine may Allah liberate all of these countries when we see an interview with an elder with a woman with a child that lost her parents in a recent bombing by the Israelis crying weeping and say I wish I was the one to die a woman says I wish I was not born this had happened and people nowadays in such heart stricken uh countries with tribulation with such calamities they pass by the grave of a dead person and they wish for death because of the tribulation because of the wars because of the so many calamities that fall upon them they wish for death of course wishing for death is not permissible and the prophet told us do not ever wish for death sallallahu alaihi wasallam and if you have to wish for death then make a condition by saying oh Allah if death is good for me make it happen and if life is good for me prolong my life so this is a condition but you never say I wish I die I heard this so many times from women from mothers when their children do bad things and they're so frustrated they tell an address their children I wish I'm dead I wish I die now at the moment and and be careful for what you wish because the prophet Alam said do not supplicate against yourselves against your wealth against your children against your servants do not supplicate because you never know you may uh uh find that your supplication is answered because it coincided with an hour of where Allah answers and gives those who ask for what they ask for so this has taken place and may Allah make it easy upon all the Muslims among the signs of the hour is the spreading of killing whether it's discriminate whether it's targeted a lot of killing takes place in the Muslims by the Muslims and not by other enemies of Islam and this was part of the things that the prophet was not granted and in in a number of Hadith if I recall correctly the prophet said I asked Allah three things and he gave me two and kept back one so I asked him that he would not annihilate the people my umah with drought so the whole umah would not just go by drought or by famine or by um an epidemic yes it there might be some here some there but not the whole um so Allah gave me this and I ask Allah not to appoint an enemy outside of my umah non-muslims to attack them and anal all of them and Allah granted me this and I ask Allah not to make my umah fight one another and Allah withheld this from me this is a clear prophecy no enemy can an annihilate the Muslims take this for granted and we're here we're challenging no one can do this and there will never come a time where there's an epidemic or an earthquake or uh uh hurricanes or uh whatever that would annihilate the Muslim um this would never happen we know this and the third thing which is them fighting each other this is visible may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said among the signs of the hour just before the day of judgment there will be and the companion said what is Al and the prophet said killing so this is one of the signs a lot of killing so the companion said prophet of Allah more than we kill we kill like 70,000 of the pagans every single uh uh year or every decade 70,000 in the Arabic language is not meant literally the scholars of of the language say 70,000 is a metaphor for something that is beyond counting so when Arabs you know Arabs were illiterate and they could not count barely 10 20 100 when they would think of a number that is beyond Beyond imagination they would say 70,000 and that is why the the word 70 sometimes refers to something that is more than the things you can count Allah says inah that whether you Prophet of Allah seek forgiveness for the Hypocrites 70 times or you don't Allah will not forgive them so 70 times is not meant literally because the prophet said if I knew that Allah would forgive them if I forgive if I ask for forgiveness for the hypocrite Abdullah the head of the Hypocrites if I knew that Allah would forgive them if I added more than 70 I would have which meant that the prophet knew that 70 was not meant here but even no matter how much you ask for forgiveness for them countlessly Allah will not forgive them so the Arabs used to use 70 and its multiplication so 70,000 for numbers that we use like today we say a gazillion times what is a gazillion times is it a number I don't know but we it's it's it's something we use so the companion said prophet of Allah we killed 70,000 and the prophet told them it is not killing the idol worshippers and they never killed more than 2,000 at the time of the Prophet not even 1,000 of fatalities between their words so it's it's an exaggeration so the prophet said it is is not killing the pagans uh uh that you do it is killing one another and the companions were shocked all this love we have to our Muslim Brothers all this Brotherhood sharing our houses sharing our wealth giving them our money and you telling us there will come a time when we kill ourselves they couldn't believe it so they ask oh prophet of Allah do we have our sanity do we have our intellect do we have our brains at that time and the prophet Alat wasam said at that time the brains of people would be taken out they would not have their intellect they would act without thinking and there will remain the scum of the earth the scum of the people so the prophet is telling us at a time where the scums Prevail and the pious and the knowledgeable people are so little you can barely notice them and all what you see in the surface is people without any brains without any intellect they see the prophet says the majority of them think that they are doing something but they are worthless they're not doing anything at all and this part of it is visible but not to that extent hamdulillah and it's inevitably going to happen I pray to Allah that we cannot say oh don't make it happen because it's going to happen it's a sign of the hour but we pray to Allah that we would not be witnessing such events because it is not a pleasant sight to see there are different a number of hadiths where the Prophet tells usam that people kill one another for without any reason and people would come and look at the gold and look at the silver and the measures of the earth that at the end of time will come and surface and a murderer would come and say in this the gold I killed and another would say in this I was amputated because he stole something and in this I CED my K my kinship and everyone calls his sins that he had done because of the gold and the silver because of the treasures there will come a time a killer does not know why he killed and a murdered person does not know why he was killed for and the prophet also and this Hadith is narrated by Abu Bard may Allah be have mercy on him the son of Abu musar and he says he's telling me that once I was in the market and and I was doing this which is a sign of astonishment I'm shocked so there was a man next to me from the ansar his father was a companion of the Prophet Alam so both of them were not companions HH but the parents were so the man was asking him what are you shocked of ababda why are you so astonished so Abu Abu BDA said I'm astonished of these people their lord is one their messenger peace be upon Him is one their call to Islam is one their pilgrimage is one their expeditions and fighting is for the cause of of Allah and it's one however each one of them thinks that it's permissible to kill the other how could that be because there were so many tribulation at his time there were so many killings whether it is due to the coming and killing uh uh and and doing atrocities whether it was between the fight between Ali's armies and mu's army may Allah be pleased with them both and what the k did and what the uh uh Hypocrites did to invoke such uh uh Wars and killings and so on so Abu B was shocked so this man told him don't be I've heard my father narrate a Hadith that the prophet said my um is an um where Allah would have mercy upon it's a blessed umah it's an um that Allah would have mercy upon the prophet goes on to say there is no torment for my umah in the Hereafter they will not be punished in the hereafter as a hum as an um their torment their punishment will be in this life through tribulation earthquakes and killings so this is a clear sign that there will be a lot of tribulation a lot of killings a lot of uh uh um things that are not called for in this umah and we know this we can see this visibly in the previous Century from 1980 is it till 1990 approximately the war that claimed millions of lives was it between the Muslims and the cfers no well sort of speak it was between Iran and Iraq and both claimed to be Muslims and look at the killings and for what no one knows the sectarian killings that took place in Lebanon The Killing that is happening now in Syria between the Muslims themselves we know that theis and the Alis are not Muslims but the armies that under them they're Muslims the shab and the and the Hypocrites they all claim to be Muslims they all carry the flag saying that they're Muslims but look at the killings and what's happening in there look at what's happening in Iraq the killing the discriminate killings look what is happening in Afghanistan but even in Iraq when you go and see the killings that's taking place is it done by the kufar is it done by the Christians no it's been done by the Muslims so-called Muslims and that is why you have thear over there they are killing discriminately sunnis Shia Elders children women no problem just kill and this shows you the Hadith of the Prophet one would say yes but they are blowing upat they are blowing up shrines and Graves and killing this is not permissible having shrines is shik we know that having Graves and worshiping them like they have in in in Naf and all of this is not related to Islam and those who go there are not Muslims this is a fact this is shik total shik however this does not justify not a single bit for a Muslim to go and blow up people or commit suicide they call suicide bombers and kill people discriminately how dare you kill children women elders and even grown up men even if they were mush you cannot just blow them up call them to Islam call them to uh uh uh the true if you were practicing but you're not you are part of the and you think that everyone is cfir except you and you have no knowledge you do not know the Quran and the prophet told us that reciting the Quran would not exceed their throats as we will come maybe later on and and talk about it so all of what's happening at the moment is a clear sign of the authenticity of the Prophecies of the Prophet we can see it visibly now remember the prophet said thisam at a time when the Muslims were poor were weak we were out only in their Villages or cities or in their area and they had so much love to one another when the prophet tells them that you will have this money the wealth when the prophet tells them Alam you will conquer Persia and bantia and you will have their wealth and the companions are looking one they believe but they're saying we can barely find food to eat and the prophet is giving us such prophecy prophecies when they hear about a city half of it in water and half of it in land and they know Constantinople which is uh ISL um Istanbul they heard of it but had not seen it and the prophet is telling them that you will uh uh take it and it will become all Muslim they're shocked and astonished when the prophet tells him that you will wear the bracelets of KRA the head of the Persian Empire and AD this is strange but the prophet said it I believe it everything happened everything took place so this is one of the signs of the authenticity and the truthfulness of Islam and of the Prophecies of the Prophet Sall wasam we have a short break and afterwards inshallah we will take your questions so stay tuned Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah there is an American sister who's very active in in Egypt told me personally that uh she traveled between Buddhism and Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left F she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quran so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of a word of Allah subhana goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah spoke it outad and forgiveness Ramadan Ramadan [Music] Ramadan you can do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad Salli wasallam to follow our Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by Omar saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of the same of the companion [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in lifeam alaykum and welcome back I believe we have Al Froman hello Alum uh my questions are three first question is is it permissible to pray with three combined like M okay second question my second question is is it permissible to participate in Lucky Draw held by supermarkets like Lulu do you say that pred after in is good what is the true opinion uh six rakat sixed after in shabat Shabib Barat is 15 of Shaban right I will answer your questions insh okayi sister Al Froman had three questions first one what's the ruling on praying Witter three combined ra exactly like the answer is this is not permissible the prophet forbade us from praying W similar to which means that we have if we want to combine the three raas we pray the first Rak and stand up pray the second Rak and stand up not sit down and then pray the third Rak and then sit down and offer the T so in the second ra we have to differ than by not sitting for T immediately standing up for the third raak she's asking what's the ruling on uh Lucky Draw when we buy things from the supermarket first of all if you pay something for this Lucky Draw It it is Lottery it is gambling it's Haram if you don't pay anything you just simply buy your groceries but you usually do not go to that Supermarket you only went to shop from that Supermarket hoping that you will get a chance to win a prize and participate in this Lucky Draw this is not permissible so if you go to the usual Supermarket you go to and you are shopping your normal uh uh groceries not for the draw because this is the convenient place you go to usually and then they put your name in a draw this is Hal there is no problem in that and I give you another example if there are two uh um milk Brands you always buy this milk brand and all of a sudden the other company announced that whoever buys their product under the the cap they will find a number number and if you call the number will be inshallah this or that and you may win a car so you change to that brand this is Haram because your intention is to participate unfortunately gambling is so widely spread in the Muslim world it's beyond imagination even in Saudi Arabia you will find TV uh uh channels you'll find newspapers magazines supermarkets to the extent that you get sms's in the Gulf worldwide tells you send a message and the message costs for example five r or 10 R and you will be able to participate in a lucky drw what's the difference between this and between buying a lottery ticket for a pound and maybe I will get a million pound and become a millionaire and maybe the pound would go down the drain this is gambling either you lose the pound or you win something far far greater than you've anticipated and this is found in TV channels call 700 numbers or call this number where they will extract money from you and maybe they will give you a question or two so what so the question is what uh uh was the prophets of Islam's name and they put you on hold so the minutes that are running they're taking your money and then you say Muhammad okay you're in the lucky drw and after a mon month or so you lose everything this is all not permissible Abu Abdullah from Saudi Arabia how are you I'm fine I have three questions okay the first is regarding obedience to parents sometimes you uh you have your mother and your father and you are doing trying your best to obey them but then sometimes because the responsibility of the mother is much greater than that of the father but then when you are doing it you do it first to the father before you do it to the mother because maybe you see the mother is under the control of the father and you know trying to please the father first before the mother okay is this having any problem in Islam okay question regarding the issue ofar after subh Allah and also that okay you can only choose one of the two is regarding the signs of the last hour is there any specific Dua that the prophet s gave order for us to recite what to this the last the last days this calami this tribulations okay the prophet reced okay from Saudi Arabia Omar mute your mute your television please yeah it's already off okay I already put it off what's your questions uh I have one question uh I want to ask what is the difference between and and what is the reward between this Salah and the other one and which is better okay I will answer your question or Al had a third question saying that is it part of the Sunnah is it recommended to pray the sixth in the 15th of Shan and the answer is no there is no authentic Hadith and it's an innovated uh prayer on that particular night and one should not do them our religion is taken from the and the Sunnah it's not taken from this scholar or that so whoever claims that yes this is good thing provide me Hadith he may bring me a Hadith from a book that has so much dust on it and Yellow Pages but we have to verify that this is an authentic Hadith and this means that we have to take it to a scholar of Hadith who can tell me if this narration uh chain of narr narrators are they all authentic or it is not abdullah's questions one they have a problem with the parents so you try your best to please your father and please your mother but sometimes you prefer to do something for your father first than your mother so is there any sin or problem there isn't any sin as long as your mother is pleased or as long as your mother does not know however the prophet Alam gave 75% of our devotion and love and obedience to the to the mother so when a companion came to the the prophet and said who is among my parents most worthy of my good companionship he said your mother the companion said then who the prophet said your mother then who the prophet said your mother then who the prophet said your father so 75% you should always put your mother ahead but if she doesn't know or you feel that she is okay with you putting your father first and doing what you want to do to him first this is okay however it is a very thin line you walk and that is why IM Malik may Allah have mercy in his soul Malik anas one of the four imams of the schools of thought we have was asked once who should I obey my father or my mother meaning my father tells me go right my mother tells me go left who should I obey and the Imam said obey your mother and do not dis obey your father so how can I do this you're telling me to obey them both and both he said I have no other answer obey your mother and do not disobey your father meaning that you cannot draw the line you have to try to compromise and do your level best providing that there is no sin providing that there is nothing that is sinful they're ordering you to do uh AB is saying that when we raise our heads from the uh we know that the IM says or we say if we're alone and then we say but there are a number of different du so he says can we combine the answer is yes if the is waiting and he is doing a lot of Supplication it's better to combine rather than to stand in silence so you may do this inshallah and there's nothing wrong in that okay sister ttif from Saudi Arabia yes Alum my name is toifa okay yeah yes uh I'm I want to ask one question okay um I live at abha and the timing of the prayers of ABA and makat Muk is almost the same um you will be knowing that they are daily showing thei andat is from makah Muk through television daily so can I join this you know Salat and flat all the way from right is it permissible okay I will answer your question inshallah and Rashida from Saudi Arabia hello yes I'm still here I have a question yes I'm listening okay yeah my question is um is it okay for a half to pray at home because he's memorized the Quran and it's a way for him to review the Quran rather than pring in the mid congregation if a person has memorized the Quran is it best for him to pray home as for him to review or is is it recommended for him to pray in the mid you're speaking uh on behalf of a male right of a male not a woman okay I will answer your question inshallah all right thank you you're welcome uh Abu abdullah's last question he was asking is there any Dua that the prophet used to say so that Allah would keep these tribulations and fan away from us there are a lot of duas but they are General the specific ones for example that the prophet taught us to say say before we offer Salam before we conclude our prayer by saying so this last two oh Allah I seek refuge in you from the torment of of of hell and from the torment of the grave and from the torment of life and death so this is one the uh uh uh FNA from the tribulation of life and death this is one and from the tribulation of the Antichrist of theal so the prophet specifically naming this FNA also the prophet used to say and address his seek refuge in Allah from tribulation whatever is hidden or appearing so all of this is part of the duas that the prophet used to ask Allah to preserve him and his umah from such a thing okay sister Al is back again your question sister alikum uh actually my question is again for the Lucky Draw it's not the lucky draw when we purchase something from like supermarkets they uh give a coupon on 10 real or five real and we have to fill that and that lucky draw is it permissible to participate in that lucky draw meaning that when you fill the copon do you pay five real or 10 real yeah yeah yeah we when we purchase something of five 10 real or and they fix amount on the fix amount they give one coupon like five real they give one coupon or 10 real they give one coupon is it permissible to participate in that okay I will answer your question Khadija from Saudi Arabia Khadijah asalam alaykum waum Salam she I have three questions okay okay the first question is like what we see nowadays are the traffic signals women carrying small children and healthy boys ask for begging so is it permissible for us to give them amount as they are Beggars because I have heard of an Hadith where in Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam he asked a person to move or clean his slipper and then gave him money and did not just pay him uh for begging also in Quran I have gone across an ayat which says pay to those who are so what is exactly that we need to go ahead with okay second question my second question is my sister my co sister in-law without her husband can she join for omra with me and my husband because my husband is her brother-in-law so can she join to umra with us your sister-in-law my co sister-in-law my husband's brother's wife okay you are living in I'm living in jba so she's residing in Jed yeah she is also living in jeda so can she join me and my husband without her husband or any of her M she join can she join me to go to Haram for omra third question and can I cut my hair myself after doing my omra okay I will answer your question inshallah uh Safa from Saudi Arabia yeah yeah I just followed three questions from you okay the number one is is there any particular suras that we have to recite to get a child to get pregnant and to get rid of an illness not a deadly disease just a normal disease okay second question and number two is uh if I'm having a uh gold of 200 g which is 21 karat so how it is possible to give the zakat right third question and number three is can we make the duas personal duas during s in five time prayers and prayers okay I will answer your question inshallah okay thank you you're welcome okay um Omar was asking what's the difference between tahajud and night prayer tud is part of night prayer so night prayer is umbrella under it you have you have you have W all of this is considered to be night prayer but tud Scholars say that it has to be preceded by sleeping so if someone is awake the whole night until the break of dawn and he prays night prayer this is night prayer it's not tud you have to sleep for half an hour or so and wake up because waking up in the middle of the night to pray is very hard and difficult that's why tahajud is far greater than normal prayer night which uh uh night prayer which you pray before sleeping and that is why also the prophet saidat the best of prayer other than the mandatory prayers are the night prayer and the best of night prayer is in the middle of the night meaning in the midst of the night where everyone is asleep and of course the best time is the last third of the night so if night time is 9 hours the last third is 3 hours before fer and this is how you calculate it Khadijah from the Emirates alikum Shum salamah Ramadan Mubarak and to you as well uh Sheik I have a question because uh as earlier you have mentioned about the praying Wier just like uh praying it like a mrid it is forbidden yes and uh while we we are in a mid okay we were praying there for how many days and then after and one night the Imam prayed uh threea as uh as M prayer so what happened then I was uh distracted with my Wier and then I didn't know what to do what what is the best thing to do is it to to not to continue the wheer or to to make tlim or what what what what to do and then second question is if um for example if uh you are in the in the congregation and then you are in the first pah hood and then you added uh salaat to the prophet while uh the Imam is still sitting is it uh permissible or or you have to make and uh what ra what RA are you in pardon what raak were you in in in the first shahood at Thea for example okay and you for example in Isa prayer okay okay uh in tah Hood in the first tah Hood uh it should be up to only to [Music] muh and then you added theat to the prophet Muhammad sallam okay and is it part of the r or shall shall I have to I understand I will answer your question inshallah okay I believe that we will not have any more phone calls because time is catching up toifa she's saying that she lives in abha Lucky her it's very cold it's very nice weather m it's very high and she says that the timings are almost the same let's assume they are the same let's assume that you're living in mecah not in abha but far away from the Haram and she says I see the people praying praying uh uh Isa prayer so can I join them and the answer is are you considered to be in the congregation the answer is no you're not in the Masjid you're not physically there you cannot see the them uh uh physically and the roads are not connected and therefore you cannot pray with them even if you were in Mecca let alone being an abha uh Rashida she says if a a male is a of the Quran masallah and he would like to pray in the house to revise his in his uh uh Quran is this permissible is not mandatory so even if I don't want to pray I want to sit home and I don't want to pray I'm the I'm the loser but did I make a sin no it's not a sin and that is why Scholars say may Allah pleas when he joined the people to pray behind in Ramadan and they prayed behind one IM before they used to pray scattered here and there one or two when he combined them he did not join them he did not pray with them and he would say the one that they sleep over is better than the one they're praying now meaning that their prayer at the end of the night is much better than now and he used to pray on his own but Scholars say that he didn't neglect he had so much on his plate that he had an whole um to run so it was he was utilizing the time of to send armies and to run his government his um his country and he would also pray night prayer but he would delay it so if he wants to pray at home definitely this is permissible now which is more rewardable definitely praying it with the congregation in the Masjid the prophet saidham he who prays with the IM until he concludes his prayer Allah would reward him as if he prayed the whole night so one hour with the IM is equivalent to praying from M till the break of dawn and no one can do this on his own so definitely the award is far greater if he prays with the Imam and if he can combine both pray with the Imam and then go home and offer tahajud prayer or night prayer and revise your Quran this is good adding to good Al says uh clarifies alchem is clarifying that we buy and the total is 300 real they give us uh 30 copons 10 real each we fill our names and we put it in again the same answer if you go usually before the draw before this competition if you are used to going to that place and then they came up with this idea and you participating is halal but if all the time I go to x uh uh Superstores and when y Superstores introduced this I changed so that I would participate this is Haram Khadijah we always face those Beggars at traffic lights carrying children and she's confused because she remember a Hadith with the prophet order ordered a beggar to clean his shoes I don't know any of such a Hadith and the prophet I believe would not do this but we have to look at the Hadith to and you have to provide us with the sources I never know or recall anything that the prophet ordered a beggar to clean his shoes and then gave him Sak charity this is not uh uh heard of in my opinion and uh the prophet said in the authentic Hadith that a beggar some not a beggar someone who is asking for money has a right even if he comes on Horseback meaning horseback and he's as if he's driving a car meaning that you should try your level best to give money to the poor and don't look into their intention see if you're going to utilize your money a thousand R and give it to those who need it yes but if you're going to scrutinize everyone that comes to you and at the end of the day don't even pay one real no give and intention is by Allah these Beggars they should be controlled by the government they should ban them and they're trying their best but there's so many of them you cannot control it people claim to come for and they don't leave on time and they start begging at masjids at the streets and some of them they inflict these uh uh uh uh handicaps and they put these imputations on them forcefully so that they can beg and all of this is definitely not a good sign uh she Khadijah is saying that my co- sister-in-law meaning Khadijah and her husband and her husband's sister-in-law can they go for omra the answer is yes because they are in jida and from jida to mecah they do not require a m because it's not a traveling distance she says can I cut my own hair after concluding the the omra the answer is yes uh saf from Saudi Arabia is there any prescribed Surah for someone to recite so that he can conceive the answer is no but you can supplicate it's far greater than any other means of conceiving so you can supplicate while in your suud while in your prayer while in the third last third of the night between and at times of rainfall all of this inshallah is heard by Allah she has 200 gram of 21 carat of gold is there zakat for it you have to take it to the Goldsmith and he would evaluate how much pure gold in it maybe it would come to uh 170 and then this is what you have to pay zakat for 170 the pure gold not the 221 karat gold so the one that advises you is the Goldsmith I think on the internet I've seen it once they had a table saying that if you have 20 G1 g of gold this is equivalent to so much in uh 24 Karat if it's 18 if it's 16 so it gives you uh uh the math uh can we supplicate in sujud yes you can supplicate in sujud whatever you want Oh Allah pay off my debts oh Allah guide my uh my spouse oh Allah uh uh grant me a child Etc all of this is permissible Khadijah says W and what should I do the IM prayed three ra you should have followed him though it's wrong you should follow him because the Imam is following the IM Abu hanifah and it's a trustworthy school of thought there is no problem in uh following it and finally she made a mistake she says that after offering the uh in the second ra the Imam was sitting so she continued to say Allah Muhammad Muhammad should she prostrate for forgetfulness definitely not because this is something part of the Salah and if the IM prolonged his sitting you may say this some Scholars like a shaf say it is recommended so says it's recommended to say it even if he does not prolong so making it uh uh is no problem insh I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet you next time oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious [Music]"
