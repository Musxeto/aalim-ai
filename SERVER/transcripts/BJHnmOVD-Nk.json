  "transcript": "in um um a friend of my wife who happens to be going through uh some issue with her husband so before now the husband has always been using tolac to put this top to treating her and recently the husband proclaimed that um he has divorced her and this lady asked the husband okay how is she going to perform his radar period and the husband said whatever she likes like she's done with her she should go now can the lady leave the husband out and go to her father's house without you know performing The Elder period in her husband house someone so issues of divorce are not answered over the phone or over Twitter known now as X platform they have to be face to face so that the Sheikh can inquire and ask both parties now in this question of Allah if the man and the husband confirms that divorced had taken place and the woman is in harada she must not leave her house unless this is the third divorce if it's the first or the second divorce she is obliged in the Quran to remain in her home for the three monthly Cycles which are hereda or if she's pregnant until she gives birth to her child also her husband is obliged to stay with her in the same house during this period if he forcefully kicks her out then she may go to her parents house and he is the sinful one but if this is the third divorce immediately she she must leave the house and he is her Nan mahram she cannot uh take off her hijab with uh in front of him or communicate with him as she used to earlier as a husband because now he's totally a nun mahram to her after the third divorce but the first and second divorce this is a transitional period of three monthly Cycles if she's not pregnant where they remain as husband and wife doing everything except intimacy no intimacy no hanky-panky stuff at all but she can stay with him without hijab she he can communicate with her she can cook for him they sleep on the same bed but no touching and no forms of intimacy and Allah knows best and I would highly advise them or advise her at least to take him to court so that they could register and document this divorce and for the judge to inquire whether he actually divorced her or after a couple of weeks you said no no I was just threatening you I did not divorce you a woman cannot live like this hanging by a threat and Allah Knows Best"
