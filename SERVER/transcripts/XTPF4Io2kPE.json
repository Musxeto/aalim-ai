  "transcript": "foreign we move on to another chapter and that is upon seeing a good dream or a bad dream what is to be done and said so the prophet said alaihis wasalam the righteous dream that is a good dream is from allah and the bad dream is from the devil so if any one sees something which pleases him then he should only relate it to one whom he loves now that there is a number of hadiths and long hadiths the sheikh says summary of what to do upon having a bad dream are the followings one spit on your left three times two seek refuge in allah from shaytaan and the evil of what you saw three times do not relate it do not say it to anyone four turn and sleep on the opposite side to which you were sleeping on previously and hadith number 115 get up and pray if you desire now what is this all about dreams are divided into three types as mentioned in another hadith a good vision that is from allah so what to do i see myself in a good dream i wake up and i'm happy i'm cheerful i'm optimistic the prophet says al-islam do not tell this dream except to someone who you love and he loves you back so tell your close friends tell your relatives because they will interpret it and they in a in a good way and they will feel happy for you dream number two is something that is evil so you wake up terrified you saw a nightmare you saw something that made you sad or depressed what to do do the following number one spit three times to your left dry spitting so you do this seek refuge in allah from satan three times three do not tell any soul about it listen yesterday i saw this and that and i was decapitated and i was uh walking with my guts on the ground and i saw a friend of ours burning burned to death do not tell anyone any soul about it number four if you are sleeping on your right side move and sleep on your left changes the position and number five and this is in a muslim if you wish get up make abolution pray to raka's for allah this would cleanse your soul and would make you more comfortable to go back to bed again this is dream number two dream number three is a result of your subconscious which relates to whatever you do during your daytime so if you are a mechanic you will most likely dream in grease oil engines cars tires etc if you're a tailor all what you remember in your dreams or you'll see in your dreams wedding dresses or three-piece suits and fabrics etc so the prophet told us aslam that these are the three types of dreams and that we should not pay attention to the second one which is the evil one so many people are depressed they see reoccurring dreams over something that is bad which is going to happen this is from shaytan this is what the prophet interpreted for you and you should believe what he had said to you the following chapter deals with kunut and witter and hadith 116 the prophet says along with those whom you have guided pardon me along with those you have pardoned be an ally to me along with those whom you are an ally to and bless for me that which you have bestowed protect me from the evil you had decreed or you have decreed for verily you decree and none can decree over you for surely he whom you show allegiance to is never a based and he whom you take an enemy as an enemy is never honored and mighty o our lord blessed and exalted are you what is this this is a dua who was it taught to it was taught to the prophet's grandson al-hasan ibn ali the the son of fatima the daughter of the prophet how old was he he was a child 10 maybe 11 years of age give or take why did he ask the prophet for this dua imagine this child came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah teach me a dua i should use in witter so the prophet gave him this beautiful dua so this dua is to be recited in witter in kunut not like those who follow the shafi medhab and they recite it in fajr prayer which is totally wrong and totally baseless this dua is only to be recited in witter prayer and is it mandatory the answer is no this is voluntary and it's highly recommended what else hadith 117 the prophet isam as mother aisha used to say he used to recite this dua at the end of his witter or kunut what is this beautiful dua becoming i take refuge within your pleasure from your displeasure and within your pardon from your punishment and i take refuge in you from you i cannot enumerate your praise i cannot count it so many of them you are as you have praised yourself beautiful words to be said whenever you want to praise allah azzawajal and before you want to begin your dua or when you want to conclude your dua but this was said during kunut and during a witcher prayer this is all the time we have until we meet next time one [Music] the"
