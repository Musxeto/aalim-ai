  "title": "What can a person do to get his dua answered? Angry Allah is not answering my dua - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as he's from sri lanka he asked a general question and he said what is to be done in order to get our dua doesn't work like this there isn't any such a thing that when you say it it's answered it's not a a genie in a lamp you rub it and it comes out and answers your three wishes no you are begging allah you are expressing your poverty and humility to allah not demanding on allah to answer you and this is the biggest mistake most of us do when we make dua thinking that what is wrong and this is similar to uh mehush question when she says that someone is angry i get a lot of questions like this from imbeciles from ignorant imbeciles writing it without any form of shame why is allah not responding to me i've done all what i can why isn't he protecting me from pornography or from masturbation i don't understand why is he doing this to me who are you talking about you can't say this to your headmaster in school you can say this to your ceo in the company you can't say this to your prime minister or your ruler or even a police officer let alone allah azzawajal so this type of impoliteness this type of attitude is definitely not going to help you in this life nor in the hereafter you don't dictate oh allah tell me what you want so that you can answer my prayers so should i sacrifice a camel should i do this well what i want this thing so tell me what is it no you have to reverse it by always feeling broken feeling the humility feeling the poverty to allah's wealth and support and guidance and if you do this this would definitely increase your chances of being answered not okay allah i want this following thing uh by the way last week i did umrah and i visited the masjid in medina and i completed reciting the quran and i gave a thousand dollars in charity so yeah we're late on time i hope that you answer my prayers soon i mean no it doesn't work like this secondly you want your ass to be answered make sure that your provision and whatever you consume is halal because allah does not answer those whose income is from haram even if they're traveling even if they have dusted hair even if they raise their hands saying ya rabbi arab calling allah with his beautiful names and attributes as long as their provision is haram they eat haram they drink haram they wear from haram allah would not respond to them you have to select the appropriate times for dua so we know that there are blessed locations if you go to the haram next to the kaaba and make dua you are closer to allah if you do your dua during tawaf or during sai you are closer to allah if you do it during the last third of every single night when allah descends to the lower heaven and he says is there anyone asking me to give him is anyone making dua i would respond to him is anyone seeking forgiveness so i'd forgive him so this is a blessed time you should make dua when it is in the sujud because the more you do it in the sajud the closer you are to allah when it is reigning between adhan and akama and among so many things that would definitely add value to your dua and your chances of being answered and allah azza knows best"
