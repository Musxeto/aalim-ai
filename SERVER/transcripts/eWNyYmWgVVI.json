  "title": "What's stopping muslims from being influencers in technology, science, theology assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "last time due to time constraints of this program I was so quick to ask that comparatively today's Muslims are contributing Less in the field of Technology science and theology some said this dun is not for the Muslims that's why non-muslims are contributing more in worldly matters and getting Applause sh my question is what's stopping today's Muslim to be influential contributors in technology science and Theological Fields what is what is Stopping You fim Shake shik sorry what is stopping you from that I think it it's due to lack of my hard work nothing else but some people say that Allah has given more power to non-muslims no no this is not true this is not entirely true at all it is your laziness it is your lack of commitment it is your own disadvantages that you impose upon yourself and why did I ask you this question and turn the table on your head because we're very good in this we're very good in criticizing the Muslims and those around us and failing to see our own flaws and shortcomings in the mirror and this is what this program is about how to deal with people's mistakes and errors the Muslim world is privileged today by having lots of of wealth they are having the latest of Technologies and we're almost as close as the First World countries in almost everything almost what we lack is sincerity in doing what we do for the sake of Allah because most people do what they do for the sake of the chair they're sitting on the position they're assuming and this is why we have corruption we have bribes we have deceit and lying sometimes when I go to the Netherlands for example or to Belgium and I go downtown and I see the brick roads to know that these were built 300 years ago I'm shocked when I look at the old buildings 200 300 years old still in good shape while our own buildings after five or 10 years start to leak from rainwater or get burnt easily for any reason or the other it shows the lack of planning the lack of sincerity among the Muslims with the grace of Allah we have the best of Minds we sport talents and Technical minds and Geniuses all over the world so it has nothing to do with Islam in a negative sense rather Islam promotes us to be the best and the first in everything we do is it sufficient that Allah says in the Quran Allah says prepare with the best of your means whatever force and power you can to fight the enemies and this includes technological and scientific advances isn't it sufficient that the prophet himself said Allah loves when one of you executes something that he does it in a perfect manner so if you're a janitor as a Muslim you have to be the best genitor on Earth if you're an engineer it is your o religious obligation to be the most highly qualified engineer or a physician or a pilot or a builder or a scientist this is what we bring our children to be this is how they grow up not on Instagram and following Snapchat and following Facebook or Twitter or YouTubers or influencers these are scum these are trash regardless of what they do because because they have no value in Islam all what they do is show their skin and their filth and their IM Modest Behavior we know and they know that they're nothing so you cannot blame Islam for any of this we have to look in the mirror and start pointing fingers at the right person which is me"
