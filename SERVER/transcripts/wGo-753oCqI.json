  "transcript": "slamming raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he wore a suit muhammad ali yamin nabina muhammad in rider arias average main assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we're gonna start in a new chapter which deals with wiping over a low fame and the word hoof means anything that you wear on your feet and this is part of evolution of course because the last pillar of ablution is washing the feet so if you're gonna have shoes socks or whatever on your feet you know you won't be able to wash them and this chapter deals with wiping over whatever you're wearing on your feet the first hadith narrated animal arab in Shaba may allah be pleased with him i was with the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam he performed ablution and I was then about to remove his shoes when he said leave them for my feet were pure when I put them in so he rubbed over them now this hadith tells us that Alma here of the Sherpa was helping the Prophet salah salem perform moodle which means that it is okay for a search for a person to serve another so if someone wants to pour water so you perform moodle it's okay admirably Shaba one of the companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam once the Prophet finished wiping his head then it's the the turn of the feet so a new era went to take the shoes of the prophets I'm off and the Prophet told them leave them for I have put them on on a Tahara and what does that mean it means that if person performs mobile revolution and after he washed his feet he put on his socks or he put on his shoes he has worn these socks or shoes while being pure while being Paha after performing ablution so this entitles him to wipe over the shoes or the socks once he nullified his ablution his widow and wants to perform ablution again in this scenario it is very easy you wake up in the morning and perform ablution you wash your feet you put on your socks you put on your shoes and you go off to college or to work midday you answer the call of nature you go to the toilet go to the bathroom and then you want to perform will do so you prepare yourself to the apt to the noon prayers but when you perform a little should I take off my shoes should I take off my socks and wash my feet the answer would be no you don't have to do this why because the Prophet tells us at least about - Salam if you have worn your socks or shoes while you are in the state of purity and after performing ablution then all what you have to do is just wipe over them and this is the Sunnah but the question would be there's anything we wear on our feet if we ask for example Fatih does anything we wear on our feet applies or does it have to to be shoes you can it could be shoes or socks and you can before you can just wipe them off so that's again the question is to you does slippers do slippers countin yeah I think so well it has to be something that covers the whole foot slippers do not cover the whole foot there are areas of your feet that are exposed and they're naked so they don't count it they have to cover the whole foot for it to be allowed to wipe over the shoes or socks and this is the Sunnah as we go on reading the hadith sharla we will learn more and more about the time about the duration and about the nature of what we are wearing that the following hadith narrated by ali radiyaallahu anhu if the religion will pass it on opinion it will be more important to what the under part of the shoe than the upper but I have seen a lost messenger so lovely wa sallam weeping over the upper part of his shoes okay it's it's wiping not weeping will be wiping we cry and I hope we don't cry but it's wiping okay to wipe over the shoes there is a Sunnah now when we wash Mustafa when we wash our feet during ablution what do we wash the upper part or the lower part we wash both parts okay that's good he's awake that's great we wash the whole foot now if I'm wearing my socks and I want to wipe now one would say okay this is substituting for washing so I think I should wipe both sides now Adi says no this is not the Sunnah what's the Sonali can you Allah be pleased with him Adi says that the Sunnah is to wipe over the top of the foot or of the socks and why is that because this is the Sunnah and he's saying that if this sooner was by logic or reasoning of men then one would wipe the bottom of the foot because this is the part that steps on dirt steps on Filth so it should be more cleaned more than the surface of the foot and this is not the case religion is not my logic logic or reasoning though lots of it is but there are certain areas that allah azzawajal has made his own so allah does not justify every single thing for you there are things that it's common sense we can understand that allah awj Allah forbids intoxicants you know wine alcohol drugs Allah tells you this is Haram anyone with his sound mind would say I agree it's harmful it could lead to problems and it's not healthy Allah so gel forbids that one steals from the others or kills or fornicates because these are all part of the 10 commandments that everyone agrees upon yet there are things in Islam that we do not know that wisdom behind them we do not know the logic and reasoning so should we do it or should we stop until we know the reason this is the difference between the master and a slave a slave does not question he follows a master would pause and say I'm not convinced why should I do this why shouldn't I do that a slave complies with it with his master's instructions and this is arc the case in our in our case now Allah says men must not wear gold whether watches rings whatever the Prophet says these are forbidden for males and it's permissible for females one would say why that should be obscenity of business tells you do it you do it so one would say okay what about diamonds they say diamonds are forever can we put on diamonds as male as men hmm what do you think's amber why just too many mighty ideals behind it but I think because on diamonds are four liked women and secondly it's arrogance it shows excessive pride Huber's to be like flashing diamonds and gold is basically the same thing okay this is part of the normal reasoning yet when we come to Islamic sharia we find that allah azzawajal allows us to wear silver and the only thing he tells us through His Prophet Allison not to wear is gold this means that in order for us to make something forbidden we have to have the justification now for example intoxicants wine is mentioned in the holy quran is forbidden the reasoning it makes you unaware of what you do so whatever makes you unaware of what you do making the wrong decisions making their own moves it's considered to be part of intoxicants which means heroin and cocaine are considered to be intoxicants so it's Haram Why Why are they Haram because they share the same reasoning the Sheikh is it the same justification we got come back to gold and silver gold allah did not tell us why it's Haram oh you know what's forbidden why we don't know so you cannot say well diamonds emeralds rubies whatever are also the same verdict that is forbidden No everything in this world is permissible for us to use everything unless Allah specifies that this is Haram then we stop but if it does not say it's Haram we cannot say well it's arrogant I know a lot of arrogant people in their garments without wearing any gold or silver jewelry their arrogance arrogance is in the heart it's not in what you wear and you can wear flashy clothes you can wear designers clothes you can write the best cars but you sir humming and loving and caring and giving the poor what Allah so gel has instructed you to do and his has nothing to do with arrogance fadi say for instance someone has a golden ring and you didn't know that gold was Haram or and like not allowed in Islam so he took it and he changed the outer surface surface of the golden ring and to platinum for instance but the core is still like gold can you still wear that ring if it's like a d-ring or as he said I have to take it off what is the topic Mustafa wiping over the shoes wiping over the shoes and socks so it's a bit a little bit far-fetched nevertheless it's a legitimate question because it's in the topic we're talking about which is gold diamonds and and so on my cameraman says that we have to pause for a break please stay tuned and I'll answer your question in sha allah right after the break good questions that bother you what about issues of concern to you would you like to share things on your mind with us are you interested in solutions based an Islamic perspective please join me live in meet your advisor every Friday at 9 p.m. Mecca time here Oh Salam alaikum wa lillahi wa barakato brother Fadi before the break you had a question not related at topic but nevertheless as long as you've said it we have to answer it if we have the knowledge in sha allah to the question again my question was i was wondering if someone has a ring like a d-ring yes made out of gold and then he had it changed like the outer surface of it only into platinum is it permitted trim still to wear it still wearing it or not I'm not good in physics or chemistry but I think they have a certain symbol for gold metal like oxygen is Oh hydrogen is H there's a certain symbol for gold now if any metal contains this core this metal gold in it whether you put a coating outside coating whether you concealed it in your pocket it's forbidden for us to use now remember there is the yellow gold and there is a coating you put on the gold just to cover the yellowish part and put a white black whatever but the core the metal itself Gold is inside is still existing and there there is a third substance that some called platinum or white gold and it has nothing to do with yellow gold except sharing the name like in black gold that is oil they call it sometimes black gold and it's definitely not forbidden for males to use otherwise we wouldn't be able to transport from one place to the other if you have a watch and the inner parts the the mechanics inside mechanical parts are made of gold yellow gold though nobody can see it yet still it's forbidden for you to use it's forbidden for you to use a golden pen or to have a key ring that's made of gold as it is forbidden for us to use gold period except in certain cases that were found at the time of the Prophet an assassin I'm such as having a golden tooth then this is okay because it's a necessity in a form of medication not a form of showing off now white gold is a different story altogether because it's a different metal so it regardless of the name the name has no consequences it's like for example it's forbidden for men to wear silk that is natural silk but I don't know what you call this fabric that is not natural silk but they call it silk the important to some clothing it's not as expensive as natural silk though it shares the name silk but because it's not natural then it's okay for us to use so we come back to your question if you have a golden ring and you coat it with silver or with what ever substance as an outside layer it is still forbidden for you to use we come back to the hadith of Heidi no Adi may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the prophet sallallaahu Selim and the husband of his daughter the son law of the prophets um he was married to Fatima the daughter of the prophet Isaiah he is justifying this the sooner the sooner in wiping over your feet that is over your shoes or socks what you're wearing on your feet the Sunnah is to wife only the upper part the lower part is against the Sunnah re says it's not logical but this is religion religion is not by reasoning or logic because if it were to be by reasoning or logic then you would pause in so many things they say gee I don't believe in this I don't see what's the reason or wisdom behind this so I'm not gonna do it and this is a big problem you may succeed in finding the logic or reasoning behind 95% 98% or 99.9 percent as in their election you may find or succeed to find the reasoning behind that but there is this point 1 percent that you did not find the reasoning behind it though it is there in the Quran although it's there in the Sunna what will happen Satan will come and tell you don't accept this what do you want me to do reject it isn't on well even if it's in the Quran if you don't know the reasoning behind it don't reach it don't don't accept it and that is why as Muslims we follow the instructions of Allah and we follow the instructions of the Prophet that I saw Sarah without questioning we may ask what is the reason behind this and if we have a reason we tell it to you if we don't we say I don't know Allah tells us to do this we do it and you then have to comply you don't have the option of well if you don't tell me the reason I'm not gonna do it this is unacceptable and Islam it's exactly like driving a car and then there's this spread traffic light you look left and right there's no traffic so why should I stop the cops are on the other side and the guy is waiting in his car with the pad for writing a ticket and it's just weighing make my day make your move so what do you do well I don't see any reasoning for me to stop but the police tells me to stop so what should I do what do you do you stop nobody dares and cross a red traffic light when the police are watching why simply because you know they're gonna be a Punisher that and Allah has the higher example Allah tells you not to do this you are not in a position to say why yet you may ask just to increase your faith and believe and in this hadith the logic is there though Ali may Allah be pleased with him said that the reasoning or logic is not clear it's clear to us now imagine what happens if you wipe the bottom of your shoes or socks with wet hands what would happen to your hands they will become dirty from the dust from the filth and what will become to your shoes the minute you stop thought you step and and walk you're gonna catch more filth and dirt from the floor so the logic thing is that you wipe the upper part and this is symbolic but we have to do it and Sharia and Islam is filled with similar examples where Elijah is testing you he's examining you to see how you comply with what he says again don't mix the role of a servant and the role of a master we are servants of Allah we are the slaves of Allah he tells us to do something we say subhanAllah Alpana we have heard and we comply and we accept whatever Allah soja tells us but the men to say we have heard and we disagree this is the role of the Jews who were commanded to do things and they did not follow what Allah Azza WA JAL has ordered them to do the following hadith narrated by stefanov now said the prophet sallallaahu l'm used to commend us when we were traveling not to take off our shoes for three days and nights except for sexual impurity and not to do so on account of easing ourselves passing water or sleeping ok this hadith tells us that if a person is traveling he has the period of three days and three nights which is equivalent of 72 hours that he has the option to wipe over his shoes or socks during this period of three days and three nights whether he urinates passes stool or falls asleep he when he performs ablution he all what he has to do is wipe over his socks or over his shoes with the exception of sexual impurity and why is that because sexual impurity requires that you have a total bath you have muscle and you cannot have a total bath with wiping your socks you have to take off your socks shoes and you have to perform this total bath muscle all in all and if you find this hadith the following hadith will elaborate a little bit on the period insha'Allah so hadith number yes Fadi I have a question so you're free traveling so is it better for us to take off the shoes and yeah like if you do performing ablution to wash our feet or is it better for us not to do so no is that is the question understood I'm travelling and I have my shoes I wore my shoes on Appa Hara perform ablution and I'm wearing my shoes now it's time for prayer should I take off my shoes and wash my feet or is it recommendable to wipe over the shoes it depends on what you're doing if you mistake you are in if I'm in the state of an inn I'm having my shoes on then I wipe on my shoes or wipe on my socks if I don't have them I wash my feet scholars say that this is made to make your life easier so it is up to you it is the this mean that if I started traveling today and I have three days which is Saturday Sunday and Monday that during these three days I may not take off my shoes no it depends on what how you feel so it's not obligatory that someone well I made a mistake I wore my shoes on would walk now I have to stay three is three full nights without taking off my shoes just to comply with the Sun and no no what no one says this but is it recommendable well if I'm having my shoes on let's recommendable that you wipe over them and you have no problem in doing this and this brings us back a little bit to the previous hadith where adi says may allah be pleased with him wiping over the over the surface of the foot now when you wipe over the foot nut underneath the foot when you wipe over the shoes or the socks this does not happen you do not put water in your hands and you soak your shoes or socks it's called wiping it's not called washing so all what you have to do is just wet your your hands and it's it's there's no water in it it's just wet and you all what you do is once from the front to the back of your foot and of your foot once all what you do is once you don't have to soak it and a lot of people have this strong idea of doing it they wet their hands really well and put some water in their hands and then put it on the socks or on the feet and this is wrong you are not supposed to wash it you're supposed to wipe on it again the hadith where the prophets are seldom instructed so funny mile may Allah be pleased with him that you may and this is a permission this is Sunnah you may have three days and three nights to wipe over your socks and when you are traveling but how long can I do this when I'm residing how long can I do this when I'm in my city or in my hometown this is sha Allah we will come to discuss in a little bit you know confusing but not that confusing insha'Allah next time we meet and until then fear man allah wa salam alaykom what I heard Allah he what about a cat"
