  "transcript": "we're still discussing the hadiths related to the Seal of the prophethood which is a physical characteristic of the Prophet may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to me once oh Abu Z come close to me and stroke my back I duy stroked his back whereupon my fingers touched the seal I said what is the seal that is the is asking what is the seal he said interwin hairs what does this mean may Allah pleased with him was a companion and when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam noticed that he had an interest in looking at the Seal of prophethood which is in the prophet's body he deliberately asked him and this shows you the kindness of the Prophet Alat wasam to come and touch it so the companion touched it physically and he described it as interwin hairs which means that this piece of flashh between the shoulders at the back of the Prophet had hair on it and this was something that he felt now Abu Z Allah be pleased with him was close to the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam and the prophet gave Dua that Allah makes him more handsome and gives him health and they say that he lived long he had no wrinkles on his face his hair was always black and he died as a healthy person may Allah be pleased with him the follow in Hadith is narrated by Abu may Allah be pleased with him he said Sal Al may Allah be pleased with him brought to the prophet of allaham when he reached Medina a table with ripe dates upon it and he placed it in front of the Prophet Alat wasam so he said when the prophet saw thisam oh Salman what is this Salman replied A charitable gift for you and for your companions so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam rejected it and said take it away for we will not eat a charitable gift the prophet does not accept charity he that is Salman therefore took it away then he came the next day with the like of it and he placed it in front of the Prophet Alat wasam who said what is this oh Salman he replied a present for you so the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said to his companions here the translation is spread out while actually it means spread and open your hands so that I can give you from it your share Salman looked at the seal on the back of Allah's messenger so he believed in him he was a slave of the Jews however uh um the prophet of allaham purchased him or purchased his freedom at such and such a price of silver coin on condition that he that the prophet Alam would plant date palms for them for the Jews as a compensation and thenat planted these trees or palm trees and Salman would work on them until they bore edible fruit the prophet of Allah Alat then planted these dates uh Palms apart from one date palm that Omar planted the date palms then bore their animal crop immediately that tree which Omar may Allah be pleased with him planted did not bear fruit so the prophet Sall Alam said what is the matter with this uh date palm so Omar said oh prophet of Allah I planted it and the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaih wasallam therefore uprooted it and then planted it again so it bore its anual crop this Hadith is part of a very long Hadith of the story of the truth Seeker Salman may Allah be pleased with him Salman left his country fled with his religion because he knew that monism is a true religion but his father was a priest for the for the fire worshippers and he was grooming his son to be one of such nature and job so he captivated his son he tortured his son until he ran away and accompanied a number of different different religions Jews and Christians priests fakes and true until the last one who was a righteous Pious Christian priest who told him the truth of a prophet coming in this era with the same religion of Abraham peace be upon him and that he would come out in the lands of the Arabs uh he would migrate to a land between two volcanic mountains and a lot of date uh uh palm trees uh would be there and he has three distinctive characteristics that you cannot miss one he doesn't eat charity very important two he accepts gifts three he has the Seal of the prophethood so the whole Hadith talks about how the prophet s wasallam fulfilled two of the characteristics when he refused to eat charity and ask his companions to eat from it he did not touch it when it was a gift he accepted it and ate from it along with his companions when he recognized that these two characteristics were sought after by Salman he realized that he was looking for the third one so he asked Salman may Allah be pleased with him to come from behind him and revealed the Seal of the prophethood and when s man saw the Seal of the Prophet Hood he embraced the prophet Alam and and could not hold himself back from crying and weeping and the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam asked him about his story so Salman told him about his miraculous and marvelous Journey seeking the truth then the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam asked him to negotiate and bargain with his masters from the Jews the owners of this slave to buy himself out and he told them that we will help you so the Jews knew that this was a bargain they requested 40 ounces of silver and 300 palm trees to be planted that's huge it's almost a farm so the prophet alham asked companions to uh lend him a hand and they all brought these palm trees uh um small palm trees to him and the prophet with his own honorable hand managed to plant all of these for him and he gained his freedom afterwards this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you"
