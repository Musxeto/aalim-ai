  "transcript": "ossama says is it an innovation to raise the index finger while reciting the Shahada ashhadu Allah Allah Allah la ilaha illallah WA ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh after completing the Woodill now in order to know whether this is an innovation or not the only way to do so is to go to the books of hadith why is that the books of hadith or known as the books of Sunnah describes to us what the Prophet had done at a salon sanam or said or approved something that happened in front of him and he approved it so by this we could tell whether this is a sunnah or not so if we go through the books of hadith and we find that it is part of the sunnah to say the Shahada afterward oh I were to say a llama join him in Ottowa bean which i named inanimate oppa hearing or to ask a non-muslim to accept islam by teaching him how to say the Shahada say ashhadu an LA ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh in these cases can we say a shadow as we sometimes do i have done this so many times when people ask me to say the Shahada say ashhadu an la illaha and when I look at the video once again I said where did I get this from unfortunately some of the Duat out of goodwill when they teach others how to say the Shahada they say ashhadu an la ilaha illa allah and they do this and we pick from them without contemplating and we do it but as a true Muslim and student of knowledge you have to refer back to the books of Sunnah and in the books of sooner you will never find that the Prophet used to raise his index finger when finishing the Woodill or when declaring the Shahada to non-muslims to revert to Islam so if the Prophet did not do it Harris allah azza this means that we should not do it because this is not part of the Sunnah hence it would be an innovation so once we finish there than the the would do we just simply say lillah hello hello sherry Cara Machado no Mohammed Abdullah so that's it if someone wants to accept Islam I would just tell him without pointing my index finger to the heavens as lots of us may do because this is not part of the way of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam you"
