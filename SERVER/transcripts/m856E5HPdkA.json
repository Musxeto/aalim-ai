  "transcript": "she laid off Amanda Rahim and haven't been there perd√≥name Oh salat wa salam Oh Allen man Borussia Martin Dale Holloman sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh hadith number twenty was narrated by the companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam a mama's root l battery he tells us that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said verily from what the people had learned from the speech of the earliest prophecy was if you feel no shame then do as you wish and this was reported by Albahari the Prophet is telling us Ali salat WA Salam that the religions that preceded our religion can be also a source of information to us as Muslims but you have to be careful because whatever is in the previous religions it can be one of three either it goes side by side with our religion so we have to follow that not because it's in the previous religions but because it's in our religion or it might go against our religion so we have to reject this the third option is that it doesn't go against and it is not in accordance to our religion such as the stories of the prophets and what happened to them but it doesn't go against our teachings in Islam in this case we do not say that it's false and we do not say that it is truth and we take it as it is there's no problem the Prophet said Isis Salam if it doesn't go against your religion then you may say the stories of the sons of Israel no problem Charlotte now this is a prophecy that the Prophet told the Sallisaw some that the people around you now one of the earliest speeches from a prophecy that came before you and the people are circulating is if you feel no shame do as you wish do as you please now is this a permission is it a permission for us if we have no shame to do whatever sin or shameful acts we feel like doing dancers no definitely not this is a linguistic way of telling you and warning you that if you have no shame and you do whatever you wish you will be held accountable on the day of judgment because shame is the last line of defense that prevents you from doing things that are not appropriate and what is shame and actually the word used in the hadith is negating bashfulness and shyness so if you're not bashful if you're not shy you may do whatever you wish so what is shyness that this hadith highlights and puts great value to shyness or bashfulness is a feeling that one gets it's a change in one's internal feelings because being afraid of being blamed for doing something so it's an honorable feeling bashfulness and shyness that drives people to stay away from whatever condemns them or brings bad reputation to them and it drives people to fulfill others rights so I may be bashful or shy from my parents and that is why I provide for them and I support them because I'm bashful I don't want to be ashamed of not supporting them it's a duty of mine and this Duty cascades on all aspects of life and not only that the hadith also means that if you are a practicing Muslim and this particular thing if you do it you don't feel ashamed of doing it means that's permissible go ahead and do it so for example I'd like to play squash with a friend do I feel ashamed when people know that I play squash No then go ahead there's no problem in doing it this does not apply with someone who is sinful because a sinful person does not mind walking in shorts in the middle of the street men and women are looking at him you're exposing your outer he has no problem he has no shame he has no bashfulness so this doesn't mean because you don't have shame or bashfulness it's okay for you to walk like this no it is not in the warning is do whatever you want on the day of judgment you're going to be punished so this can be looked at in both ways and bashfulness or higher is a good thing and it only brings good things the prophet sallallaahu are you what if Salem told us that bashfulness or shyness is one of the branches of Eman the 60-plus branches not only that the Prophet was walking once and saw a man talking to another man and this happens with us all the time we made tell a friend why are you so shy come on be forthcoming be a man speak out demand decent demand that the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam saw a man addressing another and he is blaming him for being so shy the Prophet Elisha was an intervened and said leave him bashfulness does not bring anything except good and haya Lyautey lebryk like leave him the feeling of bashfulness of being shy is a positive one now we're going to define insha'Allah which kind of bashfulness is or which kind of shyness is positive and which is negative now there are types of bashfulness the highest and the best is what Allah implants in us so that we are bashful of him we are shy of Allah so agenda and this results only from knowing Allah from acknowledging his beautiful names and attributes from knowing that Allah is close to his servants overlooking what they do and Allah Azza WA JAL is the one who provide for them and who helps them this is the highest form of being shy of Allah and a lot of the Muslims unfortunately failed to acknowledge Allah failed to know Allah through his beautiful names and attributes give any one of them an a4 paper ask him to write the names of Allah he knows and the majority would fail to go past two or three lines if you ask them to explain the names of Allah none would know what is the meaning of a summit none would know what is the meaning of al Jabar and how many meaning it has and so on so to be able to be bashful and shy of Allah you have to acknowledge a large beautiful names and attributes and be aware that Allah is watching you and this can be god-given this can be a gift of Allah and also can be achieved through training and those who are blessed by Allah to have it in them built in them they are blessed and favored by Allah but those who don't they have to work out and they have to train themselves how do I train myself which gym should I go to well it's not a gym you have to surround yourself with practicing believers practicing Muslims who are shy of Allah when you are with them Shaitaan finds it difficult to attack the Prophet tells us a little to Sarah that the wolf does not attack except a stray sheep if there's a herd of sheep the wolf stays until one of these sheep goes out from the flock from the pack and the wolf attacks it and likewise a lot of the Muslims who suffer from depression or from OCD or from lack of Eman and reduction in the levels of the belief this is attributed to the fact that they are a one-man band they're so low they don't have any friends once they surround themselves with the Muslim practicing community whether in the Masjid whether at school there all the time with these practicing brothers you would find that your shyness of Allah the levels of bashfulness are far far high why because you are finding this present through the people that surround you you learn from them you adapt to their character and to the quality the good high quality of their moral ethics and conduct by just being with them this is one of the greatest means and ways of adapting to be shy from Allah as Waja we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back the value of money in the hereafter will be measured by its proper use in the present [Music] [Music] according to the glorious quran one of the best ways to use your money is to spend it in the way of allah subhanaw taala by spreading this TV

exposed by dr zakir naik next on Peace TV assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah and welcome back there are two types of Chinese and being bashful one is to be bashful of Allah so it's yet to be shy knowing that Allah watches you and Allah hears you so this deters you from sinning this is always with you and that is why you stay away from what angers Allah because you are shy of Allah soldier the second type of shyness is when you shy with the people so maybe it's not sinful but it is inappropriate as in the case if you are in a circle of knowledge the chef is in front of you and then you extend your feet in his face you stretch your legs and there's nothing between you and him is it forbidden in Islam no it's not mentioned the Quran and the Sunnah but it is in inappropriate only people with no shame would do this thing even in front of their parents you cannot stretch your feet stretch your leg like this in front of your parents this is inappropriate so there are levels of bashfulness even with the individuals with human beings this is the level that keeps us away from being impolite and bashfulness as stated before is an honorable feeling that deters you from doing bad things that may have an impact or an influence over your reputation so that people would say that look at so-and-so he did this and that this is inappropriate what a bad thing to do then the Arabs had this even before Islam and as is why Allah selected them to have the message of Islam and then it would be spread all over the world because at the time they were the best of all nations in intellect linguistically though they were the poorest but they had things in them that they'd rather die than not do they'd rather die than to beg people or to do shameless or shameful things this is what that is why hind' been taught by the wife of abu sufyan of najara the mother of mahalia amina be Sophia may Allah be pleased with them both or all she went to give the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet Allison when the Prophet conquered Mecca and when she heard the Prophet area so some say give me the Pledge of Allegiance that you do not fornicate or commit adultery what did she say she said prophet of Allah does a free woman fornicate this is unimaginable there's a free woman not a concubine there's a free woman fornicate and this shows you the amount of bashfulness they had as Arabs before Islam her husband Abu Sufian when he was summoned at the court of the Byzantium ruler and he wanted to ask him about the Prophet Allah so some Abu Sufian was at the time a mushrik an idol worshipper he was an enemy of the Prophet Isis era and the ruler kept on asking him questions about Sofia and said by Allah had I not feared that they would circulate among themselves that I lied I would have lied but I was bashful I was shy of people circulating among them that Abu Sufyan has lied so this feeling was there even before Islam Islam came to enforce to strengthen this beautiful feeling in our hearts unfortunately this bashful feeling that hint meant at mahat does not exist or ceases to exist perfectly nowadays it is one of the most beautiful characteristic of a woman to be bashful and whenever you hear a woman being bashful you feel that this is part of her beauty and that is why a virgin is described to be bashful the Prophet tells us a lesson when there's a proposal for a virgin woman or a girl then you have to display that to tell her so-and-so proposed to you if she looks down and does not object this means that she has approved of him why because she's a virgin if she rejects him she would object no I don't want this man he's ugly his poor he is old but once she looks down and she does not say anything the Prophet says that this is an indication that she has approved of him why because she's bashful she's shy nowadays unfortunately girls are not like this at all they have taken the veil of bashfulness and thrown it away and this is because of TV channels satellite channels that expose them to dancing and singing and love affairs not only that even to homosexuality so girls are not girls anymore boys are not boys anymore now the Muslims unfortunately a lot of them have been exposed to different cultures and they've neglected their own religion and culture and that is why you find them affected by the means of media and you don't find this bashfulness in them and this is something that has to be rectified and fixed quickly because it is a branch of Eman as the Prophet tells the selling salat-u-salam now being shy can be positive and can be negative it's positive when it prevents you from falling into sin it is positive when it is forcing you to fulfill the rights of others who need to have their rights fulfilled like the parents the wife the children so you're bashful you're shy that if you don't be kind people would talk against you so you do this it can be negative when it has the opposite effect for example if your bashfulness and china's stop you from seeking knowledge then this is negative scholars say that knowledge cannot be attained by someone who's shy and someone who is arrogant the shy person sits in a circle of knowledge listens to a lecture has six or seven questions in his mind he is unable to understand yet he fails to ask questions why he's bashful why did you ask I was afraid people would laugh maybe they would think I'm stupid I'm this or that this is wrong this is negative form of shyness like wise the companions were completely unlike this I'm so lame may Allah be pleased with her one of the great companions of the Prophet the mother of an asymptomatic she goes to the Prophet Elias asan and the wife of the Prophet umm Salama is there and she says o prophet of allah allah is not bashful Allah is not shy from the truth if a woman sees a wet dream does she have to offer also and the Prophet said Alice awesome if she ejaculates if she sees the ejaculation water coming out then she has to perform was own Salama said to her you have exposed women what kind of question do you ask and the Prophet said Alice Oh Sam hush don't talk like this umm Salama she is learning her religion so this was not to do with bashfulness or shyness she had to learn her religion and she had to ask the question the shyness that prevents you from forbidding evil and vice is not a positive shyness this is not recommended bashfulness this is being simply coward when you see evil will you see vice taking place and you do not react why don't you tell these people what they're doing is wrong I'm shy and bad no you're not you're a coward this is negative and you are sinful you have to go and tell them why aren't you praying why are you drinking intoxicants why are you listening to music all of this is Haram you have to go and address them and unfortunately shyness has disappeared from earth or almost has disappeared the common denominator between the disbelievers is the love for nudity and this is what made our forefathers Adam and Eve peace be upon them dissent when they ate from the forbidden fruit and they saw that the clothes and the things that we're covering their outer has disappeared if you go to the jungles of Africa or the jungles of the Amazon they are disbelievers they're kafir I'm not talking about the Muslim ones the Muslims are different the disbelievers you will find them sharing the same qualities of the civilized disbelievers the common denominator is they're both disbelievers and not only that that they praise nudity and this shows you that bashfulness in Chinese has disappeared you would find a woman wearing nothing on beaches you would find men wearing nothing in sports clubs what is this don't you have any shame in you don't you have any shyness of people looking at you so no this is my body I can show it to whomever I want it's ma'am forbids this and fights this you can show your body only to your spouse he's the only one or she's the only one who can enjoy this but it's the same thing nudity in Africa in the Amazons and nudity in nightclubs and on nude beach camps why because they do not have the Eman the belief in their hearts and as a prophet said that Islam if you have no shame do whatever you wish to do and this is exactly what they're doing these forbidden relationships these nudity magazines TV stations on the streets or billboards it's corrupting the society and they don't feel it they don't know it but this affects their marriages that affects the family it affects the schools its affect the teenagers it affects everybody yet they fail to recognize this this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
