  "title": "How to give dawah to people who say you people label hadiths as weak, fabricated etc Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so uh I follow the methodology of alul hadees so when I give dawa to some people they ask me why do you say about the hadees like it is a week and it is a zaif and all what in case if this Hadith is a authentic and you are passing it it as a zaif why do you say it like that and uh okay check the authenticity of Hadith okay your line is breaking zahraine but I got your question inshallah so basically speaking when we speak to people of ignorance many times they wonder why do you say that this Hadith is authentic this is not authentic this is weak this is fabricated this is this and this is that how dare you say such a thing where the Hadith might be authentic and you're not knowing that these people are ignorant and with ignorant people we have to take it really slow to spoon feed them knowledge until they are grown up and can eat by themselves so we explain to them and we show them the different books of hadiths and we tell them that there are hadiths that are fabricated that are blatant lies and the prophet did not say those you as an individual can find that out through your logic and you would not accept it however your logic is not always correct this is why Allah the Almighty sent to us Scholars of Islam who would purify the Hadith collection and would follow certain sciences that govern this beautiful knowledge and purify it from any impurities so if you tell them about certain hadiths that go against logic that go against the Quran they would say no no this is fabricated we don't believe in this and you say to them that's that's correct but there are other hadiths that may sound logical but they're not authentic and the only religion on Earth that has the system of segregating what is authentic from what's not is Islam and it's not for any Tom Dick or Harry to come it's rather for Scholars who had spent 30 or 40 Years of their lives studying and teaching learning and reading and researching so that they can purify this beautiful science this beautiful Knowledge from anything that is not related to it if you do this inshallah you will gain their trust and they will follow you"
