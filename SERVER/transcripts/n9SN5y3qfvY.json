  "transcript": "What is Insan? Hokul Insan in Arabic translates to human rights and Islam is the best human rights advocate. However, it is not what the people nowadays consider to be human rights. So, it is totally different because we abide by the human rights put to us by the creator of the humans. No one knows the humans more than allahel. So the system is from Allah. So when Allah tells us that if you die leaving boys and girls as your offspring and the boys get double the girls in accordance to Islam, this is the perfect law. In accordance to all other countries and and people of intellect or other religions say no, this is not fair. A woman should be equal to um a man or a female should be equal to a male. This is not right. Well, this is Islamic law. So, this is the best uh uh human rights when it comes to personal freedom. This a human rights. You could be gay, you could be an animal, you could be uh uh whatever. And this is part of your own rights. And this is not right. They say you can slander and talk about anyone you don't like and say bad things about them. In Islam, it protects the reputation of an individual. So if you slander a woman, you'll be you'll be flogged 80 lashes unless you bring four witnesses to testify that she committed fornication or adultery. So human rights is in Islam. It tells you to be fair. It tells you to be just. It tells you to be kind. It tells you to do the things that the Quran and the Sunnah tell tell you to do. And you will find that if implemented, if done and followed as Allahel commanded and the prophetam instructed, then the people, the humans, the whole of humanity would live a perfect life.
