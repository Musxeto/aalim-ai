  "transcript": "question about can you hear me right now I can't hear you loud and clear yeah I was just wondering well I saw this matter online it's called Uh a lot of Muslims a lot of young Muslims are getting better with their Dean but a lot of them are struggling with uh you know trying to get out of music so they're using a crutch called Lo-Fi and I'm just wondering there's a version of local Quran and is that permissible what is it called is low Fidelity itself basically they're trying to have a but and recitation and a style of music That's reverbed which is electronically which is an electronic Echo and slowed with a low tempo okay first of all I don't have knowledge about this so I have to research it and look into it before I can give a verdict but attentively it seems to be disrespecting the Quran whenever someone is addicted to music and he thinks that listening to the Quran with sound effects and trying to manipulate The reciter's Voice so that it has these variations similar to a song or music so that it would have the same impact this is without doubt disrespecting the Quran insulting and humiliating the Quran when you degrade it to that level so basically speaking Quran is the word of Allah it has to be respected the vast majority of Scholars say it is respected to the extent that you cannot hold the musaf the copy of the Quran if you are not in the state of abolition or wudu it shows you and this is the only scripture on Earth that requires such a condition so to degrade it into the level of substituting music then what tomorrow a rapper comes and recites either in a wrapping way and then when he raps he does this and all these stupid things this is not permissible this is the Quran this is Islam this is religion so this is my yeah uh attentively speaking my opinion on this issue but as I said I have to listen to or research it so that I can uh know what it is about and and take a listen to it"
