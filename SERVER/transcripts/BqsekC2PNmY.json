  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good enlightening this day is so bright as the first thought always tonight with family around the nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love and i do apologize for the seven minute delay of uh today's episode due to some technical reasons we continue studying the chapter that deals with fasting from the book of bulu almaram and today we will study insha allah with the grace of allah hadith number 16 17 and 18 that all revolve around cupping or known in arabic as so let's go through these hadiths and then we start to talk about the rulings insha allah even abbas may allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had himself cupped while he was in a state of haram and had himself cupped while he was fasting and this was reported by imam al-bukhari the following hadith hadith number 17 shaddad ibn may allah be pleased with him he narrated that the prophet of allah came across a man in medina who was having himself cupped in ramadan and said to him who is he and said to him the one who cups and the one who is being cupped have both broken their fast and the final hadith is the hadith of anas hadith number 18 may allah be pleased with him anas says the first time cupping was disliked for the one who is fasting was when jafar even may allah be pleased with him had himself cupped while fasting and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam came across him and said those two have broken their fast referring and meaning jaffa and the man who was cupping him but later on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam allowed cupping for the one who is fasting anus may allah be pleased with him used to have himself cupped while he was fasting and this concludes the third hadith now if we look at these hadiths we find that they are conflicting in a way hadith and we know that the bukhari is the most authentic book after the quran and it states that the prophet allah did cupping himself while he was in the state of israel and this is not our topic and while he was in the state of fasting while he was fasting and this is what we're referring to here but shaddad aus hadith though it is not in al-bukhari or muslim yet it's graded as authentic by scholars stated that the prophet sallam saw a man being cupped and he said that this person and the one who's copying him they have both nullified and voided their fasting and the third hadith of jaffa abi talib the cousin of the prophet allah the brother of ali may allah be pleased with them both he was performing cupping and the prophet came to him and told him that this person and the one who's cupping him has nullified their fasting but later on he allowed them to perform cupping while fasting and anas used to do that may allah be pleased with him while he was fasting as well so how can we understand these hadiths first of all what is cupping cupping is you could say a surgical procedure but very minor it is using a blade and making scratches or small wounds at the back of the neck or at the back of the shoulders and then sucking the blood from these uh scratches or the slashes you had made and usually at the old time they used to do this through the conventional ways by placing a device and then sucking the air out of it so that the blood would be extracted now a days they have maybe a little bit more advanced methods so they bring a cup and then they light something inside it so it would be vacuumed from air and then they place it on the uh slashes and and these small wounds and it sucks the blood out of it and why are you doing this is this something to deal with vampires and and werewolves or whatever no definitely not this is part of the sunnah what kind of sunnah is this why do you do this see the prophet this is part of the prophetic medicine and what is the prophetic medicine there are things that in the hadith in the sunnah where the prophet tells us that if you do these they have benefits medical benefits over you and medication can either be through islamic means or through medical means that are proven or through a third way which is not related to either and this is prohibited so the first islamic means we have the quran we have the we have zamzam water we have the black seed or soda we have cupping we have honey if you eat honey or drink it depending on how you consume it this is one of the greatest medication on earth natural medication and you have catheterization which is burning the flesh in particular areas for particular diseases these are medication that the sunnah has brought forward to us the prophet says if healing might be in anything it is in one of three a taste of honey or cupping the the splashes of the blade of a copper or in catheterization this is cupping what does it do to you it does wonders medically proven wonders because it is unlike bleeding from your body this blood at the back of the neck or the shoulders some do it in the knees some do it at the limbs at the end of the limbs and the feet they say out of practice that the blood in nature is different than what comes out when you bleed from a normal wound it's thick it's not easy uh moving in this viscosity is very thick and i don't know i'm not a doctor i'm not a medical doctor but it has been proven and tested that it relieves from migraines it improves your eyesight it lessens the need for sleeping hours a lot and there are so many things about it to us as muslims all of this does not matter because what matters is that the prophet himself alessan had done it so we are encouraged to do it either to follow the sunnah and that is it as imam ahmad did once imam had a couple to come and cup him and after he finished he gave him a dinar and he not is a big amount of money so they told him may allah have mercy on you if you're given if you had given him one dina one dirham that would have would have been more than enough he would have been happy he said i know but every sunnah that the prophet did and i reported in my books of hadith i have done in my life except this particular sunnah where the prophet salam performed cupping and gave the copper a dinar i did not do this so i thought this is the only thing missing for me to complete following the prophet islam in all of his actions subhanallah so this is a means of healing first of all there are normal medical lab tested proven medication so we know if you take antibiotics it's good for your infection if you take a certain medication it's good for your headaches it relieves you from your headaches a certain medication eases the rash on your skin or cures burns etc so this is clinically proven it was proven through lab tests and experience experiments and physicians the doctors tell us that yes this is a proper medication so this is also halal for you to use the third category is what the doctors say this is not known to cure anything and people claim that through experience it cures for example they say that there is a bracelet that you wear and it's called energy bracelet and it ha gives you energy and it absorbs from you um the negative waves and and stuff doctors say this is baloney this is nothing this is bogus and people insist other bracelets like copper bracelets and say this takes away all your rhomatism and your uh uh joint pains and and bone pains etc doctors say this is nonsense so believing in such things and using them is minor shirk if you believe that allah is the one who cures you through these things but if you don't if you believe that they cure you by themselves and by their own powers this is my major shirt and you're not a muslim anymore likewise those who wear rings with stones over for example or uh i have the tiger or whatever thinking that it gives them special powers or some kind of energy this is minor shirk depending on your belief or major share so going back to the issue of cupping cupping is a well-established sunnah what is the ruling of cupping while in the state of fasting the scholars differed the majority of them say that it does not affect your fasting however some scholars said that the hadith of clearly states that the prophet said these two have nullified their fasting and also the hadith of anas what he when he passed by jaffram repeats with him he told him that you and the man who's doing cupping to you you both have nullified your fasting so they say that these hadiths are crystal clear the majority of scholars say yes but the hadith of anas clearly explained that the prophet said allah afterwards that he permitted them to make cupping while fasting and anas used to do it while fasting he's the narrator of the hadith not only that the hadith is in sahih bukhari and with his father and no one doubts the hadith of al-bukhari so what to do when we have what seems to be clashing evidences scholars say that there are four levels the first thing try to apply both at the same time so if you have two hadiths or a hadith and an ayah or two and they sound to be conflicting no try to apply them together and compromise example allah says in the quran will make it toward them allah has made forbidden upon you the dead animals and the blood and the swine flesh so this is clear it's prohibited for you the dead animal and the blood of course the blood is the one that is gushing when you slaughter an animal and the blood comes out gushing this is impure this is nudges some cultures they would collect the blood in a vessel and then they cook it and eat it this is totally prohibited now the blood that remains in the veins so if you get a big nice fat steak a rabbi and you cut it and it comes out some blood from the meat it was not well done or medium cooked it was rare so does this mean that this is nudges and i cannot eat it no what's what remains in the veins this is something you cannot dry out so it is forgiven coming back to the ayah allah says it was made unlawful for you it was made prohibited for you the dead animal and the blood that animal is an animal that is not slaughtered so if i hit an animal by my with my car i cannot go and eat the flesh this was not slaughtered if an animal dies in its sleep i cannot eat it because it's a dead meat dead animal if an animal had a fight with another animal or if a wolf attacked a sheep and left it dead i cannot eat it because this was not properly or islamically slaughtered so the ayah is crystal clear it is prohibited but there is a hadith where the prophet says two dead meats and two blood were made permissible for us the fish and the locust and the liver and the spleen so the prophet assalam said it was made permissible so how can we combine between the ayah and the hadith it's very simple the scholars say you can join both of them by saying every dead meat is haram with the exception of seafood and locust and likewise all types of blood is haram with the exception of livers and spleens so this is what is known as general and specific the second level if we try to look at these two evidences and we cannot join no way we can't do that what to do in the second level we have to ignore one of them because if you cannot join then one of them has to fall has to leave and one of the best ways of doing so is looking at the dates so if one came before the other then definitely we know that this abrogates the one that came previously so i read the quran allah says the almighty do not approach prayer while you are in the state of intoxication ah this means that i can party after isha till fajr and be wasted and by the time of fajr the hangover is gone and i'm sober and i can pray that's good but later on i pass by an ayah where allah says that verily that intoxications wine and gambling and uh the lots drawing of the lots and the idols are all abomination of shaytaan mean shaytaan and you have to refrain from it so now i have two verses that definitely one says it's okay to pray but not while you are intoxicated and other one says that no this is totally prohibited altogether so now i know that this one came after that one and this one abrogates the one that came previously if something happened in makkah and then another thing happened medina i know madinah came after mecca so this abrogates her so if we have a date then we have no problem in that if we have an evidence telling us that one preceded the other then we know that the first one is abrogated but if you don't know the dates as in our case here in this case the scholars say let's sway between the evidences so if it's a quran and a sunnah definitely the quran is heavier we give it a priority if both of them are sunnah or a hadith but one is in bukhari and the other one is for example then definitely bukhari rules because it is more authentic and much credible than any other book of hadith and likewise and the fourth and the final level what about if i cannot follow the three previous stages i cannot combine and i don't know what obligated what and the third one i cannot uh utilize i cannot tell which one is stronger than the other the fourth level is that you abstain you just stop and say i don't know because no way that two evidences conflict and they're both authentic because they came from allah azza and there is no way that it can conflict there has to be a way out but i don't possess the knowledge at the moment so the knowledge is with allah i'll wait until someone who's more knowledgeable comes and solves the problem for me having said that what is the most authentic opinion it's an issue of dispute as stated but the majority say that cupping does not nullify your wudu and i'm inclined to follow this opinion having said that at all we do not encourage people to do cupping while they're in the state of fasting because alhamdulillah you have the whole night after maghrib after sunset to do it so why insist on doing doing it while fasting so to be safe rather than sorry it is best for you to delay it after you break your fast but if you do it while fasting there's nothing wrong with that insha allah unless you become weary and tired and you are unable to continue fasting in this case it nullifies your fasting does checking my sugar level or taking samples of my blood at the lab also takes the same ruling the answer is no because this is different than cupping cupping usually is accompanied by being tired and your system is down while taking a sample of your blood even a bottle or two that does not harm you or affect you what about the ruling on let's say a blood donation well it depends if you're going to donate three or four pints for example this would definitely put your system down and will make you too tired and maybe make you faint so in this case we would feel more inclined to say that this uh affects your fasting negatively and it breaks it but if it's a small wound if you're bleeding if you go to the doctor and extract the tooth and you bleed all of this does not affect your fasting due to the blood coming out no your fasting is still intact we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back in sha allah the forgiveness of your lord and to paradise the width of which is the heavens and the earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and sisters

the salah so just uh i was not offended on that and uh i am i'm i am so much thankful and i have learned so much from yourself and dr salah so many things after coming to saudi arabia all these speakers because in my place so much of vida vida and innovations are going on so i'm trying to learn and impart these things to my family and my friends and all whatever it is along with imam when he is reciting loudly sake okay i will answer your question thank you you're welcome jose from nigeria yusuf listen to me from the phone new to tv please my first question is yes he's a old woman she's above 70 and she didn't make it maybe even she has questions he didn't uh make it through are we to if i give charity out of it or we are going to do it for her okay i will answer the question inshallah okay uh shamsudeen from saudi arabia yeah my first question goes does i want to ask the question concept does the islamic ruling concerning philia philia a pregnant woman or somebody that just diverged what does she have to make payment or she has to make that fast that's my first question then the second question is that if by chance i had an opportunity of going together i never had the intention of making umura so i found out that my flight was still in the night and i made umrah and i did my my record at masjid aisha is there any expiration for that so i do have to go to toi without having an intention before okay i will answer your question inshallah thank you so much you're welcome i've been listening to your programs and i've noticed that we keep talking about trying to stay as close to our kit and kin and to ignore any attempts to stay away from them but something is bothering me that my brother over the years over many years has been doing a lot of wrong in which uh financial irregularities and some other very serious crimes if you want to call it now what i want to know is it uh required by me to just keep my mouth shut to keep close or should i report it to the authorities thank you very much okay aisha from saudi um when women of the house make a star like cut fruits and all and give it to the family and they eat it so does this form to the category of someone giving a start to the food and uh we get the reward of them without without them losing the reward you mean that they cook food and give it to you to break your fast on no no if if the women of the house yes make a astar and give it to their family they make what okay okay and they give it to the family so does this form the category of someone giving others a star and they getting the reward of them also okay i will answer your question i have two questions the first one is one of my uncles are working in a bank can i accept a an invitation at his house and can i accept gifts from him the second question can we do facial while fasting like go to a salon and uh okay uh muted his telephone altogether um osama says that we used to send donations to huda tv through bank but now she doesn't know how to do this i believe that if you watch the tv you will find the right way of sending donations if not then send it to feedback at huda dot tv feedback at hudder.tv and they will communicate with you i personally i don't know how to uh send these donations but definitely you will find it on their screens in sha allah sumana from gambia she is asking a question well before that we have umaisha from the emirates uh i have a question yes my mother my mother gave da'wah to her younger brother last ramadan from then he refuses to talk to her and he wants her to apologize to her for giving dawah and talking about islam to him okay so she wants to ask you whether she should talk or okay i will answer you i will answer inshallah aisha from nigeria which you've been asked like three days back because we don't have like so i didn't give you a reply my question is um if one is observing his um period and wants to decide he will equal and so i don't know how that person is going to do okay yes okay and my second question is you said um if one is reciting the holy quran and he's not moving his lead his fears is he first is invalid like when doing this muslims the answer is no and this is a consensus of all scholars of islam that ahmadis baha'is are all not related to islam you cannot marry from them you cannot say to them assalamu alaikum you cannot eat from their slaughtering if they slaughter because they are they are a deviant cult they are a sect they are uh apostates even if they claim that they are muslims like the derus like the nusaria they are they are not muslims they don't relate to islam they just have the label but the essence if someone says that the quran is is false or someone says that the prophet hassam is not the seal of the prophethood and there are prophets after him or someone says that we don't pray or do this or do that this is an act of apostasy he is not a muslim any more ambar from saudi arabia yes uh one i want to know uh the kinds of uh the root sharif where we can recite like i know there is this uh the root the nadjina something like uh are these all uh valid the root sharings well i don't know until i hear them anyhow second question my second question i want to know the right way for uh sahu okay yeah i will answer the question inshaallah um sumana's second question that someone told her to give the imam three eggs and this is a gift this is a charity but why three eggs not three chickens for example what would the imam do with three eggs and are they uh uh scrambled or fried or i don't know so there has to be something connected to the question maybe they think that giving three eggs to an imam gives you good fortune or protects you from something i don't know but generally speaking giving a gift to the imam of the masjid or to the scholars or something is considered to be a gift that is accepted and it's a form of charity this is a question regarding the changing of name after like in india and pakistan the women change their name after the marriage okay so my question is now since we watch your program dr salah and your program you are such a blessing from allah to us that we are now more aware of this fact but now it has been 20 25 years and in all the documents the name is the same of the husband so can you please suggest what should we do now okay i will ensure allah thank you you're welcome we have sadie from emirates um i have three questions is it okay yes okay the first one is i had my first child four years ago in ramadan and on the fourth night of ramadan so i couldn't fast the whole month um when we asked for a shaykh he said it's enough if i give a fidya and i gave for all the thirty first things but later on i other sisters told me that i have to make it up um i i want an answer for that and the second one is um one of my friend asked if children are troubling while um she's praying they're like sleeping on the musa and disturbing her can she close her eyes and the third one is about this cauterization i i saw a hadith that says cauterization is forbidden for my ummah about the hadith that comes the honey the cupping and the cauterization uh it says uh but i forbid cauterization to my mind it says this is darus ram's book i was i had a bit of a doubt when i heard you today okay okay okay and uh and another thing is if i if somebody is making up their fast miss fast in ramadan on the white days the 13th and 14th and 15th would they get the other for making up the fasting and the fasting in the white days as well okay you know you know that this is your fourth question okay sorry about it no problem i will inshaallah answer your question insha allah so i think we'll take like a short pause to answer these questions uh says that what's the ruling on again for the third day in a row arrays uh mashallah a regular caller uh i haven't paid him anything so don't get me wrong he calls from his own self every day he's asking again about reciting the fatiha but this time he's saying what's the ruling on reciting the fatih because imam doesn't leave a pause and you said that this is not part of the sunnah we agree so it is recommended to recite the fatiha but he doesn't leave a pause so is it permissible for me when he says is this permissible he has to finish it so once he finishes it and he starts reciting another surah you can start reciting the fatiha while he's reciting the other surah though i personally recommend that you do not because you've listened you've heard it and this is sufficient to you yusuf says that from nigeria a woman who is 70 years old passed away and could not fast ramadan what should we do if she did not fast the previous ramadan because of her illness and she was hoping to recover and then make up for these missed days and wasn't able to do so because she died there is nothing for you or for her alhamdulillah allah would not hold her accountable but if she recovered and had a month or two where she could have made up for the missed days and she didn't then you may fast on behalf of that woman if she was chronically ill meaning that she would never recover and the sharia are told that she should pay a a a or feed a poor person per every day missed in this case alhamdulillah you can pay for the days missed so these are the three categories samsudeen says what's the ruling on phidia on a woman who's pregnant the most authentic opinion of scholar and this is the the opinion of the majorities is that she has to make up for the days missed there is uh an opinion and this is backed by sheikh al-bani and others saying that a woman who's breastfeeding or pregnant she may skip ramadan and pay for dear but this is not the most authentic opinion and a majority say that she has to make up for the missed days and they differ when the when she makes up for these missed days should she give fidya or not the most authentic opinion is that she is only required to fast a day per day so if she missed for suckling or for being pregnant and she was afraid for the child she may make up for these days later on the following year or whatever the obstacle is gone and she only fasts a day for a day missed nothing else and no compensation he says that i went to jiddah and i did not have the intention of making umrah but all of a sudden my flight was delayed in the evening so i initiated the intention for umrah from jeddah so is this okay this is okay you can make your haram from judah itself you don't have to go to masjid aisha because you're not in makkah you are in jeddah so you make it from your hotel or from office from wherever you initiated it asaf says that my brother has big time problems financial problems he's a crook in short and he maybe embezzles money maybe he takes money so should i uh a part of being a next of kin and and honoring it should i continue to meet him and and sit with him yes of course you have to but you have to keep on advising him and if he's doing something that is illegal and you know about it and it harms us the community tell him i'm going to report you if you don't stop and if he doesn't stop report him because he is a menace to the society from saudi arabia she says that when women stay like two or three hours in the kitchen cooking would they're cooking and serving the food to their family considered to be part of uh uh iftar islam because the hadith the prophet said assam whoever breaks the fasting of someone who's fasting you know by offering food not of course during the daytime but after sunset then he would get the same reward and that is why if you look at haram you'll see the locals and the expats all trying the level best at the time of maghrib to give dates and coffee and water to the worshipers you find them at the traffic lights you find them in malls whoever is stranded they give them food because they want the reward so she says do we get the same reward the answer in sha allah you would get the same reward ambilal from saudi arabia she says that her uncle works in a bank and he invites her for food and maybe he gives her some gifts can she accept that answer is yes you can accept that because his income is haram on him once he takes this halam income and he uses it in buying food paying the rent giving gifts to others it's halal for everyone else except for him she says what's the ruling on doing a mini-care body care going to a beauty saloon beauty parlor whatever and uh a while in the state of fasting as long as there is nothing haram you're not plucking your eyebrows you're not seeing uh awry you're not uh involved in these things no problem inshallah aisha from the emirates says that her mother gave dawa to her uncle so her mother gave dow to her brother so the brother now is angry and he's all flared up and he says that you have you've insulted me by calling me to islam he's a non-muslim apparently and he's saying that you have to apologize and she says her mother doesn't know what to do should she continue to talk to him or shun him and disown him and and never meet him again no no take it easy you are a doctor and he is sick literally sick he's a patient so if you're a dentist and someone while working as his teeth started shouting because the root canal is is is killing him it's hurting him as a doctor you do not punch him in the face you take it easy and say oh no no problem i'm gonna make it easy so you have to treat this imbecile in such a fashion so no problem give him a call brother i'm sorry i apologize for calling you to islam i was only meaning the best for you and this is something i'm convinced with but if it offends you then i apologize and move on with your life and every now and then throw him bits and pieces here and there bread crumbs so that he follows and maybe then he would accept islam and try to change your way of tawa what's the ruling aisha says from nigeria on reading the quran for someone and herman says this is permissible reciting the quran this is permissible the only difference is what's the ruling on touching the quran when she is in her menses directly directly this is not permissible as the majority of scholars say if you wear gloves this is permissible and better more if you read it from your mobile phone from the internet from your pda whatever this is totally permissible whether you are in your menses or not and she says that you said that while praying you have to move your lips otherwise your prayer would be invalid and this is true what counts is what comes out of your mouth so if you're see if your lips are sealed and you just read the quran through scanning with your eyes or just mentally thinking of it this does not count as a salah so if you say and this means allahu akbar but i didn't move my my lips for the first takabeer this prayer is invalid and this is what all the scholars say ambars from saudi arabia says there are different types of durut the root is not an arabic word so that's why lots of the arabs when you say sharif they say who is this the brother of um that is a famous actor no no maybe a sister i don't know durut is not an arabic word maybe she is referring to so when you say uh this is the short version the long version etc now she said that there is a a or whatever a different and all of these names i do not know of and most likely they are innovated like salat al-fatiha all of these are innovated so avoid them i don't have time for that i apologize but it can be before salaam it can be after salaam it can be for adding something in the prayer it can be for for subtracting something from the uh prayer write to my website asking and i will get you a formula that is there with an explanation inshallah that would make you understand she said for 25 years my name is mrs so-and-so after my husband so what to do now we know that it's haram then that the prophet islam cursed those who are called after other than their parents or their father so what to do if you can change this or these documentation it would be a little bit hard but you can change your passport you can change your uh degrees then inshallah this is what you should do if this is impossible or truly hard and would make life impossible for you in this case the least you could do is to spread the news among everyone you know and everyone you do not know that my name is so-and-so the daughter of so-and-so and omit and remove your husband's name altogether from uh uh using it sergi from the emirates she says that she has i think three kids one of them is four years old and four uh five years ago when she gave birth someone told her that she gave birth on the first of ramadan or something like that and someone told her give her a fatwa that you should feed instead of making up for the days and then later on she discovered that this was wrong what to do you have to make up for the missed days alhamdulillah take it easy you can do it every monday and thursday you can do it on the white days and these are by themselves are approximately 10 days a month so if you do this every single month then you have 110 days which is equivalent to approximately four months or four ramadans and there you go she says that if i'm praying in my prayer hall or in my room and there's a child in front of me lying down and i'm distracted by the movement of the child so can i close my eyes closing the eyes while in prayer is not part of the sunnah however if there is need for something that distracts you and this is not frequent not every single prayer you close your eyes but because someone is in front of you making faces to you something like that a child is playing and it's distracting you and you close it temporarily this is permissible insha allah now she says that she read a book from darussalam and the book stated that characterization is prohibited and the prophet alaihi salat was said strong words about it first of all i don't know about dar salam i'm not acquainted with the literature and this does not mean that it is muslim yes maybe they are alhamdulillah on the salafi manhattan they are authenticating what they publish but still you have to go to the references not to the publisher publishing house the issue of al-qaeda or casualization this is something that is found it is medication and the prophet had done it they're telling me that the time is out but they forgot that they took seven minutes off me so bear with me a few minutes so the prophet did it islam himself with sadhana when he bled for a month and he tried to stop the bleeding and he did this himself and the prophet told us islam that it is a means of healing yet he did not recommend it so it is permissible like wise with rookia i can ask you please i'm sick can you make rook to me this is permissible however it goes against the hadith of the seventy thousand that would be admitted to jannah without accountability accountability or punishment and the prophet said that there are those who do not characterize and they do not believe in bad omen and they do not ask people to make rupiah for themselves and they have trust on allah azza so it is not haram but it is a lower degree of dependence and reliance on allah azza likewise with catholization it is permissible but it is not recommended this is all the time we have until we meet you a couple of days from today on saturday i leave you for him with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
