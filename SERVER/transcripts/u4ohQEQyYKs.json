  "transcript": "if Muhammad's on the Louisville EU was telling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony he gay he be screamin after no more honest well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to contemporary Islamic issues and concepts on Hooda TV I'm your host our commercial in this episode we will continue the third part to the concept of takfeer in the first episode that we did concerning takfeer we spoke about the rules the regulations what is duck fear in Islam and then we went on to discuss some of the concepts and we answered many of the questions that were related to the obstacles and concepts now we're going to start this program by continuing some of the obstacles and some of the conditions that are there there when making to fear and from there we will extract many interesting questions for the ships so let's start off by welcoming him to the program assalamu alikum Shahada personnel over cattle and I shift so I mean the last program we spoke about some of the conditions and obstacles and you give us two wonderful examples so continuing from there let's start with an example number three in sha Allah an obstacle City Fine Arts we learn about material if I'm not mistaken we spoke about ignorance and we spoke about interpretation so there is a third obstacle which is error analyzation says a banana to echidna in the sina pona so do not burden us if we forget or we make a mistake so error or making a mistake is forgiven in islam and the greatest and most famous hadith that everybody knows where the profit area so Sam tells us that lala who Afra hope be tell by the idea that Allah is more happier by the repentance of his servant than a man who was travelling in the desert with his camel that had his food and water and he took a nap tying his camel next to him only to wake up with the camel vanishing and it's not there anymore so he looked left right center everywhere he can go and when he felt this in despair and depressed that he is unable to find it he again light on the ground reckoning that he is dead and he took a short nap and he woke up only to find his camel next to him he imagined the amount of joy in his heart he said o Allah you are my servant and I'm your God the Prophet says he made a mistake do you to his jubilation you do to his happiness now this mistake is blatant kufur to anyone this is a kafir not he he is not a kafir he made a mistake and the mistake was in the words not in his intention so if you look at these hadees and they're authentic there in the Sahir and compare Apple to Apple you know the biggest mistake that these people are doing when they give the field without applying these conditions and fulfilling that the obstacles do not exist whenever someone makes a mistake it's a mistake allah azza wajal holds him accountable only if it was done intentionally and not by mistake so this type which is error or mistake is an obstacle that prevents us from giving takfeer to people and this happens a lot with people in communicating someone may say something that is wrong and this is due to his ignorance so like saying yeah this thing is not Haram but he doesn't know if he doesn't know so this is an obstacle or he misinterpreted or he makes a mistake by saying something and it's a slip of the tongue and you find the people especially when he's a diary or a scholar or a ruler you find people rushing to the gun and making witch-hunt against this person because of a slip of the tongue okay rectify it let him ask for forgiveness explain it to him so no no no no this mistake cannot be tolerated and they immediately go to burn the switch somehow you mentioned ruler now there's a very common phenomenon of you know saying the ruler is kafir the ruler of this country is cafard the ruler it's very common amongst Muslims everywhere you know they make the clear of the rulers why is this there what's the reason behind it and does it have any Lama faces to it or not okay the profit that is salat-u-salam saw this coming and this is why if you read the Bihari and Muslim Asahi and the books of hadith you would find the Prophet as I'm highlighting the importance of the Muslim ruler and governing him protecting him because as the scholars of the Salaf say one day under the ruling of an oppressive tyrant is better than seventy years without any ruler and this is very deep to think about it because if you look at what we they call the Arab Spring people rebelled they want democracy they want fairness and this is the right you can't ask people to live under oppression and not talk they require freedom they require equality and fairness but there are ways of attaining this other than that so what happened they rebelled against their rulers and to rebel against your ruler usually you will be faced by a number of hadith preventing you from doing this and that is that you cannot leave the pledge of allegiance to a Muslim rule otherwise you die the death of jelly of pre-islamic era so they were faced with this obstacle hmm I can't repel what should i do what should I do aha let's give tech field to him so the ruler is a kafir which means that we don't have any pledge of allegiance to him which means that we can attack him and this cascades down so if he is a kafir this mean that his cabinet is a kafir as well they are his ministers and the prime ministers and they serve his agenda so they're covered as well and if they're kafir those protecting them such as the army the civil defense the police force are kafir as well and their wives and families and children because they are accepting their their their father their role in the government are kafir as well so who's Muslim you and I that's it so it cascades down now they neglect or purposely ignore the teachings of the Prophet erase a lot for cinema the Prophet Allah so son was addressing the Companions in so many occasions in one occasion the Companions when they heard about the bad rulers that the Prophet was telling them about and that they were coming in the future the Companions said o prophet of Allah should we fight them so now the Prophet Eraser Salam is explaining to his companions the request was can really bel can we fight against the Muslim ruler who is bad as you have described the Prophet Isis Salam prohibited this and he said no unless now look at these conditions set by the Prophet at a system not by the scholars it is him who stated it he said no unless you first of all see condition number one blatant condition number two cliff or condition number three you have ample evidence from Allah as there was a condition number four in antelope cofrin Bauer Han V Gila Camino LIBOR had four conditions and if you try to apply them on most if not all of the tyrants we have in the Arab world it wouldn't fit them but this doesn't suit their agenda their personal vendetta we want to give the free to the ruler so that we can do all the chaos and may have we have or we want so they deliberately ignore the instruction of the prophet alayhi salatu salam or they throw in and evidence from here or there so that they would confuse the people and say that listen these evidences are clashing how can they clash if they are from the Prophet himself is also them and this was a revelation from Allah so again if you want to dissect the hadith and analyze it you would see that first of all to give takfeer to the ruler you have to see most of us if not all did not see we heard a person saying that a person saying a friend of his saw or heard something else this is not permissible you have to see it and feel it and be a witness so that you're excused at the sight of Allah it has to be blatant thirdly offer so if it is not blatant black and white the guy is frustrating to Buddha he is a kafir this is blatant it's crystal clear but if he does something that is not good for for example he says RIBA is Haram he but you have these are banks dealing when driba and interest said no no this is not RIBA my grand mufti or my grand scholar told me that RIBA is giving money and taking money and this sort of extortion and oppressing the poor what we're doing is with companies and with nations and with banks so he told me that this is not River so this is not blatant because he has misinterpretation go for meaning that if he says yes we deal in RIBA we have bars and we sell intoxicants and we have bottles and prostitutions but their own Haram I admit yet they're sinful so you cannot repeal he's sinful he is one of the worst servants of Allah I agree with you I'm not defending him but this does not allow you to do an act of rebellions because he's still a Muslim ruler fourthly you have ample proof from Allah that this is covered so it's not what a scholar said is cover you have ample proof from the Quran and the Sunnah that wherever does this is a kafir and it's clear-cut evidence so you see that Allah Azza WA JAL and the Prophet sallallaahu Salim is protecting the Muslim Ummah for the welfare of the Ummah itself it's not that we advocate transgression or being unfair or we are the scholars of the palace the petrodollar scholars the Milkshakes that they people usually say about us it is Allah's law actually what they don't pay us we don't work for them hamdulillah we're independent we we have to have nothing to do with us when you have nothing to do with them even if they hire us we would not work for them because it's always fine to be independent and be able to express Islam and give it to people without any agendas this is the ruling of Allah so which L is not yours or mine to say so this third obstacle which is a mistake and an error can also apply for the ruler why did he do this it's a mistake he was missing for the scholars that he have told him wrongly they're sinful but he's not this is not blatant cover it's similar to what we mentioned in the last episode the person who doesn't know he's ignorant or misinformed he the ruler himself falls under one of these categories oh by mistake he did a mistake of course there's a fourth condition we're gonna get into the fourth condition before that we're gonna go for a short break dear viewers so far we've can we've gone over three of the conditions and three of the obstacles as well when you're going to the fourth condition but before that we're going to go for a short break so stay tuned welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were discussing some of the obstacles and some of the conditions that are there for takfeer we've done three so far and we said we were going to go into the fourth one soon as we come back to chef if you can start us off with the fourth obstacle and then after we get the obstacles we'll have some questions in chawla and then we'll get into the consequences of that fear after that okay the fourth obstacle is when a person is doing an act of takfeer or saying something that nullifies Islam out of compulsion somebody forcing him to do so and the clearest evidence of this hadith of a marble yes sir may Allah be pleased with a man with his father and mother who was a slave at the time in Mecca in the Meccan period and he came once to the Prophet as I said I'm weeping and sobbing so the Prophet said Oh Sam what's wrong and throughout the tears he managed to explain to the Prophet Adam that they kept on torturing him and tormenting him until he said something offensive against the Prophet or a sorcerer so the Prophet asked him is awesome how do you find your heart when you utter these words were you feeling good about it or not and the pen he said my heart was filled with Iman but I was tortured beyond my ability the Prophet hasn't comforted him and said if they go back to torment you and torturing you go back into saying negative things about me you have a permission to do this as long as your heart is filled with a man so this kind of being forced or compulsion is an obstacle so if someone gets to you pointing a gun at your head and say prostrate to this idol if you prostrate it because of the fear of being killed this is totally permissible and there's nothing going that others who watch you do this can give you that fear but it is due to their ignorance they have to first make sure that there are no obstacles once they asked you and you told them you tell them about the gunpoint then they would have an excuse for you however such compulsion such forceful act must be measured because not every every composer yes is acceptable a man comes to me said sure I was compelled to divorce my wife says why she threatened me and I had to divorce her okay if she threatened you and you were afraid then yes the divorce doesn't take place but wait wait a minute how did she threaten you she said I'm not gonna cook dinner for you okay what is this this is nonsense so this kind of compulsion is unacceptable it has to be serious something that would harm you physically or jeopardize your livelihood and it has to be from someone who's capable of executing it I had to divorce my wife why my toddler he's a 4 years old he threatened me to kill to kill me by with a knife and he's not unable to do this and he can fight him off he can do so many things so this kind of compulsion again is not realistic so this is the fourth obstacle which the condition that must be applied is intending to do something willingly and these are some of the conditions that must be be fulfilled before giving the fear when he made that act when he said that statement did he intend it was he doing it willingly or of compulsion so this is a type of the obstacles the conditions are similar but for example if someone who is insane we know that he is not sane he is crazy he's mad he's a lunatic he's not held accountable in the set of Allah and he does an act of cover he steps on the Quran / he curses Allah can we execute him can we give him the career definitely not the man is not sane so a child for example and this happens in our houses an infant of like 2 or 3 years of age takes the Quran and tears the cut the pages of it of course without us knowing it when we see when we see it what do we do look at this kafir see he's a fevers old yeah how can you give us a clue to this child so these things have to be taken into consideration that whether he is doing it willingly whether he's doing it with knowledge whether he knows the consequences whether the act itself is labeled in the Quran and Sunnah scoffer or not so these are some of the aspects so just a recap from last episode in this episode the the four major obstacles that we mentioned the first one being ignorant so if a person doesn't even know that this deed is gopher or you know if it's allowed or whatever the situation may be but it's complete ignorance the second one is misinterpretation so he knows the ruling but misinterpreted in a long way a sorry interpreted in a wrong way the third is error so he said something by accident and didn't intend and you give that wonderful example from the hadith of the prophet sallallaahu audio Asylum and then the fourth one that we just spoke about is compulsion that somebody has forced him to say something that he did not mean his intention inside of his heart did not match the reality that came out of his mouth now after that I want to get into some of the consequences that can you know that are tied with and come with duck fear takfeer is a major issue and the more the people are away from Islam the more you would find them doing heinous acts because of their lack of knowledge because of their ignorance because of following the desires and whims so takfeer if a person goes into it he ends up in a vicious circle and this vicious circle affects not only him on personal aspects but the whole Ummah because you find this coming and apparent in a lot of the youth and the Muslim circles due to their ignorance and this is why I always believe that the enemies of Islam and also those disbelievers who have good intent but they are not well acquainted with Islamic teaching they prevent scholars they prevent students of knowledge from relaying from teaching the proper Islam and this causes these masses living in their countries to grow in their ignorance and take the wrong decisions which affect not only their communities but the whole of the reputation of Islam the consequences of takfeer first of all is ignorance when I give you takfeer I'm actually being arrogant because I think that I'm better than you unless the tikrit is legit but I'm talking about those who give tech field without knowledge they keep on giving the field to everyone else so that they would elevate themselves over everyone else among the consequences of takfeer is repelling people against Islam so when I see that a Muslim keeps on giving takfeer to good people who are praying and fasting and doing everything that is good in Islam and staying away from her on things I'd have second thoughts about Islam is this the religion I want to accept or not the third and most dangerous aspect is that a person who gives the fear takes the ruling of allah azza wajal and puts it in a wrong place so why is it a vicious circle because a person ends up in bloodshed and chaos and having this order in the muslim country or muslim community which affects islam affects the muslims and affects the whole world okay so for example you would obviously there's always going to be people who do that clear of everybody and like like you mentioned some of the consequences that are there but how do the regular muslims and the masses of the Muslims deal with these people who do take fear of everybody who constantly took fear and you know say okay this person is covered because he's done there's this person's covered because he's in this how do we deal with the people doing that that fear okay the first thing is you have to debate with them and call them to Islam this happened without the live and I've asked me a lot of peace with him when a group of her Huaraz mounting to approximately like 8,000 or more individuals went against I'll even have a party the fourth caliph and said Ali is kafir imagine that one of the ten heavenly bound the brother that the the cousin of the Prophet as a salam his son-in-law being who he is with his knowledge and his ranking in islam these deviant cult comes and say he's a kafir so he wanted to fight them off he's a Muslim ruler so beloved Abbas his cousin told him let me go and talk to them so he took his suit and went to speak with them and he debated with them and they debated with him but he managed to overtake him that to take them easily because he was knowledgeable with the Quran and the Sunnah and four thousand went back with him accepting Islam and depending from this corrupt ideology so you have to speak to them to try and clear their misconceptions okay so that's that works for everything usually I mean the the discussing and it allows you to inform the person of you know the truth actual interpretations of the ayahs just like we mentioned you know some of the barriers one of them was misinterpretation another one was ignorance this is the same situation here so it's just the opposite people on this side this is the people being being done the duck fear - and this is the people giving the takfeer in both cases you need to inform them and conversate with them and a sheikh who at the end of the episode so I want to thank you very much for joining us here on her the TV thank you very much dear viewers I hope you benefited from the last episode of the series for takfeer we've done three episodes of takfeer as a whole set inshallah join us again for more contemporary issues and until then may allah subhanaw taala bless us all assalamualaikum warahmatullahi
