  "transcript": "sh my question is similar to one of the previous callers so ever since I was a kid I heard that Allah subh tala is new so whenever I try to pray or do anything there's this image of no that comes to my mind that uh I know that that that is not Allah tal but it just stucks to my mind and even if I'm trying to pray it's it's just there so am I sinful for what am I supposed to do in this situation Muhammad is it getting you close to Allah when you think like that then this isan so what do you expect Shan to do he will Infuse this feeling he will exaggerate it he will inflate it until it destroys your whole Islam and you will find that skipping Islam is the easiest thing to do and this is what Shan wants so ignore it block it and move on with your life"
