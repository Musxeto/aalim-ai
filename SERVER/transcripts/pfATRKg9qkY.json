  "title": "I can only join 2nd Friday prayer but I heard its not permissible, what to do #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so basically like if I go to school then I am only able to attend like a a Juma that was like a second Juma in mosque but when I contacted the people of knowledge of my country they said it's a b and you should pray instead no this is not true the difference of opinion among Scholars over repeating the jum in the same Masjid applies in Muslim countries where you have lots of masjids and the people are able to pray on time the country itself gives Muslims time to pray so there is no necessity or a need to make a second Juma as for European and American countri where you have fewer Mass smaller in size and the demand and the people that pray there are far exceeding the capacity sometimes you have three jumas yes this is not the ideal situation but you tell me what's the alternative you ask some Scholars they say you have to pray one jum and you pray outside of the Masjid if the Masjid cannot accommodate you but this is not practical because so many countries prohibit such an action and would consider it illegal yes there are countries that are tolerant alhamdulillah and they allow this but not all countries would allow this as we have lots of islamophobes who hate anything that has to do with Islam so what can we do we're forced to live there and some of would say this is my country I'm born born here I can't go anywhere else at the moment so in this case you pray the second J without any problem inshallah"
