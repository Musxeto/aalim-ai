  "transcript": "sure I heard you say that rubbing in wo is not mandatory can you demonstrate how to make water reach our limbs without rubbing too much because I spend close to 10 minutes doing wood and rubbing a lot okay so basically speaking it is recommended to rub but if I simply put my arm under the tab water do this and do that or I insert my arm in the sea or in the river or in a a spring or in a a tub where it's submerged with water as it's washed I don't have to touch it this is sufficient and Allah Asel Knows Best"
