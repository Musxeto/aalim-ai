  "transcript": "question I'm a medical student and we have to to dissect dead bodies and sometimes we have to see naked pictures Etc so what should I do is it permissible to attend these classes Scholars say that dissecting dead bodies is permissible due to the need of such a thing but they made it condition and that condition would be that these dead bodies must not be of Muslims as this is a sin and it is disrespectful it is disrespectful for uh a dead body of a Muslim to be treated in such a manner unless it is of utmost urgency and need as in the case of a criminal uh investigation so if a Muslim dies and we would like to investigate his death due to suspicion of uh something a wrong that led to his death in this case it is permissible only in very limited cases to go and perform per an autopsy on that body but to study the bodies of uh uh Muslims in medical schools and dissecting it this is completely forbidden and not permissible if it was for the bodies or if it was a body of a non-muslim and this is found on the market a lot of the poor countries would sell the bodies of its citizens uh after their death and their families would benefit from that due to the legitimacy of the reason which is to study medicine it is permissible as for uh uh looking at uh naked pictures for uh the purpose of studying as well and to know the different organs of the human body inshallah this is also permissible in limited cases not to watch pornography and justify this by saying well I'm a student of medicine and I have to know the human body you know this is ridiculous but when it is needed for the purpose of your study and the intention is pure and you're not following your desires within that inshallah this is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
