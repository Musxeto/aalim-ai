  "title": "Is it permissible to join the Turkish army? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh is it permissible to join the Army voluntarily in a country like turkey where we aren't governed by Shar rather by man-made laws I personally believe that joining the Army in such countries where a lot of the Islamic values will be undermined they will force you to shave your beard they will force you to do heinous and Haram things under the uh uh justification of discipline they will order you to skip Salat and not pray on time and not allow you to pray and if they find you praying on time they will increase their torture and abuse why would I do this when it's voluntary the hell with it no preserve your Iman and your religion and focus on something else"
