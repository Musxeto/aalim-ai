  "transcript": "so brother Matt death that says that his aunt died in India and after her burial he came to know that she died and was buried so he performed salat on genna's at the funeral prayer here in Saudi Arabia known as salat al habib the funeral prayer performed on behalf of an absentee someone who died and he's not present physically this is an issue of dispute among scholar and the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible to offer such an absentee funeral prayer when the deceased had been already prayed upon by the Muslims let me explain this in a nutshell someone dies in Siberia no Muslims around they buried him someone dies in the jungles of Africa all idol worshiper tribes no Muslim with them they buried him in this case we pray the absentee funeral prayer as did the Prophet as some with Anna Joshi the Abyssinian ruler who embraced Islam but had no Muslim person around him when he died the Prophet ordered the Prophet other companions may allah be pleased with them to pray funeral prayer but if someone died in a Muslim country or in a place where Muslims offered funeral prayer in this case we do not do this and Allah knows best"
