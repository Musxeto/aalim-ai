  "transcript": "your wife does my wife break my woodo I've been married for 41 years what do you mean she doesn't even obligate alhamdulillah okay now on a serious note uh she is part of my body now if I kiss her or kiss my hand it's the same impact listen to me uh the concept of touching the opposite gender is only found in the shaf where Imam Shafi used to say that touching the opposite gender whether your sister your Maham your wife breaks your wo the other Scholars and schools of thought say it does not break your w because Prophet Muhammad used to sit in his home before going to Salat he used to kiss his wife AA and go without renewing his woodo so this means that touching your wife kissing your wife does not impact the woodoo inshallah and Allah knows rest"
