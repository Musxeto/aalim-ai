  "transcript": "um we're still discussing the chapter that deals with pilgrimage and it is essential for those who are interested in going for hajj to learn the different types of hajj we have hadith number 231 narrated i said oh allah prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam what is wrong with people they have finished their eram but you have not he said i mattered my hair and have garlanded my hadi so i will not finish my erham till i finish my hajj now again this hadith is regarding the issue of tamato and if you recall i shall be pleased with her said o prophet of allah we all came for hajj now i see people offering umrah and wearing their normal clothes but you are not doing this so she's saying this because she cannot be intimate with the prophet while he's wearing the haram and not only because of that she herself was in her menses but she wanted to learn why was the prophet islam still wearing his which means that he was offering he was and the people were doing and that is why they finished their umrah and not wore their normal clothes so the prophet explained to her that i've matted my hair and it is permissible for a person if traveling to put something on his hair so that it would make it calm and not untidy and this i think nowadays the youth may help us more i believe that this is what they call hair gel it's what makes the hair shiny but it does not move it's like glue and so many people i see people wearing this and looks nice but when you touch it it looks like wood it's not real so it is something like that when you're traveling because of the dust because of the need of calming your hair and making it tidy the prophet used to apply this so he said that i cannot take off my haram and wear my normal clothes and clip my hair because i have garlanded my hadi and garlanding your hadi would be by putting something on it as a sign that this is a sacrifice so a normal camel is a normal camel but when you see a number of clothes on it and a number of things in its neck signifying that this is not for public transport this is for hadi this is sacrifice that is traveling all the way to makkah to be slaughtered in mecca this gives a form of glorification for this process and for this journey and people praise allah more when they see the justification therefore a quick question to those who are with us what are the types of haram a pilgrim cannot wear his normal clothes until the day of eid if a person offers let's say in the first month of hajj which is shawwal who is allowed to take off his haram and not wear normal clothes and who is not allowed to do this until the tenth of the hijab is allowed and a mukharin and um mufra is not allowed this is correct when when is out after completing the umrah excellent after completing the umrah and therefore scholars say that if a person comes with a fraud for example but he reaches makkah two weeks before hajj two weeks before the eighth of the hija it would be difficult for him to remain in his home for two weeks so what is recommended change your intention and your haram by offering our umrah and make your ifraud to become a mutamat and this is a higher degree and this is permissible and also part of the things that the prophet instructed his companion he told them you do this as long as you don't have your sacrifice no make it a umrah make for yourself we don't have time for the questions but let's take your question as an exception are we allowed to change the haram if our gets dirty can we put a fresh it is permissible for a person in the state of ahram to shower to clean himself to change the haram twice a day if he wishes to clean the haram and wash it or to wear another new set or a third set nothing is restricted for him to do that what he's restricted from is to apply his perfume his deodorant to put scent on his haram while in the state of haram this is not permissible moving on to the following hadith hadith number 232 yes brother rated imran bin hussein was revealed in the last book so he performed it with allah's prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and nothing was revealed in the quran to make it illegal nor did the prophet alaihi wasallam or he bit it till he died but the man who regarded it illegal just expressed what his own mind suggested al-bukhari said that people said that he was tumor in a narration of muslim the ayah of muta was revealed and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ordered us with it and it was not abrogated and he did not forbid us from doing it until he died is addressing the issue that some of the companions may allah be pleased with them did not encourage muta muta ahir so you have to understand the arabic terminologies well before judging an issue so imran is saying that this is strange what's happening the ayah that was revealed in te matur was revealed at the time of the prophet we also performed to in accordance with the quran with the prophet the prophet died nothing abrogated it and the prophet died and he did not tell us do not make tattoo why is he saying this this is strange and he is referring to um may allah be pleased with them and scholars say it was not umar alone scholars say that even abu bakr umar uthman and ali they all used to offer hajj every year as a fraud and they did not offer tomato or and as stated before scholars differed whether the prophet islam offered to mature or iran or ifrad simply because some of the words describing his hajj were different so when they say the prophet tamatta they meant that he salah made quran and when they said iran they meant the actual quran and when they said the fraud they looked only at him not doing umrah with the hajj so it appeared to them as he made one ritual and there is a fraud but the most authentic opinion if you look at all the hadiths all combined you will find that he offered quran and he encouraged the metro and he allowed the fraud so all of these coincide insha allah and nothing is abrogated these three are still present today you have all the right to choose what you wish now a lot of the muslims unfortunately choose a fraud for one simple reason and that is to escape the sacrifice they don't want to offer sacrifice so they always do a fraud and allah did not burden his ummah because if you cannot financially afford to sacrifice allah gave you the way out and that is to fast three days during the hajj and seven days after you go back and what are the days of hajj scholars say the minute you make haram you can fast three days so if you make haram for your tomato in shawwal and you make your umrah and you stay shawwal the in the beginning of the hija during this period you can fast the three days and they don't have to be consecutive days you can pass a day here and a day there we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back we have hadith number 200 233 i twisted with my own hands the garlands of the buddha of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who landed them and marked them and then sent them to the kaaba and stayed behind in madina yet no permissible thing was regarded as illegal for him then meaning he wasn't in the state of haram in this hadith mother aisha is telling us that hadi or sacrifice is not only to be offered by people offering or doing hajj you can offer sacrifice as the prophet did at isla while he was in medina and she was the one who made these garlands to the sacrifice with her own hands and the prophet sent the sacrifice to mecca to be slaughtered there as a form of worship to allah and glorification of him yet she is telling us that he was not in the state of israel so if you're sacrificing this does not mean you have to wear a special clothes you have to prevent yourself from intimacy with your wife you cannot clip your nails you cannot cut your hair you cannot wear perfumes no all of these are permissible if you're sending your sacrifice to makkah one may have the confusion regarding the is different than hadi hadi is what you give to be slaughtered in makkah while audrey is what is being slaughtered in your own hometown in your presence and you eat from it as well on the 10th day of the hijab so the prophet israel in regard to sacrifice you can wear what you wish you can put perfumes you have nothing that is forbidden for you to do if you're saying your hometown and you're sending the sacrifice is anything restricted for me no i can do whatever i wish when it comes to oddha which is the slaughtering of the sacrifice in my town on the 10th of hajj i'm not performing hajj i'm in my house in this case it's a different scenario why because the prophet said that islam when you see the moon of the hijab meaning in the beginning of the hijab and one of you intends to sacrifice he must not touch his hair or his body until he offers his sacrifice what does this mean this means that when you are in the state of offering the sacrifice of you cannot clip your names you cannot shave or cut any part of the hair of your body as long as you're sacrificing until you finish your sacrifice why this is what the prophet instructed allah maybe just to be sharing something with the pilgrims who are doing much much more than that who are wearing their haram unable to wear trousers or shirts unable to perfume unable to clip their nails unable to have intimacy those who are not offering pilgrimage and they're at their homes but they intend to sacrifice they're instructed not to touch their fingernails or their hair until they offer their sacrifice is this for the whole household is it for my wife my children my sisters no it's only for the person offering the sacrifice which is me the rest of my family don't share this they can do whatever they wish moving on to hadith number 243 the hadith is short so i'll read it myself it was narrated by ayasha may allah be pleased with her and she said that the prophet salallahu sent sheep as hadi and this means that the sacrifice the hadi must not only be from camels or from cows but it also can be from sheep and the prophet salaam sent sheep as hadi as well and we know that the most precious wealth to the arabs are the camels and this is why the majority of the prophets is sacrificed was camels but also this does not mean that you cannot sacrifice cows or sheep the prophet offered sheep which means that it is also okay do you have any questions yes brother there someone cheers my question is that the hadith can we ride it if i'm going from madina to makkah so can i write mahaji yes this is a question that will be answered inshallah later on because there's a hadith where the prophet instructed one of his companions to ride his hadith and when he objected that it is hadi it sacrificed how do you want me to ride it he said ride it and he insisted that he ride it so the scholars say that as long as it does not harm the sacrifice you may ride it and you also if you need you can milk it but if it harms the hadith no it should be left untouched and allah azza knows best we see today that when we go to minna there are a lot of tents that are also based in musdalifa which is not the part of minna so how do we justify this having the tents in muslim when we are supposed to be in mina spending the night in mina the 10th the 11th and the 12th is mandatory it's one of the mandatory things of hajj and whoever does not do this he has to give expiation and nowadays due to the fact that mina is a limited piece of land and people are unable to take their position or their place in it they've expanded it a little bit out to muzdalifah now those who are in these tents are not considered to be in mina but they are exempted from staying in mina because they cannot and i'll give you an example this is the masjid if the message is full what to do you can pray outside of the masjid in the plazas or the open area you can pray in the streets you can pray outside the streets so as long as the rows are connected the prayer is valid and as long as the houses or the tents are connected then it takes the same ruling as staying in mina and this is what the scholars say due to the lack of space yes brother islamic sam today because of the people walk from muzdalifah to meena and everything some people may have some injuries or rashes so when they apply the medication the people say we should not apply the medication because it has a smell it has a scent so how to justify now this is not true the scent that some of the creams have for easing the rash is not perfume i'm not perfuming myself i'm using medication so this scent and the medication is not perfume in the sense that if i'm invited to a wedding i would never put this lotion or cream that is used for medication on my neck for example and go because this has a beautiful scent it is not used as a perfume so this is permissible to have and to wear when the people from indian subcontinent when they go for hajj it seems that there is a misconception that they have to collect the stones only from muslim so when they go to muslim they all busy collecting their pebbles for jamarad now we're talking ahead of the description of hajj again but we will come to this inshallah we know that we have to throw the pibbles in on the 10th 11th 12th and optionally on the 13th but collecting the stones is not to be done in muzdalifa this is not the sunnah a lot of the muslims do this instead of spending the night in sleeping as the prophet said because they have a big day ahead of them so they should get dressed some of them spend their night getting and collecting these stones and they count them so seven for the first day 21 and 21 this is 42 so 49 stones for the first three days not only that some even go to the extent of putting some soap and water and washing them and maybe perfuming them yes this is what people do and this is a little bit strange because they believe that they are throwing the shaytan so are you giving him a good time by perfuming it and cleaning it you should not do this because this is not part of the sunnah and this is an innovation yes brother if someone is going from india to hajj so can he buy that sacrifice from here you can buy and cut year only the sacrifice of hadi it is a must that is not acceptable otherwise that the hadi must be slaughtered in makkah you cannot slaughter the hadith anywhere else allah says in the quran that the sacrifice the hadith has to reach the kaaba of course when we say kaaba we mean the sanctuary the haram area which is mina part of it so when you slaughter in mina you slaughter in makka singh but you cannot slaughter in jinda because this is hajj the sacrifice has to reach the sanctuary it has to reach the haram in ut it's a different issue i may buy a sacrifice in somalia they're in drought and famine and i would like to send it there yes providing the companies doing that would put my name and they would say yes we will assign a particular sheep in your name to be slaughtered on the day of hajj i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
