  "transcript": "his third question about his friend who lost confidence and a lot of us may fall in the same trap of Shaitaan when calamities strike these are tests from allah azza wajal no one on earth can escape a las testing but a las tests to us very now your your friend is divorced and he has problems at work he's scared to talk back to his boss he has a lot of calamities if you ask him all these calamities that you're having combined would it be equal to having colon cancer or leukemia or would you or would you be fine with these calamities and trials from allah azza wajal he will tell you definitely know what I'm going through is far better than being a patient of cancer stage 4 or whatever may Allah cure all our ill people and loved ones if you ask him are these calamity is okay or would you rather be in Africa suffering from drought and famine or maybe be in Syria being bombarded by the Russian army or by the tyrant forces being killed being displaced having to migrate suffering from hunger you don't know when someone will come and chop your neck or take your loved ones and do hideous things with them you would say no what I'm having is far greater so you should look at other people's suffering in order to appreciate what Allah sol-gel is testing with first of all second of all what he is suffering from is due to lack of TOEIC cool which means trust dependence and reliance on a logic when we don't have this trust in Allah when we do not depend on Allah everything scares us and this is why the self used to say whoever fears Allah Allah will make everything else afraid of him and whoever fears other than Allah Allah would make everything intimidate him and make him afraid so when you trust Allah when you depend on allah soldier when you know that Allah is your protector your provider you don't fear anyone else you would have guts I understand that people differ and we may be a bit reluctant a bit hesitant to speak to others no one can out of the blue enter a message and give a hope of jama' maybe one in a thousand and the rest would be intimidated some people would go and try to give hot but Jamaat and faint as they they have reported people coming and saying alhamdulillah was sort of service relapsed and they faint it's too much for them and there are people who have no problem in giving a hot bath of Juma and they have no shame in coming on Got Talent or the voice or whatever and singing their heads off they have they don't even observe Allah so they could care less they don't think that they're doing something Haram because they don't even know what hollom is therefore my advice to your friend is first of all to sit with himself acknowledge all those favors and blessings upon him that are numerous and without count you cannot count them secondly to trust a lot to put all of his dependence and reliance on so HL thirdly try to communicate not to be defensive all the time not to block yourself out of any conversation try to make a move try to push yourself a little bit and once you cross this line of being reluctant and hesitant in sha Allah so easily you will find a big difference"
