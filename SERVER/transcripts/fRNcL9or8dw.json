  "transcript": "an anonymous says what is the ruling on caste system in islam like for marriage they first look at the caste of a person first for instance if someone is a saiyad they would not marry from any other caste we do not have caste system in islam this is something that is abhorred in islam all muslims are equal and what counts is a person's religious commitment not his lineage not his wealth not his education these are supporting elements but they're not something to judge people with and the notion and the concept that a woman who is from the lineage of the prophet allah whom they call said she cannot be given to a man who is not a saiyan this is a false concept that must not be followed by true muslims the prophet himself gave two of his daughters or actually three of his daughters to people not from his lineage so he give he gave zainab to abu las her cousin and he gave rukaya unkarthum to uthman ibn afan only fatima was given to his cousin which indicates that the prophet islam is giving us a practical lesson that what counts is the person as a person one of the great 10 heaven bound companions of the prophet i saw sallam one of the richest of the companions may allah be pleased with him gave his sister to bilal the abyssinian slave just to show the muslims that what counts is a person is a person's religious commitment commitment not his lineage what good his leniency is when it comes to marriage it is his character it is his religious commitment that would impact and make the wife happy or depressed and sad and allah azza knows best you"
