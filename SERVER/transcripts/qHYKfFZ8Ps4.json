  "transcript": "I'm asking on the behalf of mine he's not here but he write down the question uh his question is uh in anger I told my wife to leave after the baby will born she had miscarriage now and yesterday I angrily told her to leave and said this is the last time remember I start to packing to leave home but I didn't leave home I called her father I told him why your daughter is doing this I don't want to divorce her try to explain her when I say those words I had no intention of divorce I was angry that's why I say so are those previous statement count as a divorce and please check a new advice my wife I was bad before I don't provide for her and took money but now I changed and try my level best but she always dragged the past and start argument and that end up like this issues of divorce cannot be solved through a third party first of all it has to be solved directly with the one in charge and that is the husband himself he has to be the one who comes and asks a question he doesn't know English he should go to the area responsible for ifta in his country and tell them exactly what had happened and they will give him the Islamic verdict but lots of manipulation and covering and hiding and changing the story takes place when it is told either by the wife or by a third party so this is not a logical thing to do now you the husband said that you did not provide and you took money and you cheated and lied in the past every action has consequences what do you expect her to do when you physically and mentally and financially abuse her she's not a charity organization to stay with you show me something that is positive in you that would call her to stay in such a relationship if you repented have you returned the money have you written a document with Witnesses testifying that this amount of money is a debt and you're going to give her for the previous years that she's been with you and you did not provide for her if not then again I don't see any reason why she should stay with you unless there are other circumstances that we may look into later on"
