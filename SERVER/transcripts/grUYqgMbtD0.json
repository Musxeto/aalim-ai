  "transcript": "about these uh muslim also female um presenters who come on muslim channels and like four or five fingers of her hair is exposing and they're wearing their uh and to the back of their these people have nothing to do with practicing islam do you think that what they're wearing on their head is a head cover this is only uh simply tradition customs if it were to them they would take the whole thing off and be like the presenters and you question number one they're wearing tons of makeup they're wearing lipsticks uh eyeliners um everything in the book because this is what shaitaan is using them for these people as you see them with the abaya and with the headscarf that exposes most of their hair look at them when they board the plane traveling out of the kingdom the minute they set foot on the plane and the they close the doors of the plane they go to the bathroom and all of a sudden they're transformed from uh hijabi women into westernized women wearing a tight jeans and their hair is all exposed they're wearing t-shirts so subhanallah they do not look to be muslim so pray for them may allah guide them back and pray for those who are in charge of these tv channels because each and every one working in such tv channels is sinful he is cooperating on misguiding the muslims by portraying such women by giving false information so i believe the only people who are getting in halal income are those who are working in huda insha allah and by the way i don't do not get any uh income from none whatsoever not a single penny but those who work in hood inshallah they're working in an islamic channel and they're working in halal things but these people who are collaborating on misguiding the muslims and portraying this to be islam this isn't islam this has nothing to relate to islam islam we take it from the scholars we take it straight from the quran and sunnah and these people go against the quran sunnah"
