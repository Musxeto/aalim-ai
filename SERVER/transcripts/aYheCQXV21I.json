  "title": "Am I a hypocrite if I pray on & off (worse than a kafir who doesn't pray at all?) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh we know a person who doesn't pray is a cfir but I heard you say in a lecture before that if a person prays on and off He's a hypocrite now I'm a little confused because wouldn't that be worse than a cafir and what will be the evidence for that first of all I did not say a person who does not praise a cafir because this is a generalization the Hadith generalizes it the prophet says between a man and or kufur is leaving Salat in another Hadith whoever leaves the Salat is a cfir and in another Hadith the oath or the pledge between us and Them is prayer whoever abandons it is a cfir so this is the general Trend who doesn't praise a cafir now I cannot take this Hadith or and implement it on a particular individual until the conditions are fulfilled in that individual likewise I can't say everyone who deals in riba is cursed by Allah this is a a well-known fact in the Quran and the Sunnah I cannot Cascade this on Mr Abdullah who works in an interest based bank and I say Mr Abdullah is cursed by Allah he's in Hellfire he's Waging War against Allah and the messenger I cannot say that because there are conditions that must be fulfilled knowledge intention the willingness to do it voluntary not compelled to do it there is no misconception in it and there are obstacles to be avoided and if these two were to be fulfilled alhamdulillah then it can be established so a person who doesn't pray in my office I never seen him pray I can't say he's a cfir because he might pray when I am at the Masjid he might pray in his home in secret so I can't label him as a cafer until the conditions are fulfilled yes if he raises the flag and says I don't care I don't pray because I don't believe in prayer and we show him that these are the pillars of Islam he said nevertheless I don't want to pray I don't believe in prayer no this is a CF there's no ambiguity in it a person who prays on and off he has the hypocrisy sign and this is the Practical hypocrisy not the hypocrisy related to conviction and belief the hypocrisy the major hypocrisy which is putting the person labeled as such in the lowest level of Hellfire is related to conviction pretending to be a Muslim intending to dis disseminate and to destroy and to totally uh yeah fight against Islam this is a full-fledged hypocrite a person who prays on and off he's a practical hypocrite like the one who lies like the one who cheats yet he's still a Muslim till proven otherwise and I hope this answers your question"
