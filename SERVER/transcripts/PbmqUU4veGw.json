  "transcript": "um Abu Muhammad was asking about the Hadith of what is known among the scholars of he's a companion his name is known was as the prophet used him to go and collect the zakat and we know that the zakat is divided into two sections or two types uh something that is hidden and something that everyone can see so the hidden one the hidden part of the zakat you are instructed to pay on your own and this is between you and Allah such as gold silver money this is no one will come and collect it from you while if you have a farm and you have crops or you have uh uh cattle if you have herds of sheep camels cows Etc then it is the obligation of the ruler the Muslim ruler to send someone to evaluate and to collect the zakat so was sent by the prophet to collect the zakat he came after a while and he said this portion is yours this is the zakat and this small P portion is mine I was uh given it by the people I visited the prophet alham was outraged so he went to the pulpit he praised Allah he offered salutation to the prophet Alam and then he gave a general speech a general reminder without naming this man and he said why do I get people to work and bring the zakat and when they come they say this is your zakat but this was given to me this is mine the prophet then gave the justification that you can determine whether what you giving is a bribe or not the prophet said Alam wouldn't he had sit in his mother's house and then figure out would people come and give him something or not so this is the way that you can judge the brother AB Muhammad is telling us that he's supporting he's providing he is probably supplying some companies with um electricity with Machinery with tools spare parts uh stationer whatever and definitely in that company there are uh purchasing department there are uh uh people who are responsible for giving the bids to whomever they think is fit for the company and in the majority of purchasing departments you uh you have a problem with uh these departments because they take a lot of the bribes basically speaking when you give these gifts this this money to the employees let's look at another scenario if this individual you're giving him the the gift or the money if he was in his house and not working for that company would you have given him anything the answer is definitely not no one would give him anything because no one knows him no one wants anything from him so basically speaking what you're doing is a bribe when you go to the purchasing department general manager and you give him an expensive watch or an expensive pen or a ticket to sh or a laptop or an A phone a mobile phone you're not giving it to him because he has black eyes or blue eyes you're giving it to him because of his position and that is why you're giving it to this particular Department's head rather than giving it to the HR GM for example nobody gives the the HR GM anything because they don't want anything from him until they want a job therefore this is the way you can judge whether it's a bribe or not Scholars say there is an exception for example if I if you and I went to school together and we are friends and you used to give me gifts and I give you gifts and then I went to college and then I graduated and became a judge or became an official in a company and the gifts were continuing so when I give you a gift I'm not actually giving it to because of your position or because you are influential I'm giving it to you because this is the Habit that has been going on for years before or you have assumed that position in this case Scholars say as long as I when I receive this gift I'm not going to feel inclined to help him or to bend some rules or pull some strings if this is the case it is permissible for me to take that gift and I hope this answers your question s"
