  "transcript": "If a person misses a day or more from Ramadan, he is one of two. Either his reason was temporary which means that he was ill but he will recover either after a while or after a year or two whatever illness he has. It is temporary. It's not permanent. So this person has to make up for the days he missed when he gets better. The second person is a person who missed days of Ramadan due to his illness which is permanent illness. The doctor says that there is no way that he will be cured of such an illness. And this person he has to feed a day a poor person for every day he misses. And under the same category falls those who are elderly. So if a person is 70 or 80 years old and he's not ill but he's so fragile and weak to the extent that he could not fast Ramadan. In this case this person has to feed one poor person for every day he misses from Ramadan. And we have to uh uh pay attention to the fact that the feeding must be after missing the days not before. Some of the people who are permanent uh uh permanently sick or elderly they come in the beginning of Ramadan and they feed 30 people for the whole month of Ramadan. This is wrong. they have to feed the 30 people after the the month is over and not before the days are missed. So in this case the uh uh the person who's asking about losing eight days most likely his or her illness was temporary and it's gone. So now they should make up for these days and they don't have to uh feed any poor person as a expeation just simply make up for the days and allahel knows"
