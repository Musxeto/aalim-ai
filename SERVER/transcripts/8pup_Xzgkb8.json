  "title": "Does the man have the right to beat his wife in Islam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] you have to look at the whole quran and the sunnah to understand it you cannot come to one single line and say this is what islam is based on so what is islam based on first of all marriage is important in islam you have to take care of this this institution because you have children coming out of it it's a life a woman who is divorced has difficulty getting married again maybe a man can marry easily but it's difficult the supply is far greater than the demand and this is noticeable and common sense now i have a problem with my wife and i am assuming she's the aggressor because if i'm the aggressor i have no right even to advise her i'm the aggressor i have no right to abandon her i'm the aggressor so the ayah the verse is referring to a situation where the woman is the aggressor and she is not complying she is not obedient she is she's she doesn't want life to go on islam tells you advise her and then abandon her in bed do not have any intimacy and if she does not comply and you think that by spanking her she will go back to the track and she will listen then do so one says yesterday i beat my wife why said i gave her advice for a couple of minutes and i abandoned her in bed for 10 minutes and then i i beat the hell out of her muslim a proper muslim no you should advise her for a week for two weeks for three weeks keep on preaching her this is haram what you're doing is haram allah is not happy with you you this doesn't work abandon her in bed don't leave the house don't kick her out don't send her to her family you're both in the same house you're both in the same bedroom but give her give her your back don't look at her or give her any a kind of of a feeling that you're attracted to her the wife will say i hope he stays like this for a whole year one one month that would it may affect her if this does not help i did all what i can do then islam tells you it's permissible to spank her okay put on your boxing gloves and let's start training no how how do i beat her the prophet says do not leave a mark do not break a bone do not shed blood do not live am i leave a mark if i do this it's going to be red i can't do this yes you can't he will leave a mark how would you want me to beat her then even abba says use the miswak what kind of it does it inflict pain does it well life i do like this it's not painful but it is not meant to be painful it is meant to be mental into allah all this love that we had all these beautiful days that we've shared and now it comes to you hitting me with a toothbrush with a swag yes because you've done something and you have been the aggressor this if it doesn't help then you have to bring someone to council between you and her from your family and from her family and if this does not work then it's divorced and hundreds and hundreds of women when they know about them swag who were divorced they would say well he i'd rather my husband beats me with a miswak rather than being divorced as i am for three or four years with the kids so does islam promote beating of women yes or no did the prophet allah beat one single woman in his life with her set by allah the prophet had never this is hadith so you don't understand the quran without the hadith she says by allah the prophet had never beaten a woman nor a child unless it was for the cause of allah in jihad in fighting and of course neither the women nor the children would hold a raise a a a sword in the face of anyone so the prophet had never done this so if you understand this you know the role of that in marriage now does if we know that a brother domestically abuses his wife and his family her family are not defending her it's not your responsibility to go and intervene if you and a bunch of strong guys you know guys from the gym let's go and give him a a battery let's go and you know break a tooth or two it's not your job it's the job of the family of the girl and if they don't want to it's her job to call the police and get help but you coming out from outside and you're not related neither to the man and to the girl and you want to become a law enforcer this is not permissible in islam and it's not even logical no one would accept this"
