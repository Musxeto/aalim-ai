  "title": "At work we have to use alarm buttons with music & melody sound, is my salary haram? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh social uh recently I'm working in a place where we are using some alerts in the before that I was working in a place so I left that and I have tried my best to find a Halal job so this is a car fabrication company and there is no alcohol or food something like that but the problem is whenever we work there are some alarms Melody sounds that we are using like when we have a problem in the post or we we are not capable of doing the part of the job so we are using a situation pattern and an alarm turns on in a loud speaker and our responsible or boss team or she may hear it and come and ask us about the problem that was the problem and there are some two three or four tracks or maybe more alarms different alarms for different groups so and we are hearing it and some of the times we are obliged to use it ourselves when we need help so our example for that or does it make our salary Haram okay I got your question so basically speaking the answer is no your salary is halal because your job description is halal and you are forced to hear such Melodies and musical instruments which is not for the sake of enjoyment rather for the sake of alarming others to come and attend so it's like a bell some houses have when you press the button you hear an orchestra playing a Beethoven V and you don't want this they've installed it you don't want to hear it or listen to it sometimes you call a company and they put you on hold and you hear music again you don't want to listen to it there's a difference between hearing something which is unwillingly or and listening to something which is done willingly and enjoying it so there's no problem in your job and in these alarms that you may have to apply or listen to because this is not music that you are enjoying or listening uh to"
