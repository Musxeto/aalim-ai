  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] welcome to this final episode of our uh valuable book for so long and the islamic faith and today's class is number 24. we will conclude inshaallah today's class with this book and the following class hopefully to be on next monday not this thursday because most likely this is thursday i'll be going to medina in sha allah so next monday we will conclude insha allah with our third segment of questions and answers dedicated for this uh book and with that we would finish the course insha allah so we have the uh 16th chapter of this book and in it the sheikh says the essence of freedom is to be free of of subservience to any other than allah now this is a very important concept in our islamic in our conviction in our belief in our creed as muslims because when people ignore the fact that they are servants when they tend to have this rebellious feeling of not submitting of being free this is when they are no longer considering themselves slaves to allah and this feeling as many of you may be surprised to know is found among many muslims and i'm not going to say that the muslims of the east the muslims of the west the muslims of the intellectual party that this and that no but they are found among all types when you have this arrogance when we give dawah or when specialized people in our centers give da'wah they tell us some communities are so quick to accept islam and usually these communities are those communities known among people to be humble to be easy-going to be soft-spoken filipinos for example are among those who are very quick to accept islam and the far east in general but when you go to some cultures some communities that believe there's their supreme they believe in their supremacy and that they are better than all mankind due to their race due to their nation due to their upbringing they have this arrogance in them such people usually don't accept islam easy and this is why you will really rarely find high percentages of muslims like you do in the far east why is that simply because they think and believe of themselves more than it deserves they overrate their intellectual powers and they value their quote unquote freedom so they have freedom of speech freedom of doing whatever you want it's a free country not knowing that once you have this concept in you even if you're a muslim you are in great danger of turning back on your heels because you have not submitted to allah yet the essence of freedom is to be free of subservience to anyone other than allah and this should be written in gold to think that freedom is to discard allah's commandments is nothing less than considering oneself as the idol and giving subservience to desire and this is what we find in western and eastern countries where they disbelieve and show their enmity to islam only today with a very small margin switzerland voted to ban nihab and this is the most stupid decision ever made yes it's a sovereign country they can do whatever they want why is that because in all of switzerland there is only 30 women who wear the neck up 3-0 30. yet they vote and waste people's money over 30 women and why are they so anxious to do so when everyone nowadays with covered 19 everyone is recommending people to cover their faces with face masks so the niqab is the best face mask what is it that you fear they fear islam and they are so arrogant that they consider themselves idle and give subservience to their desires allah says in the quran consider the one who takes his own desires as his deity and whom allah has therefore let go astray despite his knowledge of the truth sealing his ears and hearts and placing a cover on his eyes who can guide such a person after allah has abandoned him will you not then take heed this is exactly what fits those atheists those stubborn infidels who do not want to concede to the truth or at least objectively look into it they simply shut off every means of understanding the sheikh says whoever justifies that man can do and say whatever he wishes or chooses as he chooses and when he chooses such a person accepts that man is is subservient to his own desire and this is what's happening in the west freedom of speech you can slander anyone you can speak ill about anyone you can accuse anyone and at the end of the day sorry i thought that this was right but you can do whatever you wish without any boundaries and this is what is thinking of oneself as subservient to one's own desire man is created as a subservient being and this is a well-known fact we are not lords we are not gods we don't have the power and authority we are born as servants and slaves and we are servants and slaves to allah azzawajal if man does not submit himself to allah and worship him he will worship someone else without doubt so this is your destiny your destiny is to be subservient and worshipping who this is something you have to decide if you are among the fortunate you will only agree and choose to worship allah alone otherwise you're going to worship thousands and thousands of different gods that would lead you straight to hell had there been only one human and this is a logical idea if there were only one human being on earth allah would not have legislated for him punishment for murder slandering false accusation and adultery if i were the only human being on earth do you think allah azza would legislate to me punishments that require the presence of others of course not that would not be wise nor would allah have required him that is the only soul person living on earth allah would nor would allah have required him to lower his gaze or to adopt a system of inheritance inherit who there's nobody he would not have forbidden him adultery usually there is ribba and other vile practices because it is like asking someone or telling someone nowadays or giving someone the protocol how to walk on water anyone would look at this and says what is this this is insane i can't walk on water why do you give me a protocol that shows me how to walk in water when i can't now allah has legislated all these prescribed punishment lowering the gaze how to distribute inheritance etc has legislated all of these because man lives with other human beings the greater the number of people the more life needs controls had the moon been the only one in space would allah have assigned it such an accurate existence of course not if the moon was the only sphere in the heavens nothing around it allah would not have assigned a specific orbit in a format for it allah has made it move so accurately in order to be part of the system that includes the sun the earth the planets and other celestial bodies the greater their number the more control is required okay so what does the sheikh hint to the sheikh is hinting to a main concept in akida which is that we are followers we are commanded to obey we are servants and slaves of allah who should and must worship him and this is the system that allah has placed to govern this universe and without the system the universe would not go in line and there would be chaos and there would be lots and lots of problems imagine if the son of allah suddenly decided to go in a different orbit and the earth wanted to uh uh ward off and and be somewhere else and and and wander around what would happen says in the quran he covers the day with the night in swift pursuit the sun the moon and the stars are subservient to his command surely all creation and all authority belongs to him blessed is allah the lord of the worlds this system this perfection it's not like a swiss watch as they say because that has flaws in it the system the terrestrial system that we see over us this is perfection that allah has placed for us to observe and wonder allah says neither can the sun overtake the moon nor can the night outrun the day each floats in its own orbit yet man decides to think of himself as a god that he is in control that he runs everything and we have seen what a menut virus did to the whole world with ordell technologies with with all their medical achievements and advances nothing it showed them how weak they were and how weak they are and how weak they will be in the future this is allah's powers and this is one of allah's soldiers islamic legislation is meant to regulate matters of religion and life whoever justifies violating allah's laws for himself incurs his punishment and this is inevitable if you do something you're going to be punished for it if you break the law you're gonna be punished for it and this is in worldly matters how come when you break allah's laws you expect to get away with it unpunished to embrace islam it is obligatory and to turn away from it is apostasy and this is a well-known fact in islamic apida yet people are still hesitant o sheikh i have a father and he said clearly he does not believe in the existence of heaven and hell he does not believe in the angels in the jinn i showed it to him in the quran i explained it to him he said i only believe in allah how do i deal with this man he's an apostate full stop if you showed him and he still insists he doesn't follow the quran in the sunnah he doesn't want to follow the pillars of islam and of iman what else can you do to such a person who is refusing to submit his will to allah azza this guy is an apostate as allah says whoever of you renounces his faith and dies as a disbeliever his works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come such people are destined to hell wherein they shall abide and the prophet said al-islam whoever changes his religion should be killed so this is the religion of islam either you're a muslim submitting your will to allah or you are in defiance and rejecting it and becoming an apostate so what is worshiping allah being subservient to allah to worship allah is the ultimate purpose of creation and existence whoever allows himself to be turned away from it does not believe that it is the purpose of existence and this is what the vast majority of humans and the jinn never succeed in sitting down and contemplating about it why do you think allah created me why am i in this world why am i on earth is it to eat drink mate and enjoy life is it to fall sick and become healthy is it to become rich and get poor why is it is it just to sleep at night and wake up in the day and i do the same routine all over and that's it this is not what created us so to worship allah is the ultimate purpose of creation and existence whoever allows himself to be turned away from it does not believe that it is the purpose of existence allah did not create us for this allah created us to worship him how is it that a person prohibits the breach of the constitution or the laws of one's country but justifies the breach of submission to allah isn't that strange and weird to do so that is to justify that i cannot break a red light i cannot violate the law of the country when they say do not import such and such plants i cannot disobey the law but when it comes to halal and haram yeah it's okay there's no problem in skipping salah there's no problem in free mixing there is no problem in selling haram products like wine and intoxicants and and pork there's no problem in be friending and having allegiance to the disbelievers there's no problem in congratulating people with of their false deities and religions there's no problem not abiding by the islamic attire there's no problem in not submitting your will to allah and being content with allah's decree and the list goes on and on and on to do so is to implicitly admit that one does not truly believe in the purpose of creation but allah says i have not created the jinn and mankind to any end other than that they may worship me the concludes by saying the one who brought the humans and the jinn into this life to worship him alone will certainly bring them into the life to come so that they will account for their deeds and receive their reward or receive their punishment may allah grant us the best of situations in life and give us the best of provisions and peace and blessing be upon him and those who follow him now this concludes our beautiful book as stated earlier and indeed this book is beneficial informative and it is filled with logical information that objective people even non-muslims can relate to can understand it is a huge eye opener and may allah reward the brother's ancestors of osol group who translated this great book and provided it to us in this software copy so that we can study it and benefit from it ami we conclude today's session with few questions remaining from last time so masuma says can you tell me is zakat applicable for widow and she has no earnings except savings which her kids give her do we have to recite durood after kunut in witcher so the first question is about whether it is mandatory upon a widow who has savings but she doesn't earn and these savings are provided to her by her children does she have to give zakat a rule of thumb zakat is mandatory over whatever a person possesses whatever an individual or individuals possess as their own money whether they are widows even orphans children even if a person is insane someone who lost his mind he's insane he's mentally challenged he's handicapped he doesn't have any um sense a person who's in a coma for years but he has wealth that exceeded the threshold and a whole lunar year had passed with it in his possession he must give zakat which is 2.5 percent of his savings so it doesn't matter whether she is a widow or an orphanage or on an orphan or someone is insane they all have to pay zakat the only exception is that when there is a non-profit organization where the money does not belong to anyone so if we have a portfolio where all the family member put a certain amount of money for future use such as a disaster an accident a need to pay money then we take from it and allocate it to the people who contribute but at the end of the day this money does not belong to a specific individual no one can come and say listen since 1995 i've been giving and contributing annually i want my money back no this is not possible he cannot be given a penny if this is the case this money has no zakat in it if i have a community or i formed the committee to collect money for a masjid and now i have in my possession three million dollars for that masjid to be built and a year or two or more pass over this wealth in my possession there is no zakat on it because it doesn't belong belong to an individual or a group of individuals that may possess it once again now it's out of their possession a second question about offering salutation upon the prophet after the in which there are some narrations stating that this is recommended so yes when you conclude your quran you may say was [Music] is it permissible to sell condoms as i own a drugstore and i'm in doubt as if i should sell it or not yes it is yes it is permissible to sell condoms because condoms are like a knife people buy it either to cut bread and meat with it and once every blue moon someone may buy it to cut someone's throat with it so does this mean that we prohibit selling knives no the item itself is halal to be used and the person buying it if he's using it for something that is haram he is sinful for that afrina says why does allah care about parents emotions more than children emotions what's the children's fault first of all karen oh afrina sorry nobody has the right to question this is totally inappropriate and disrespectful especially when being word worded in such a fashion to indicate an objection or this is not fair so this is definitely inappropriate and not allowed however if we look at your question you're saying why does allah care about the parents emotions and he instructs the children to be dutiful obedient and respectful while not asking the the parents to be as cordial as that the reason is and allah knows best that the inner feeling of compassion mercy love and kindness is natural in the hearts of the parents so you don't preach the choir as they say you don't need to while the children are by nature rebellious disobedient and at times ungrateful so allah made it clear that they must go out of their way to be kind dutiful obedient respectful and taking care of their parents this is the general tendency this is the norm you will find sometimes that some of the parents are not at all compassionate or caring or loving yet this abnormality does not justify the children to be disobedient or disrespectful the parents who are of such a nature would be held accountable on the day of judgment and would surely punish them for their behavior yet even if they were the worst of people they still have an upper upper hand for being the reason of a person existing in this world and the least you can do to repay them is to follow allah's commands which is a form of worship which is a form of showing your subservience to allah azzawajal when you obey and respect and become dutiful and kind to this parent who doesn't deserve it in our worldly standards but simply because allah told us to be as this we are in compliance with it zaid says is sunnah to die our beards this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it is highly recommended to die the whiteness of the beard but it is not mandatory in a hadith the prophet said allah the jews and the christians do not die their beards so die yours okay die yours this is an order if it's an order why aren't you complying well there are other evidences reducing it from an obligation to a recommendation among them is the fact that the prophet saws was known to have some white hairs in his beard his sideburns and his hair and that he did not diet also and allah be pleased with them two of the great four caliphs and among the 10 heaven bound had white beards and never died so these evidences and others all indicate that it is not mandatory to die and of course we have other evidences praising one strand of white hair to be light in the face of the individual and how the prophet islam prohibited plucking them out etc so all of these indicate that it is a recommendation but not an obligation to dye your white hair for me personally i would love to but the problem is every couple of weeks you have to repeat that and it consumes time and it makes a great mess to prepare the die so i think maybe i'm better off without it and allah knows best muhammad says should we have to say our athkar of the evening after assa or after mahdi prayer it's an issue of dispute i personally believe that it should be done after mahdi prayer this is where the evening begins but there are other evidences that it is after asur and to tell you the truth it's up to your preference if you feel good about saying it after assa you may do the so i personally do it after mahdi is says please in what situation can someone be allowed to be in salat while wearing his or her shoes there are no situations for that the prophet saw recommended praying in our shoes when he said go against the jews and pray in your shoes because they do not pray in their shoes so whenever you are wearing your shoes and you want to pray pray with them on if i'm in the airport for example or in a mall where there are no places for me to pray and it's time for prayer i just take a corner and i pray with my shoes on why would i take my shoes off there's no reason for that but when a person enters a masjid that has carpets then in this case you take your shoes off so that first of all you would not create any chaos in the masjid when the people see you coming in with your shoes not knowing whether your shoes are clean or dirty whether they're pure or nudges this is inappropriate because it would stain and make a scene out of it in the masjid this is a fitna but other than that there is no problem in sha allah none whatsoever senna says if the postmortem stops if there is no more bleeding after 40 days can i fast in the month of ramadan we know that when a woman gives birth she gets mortem bleeding or postnatal bleeding and this the islam has put a max to it so this bleeding can go on for 40 days and she can or she must skip prayer and fasting and not be intimate with her husband for 40 days but if after 15 days of birth or 20 days she sees her purity blood stops altogether and she sees the white thread like discharge or complete dryness in this case where she's ordered to perform russell to start praying and fasting if she wants fat too fast and she can be intimate with her husband 15 days or 20 days after her birth giving birth couple of weeks later meaning that 30 days after her delivery she sees blood again we say to her stop everything you are now still on your post natal bleeding until the 40 days are over once the 40 days are over even if the blood does not stop she makes rosur and she prays and fast and can be intimate providing this is not her menses and she can tell by the color the pain the back pain the cramps etc so the point is that she is not obliged to wait for 40 days without praying and fasting she can pray and fast before that if she were to see her purity but bearing in mind that if the bleeding comes again within the 40 days she must stop again farzana says how do we understand the concept of allah's hands chins face fingers do we say allah has a body first of all as muslims we confirm only what allah and his messengers messenger confirmed and we deny what allah has denied and his messenger other than that we refrain so did allah tell us in the quran and in the sunnah that he has a face yes eyes yes shin yes hands yes to to to be exact fingers yes so do we confirm this the answer is yes so do we say that allah has a body said whoop wait wait wait show me in the quran or in the sunnah that allah said that he has a body ah so you say that allah doesn't have a body i said wait again show me that allah said that he does not have a body now you're getting me confused does allah have a body or he doesn't have a body i would say to you i don't know allah did not tell us that he told us about the previously mentioned attributes of his so we confirm it but we do not go beyond that and describe allah with with something he did not describe himself by so if a person says allah does not have a body we say this is wrong you cannot say that and the first says allah has a body i said this is also wrong you cannot say that you can only describe allah with what he had described himself or his messenger described him of but when the person says allah doesn't have a body and he elaborates by saying and he does not have hands he does not have a face he said no no no come here you are totally wrong and you are deviant and when someone says allah has a body and his hand is like this and his face is like this and he starts to simulate and give examples this is the work of um this is totally haram and blasphemous so we have to stick exactly with what the sunnah and the appeared of allah said the zebra khan says how do we calculate zakat on 22 karat of gold what if i need to calculate the cut of 15 months because i couldn't pay it on its due time first of all [Music] exceeding the zakat date is sinful but the date does not change so if your date was the first of shaban the eighth month of the islamic calendar and the following shaban you didn't have money for one reason or the other you didn't pay zakat in ramadan in shawwal and on the you had money so we wanted to give so you're asking 15 months now had passed this doesn't make any difference calculate your zakat till the first of shaban for the 12 months and gives the cat the remaining three months you'll add another nine months to it so the following first of shaban you give the second zakat and not now as for your 22 carat of gold you have to first find out whether it exceeds the threshold or not the threshold is calculated in 24 karat of gold so if you have 85 grams of 24 carat gold or more you must give zakat providing a whole year passed with it in your possession so like for example if you have 22 karat gold and you have 200 grams of it definitely this is the catabol how to calculate it it doesn't matter what caliber it is 22 karat gold 200 you have to give five percent of it of of each 100 well let me um repeat that the 200 of 22 karat gold you divide this by 40 and the total would come to you as the zakat what is the division that the result 200 grams divided by 40 is 5 grams of 22 karat gold this is one way of doing it and this is a 2.5 percent the other way of doing it which is the easiest go and check the 200 grams value in the market they say it's an x amount multiplied by 2.5 and the result is your zakat moyan hussein says i have heard uh i have a hard time sleeping so if i regularly recite samathkar till i fall asleep will it fall under innovation that is no you can make vikr you can recite the quran all of these are things that are made to comfort your heart and to get you closer to allah so if you do this with the intention to utilize your time until you fall asleep this is totally permissible kb thrift says is assurance meaning i think insurance schemes reba and haram yes insurance schemes are based on gambling and river and hence they are prohibited afsha says can a jamaa be made with only one man and wife and daughters no other male no son yes this is a jamaa if a man prays with his wife he's not praying single so this is considered to be a jamar and we're talking in situations where a man cannot go to the masjid either due to covet or due to the distance the message is far away then yes he can pray with his family daughters and wife mubasher what is the difference between zibya and halal can we eat halal when it's not zibiya i think by slaughtered animal so a slaughtered animal is not halal to eat all the time it depends on the person who has slaughtered it so if a muslim a christian or a jew slaughtered an animal this is a biha and it is halal so halal itself is a description that is the opposite of haram so halal is permissible haram is prohibited and forbidden but people nowadays describe the meat as halal meaning it was slaughtered by a muslim jew or christian and any animal that is slaughtered by other than muslim jew or christian it is it's a dead meat that we cannot consume and finally fat head says is it haram for a male professor to teach males and females together will is earning bihar no his earning will be halal because a man is the breadwinner of the family and what he's doing is teaching so he's not fornicating he's not free mixing he's not chit chatting all of these are haram but if he's teaching math or science or literature whether he's teaching men or women boys or girls as he has no control over that he's earning his providing he does not commit anything haram in the process and allah azzawajal knows best and this is all what we have for today's class and with it we conclude our course until we meet in another course and as a reminder next monday inshallah we will have the final q a so be sure to post them on the facebook uh of the islamic page so that we can inshallah collect them and answer them for you was allah"
