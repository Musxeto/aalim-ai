  "transcript": "anna says my question is regarding the importance of weak hadith there is wife should we follow the boy if a hadith and what is the Islamic ruling for it because I have heard people saying to not completely reject them as they are after all considered to be hadith this is an issue of dispute among scholars the reason of the dispute is that some imams considered the hadith that are weak to be better than using using your analogy so this came up when the Hanbury school of thought came to a fork of the road over issues that were not clearly covered by the Quran and the Sunna so they looked into the issue and to be able to determine and give a verdict they had one of two either to rely on their analogy and their logic or to search in the weak hadith and find the hadith that is weak yet it supports a verdict and they followed that in Abu Hanifa used to follow the analogy and the logic due to the fact that he did not have a lot of hadith at his time to rely on due to the fact that he did not travel as did a man Malik Imam Shafi nur Muhammad he was always in his village in his town and people from all over came there and shared with him some of the hadith that they had heard but not all of it while ematic traveled Imam Shafi traveled anna muhammad traveled the most so he got to meet people who heard the hadith from different companions who were travelling all over after the death of the Prophet erase a lot Salam and managed to learn from them more now the problem is that when we come to a week or belief hadith scholars that said that we can refer to it sometimes said that there are conditions one that the weakness of the hadith is not due to one of the narrator's being a liar or being an innovator rather being weak in his memory his books were burnt so now he doesn't have any references he's giving hadith from his memory this is why it's weak secondly it should not be in hell and Haram so it should not be related to fit or to act either rather it is related to Fattah little a man the deeds that are not of essence so whoever prays to raka between this prayer and that prayer Allah would grant him a house in Jannah is therein halal Haram no is anything to do with appear no it is something recommended to pray yes so this dive hadith we can adopt it and so on and this is why the scholars have differed some of them said it is okay to use weak hadith when it's related to things that do not deal with al-qaeda or with halal and Haram or with verdicts of the Deen others said no when Allah said that he will protect the religion that he is the one who revealed the Vicker which includes Quran and Sunna and that he is the one who's going to protect it the weak hadith is not part of the protected one and when Allah says Ali o McMahon Telecom Dina come today I have completed your religion the weak hadith is not part of the religion that was completed therefore and this is open initial Albani we only rely on the Koran the authentic hadith with the understanding of the three favorite generations the generation of the companion stabbing and Tevye Tevye and I'm inclined to this opinion because it's the safest and it is crystal clear you cannot bring weak hadith and make the firm foundations which Islam is standing on a little bit shaky because of such weak hadith someone knows best"
