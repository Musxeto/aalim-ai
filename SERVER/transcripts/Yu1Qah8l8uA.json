  "transcript": "[Music] I've heard some people talking about this openly in the tafseer of suratul marriage what if someone indulges an extremely filthy axe during fasting by himself which requires him to do ocean what is the kuffara for that this is in referral to masturbation and masturbation according to the majority of scholar scholars is prohibited it's an act of transgression and a Muslim must avoid this does it impact his fasting definitely it does it breaks your fast is there any explanation for that the answer is no the expiration is only for intercourse but it is sinful it void and nullify is your fasting and you have to repent to Allah so JAL and make up for that day you [Applause]"
