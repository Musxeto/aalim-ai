  "title": "Praying in hotel Masjids that are linked to the Makkah haram same as praying in haram? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "I had says is it the same praying in the messages that are linked to the mecha harem in hotels such as intercontinental and Hilton Suites in German Omar this is an issue of dispute you know that Hallam is Helen and there are buildings and high risers surrounding it and in these hotels or high-rises there is usually a prayer hall with glass walls overlooking the plaza of the harem so you can see the Masjid the worshippers some say that praying there is exactly as praying in the Masjid and some say that it is not permissible to pray there altogether personally I say that it is only permissible for you to pray in such places at times of hatch or at times of Ramadan when the full message it is complete and the plazas and and the areas be outside of it are complete and the rows reach literally your hotel so praying in that hall has the same ruling in sha Allah as if you praying downstairs with them in a larger knows best but in normal times when the Haram is empty and there are only scattered people outside no this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
