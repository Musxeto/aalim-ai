  "transcript": "foreign my question is is there a percentage limit on profits islamically so if I buy a certain product then I either use it for a bit or leave it unopened in its packaging can I then sell it to someone for whatever price I like or is there a percentage limit on the profit I can make Scholars said that the profit should be within reason and it should not be exaggerated personally speaking I never found such evidences that back it up if I bought this for a pound and someone wants to buy it from me and I say I'll sell it for you for 20 pounds that's a lot I'm not hitting you on your hand so that you can buy it you don't want to buy it no problem you can go so it's demand and supply but if he's willing to pay 20 pounds for it why would it be Haram for me I didn't lie I didn't cheat how much you want for the spend 20 pounds 100 pounds 5 000 pounds this is too much says who if I have no restrictions from the Quran the Sunnah I'm not cheating I'm not lying and he's willing to pay and the off and the shops are all around us I could go and look and he doesn't then this is his problem not mine and Allah knows best you"
