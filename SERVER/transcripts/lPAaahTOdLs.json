  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah what are the obligatory parts of tum number one the intention it's not sufficient just to strike the ground and do whatever you want without the intention of uplifting the minor or major ritual impurity so you have to have this in your heart it's not something that you verbalize rather it's an intention number two you have to wipe your faith number three you have to W wipe your palms and hands and number four you have to have this sequence and this is an issue of dispute but the majority say the majority of schools of thought you have to have the sequence of wiping the face then the hands though there are reports that the prophet Sall Ali wasallam said wipe your hands and then your face which caused a confusion the verse of the Quran clearly states that to wipe your faces and your hands and some of the hadiths in bukari states that you wipe your right hand and left then you wipe your face so how to make them work one way of doing it is to follow the majority of the scholars who followed the Quran and be safe there's no problem in that the other way is to say that alhamdulillah the best is to wash your face to wipe your face and your hands as per the Quran and the majority of Scholars but if you do the other way around the prophet had done itam which means that this is permissible as well but as I said better safe than sorry follow the Quran and the majority of the scholars to be safe so this is the way of doing it to strike the ground once wipe your face and then wipe your right hand with your left and then your left with your right that's it you don't go all the way down to your uh um elbows you know you don't wipe your forearms it's only the palms of your hand this is the way of doing it a lot of the Muslims ask she I wake up one minute Before Sunrise and if I go to perform Wu The Sun would rise and I would have missed F prayer so can I talk take a shortcut and do tum and the answer is no this is not permissible even if the sun rises you cannot perform tum for this reason you have to perform a full-fledged Evolution or woodo how to perform we discussed this briefly your fingers have to be apart don't do this so they have to be a part from one another and this is recommended if you do this it's okay but it has to it best to be part away from each other you strike the earth once not twice only once and then you wipe your face with it and then you wipe your uh uh um the back of your hands with your palms doing this so it's just a normal process once and if you are unable to use T how could that be someone is unable to use water and he's unable to use the but this is not possible you can't be flying on air where you don't have any Earth to touch everybody has air well this is hypothetical let's assume someone is tied up may Allah protect us in Chains and is unable to use neither water nor the Earth in this case you have to pray as you are without W yes without W without yes without even if there are impurities on my body I'm not clean yes prayer does not fall in the sense that no one is permitted to skip prayer for any reason as Allah says fear Allah to the best of your ability and this is the best of of my ability to pray in the in and this is what we should address those who are bedridden in hospitals for example for a couple of months three months and they have a bag of urine next to them and they feel filthy and dirty some of them unfortunately Satan manages to trick by whispering in their heads that you're not clean you're not fit to pray so they abandoned prayer all their stay and some of them unfortunately die in that state of not praying for two or three months may Allah protect us all so what happens if we find water well it states that there are three types of situations number one if I make tum and before I start to pray I find water in this case you can't continue to pray yes but she when I started do do my tum there was no water just as I was going to say allahar I found water or someone brought water to me in this case your tum is broken automatically and you need to go and perform W number two if I were to pray with because there was no water and after finishing my Salat and doing my Salam someone brought water to me in this case my prayer is valid 100% I'm not in need to do woodo and redo it again because this is the Sunnah as the prophet said Alat number three if I'm in the middle of the prayer in the state of tum I didn't find water so I made tum while I was praying it started to rain or someone came in with a bottle of water in this case I have to break my prayer and perform woodo to be able to pray again with wo or in the state of woodo okay so now I am in the state of tum what breaks my tum number one finding water or being able to use water so the moment the reason you can't use water is uplifted and now you can use water such as in the case of having a surgical plaster and it was removed and the doctor says now you can use water immediately my tum is broken I have to perform W number two is if I were to break my state of Purity with whatever nullifies my woodo the normal things so defecating urinating passing of wind sleeping or eating camels meat all of this breaks my wood therefore it breaks my state of tum as well and Allah Knows [Music] [Music] Best [Music] for"
