  "transcript": "Rizwan says that is it permissible for women to wear different colored Evalia or outer garment or Jill Bob that that is a designer ones most of them are attractive honestly well the essence of a woman's jilbab jilbab is the outer garment the abaya is the black dress that women wear in arabia that covers their whole entire body so this outer garment is mandatory in Islam for women to wear why because it has to conceal their bodies it has to conceal their beauty so that men would not be tempted by it feminists say why don't men look down and lower their gaze said anti-feminists say why don't women come out naked this is the dress code that Allah the creator of the heavens and the earth had made for people women by nature attract men like flowers attract bees this is nature this is how Allah made us and it's not the other way around so even if you have a handsome man a really beautiful person man women would not look at him as much as when you have a beautiful bombshell when you have a woman who's beautiful men would turn their heads this is something in their genes is something that Allah created them and this is why women are obliged to wear the hijab and then you pop while men even no matter how handsome they are they're not a ordered or obliged to cover their faces or the hair or etc so it defies the purpose of a job when the outer garment is attractive so it has to be black know it can be black it can be brown it can be dark blue it can be a regular color that is not attractive with its like red or pink this is attractive it's like a peacock coming out when it has drawings and decoration this is beautiful people would look and would wonder what is underneath etc so a pious and righteous and chaste woman would not go to the extreme of attracting people to her but this doesn't mean that she cannot wear any other colors no she can wear modest and normal colors insha'Allah"
