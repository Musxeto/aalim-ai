  "title": "Can we open Savings account",
  "transcript": "are we allowed to open a saving account with an Islamic banks such as Islamic Bank of Britain I have contacted them and they assured me that they will invest your money in a halal business and the profit is not fixed every month the profit will be different I should have if you call anyone any bank that deals with RIBA or a bank that does not deal with RIBA they will definitely assure you that they are dealing this halal bla bla bla so don't believe what they say until you investigate especially when it comes to the book especially when it comes to money people are willing to sell their Acula to sell their religion for an extra amount of cash and they are pursuing and following their targets they have to achieve their target before the end of the year so that they can qualify for the bonus whether it's one or two or three or six monthly salaries so definitely you have to investigate now just because it's called Islamic a Bank of Britain does not mean it's Islamic the Bank depends entirely on the savings on the money you deposit so they want to get your money but the issue is how do they treat this money and what do they do with it if they lend others with interest if they deal with other banks of giving them time deposits for a month or so for a rate of 0.5% this is totally prohibited but if they do invest in Hanul transactions and Islamic windows as they call it and they buy and sell goods and they do Islamic stuff with a Sharia compliant world so there there are scholars who are monitoring not only giving them fatwa halal Haram no they're monitoring the transactions of the bank in this case it is permissible insha allah"
