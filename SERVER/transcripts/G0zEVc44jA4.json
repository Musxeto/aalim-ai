  "transcript": "from the Philippines says if I missed a in Salat unintentionally and then figured it out what should I do one of two situations either you miss a pillar such as a fa I'm presuming you're praying alone sitting between the two suj rising up from R Etc a whole pillar if you forget it either you remember it before reaching its place from the second raak so let's assume I'm reciting theb and I go sub instead of saying and rising up I say go for sujud I do my two sujud and I stand up for the second ra I'm reciting the faat and I remember hey I didn't Rise Up from R and rising up from R is a pillar okay I missed it what should I do in this case you should assume yourself in the ru position and that you have raised your head and you say and everything you did before that would be void because that would be extra as you have not rised from the yet so while standing you say assuming that this is the rising up from R of your first raak and then you perform two suud hey hey wait I did perform two sujud earlier their void because they came after a misted rook a m pillar that you forgot to do so they're all void and you continue so this is situation one situation two no I forgot to Rise Up from R I continued to my second ra and while I was in I rised up from and said and I continued my second raak my third raak in the fourth raak I remembered whoops I forgot to Rise Up from my first raak then what to do your first raak is void your second raak becomes your first your third raak becomes your second your fourth raak which you are standing in at the moment becomes your third so you continue and by this technically You' have prayed five and you offer after the Salam and you repeat the Salam so technically some folks watching would say that you've prayed five R actually the first one was void and you prayed four ra and this is uh uh the correct way of doing it so it's two scenarios I hope this answers a question"
