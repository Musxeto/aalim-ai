  "title": "Fortress Of Muslim 66 Dua for 1 you've insulted. When you praise someone / someone praises you Assim",
  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord alhamdulillah I'm about the prophet Allah was a prophet and a messenger for 23 years everything in his life was documented and I mean everything and if you go through his biography you will find that he was a kind merciful and soft person nevertheless he was a human being so you would expect that there should be times reported that he expresses his anger as a human being or he can't be just like that because a person who does not become angry is not a living person so if you look into his biography you will find that there are a number of isolated incidents where he got angry and may have said something that you would think that this is a little bit harsh but it's only human nature and these things are not more than what you can count on one hand incidents that are documented where he may have insulted someone or cursed someone for disobeying his direct order or making Dua which is random Dua as the Arabs say but do not intend it so how can we look and study such isolated limited incidents Hadith 230 the prophet Allah says in his Dua Allah foreign to any believer whom I have insulted let that be cause to draw him nearer to you on the day of Resurrection whoa so if the prophet insults me Allah or he curses me or he spanks me or beats me this would be a cause of getting me nearer to Allah which means that it is actually a good thing for me this is what the prophet Allah said what does that mean it means that the mercy of the Prophet Allah is blocking his anger and he's asking Allah azzawajal not to answer his Dua like when a daughter of um sulaim the mother of anas so this daughter is the sister of Annas once she's a young girl came and the prophet saw her and he was astonished because she grew up all of a sudden he didn't see her for a couple of months maybe and she seemed to have grown up she was like six or seven years of age so he said to her you've grown up may you never grow up again in Arabic so the girl went to her mom terrified and the mom rushed to the prophet assalam inquiring is this going to affect my daughter so she said oh prophet of Allah you said so and so so now my girl is not never going to grow up so the prophet smiled and said didn't you know that I asked Allah to make whatever things that come out of my mouth if it's insulting others or cursing them or beating them to make it a cause of them getting closer to Allah and of course the girl grew up and that is an indication that this Dua falls under under the whole Dua so this highlights the danger of what comes out of your mouth be careful when you curse your sons or your wealth or your servants but at the same time it indicates the mercy of the prophet of Salah to assalam and how his heart was was filled even at times of anger with compassion and mercy to his um now another situation which happens a lot when we would like to praise someone a fellow Muslim he's kind he is generous he is practicing this is a dangerous Zone because we may be complementing him while at the side of Allah azzawajal he's among the people of hell we don't know so what to do the prophet is if any one of you is impelled to praise his brother then he should say I deem so and so to be good to be righteous to be practicing to be generous and Allah is his reckoner and I don't praise anyone putting it that is my praising forward in front of Allah's Commendation however I assume him to be such and such if he knows that of him what does that mean so many times I would like to praise someone for his knowledge I always have to put this phrase Allah is his reckoner and I don't praise anyone putting it that is my praising forward in front of Allah's commendation this is how I always put a disclaimer so that I would not talking wrongly or wrongfully about others when they are not as I think of them then what happens if someone Praises me if you go through the biography of Scholars like bimbaz like even if they mean and those before them but these are our contemporaries these we've seen them and witnessed them you will find utter humbleness total refusal for anyone to praise them in front of them I've seen this myself when the Sheikh would interrupt someone who's praising him in a gathering he said no no stop no don't continue I don't allow this even when people say that I mean you are the solution for our problem problems he says stop this this is not Halal it's not permissible for you to praise me like this so what should we say when someone does praise us like this the Dua is to say Allah oh Allah do not hold me to account for what they say about me forgive me for that which they do not know about me and make me better than what they perceive me to be this Dua is coated by many of the salaf and some say that this is or these are the words of Abu Bakr himself and there are other narrations stating that this is what the companions used to say may Allah be pleased with them and these words are beautiful because it shows that no one knows you for truly who you are other than Allah the almighty and that we should continue to always look down upon ourselves and not allow people's praise to inflate us and this is a very dangerous thing because whenever someone Praises you the Sunnah is that you interrupt them and not allow them to keep on saying oh Sheikh you are the one who revived the Sunnah as so many people say to us when calling or communicating or talking oh you are this you are that you don't know me so if I allow you to continue yes yes yes I'm no no I I'm much better than this but uh yeah I'm I'm being humble no this endangers your Iman because shaytan will inevitably creep into your heart spoil it soil it darken it and make it as hard as Stone so always acknowledge who you really are and ask Allah to remain steadfast this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave [Music] foreign"
