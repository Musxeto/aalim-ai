  "title": "He gets a bad interpretation of his good dream, is it bound to come true? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I heard I heard the interpretation of a good dream we get comes true so we shouldn't tell about our dreams to anyone my question is if someone make a mistake and said his good dream to someone and get a bad interpretation is the interpretation bound to come true or it can be changed by Allah if the person make Dua no it is not going to to come true with the grace of Allah because the interpretation of the Hadith is an issue of dispute among Scholars whoever sees a good dream uh um he should not tell it except to those who love him because the interpretation would coincide with the of Allah this is mainly so in most occasions like 95% you will not tell your good dreams except to those who love you and in these 95% those who love you will interpret it in a good way and in these 95% they interpret it in a good way it will coincide with the Divine decree of Allah and it will happen as they've interpreted it the five% who chose to go against the norm and in interpreted it in a bad way this will not happen as Allah decreed it before because it's not according to what Allah has decreed and Allah Knows Best"
