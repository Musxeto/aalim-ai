  "transcript": "um sister warfare is a question and quite an interesting question um she says she hears on many of the islamic channels when and when a sheikh is given a talk or speaking to the audience somebody rings in a female and says sheik i love you for the sake of allah she says this kind of saying from a woman to a man who is not a mahram is this in an authentic hadith whenever some of you one of you loves his brother he should notify him so the sunnah is if a person loves someone else he would tell him that he loves him for the sake of allah now this rule is general but you have to look at the pros and cons in the sense that if it is from the same gender there's no problem if a man tells another one that he loves him for the sake of allah and the love for the sake of allah means that i love this person because he's a pious person because he performs prayers in the masjid because he is kind to others he is kind to his parents he connects to the to his kin kinship and so on he gives charity he fast voluntary days he's a good practicing muslim that is why i love him for the sake of allah but if i love him because he's rich and i'm hoping that he gives me something or because he's influential and he may help me in government offices or so then this is not for the sake of allah so if it's from the same gender man to man woman to a woman there's no problem in that because there's no fear of any temptation that may take place but when it is from a man to a woman or vice versa then this is not permissible simply because if you call a sheikh being a sheikh does not mean he's not human anymore he is still human and he is still it is a big possibility that he may be tempted so when a woman caller calls in and she says to the sheikh i love you for the sake of allah no matter what maybe the chances are very slim and the sheikh being supposedly a pious and a practicing muslim would not be affected but no one knows what goes into our hearts therefore this should not be permitted it should be eliminated and going direct to the question to the subject is far greater and more important than showing your affection or your love for the sheikh and i i personally think that this is not permissible can it be said in a wider context can somebody say we love you for the sake of allah is that clear is that better in that terms if they want to say it or again there are so many other men who can say this to the ship he does not need you to specify specifically say this to him and sometimes the caller's voice might be soft and shaytan is is always present"
