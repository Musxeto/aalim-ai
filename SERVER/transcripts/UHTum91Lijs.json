  "transcript": "foreign oh of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and now it is official our prophet has reached medina and now he is safe and sound he can practice his religion freely he can preach to people he can teach them he can sit and talk with them without feeling afraid of being oppressed or intimidated because of his own beliefs the prophet alaihis salatu salam as you may recall stayed for two weeks in bani ahmednauf where he built the mosque of and then he went to medina and as he was passing by the houses of the people of medina he was invited to come in and allah ordered him not to go until the camel stops at the designated house and so his camel did stop at the house of abu ayoub ansari people would have thought that after 13 years of being oppressed after 13 years of being persecuted and attacked that it is time for the prophet to rest and that was not the case immediately the prophet sallam started by building the masjid of qurba where people had the chance to perform prayer in security and freedom never practiced before the prophet allah immediately conducted meeting after meeting in the house of abu yuba ansari to know the tribes of medina to get in touch with them and to try to formulate this first capital of islam for the nation of the muslim the prophet salallahu sallam sent his companion zaideb naharitha and abu warah to medina with two camels and five hundred dirhams to bring those whom he left behind such as the family of abu bakr abdullah ibn abi bakker and his wife and aisha may allah be pleased with them all he also sent them to bring his own daughters fatima and um and his second wife after khadijah sauda bint zuma he also sent them to bring us and his mother um ayman once they all came back then the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was faced with this community he had to rule and govern so it would be the nucleus for the islamic state our messenger salallahu salem was faced with a problem this problem was that the muhajirin those who migrated al-muhajirin came without any financial resources as they have as they were forced to leave their properties and their belongings behind while at ansar the people of medina who accepted and hosted the companions with the prophet and that is why they're called al-ansar had all the finance around because they were farmers traders and they had things going for them the prophet salallahu faced with this situation got a number of generous proposals from the ansar some of them said take what you want from our money or prophet of allah take what you want from our property share all of it we can care less this is all for the sake of allah the prophet sallam did not want to be unfair to them and at the same time he did not want to be to deprive al-muhajirin from a well-being life so he came up with the idea that each one of al muhajirin must be a brother to a particular man from al-assad so he divided al-muhajirin and gave everyone from the ansar his share so this man is the brother of that man and they all went together they become became real brothers to the extent that if one of them died the other inherited him and they lived in the same house and they gave them everything in order for them to live normally i remember one story that was so beautiful it was beyond imagination sad told him that he is now to be the brother of abdul rahman ibn haf and to those who don't know abdul rahman ibn awf abdul rahman alf was a young muslim from a very noble family yet he was a wealthy man and he was a merchant when he was living in mecca when he migrated he had to leave everything behind all of his fortune was one of the most wealthiest men in medina from the ansar when he knew that abdulrahman is his brother he came to him and said o brother in islam sad is proposing it's not the other way around sad is the wealthy man and he is proposing to this poor immigrant who just came usually it's the other way around it is us the poor who seek the rich for some aid and assistance and told him you're my brother all the people of medina know that i am among the richest with them so this is my money take half of it 50 take it it's yours and medina also knows that i have two fine wives look at them and choose whomever you like i'll divorce her she becomes your wife imagine such generosity imagine such belief in islam and accepting the instructions of the prophet on the spot without any hesitation he did not hide anything he could have easily said i'll give you a hundred i'll give you a thousand he told him give get half of what i own it's yours half of it and even someone some of us would find it easy to give away money but to reach the level that the true love of your life your wives you do not tell him which one you love more you simply tell him to choose whomever you see fit for you and i'll divorce her for you even if she's my love of my life just to show you that i am willing to sacrifice my whole life for the pleasure of allah no one would ever believe this level of generosity and if you reverse this let us look at what abraham did if i were in abdul rahman al's shoes i would have definitely taken half of the money well the women maybe not but if it's free then why not and they're one of the finest among the people of medina abdul rahman abrahaf was a true real muslim that would not harm his brother and would not cause any trouble for him he was a proud muslim he had the dignity and he had the trust in allah and he also knew his capabilities he told adam may allah bless your money and bless your wives leave them but i seek one favor of you show me where the market is and this was a slogan to all those who seek the blessing of allah azza in trade show me where the market is so they told him the market is there he went to the market and only a few days passed and he came to the prophet salallahu with money in his hand he wasn't a magician and he wasn't a liar and he would not ever cheat muslims but he was a good merchant he used to buy from people on credit and then go to the others and sell them with a small percentage and pay the others and he kept on doing this the prophet saw him once with the trace of wealth when people dye their clothings in a certain color this means that they've reached a level of of of of uh wealth so the prophet told him what what happened he told him i got married but masha allah okay what did you give the woman as a dowry he told him i gave her this much of gold this much very little maybe a 10 or 20 grams of gold so the prophet sallam was furious with him he said subhan allah do you dig gold from the mountain is it easy for you just to go to the mountain and take gold from it it's not that easy this was a lot you paid a lot of money because in islam the a muslim when getting married should not exaggerate and the doubt is they pay and then the prophet sallam told him then if this is the case if you got married then you should sacrifice even one sheep and this is the tradition and sunnah in islam whenever a person gets married he should gather the people to feed and to celebrate his marriage with him and that would be by either slaughtering the sheep or depending on the welfare and the finance available at that time we have a short break and inshallah we'll be right back if you're 18 or if you're 80 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people that are muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at huda.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you running the affairs of medina he managed to settle the muhajirin with the ansar he brought each one of the hajrin and gave him a brother of his own from the ansar which meant that the strongest thing between these two different groups was the religion as we can see in the sacrificing of the ansar for the mahjong of makkah so what's your message for the neighbor countries that receiving the the immigrants from sudan like philistine or the nowadays iraq the message is crystal clear the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam teachings to us where that all the muslims should be strong tight and together as if they are a building structured by brick by brick if you remove some of the bricks the whole building would collapse the muslims must be together as a one unit there's a hadith where the prophet sallam gives us an example of the muslims in their getting together and cooperating he is telling us it is exactly like a person's body if one part of the body is ill the whole body suffers with ache with sleepliness and with fever so it is indeed a great role to those who were fortunate and blessed by allah azza to have the financial resources but it is indeed a responsibility if they do not pay the price they will be punished on the day of judgment for not doing their responsibility towards their brothers and sisters who are who were forced to migrate to them this is understandable when we see the lack of support our brothers in palestine receive are receiving from the other muslims the people in palestine are starving to death the people in iraq are starving to death the people in afghanistan are starving to death the people in chechnya there are no people in chechnya anymore because of the oppression and the racist attacks against our brother uh muslim brothers over there and all the muslim nation are sinful at the side of allah azza if they do not take the proper measures to support their brothers we are all sinful at the side of allah when we look at the case in medina we would find that this was not the case the prophet alaihis associated with them together each muhajir from the hajjarian had a brother from al-ansar yet there were still poor people who could not support themselves and these these poor people were ranging from 50 to 100 and they used to be called these poor men had only one place to go to and that was the masjid of medina the companions of the prophet allah started to live in medina but to those who do not know medina medina has a very strange climate to it whoever comes to medina from out of it usually falls sick and this is exactly what happened to abu bakr it happened to bilal it happened to all the companions of the prophet salallahu to the extent that the prophet salallahu said a beautiful hadith and this hadith translates to that no one is patient and accepting the difficult weather of medina anyone who does this allah azzawajal will make me intercede for him on the day of judgment and be witness to him so if you go to medina and you find this hardship because of the weather because of the climate because of the change of the the location if you are patient and you take this with a good heart the prophet sallam will intercede for you he'll be a shafir and he will be a witness for you and whoever the prophet says assam abandons medina looking forward to something else because it is not like medina the prophet said allah that allah will bring someone who is much and far better than he is in medina which means that the prophet salallahu is inviting us to live if we can in medina and he's threatening those who want to leave not to leave and one of the characteristics of makkah and medina is does anybody know mecca is not taught as medina it's not what no it's not this characteristics there is something religiously about mecca and medina that are more important than any other country or city in the world at the end of time the prophet tells us that the child can't enter to this two cities that the antichrist that the jail the imposter christ is not the antichrist actually the imposter christ will not be able to enter medina or makkah and the reward of dying in medina is also great not to be buried in madina a lot of the people ignorant people think that if they die in anywhere else in jeddah or in any other city and then they ask their family to bury them in medina that is a great reward no it's not it has nothing to do on the contrary it makes life difficult for your family if you die you are buried wherever you diet but if you die in medina then there is a certain reward for that now the prophet saws saw what hardship his companions were facing with the change of weather he ordered or actually he prayed to allah azza to take this fever and hardship from medina and throw it to the village of jorfa which is the meerkat for the people coming from the north of arabia and coming from the west of arabia such as africa and so on and so this was the case once you look at the companions in medina you will find that the only bondage that kept him together was above all islam it was the religion that kept them all together and that is why you find incidents where a father may attack his son because of islam and this was the case with abu bakr trying to kill one of his sons in battle because the sun was with the pagans was trying to escape his father but his father stood in front of him and wanted to kill him and abu ubaidah had to fight his father who was a pagan attacking and fighting the muslims also killed him he had to kill them this is one of the narrations that was reported he had to kill him because otherwise he would have killed him and killed other muslims this is not natural it is because you have islam within you and the only thing that prevails is islam in another incident also abu hudaifah evan one of the great companions of islam his father was one of the greatest enemies of islam when he died in the battle of badr abu hadifa watched the muslims dragging his father and throwing him in a well and he did not move or do anything simply because he knew that his father was an enemy of the prophet alaihis allah and of islam also abu haziz the brother of musa ibn ramir in the battle of badr musa passed by his brother who was being handcuffed by one of the muslims and instead of musa telling his brother in islam take care of good care of him make it easy on him on the contrary must have said tighten it up because he has a very rich mother that will pay a great ransom that the muslims would benefit from the brother was astonished so you are my brother from my father and mother you're my flesh and blood you're saying this muslim told him brother this man who is tying you up is more precious to me at the side of allah than you so he is really my own brother more than you are the things that prevailed at the time was love among muslims the prophet sallam preached love in the sense that everyone studies islam nowadays from the orientals say islam preaches hatred islam preaches terrorism and this is not the case it's black and white the here is the quran here is the sunnah read it and you will find the answers to all of your problems the prophet salallahu preached love he told the muslims it is unlawful for you to not to talk for three consecutive days you may talk for less than not talk for less than three days but more than three days you are sinful and allah will not look at you why is that because it's human nature may we may have our differences and we make quarrel but this may not exceed three days other than that it would be a sin also if you look at the generosity and love for the other muslims gets a caravan of 1 000 camels with oil flour food on it the merchants of medina come to him and say we would like to buy it he said well i've been offered more than that this they five times pay him the amount and he still says that i have been paid more i've been paid by allah azza more than ten times of it and i bear you witness that the thousand camel with everything on it is for the muslims and the poor ones among them i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time mm-hmm"
