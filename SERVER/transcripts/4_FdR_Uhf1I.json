  "transcript": "peace welcome to the dean show i'm here to your host thank you for tuning in my next guest sheikh hasan bill look man el hakeem graduated from the prestigious um el cora university in mecca he's been the local imam for the past 22 years in juddah where the sheikh delivers weekly friday sermons and lectures on various islamic sciences sheikh asam hakeem also participates regularly both on radio and television programs to spread the authentic teachings of the quran and the sunnah he's here with us on the dean show today assalamualaikum for having me with a simple correction when you said since 22 years this brought so many good memories uh unfortunately it's 35 years now so it shows the total of time on us you gotta up the update the bio there yeah i should that should yeah so 35 years you have a lot of experience you're also the host of one of the most popular q and a sessions out there helping people uh and educate them uh on some of the basic fundamentals of the dean and i just can't uh forget uh the first time i think we met was in um for uh the peace tv and mumbai do you remember that yeah sure sure i do yeah that was the last one wasn't it no it wasn't no we just in 2014 in dubai in the peace conference as well we met earlier in 2009 i think or 10 in uh mumbai for peace conference but then 2014 in dubai the last peace conference there tell me i cannot uh recollect which lecture with this was you know when you meet someone or you listen to something from them and then it sticks in your mind there's every time i associate you with this one lecture and it hits home and you talk about if you can just remind me it's a lecture where you're talking about something about how everybody has someone closest to them that somehow they're being tested through like someone who's appointed just like and then you related to the prophet saw some that do you remember this specific lecture you were talking about you've given so many yeah i'm too old to to remember eddie come on yeah i'm not as young as you i can barely remember what i had for lunch yesterday and was it through a tube or was it normal food i'm too senile but the way the way you put it together that you know i'm not doing it justice but something along the lines that there'll be an enemy closest to you you can be on the path of doing the righteousness of conveying the message or whatnot and it could be your closest family members somebody some means it's always it's just inevitable this is a known fact each and every one of us is tested on in this life and this test varies some of us are tested with wealth so billionaires shouldn't be happy because this is a test and seldomly you'll find someone who passes this test others are tested by poverty and those who are sick of being poor again this is a test so health is a test uh sickness is a test power is a test being the underdog is a test this is what life is all about the allah who created death and life liable to test you so this is a test now if it is an easy test it wouldn't be a test so someone says sheikh allah has given me abusive parents they're so rude and they're so disconsiderate and they're so bad when they deal with us their children so how can i be steadfast i'm trying my level best but i'm not succeeding if allah gave you a mother who's a sweetheart and a father that is providing for you buying your cars and giving you money unconditionally and not ever asking you to carry a bag of groceries with him and then you come and say alhamdulillah i'm beautiful where is your test the test is when you are tested so the closer a person to you is the harder the betrayal is the harder the test is so always be on your guard never enslave yourself to wealth never enslave yourself to spouses or children or close friends be a slave of allah azzawajal love everybody to the best of your ability be considerate be compassionate but always never let your guard down because you never know when the test is going to come subhanallah that's so true so that would answer the question for the atheist who says now if there is a god then why is there so much evil in the world you kind of answered it because this life is a test well for atheists we feel sorry for them and they have our condolences because they unfortunately have missed the whole thing and they know it deep inside so we don't usually go out of our way to convince them there's no need to yeah if you just tell me how can this be created i'm fine with that allah says in the quran have they been created via vacuum of out of nothing nothing created them or were they the creators of themselves of course vacuum creates nothing so definitely they were not created by nothing if you were to bring a junk of metals and put it in your room and lock your room for a thousand years or a a hundred thousand years it would not come out to be a porsche 911s turbo it needs a manufacturer so there is nothing as evaluate evolution or something that created itself or evolved no this is baloney have we created ourselves definitely iraq not we can't even create look look at this eye of mine so perfect not because it's mine so yeah that might add some uh value to it and i is so perfect so precise yet no power on earth can create a similar eye that it's in this socket that is protected by this the the skull itself structure how many eyes are there on earth at the moment almost 16 million eyes except what's in the wombs of women that is under the making tell me how many eyes are there of animals how many eyes are there of birds how many eyes are there of fish how many eyes are there of insects who created all of this oh it's it's evolution it's nature it's uh anything but god so with all due respect atheists i'm not gonna waste my time talking to them because if they fail to see the sun and they brought light then they have something wrong with their heads do you see a lot of the questions that you get more and more revolving somewhat around this you know where they talk about some some muslims not going to university and having a crisis of faith are you getting more of these types of questions from people who are not well grounded in the dean or some maybe who are but then they go to university and now the professor you know philosophy for us or he puts on the board no god here and then he gets struck by this and his faith gets challenged are you seeing this more well with grace of allah azzawajal i would say that this is point zero zero zero one of the questions that i get those who approach me eddie they know me they've been with me for the past like 21 years since i started in in the media in the social media alhamdulillah so they know my track record they come for a solution that they believe would fit the quran the sunnah they're not from a different sect or a cult let alone to be atheists however i do get few questions from parents who suffer from their children so they say chef can you sit with my child for a little while i said yeah sure so alhamdulillah usually takes between five to 15 minutes max to talk and communicate with kids with boys with girls and it is so easy to get them back into islam with the grace of allah you don't have to be a rocket scientist all what you have to do is to know your religion to know how to speak to people not over um superficial issues rather go deep into the hakida and this is where our mistake is when we think that apide is only technicalities what did the murtazila say what did the ashari say what did the jamia say and neglecting what our quran and our sunnah said once we learn it as it is displayed in the quran and know who allah is the almighty then we've got it made so now the questions that you get what are some of the main ones you also do the the counseling so what would you say are the top priority of things now that are affecting us for this day and generation the things that you're seeing answering so many of these questions that are coming to you on the forefront uh the the counseling is different see the counseling is usually divided between match counseling so this is a problem between two spouses one of them wants a solution once an eye-opener or both of them having problems with one another or one wants to divorce or one wants to get married and usually they come to me as a sheikh as someone they trust in religion alhamdulillah and due to the age and experience i have because if i were not on your live show i would have shown you my high heel traces on my head due to being married to two pre in a previous life for more than 25 years together so as a man with two wives for this long or quarter of a century you get to know women and you know get to know how they think so they come to me for an eye opener because i'm not a psychiatrist i'm not a shrink i'm just there to help them in accordance with the quran to tell them what's right and what's wrong some of them come to vent i don't take their preventing the session is half an hour they may speak for five minutes only and i do the rest of speaking because i can see exactly what suffering from has given no you're wrong as a man you're a wimp you're not a real man you should have done this you should have done that as a woman you have all the right to stand up for yourself and ask for divorce or do this or as a woman you should fear allah because you'll be cursed on the day of judgment of the things you do now other part of the counseling session is and and this like 35 to 40 percent is about people who have ocd so you get people ocd-ish when it comes to purity they perform wudu in half an hour they spend an hour taking total basal they wash the toilet like six times a day more than they pray why do you do this since we feel we think we believe doubts that overwhelm them from shaytan then you go to the higher level or the lower depending how you look at it where these wizwas and whispers are about shirk about kufur so sheikh i was putting my uh um earbuds in my ear and i smiled is that kufur i said what the heck what do you mean by kufur said yeah because i remember that the prophet when he made wudu he used to wipe his ears so i smiled he said this is not related this is not kufur this is utter stupidity you should see a psychiatrist a muslim psychiatrist so i get to sit with people who think that okay did i commit kufur did i exit the fold of islam did i do this did i do that by opening their eyes and telling them listen this is how shaytan messes up with your head through two ways either you're inclined to partying all night long and drinking booze and womenizing so he doesn't care about your whispers indeed he opens venues and sins or you're in so meticulous about things related to islam so keen on pursuing what gets you closer to allah so he exaggerates things and makes you go to extreme a grain of sand he makes it in your head as big as a mountain so you think everything is making you uh doomed and uh bound to hell this is my job is to open their eyes the rest of the questions i get are the usual questions about halal food music and pre-mixing sometimes consultation of what to do i have a best friend who's not talking to me i have a best friend who mocks the dean or religion i have this i have that and things related to transactions to selling and buying riba um and the likes uh you mentioned uh the term uh psychologist psychiatrist uh a couple times what is it when you see this where is the the line where you mentioned seeing a muslim psychologist so what's the line there within the deen within islam with psychology and islam obviously psychologists study study of human behavior and whatnot but have you seen sometimes when there's a conflict there you know when you have secular psychology and then you have the teachings of dean do you see how is the fine what's the what's the in your experience the fine line there where you have you seen some contradictions there because some we've seen some growing thing here uh that people now are seeing that some people as this is almost sometimes they'll take the advice from the psychologist over the the dean well unfortunately this is happening in so many places now psychology is a science there's no doubt in that but who had ever said that every science is infallible nobody now if you analyze what the science [Music] is upon you'll fees that theories that are totally irrelevant and wrong so a muslim psychiatrist when he analyzes a problem he knows when this is closer to being schizophrenia where a person is bipolar or not and such a person being bipolar would swing with both swings is this something that justifies him doing things and then we can say oh the poor thing he's bipolar he's exempted is did he reach the level of insanity where when he does something he's not accountable like the thing that happens in the west so many times so a murderer may uh skip punishment because of his psychiatric evaluation and this is not the case in islam a muslim psychiatrist is a person who balances this science with our islamic beliefs because unlike other religions islam is the only religion that came up with a law with the sharia that is valid till the end of time so we have a law from the quran that governs our relationship man to man our relationship man to allah and the rest of the world so if someone kills someone we have to know because insanity is a level where we can abstain from uh inflicting the prescribed punishment for uh the predetermined murder and manslaughter so this is why a muslim psychiatrist is needed we have to know when to give medication lots of the modern psychiatrists would just put you on prozac oh you have depression go ahead take uh um medical uh marijuana everybody's uh going for that nowadays especially in your country the state so i get lots of questions sheriff i'd like to do part you know and it's medical reason not to get high what is this yes this is permissible in very very very very limited cases but now with psychiatrists with doctors who don't know islam would prescribe it for everybody so yes a muslim psychiatrist is the right one to strike the balance and to know what is uh applicable what is not sometimes spiritual healing is in in in need instead of getting medication all what you need is to learn who allah is is to learn why he created you and to trust him a lot of our problems are solved if we manage to trust allah dealing now with uh many couples also with your therapy sessions are you seeing the divorce rate increasing decreasing and what are some of the causes if if so the majority of the cases alhamdulillah are decreasing when someone intervenes someone with knowledge not me of course but if an elder in the family sits with them and this concept is mentioned in the quran that when there is a conflict between the spouses send an arbitrator from his family and from hers so they both come and sit together and delegate and talk about the problem and come up with um solutions that may be accepted accepted by both parties this is best see islam does not promote divorce and this is why verse 34 chapter 4 in the quran allah gives a sequence and this sequence may not be preferred by so many people because they think of okay how is it possible for a man to beat his woman and he's not beating him with a baseball bat allah says those who are disobedient and rebellious among your wives you have to advise them so for a whole month or two i'm reminding her of allah i'm telling her this is not good for the family come on honey this is not right you have to do this according to the law of allah i have no problem do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whimsy desires if the woman says i want to follow sharia good for you that's look what shariah says and we follow it this is what we how we solve conflicts there's a conflict between me and you eddie you say right i say left so what to do we can't but one we can't fight it off so we bring someone to arbitrate the person who arbitrates comes to us and say do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires as muslims immediately you say sharia there's no doubt in that then he displays what the shariah says and if i was wrong i will say i adhere [Music] if i'm not a real muslim i would say no let's go to the civil court let's go to a shaman who would say something in my favor rather than yours then this indicates that i'm not a true real genuine muslim in marriages the same thing happens so if the man is the oppressor i say to him desires if he says well it depends what shariah says i said case is closed because you don't want islam if both of them want islam alhamdulillah we reach a settlement and a conclusion that is acceptable to both and most of these cases alhamdulillah end up in this way uh you mentioned a term that some might not be familiar with you mentioned sharia i just wanted to point out is it true i mean i've had i guess not before who are arabic speaking like yourself that in the arabic bible you have sharia mentioned over 200 times moses peace be upon him who we love and revere is one of the mightiest messengers he also brought the ten commandments would this be considered shariah definitely allah says to all of these nations we have given ishariah and a methodology away so yes the uh judaism has a sharia it has the ten commandments it has laws of its own but these laws are not applicable to all times and this is why all the previous religions had a time limit and this time limit was over when the following religion came until islam when islam came it was declared on day one that this is the final religion the final revelation from allah azzawajal that there's nothing else going to uh come after it that's why it's the perfect reigning sharia law the reigning religion for the past 15 centuries the only scripture the only book anyone any religion can come up and say listen this is my scripture not a single letter has been changed over the past 15 centuries and the language is spoken by more than 400 million uh living beings at the moment so it's not an archaic language or something that we need translators for are you familiar with uh an actor narrator he's pretty well known his name is uh morgan freeman yeah he's well known yes uh he traveled around uh many parts of the world you know and one part uh where he actually got a chance to listen to the adhan to visit the masjid i want you to go ahead and have a look at this this is actually in egypt and then uh give me your thoughts your reaction to this i've decided to return to cairo to try and understand who god is to muslims islam believes in the same god as jews and christians but i want to know if there are differences in how they think about the divine historian of islam ahmad ragab has brought me to the al hussein mosque and you can just come in here just like the catholic church so it's always open to prayer yeah if you want to come in here and you can hang out with uh yourself and allah yeah absolutely i'm just in time to hear what muslims believe is one of the most beautiful sounds in the world the call to prayer allah [Music] for the faithful the song of the musin is a manifestation of god himself so that's the end of the prayer is by saying assalamu alaikum much like you in you end an encounter with anybody and it is because the prayer is essentially a meeting with god election like hey you know see you later nice talk see you the next time that's in egypt no so what do you what do you think morgan freeman if we all i mean we can end up dying tomorrow before him we don't know when our death date departure date is but if uh if we just go by years he's uh closer than than most of us right so now he's got to hear some of the teachings of islam if we if we have to send a message to morgan freeman and then uh maybe if he was to visit your area of the world maybe he can come also visit with you and uh in his next documentary series well first of all yani we wish and hope for all humans to accept islam regardless of their position of the rank of their fame now uh having said that morgan freeman i think was doing this documentary for a purpose and he wasn't doing it for him own self so he has a script and he's following the script if they were to take him to a hindu temple he would have said what was in the script like what's his name this uh i have a certain skills uh that i will know how to get you and i don't know how to kill you uh lithium linum uh when he was in turkey yes some something like that so he they praised that he was so impressed with azan and later on he was yeah i mean it's part of the job so we wish that they all come to islam we wish that they come and ask us and debate us and ask us what what islam is i i don't like this in your religion no problem i'll clarify it to you they have so many scholars or diaries or students of knowledge around them they can get in touch with but they don't because this is their lifestyle if you read the sunnah the prophet sent to hercules or to the emperor of the byzantines a message the prophet as i've sent him a message when this ruler this emperor read the message said he is on the right path and if i were next to him i would have taken his shoes and washed his feet and drank the water of that so people asked him okay are you accepting islam said no no no i was just testing the people the prophet said that is islam he did not want to waste his empire so he knew that accepting islam means losing all the wealth losing all the power losing losing his empire so he decided to keep that over that thing is done most celebrities are like this who wants to let go of all the wealth and fame for claiming that oh islam is beautiful you have to submit your will you're not able to do this so unfortunately but yeah sure thing anyone who wants to come and talk to me or let alone i wouldn't say talk to me talk to someone who's more knowledgeable talk to scholars talk to someone who you may benefit from but if they want to come and talk to this poor slave of allah i'm always there and just a phone call away let's go back to this now this is historical people can go reference this check it up heracles now so this is this was a ruler at that time so he's exposed to islam he's exposed to the last and final messenger sent to mankind prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him who often says brother to jesus moses abraham know all the preceding messengers he didn't come with anything different he came with the same message worship the one and only creator that heavens and earth the creator not his creation and he's exposed to it so he's saying you know he's testing the waters now and he sees that this is the truth he said what'd he say he said if i was with him i'd wash his feet and drink the water hold on hold on this is really deep for people who admire historical figures like alexander the great and you know uh they watch many of these movies uh braveheart and many of these people out there you know some are even fictional but now heracl this is a real this is not someone from the movies no no the guy uh gathered all of his priests and monks and head of church and ordered his guards to lock the door and he recited to them the stories and he recited to them some of the verses um uh isa peace be upon him jesus christ and his mother and his miraculous birth and the priests and monks started crying until their beards were were wet christians these are christians crying now because they're hearing the quran they are hearing the quran and miraculous heracles is setting up this meeting now now so after that after he saw them being so emotionally moved by the truth of the quran he said to them so what do you think should we follow him so he just was testing the water in a in a positive way they immediately overturned because their love of power and love of wealth kicked in she said and they started rebelling against him no we will not do this and so much chaos and shouting and disturbance and he knew this this is why he locked the door from the inside so he said no no no no calm down calm down i was just testing your iman if you're real believers or not and everything went back to normal so when this reached the prophet alaihi salatu salam he said in arabic oh this wretched person he was favoring his wealth and power over islam that's why he would not give it up wow this was unlike unlike the reaction of the persian leader who torn the letter of the prophet and rejected even to reply to him because hercules gave the the messenger became a gift and a concubine and some jewelry back to the prophet as a form of honorary respect he gave he showed some respect yeah level to the level shake of he said i want people to imagine this he said if i was with him i would wash his feet and drink that water yes out of because all christians know of the one that prophet isa prophet jesus peace be upon him gave the glad tidings of his coming and they knew that there was someone coming to fix the world and jesus christ said this in the bible and he said that he'll come after me he will speak not from his own self but he would speak from uh um yeah i'm not a biblical historian so i i'm not at night either so you you go ahead and check it out can you get him on the phone real quick i wish i wish i seriously i can't but not at the moment so um you find evidences that are beyond doubt that they knew there was some someone coming and we know who this someone is and we can see it through his track record just open your eyes what do people hate about islam there are those who have in it in uh uh enmity against islam like some european countries without naming them even when the european council came yesterday with an ad showing a woman without hijab half picture and a woman with hijab half picture to show the integrity the uh how uh cultures blend in europe because muslims are a great portion of of uh the population europe it's an ad a woman with no hijab and a woman with hijab they blend them in so half of the girl is without and half is with what happened this european country came up front and said no this is totally unacceptable we object because this denies the christian and the jewish heritage of europe they have hatred to hijab anything that respects women they have a problem with if a woman comes out with a bikini or wearing a thumb good for you that's the thing that's what we like to see they have no fear no bashfulness no shyness they hate islam full stop so you wear a beard cut it you wear hijab take it off when corona came people started wearing the mask they they were shocked what can we do they're wearing nikab legally they couldn't do anything about it but when it's out of your conviction out of your belief out of your religion no we have a problem so these are great examples for morgan freeman or whoever else doesn't matter the message is open for every everyone uh now you mentioned the persian king you struck an example a contrast here when he and this also now look if someone wants to see if the quran is from the crate of the heavens and earth they want to take a scientific analytical approach they will see that this is indeed from the crate the proof is overwhelming but then you see these small details that are there that are just you know mind-blowing like this example that you were going to give with the persian king there was a prediction in there you can say something that was going to happen and can you go ahead and talk about this when those messengers came and then the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him what did he predict or say something that's going to happen in the future that they didn't even know until like what a month's journey or several weeks journey when the messengers came and they told the prophet and he told the prophet it was one messenger and he told the prophet that this is what the persian emperor did he torn your letter unlike what happened with the christians who honored it and sent with the gift what was in the letter what what was the letter about for people that don't know what's in the letter the letter was simply stating that peace be upon those who follow the guidance of allah come to islam and you will be rewarded for yourself and for all those who follow you and if you do not accept islam the message of allah which is to believe in monetism which to believe that the prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah then you shall be punished for your sins and the sins of those who follow you so it's a call to islam it's an invitation with sent with an and a messenger so he out of arrogance out of pride he tore it up and sent the messenger back when the messenger came back to the prophet saw and told him the prophet said two words he said may allah tear his kingdom and on that particular day which the muslims came to know a month or so later when the news came on that particular night this emperor was killed and he had no male offspring so his daughter took his position in leading the country which led it to go downhill and we all know how they were conquered by the muslims wow subhanallah so you have this what is historically documented you have heracles you have him like you are bringing to our attention that he put all the christians together they got to hear some of the quran they're crying weeping uh they recognize this as the truth but they didn't accept because their power like now what are you going to do you're going to just live for prestige power you're going to live for just the things of this world are you going to accept the truth but with the truth there come sometimes consequences right people rebelling like they were going to do against him but then you have other examples you know uh you gave this example the persian but then there was also others christians who also accepted like the christian king of abyssinia so this is another example of a christian can you talk about who now he also was someone who was just who was fair someone who later did he accept islam well this was way way back in the beginning in the early times of islam the letters to the najaf to the uh to the persian emperor to the emperor of bahrain which is in the eastern part of of saudi arabia uh the emperor of um the byzantines the king of coptics of egypt and to the abyssinian ruler these were on the ninth year of hijrah which is uh 22 years after the revelation started that was about two years before the death of the prophet islam if i'm not mistaken so it's almost when people came to accept islam et cetera this is when it was sent and it might have been let me recollect no no i was wrong i was wrong sorry i apologize um you don't have to edit this but this just to show how poor i am and how mistakes i make this was way back because when it came to the abyssinian emperor abu sufyan was at the time of the truce between the muslims and the this the mushrikeen and this was before the conquest of mecca so this was before between year six and year eight of hijrah this is when it took place now the abyssinian king you're talking about his name was she he was christian at the time he was christian but this incident took place 12 13 years ago meaning that when the muslims were prosecuted in mecca before they migrated to medina they were so finding it difficult to live to the extent that the prophet has told them listen allah has made way out for you you may migrate to abyssinia which means that you have to get on boats cross the red sea go to a foreign land with a different language and nowadays if you're a uh frequently flyer and you have uh access to different airlines and hotels no problem you can just come send me an invitation to kuala lumpur and i'll come within eight to ten hours that time it was like the difference between life and death for for bedouins to go on ships and cross the sea not knowing how to swim to a foreign land whoa so they went there now the thing is that the prophet told them go there because there is a king people would not be oppressed under his reign and that is one mind-blowing fact because for a a man who was illiterate who did not read and they didn't have any fox news or cnn at the time yet he knew who the rulers of countries around him and how they dealt with their people this shows you that the amount of knowledge the prophet had i successful about what was going on so he said to them go to him so they went and they asked permission to live in his country and the the najashi the abyssinian king allowed them to after some time the idol worshippers of quraysh of the enemies of islam did not like this so they sent two men to try to persuade the king to send them back these men one of them was may allah be pleased with him who was a kafir at the time they went with lots of gifts so they gave all the close ones to the king particular gifts watches jewelries golden pens money so they bought the court of the king and then they went to the king and said to him we have a problem with our locals who came to you their renegades and they say bad things about our gods and idols so we would like you to send them back with us we will deal with them all those around the king says yeah yeah they know their people send them back with them we don't need strangers and definitely we're not going to build a wall like trump's fault so send them back so he said no they came and chose my hospitality and country how can i return them back i would not do this yes so the following day they went to the king and said ask them what they say about jesus because they say something that is extremely wild and inappropriate being a christian he said okay i have to hear what he they say about him so he gathered them their spokesman was so he was the spokesman who came in and gave his speech and he said i will read you verses from al-quran and he read the verses from the quran portraying the miraculous birth of jesus christ and what had happened with his mother by the time he ended reciting the quran tears was filling up the face of najashi and even his monks and priests and he said to them is nothing more than what they have recited jesus is when yeah jesus christ this is when the monks and priests started to become angry because it says that jesus had no father and there was no male intervention rather it was the archangel gibril who planted his soul in the womb of mother mary they did not like this and the abyssinian cave was unlike the hercules he and he told them do whatever you want you are free to worship allah wow so this is a great you know because a lot of times people they get kind of a superficial understanding about islam morgan freeman now these are the kind of stories i mean you have so much uh isn't there a verse in the quran the verbatim word of god almighty that allah is talking about that when there is amongst them those who when they hear the truth you know they shed tears so now you have an example of the christians during the time of miraculous and now another abyssinian king here who later accepted islam you have them shedding tears they're hearing the truth and now morgan freeman or anybody else can be liam neeson again it's interesting about liam neeson that there was uh when he came back because you mentioned this he was uh in the first part of his stay in turkey he was annoyed with the dan and then you know how the story goes it's an older story but then he started he said it was something like it was penetrating his soul and there was even talk you'd watch him on some of these talk shows talking about you know he was like kind of pumped up but then he got hit with the backlash from community and that's now your test are you going to submit to what he and she says you know the community or stardom or are you going to actually go down that path and accept the truth so these are great stories for morgan freeman and others to really take a deep dive and look into islam so what would you say to someone like morgan freeman uh someone who now they think that just this is just another religion there's some good in there just like other religions and whatnot but you have clear passages in the quran where god almighty i mean if you look at this quran this book there's no way that it can come from anyone else there's not contradiction upon contradiction you know there's not different versions of the quran it's not you know a court a collection of books from anonymous authors this is from the creator who created you me and the whole universe and everything in it and he's saying that whoever chooses a way of life other than complete and total submission to him and him alone to the creator of the universe never will that way of life be accepted so what would you if you had to sit down now he's traveling morgan freeman he comes to your part of the world jeddah he's doing his documentary and now you're talking with them what what would you what are the kind of things how would you invite him to this beautiful way of life of islam usually i follow a very easy way of thinking very simple not a rocket scientist as if rocket science is the best and no i'm not someone who's uh sophisticated i'm an easy going person i'm easy like friday morning so um i wouldn't go into complicated stuff philosophical stuff i don't know this stuff alhamdulillah i know black and white i'm a logical person so i would say to him listen you believe in the existence of one creator most likely he said definitely okay this one creator would it be wise to create all this perfection in this life in this world and leave them astray without showing them what is right and what's wrong you wouldn't expect a apple to produce a device so magnificent so sleek so nice and not tell people whether it's a phone or a tv set or a microwave they would have to show them how it works uh um operation manual etc so allah azzawajal definitely would show us how to worship him what to do and what is expected from us said logical but all religions do this okay excellent number one are all religions right at the side of allah said uh maybe no no no it can be if they are all right they mean that they all share the same values do they shame that share the same same values no no no this religion goes right this religion goes left this religion does not even exist on earth so definitely the truth beside allah is one so which one which religion this is the acid test you have to do to each religion come to christianity scrutinize it look into it deeply to see if it is the accepted religion to god at the moment do you have an original scripture of the new testament of the injil no we have a translation of a translation of a translation you have the original manuscript no does anybody know the original manuscript and how no do you have one virgin no we have hundreds the catholics have the douay virgin the protestants have the king james version we have the new standard virgin we have the red dot uh virgin or letter thousands of copies okay go to other religions hindus buddhism do they share the perfection the authenticity the sustainability of all religions uh like islam or not you will come to the conclusion that okay with all religions ratings i will rate islam to have the highest eighty percent let's assume eighty percent not a hundred percent is there anything close to it no the second close is like thirty or forty five okay so why are you accepting islam oh because it's eighty if it's 80 the 80 which is right and correct and authentic should overwhelm the 20 that are doubtful in your head though i guarantee you that the future and the science will prove the other 20 that you're not being able to buy it's very easy way of communicating but people who are rigid people who say no no no no i believe that jesus freed my life that jesus cured my perilous paralysis that jesus did this jesus came to me like one american president said jesus came to him god came to him and told him to invade other countries and they said oops sorry i did it again it was it was a mistake there were no weapons of mass destruction okay sorry for the million kills tough luck next time subhanallah so uh yeah these are a lot a lot of things you know just uh simple facts it's not some hocus-pocus stuff that people throw at you and you got to put your like intelligence on hold uh when you were mentioning we were mentioning all these christians uh and then scholars you know people of intellect you had so many people who were enemies opponents of the truth but later they became lovers of the truth they accepted the truth i mean this is you know when people study the life you know from the authentic sources when they study the life you know the history of prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him not through the opponents of islam you have another christian you have another scholar uh who also if you can just touch upon this this was somebody now who was a scholar of that time who know who knew all the other you know what they had or the remnants of the truth of you know of the of the torah what they had of you know the teachings of jesus so at that time whatever he had he studied it and then when he saw prophet muhammad what did he recognize him as an impostor or as indeed that anticipated prophet who was supposed to be sent the last and final seal of the prophets he immediately accepted him and he said to him but if i wear a young when your people would kick you out prophet said everyone came with the same religion no one came with the same religion that you came up with except he would face enmity of his people but eddie with all due respect when you bring all these stories if i were in their shoes i would say that okay this is history it might be right it might be wrong i could find uh maybe one in a million who was a muslim devout muslim who rejected islam so does this no it's not the way the way is that allah gave you the intellect allah gave you a brain to think of and to analyze things off you have to do your due diligence come and sit and think is this the system that manages the whole world without problems or conflict is this the law that ensures justice to all regardless of color and he is a man of color how did the muslims deal with blacks who were among the most uh prominent of the companions of the prophet they were black and the prophet stated this 15 centuries ago there is no privilege for a white over a black [Music] we have a few more minutes shake uh we lost you there are you there can you hear us can you hear me yeah yeah i can hear you how powerful is this just leaving him morgan freeman liam neeson whoever is out there you know from the average uh persian blue-collar worker who's tuning in and they like what they have what we were talking about you know how powerful this is yeah can you hear me hello we lost you there a little bit i see we i okay i hear you now okay do you hear me good good yeah yeah yeah so what i was saying was how powerful yet it's so simple talking about you know this pure monotheism and directing people because sometimes when you ask someone i've had experience asking you know the person who's in his uh late 70s 80s have you ever thought about the purpose of life have you ever asked the creator life for guidance so i've interviewed so many people over the years and when they did this simple yet profound thing of asking the creator for guidance alone because the devil shaitan makes things confusing oh so many religions they're all the same this that and the other and so it makes it so complicated but then you know how powerful is this to leave morgan freeman or just the average layman to now ask ask for the guidance from the one who created you whoever asks allah azzawajal wholeheartedly allah will guide him i guarantee you this so i don't ask people to come to islam i just ask them to ask allah almighty to guide their heart to the straight path if they're sincere in that they will be guided imagine what was the dua the supplication that our prophet allah used to open his night prayer and night prayer is something that people offer as a voluntary act it's not part of the five pillars of islam it's something that is a bit higher it's a bonus so people wake up at 3 00 a.m an hour or two before the break of dawn when everybody's asleep nobody's awake so the prophet used to wake up and his supplication would the three greatest angels of allah after you praise allah with all of these beautiful praises you ask so you say guide me to what righteousness and truth people have disagreed upon what does that show you it shows you that even the prophet of allah is begging allah all the almighty every single night to guide him to whatever truth people have differed upon because if allah doesn't guide you you're lost you're astray and the moment you think of yourself that oh i'm strong i'm king i'm the the champion i'm the owner of everything look at all the celebrities the poor things 50 years ago who were the first page uh um articles all the time always on the first page their pictures their events they're they were so beautiful so handsome so strong where is all of that down the drain 50 years later another one bites the dust then what is going on don't you think that there is a life after death shouldn't you at least know what's the means of transportation the accommodation what's awaiting me is it a suite a royal suite or is it a room in a dungeon i have to figure it out now the problem the biggest problem is that such people not only celebrities the vast majority of the population they are enslaved to their desires so when you come to one and say okay come to islam well i cannot jeopardize my red wine of 1982 that was a good year with a big piece of uh pork chops i i can't i can't play with that and your religion prohibits it is this all what life is about you're willing but if your cardiologist say you have high level of cholesterol you have to stop this or you're going to die next week you got to stop it then you're on it yeah you have a problem think about what awaits you and look for the right way out whether it's islam or any other religion i'm fine with that but i i bet you halal betting from one side not from yours that if you ask allah for guidance you will be guided and this is what the creator is saying all my slaves are misguided unless i guide them so ask me of my guidance is not the creator this is hadith very authentic yes subhanallah so leave us with something shay what else uh what do you leave us with for again morgan freeman liam anybody out there the average muslim what advice do you leave us before we conclude if i conclude it by anything they will say oh the sheikh is envious because he was not awarded any part in our movies if you give me trillions of dollars i would not ever think of participating in this life i've done that i've been there alhamdulillah and i know everything about this life that allah has blessed me not to be in i would urge you it's not your wealth that we're after it's not your uh blue eyes or your mansions or your fame it's for your own good look into what may save you on the day of judgment don't put blind folders so that you don't see don't be like a race horse that has these folders on the side of his head so that he doesn't look right and left and only moves forward because this is not how it is seek allah for guidance and open your mind to the truth and the truth shall guide you with the grace of allah for the person just one more question who's never heard this term allah now that they think allah there's a moon god what are you talking about allah you know i call on god god okay i have a series on my youtube channel which is called the beautiful names of allah and i explained 102 names authentic names of allah the almighty that he called himself in and the greatest name of all is allah which all other names direct to so when you say who is allah you don't say the most beneficial the most merciful no when someone asks what is the most beneficial the most merciful you say allah what is the almighty you say allah what is the generous you say allah all names relate to allah who is allah he is the creator of the heavens and the earth he's the creator of the universe there was allah and nothing was with him imagine there was a point of time though time is a creation of allah allah was there and nothing was with him allah is the creator of this universe and the whole universe is nothing compared to allah except when you compare a ring to tossed in a desert so allah is the name of the only worthy of being worshipped they call him god they call him uh [Applause] other names but this is the name of allah that he accepted for himself mentioned in other scriptures those who study but this is the name that he acknowledged himself to be called in islam don't uh arabic speaking jews and christians also call upon god by the name allah correct they do and even before islam they used to have names like abdullah so the father of the prophet salam who was not a muslim his name was abdullah the servant of allah so this is the god that jesus he called upon by allah and this is the god that people jesus called people to worship not himself but they this is the one that jesus worshiped also correct correct thank you thank you for being with us again uh here on the dean show inshallah we don't let too many years go by again before we uh have another nice session like this inshallah for having an apologize for the internet connection but you guys are like five six thousand miles away you should come closer to saudi inshallah thank you may allah bless you salaam"
