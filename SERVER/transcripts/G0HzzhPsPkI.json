  "title": "Is it permissible to download or use copyrighted software or books? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh  my question is uh with regards to downloading softwares and then books that are normally sold but e-copies are actually can be downloaded online and for softwares that can be downloaded online it's what is it Halal to use this softwares or books if these books or software are copyrighted and you know that the owners of it would not approve of it then this is not permissible for you to download because it's similar to stealing if these are like in PDF files and it's a book that you may read in a library or read elsewhere and you're not sure and the possibility is that it can be an open source and you're not using it to make money rather it's for your own reading like when we read newspapers and when we read certain material found on the internet inshallah this is permissible because it's found I did not hack the system I did not Forge or violated any copyright is there in front of me and I'm not making money out of it so it's like reading it from a library and Allah Knows Best"
