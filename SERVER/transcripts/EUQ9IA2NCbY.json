  "title": "Free Mixing, Attending Free Mixed Gatherings - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "like in so many Muslim countries unfortunately it is free mixing so the men and the women they're all in one Hall each one of them is wearing the best of attire and clothes the the men are wearing their three-piece suits or the TSK Ito's and the women are you know full-fledged a make up in it this is totally Haram whether it's a wedding or it's Aarti epi' or it's a gathering or it's homecoming or it's a school reunion all of this is Haram in Islam because when you see such things in front of you if you claim that you don't have any desire for the opposite gender either you're gay or you have a problem with your hormones and the third option is you're a blatant liar so this is natural it's human nature that we are attracted to the opposite sex this is how Allah created us and this is why Allah governed the relationship between men and women he didn't say go to your temples or to your houses of worship or to your churches and never ever interact no you want to interact you can marry you can interact with your mom your sister your daughter your mother your aunt but to interact with non muharram it's putting fuel next to fire and hoping that nothing ignites and this is not possible"
