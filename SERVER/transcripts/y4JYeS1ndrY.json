  "title": "Is it correct to stop eating drinking 5 - 10 minutes before fajr for fasting (Imsak) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in some countries there is a time yani five or ten minutes before fajr time which they say is the time of ismak when the people usually start fasting and stop eating and drinking is it correct what is that first of all it's not called ishmak it's called im sac and imsak means to refrain and they give a buffer zone of 15 minutes before the adana fajr saying that you have to stop eating and drinking this is an innovation there's nothing as such in islam you are entitled and allowed to eat and drink until the time of break of dawn until the then says allahu akbar so there is no point in stopping to eat two minutes or three minutes earlier not only that you can keep on eating even and you can keep on drinking even if you hold the glass in your hand so as i'm holding the glass in my hand and that is cold i can still drink drink and sip from it because the hadith says do not put it down until you're satisfied from it if that is called and this some scholars say is exclusively for drinking while holding the glass in your hand not rushing to the kitchen and opening the fridge and taking it out while that is coming that is not the case and allah knows best"
