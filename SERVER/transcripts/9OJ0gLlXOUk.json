  "transcript": "asaf from bangladesh a man divorced his wife in a written document so most likely he went to the court and issued a divorce certificate and he did not tell his wife for a year and a half and they were separated now he wants to go back to her can they marry first of all issues of divorce cannot be answered generally because i have to sit with the individual i have to listen to his wife to verify what he has said but what i'm saying is not a fatwa for him to grab onto and say well sheikh said so and so because i did not hear it from him i'm just giving a piece of information just to add knowledge and value to the listeners and the viewers not to answer this specific question divorce is three top three times one two you can reconcile after them providing that the waiting period known as is not over and we have to go into details to talk about the red and the duration of it but this is not the time so if one divorces his wife during the three monthly cycles he reconciles with her their man and wife again one divorced down two to go he divorced her for the second time the same thing if he says the third divorce this is final he cannot reconcile they cannot remarry again until she marries a different man a real marriage for the sake of the marriage and they consummate the marriage and after they get divorced he may marry her again secondly civil divorce if the man says i divorce my wife not in an islamic center not directly to his wife rather for legal issues as long as he says i divorce my wife and he signs the documents that proves that he willingly divorced his wife then this is a binding divorce even if he says i didn't intend it but you said it verbally and the prophet said alaihis salatu the majority of scholars say that this is an authentic hadith three issues when you say them seriously or jokingly it takes place marriage divorce and reconciliation so even if someone is drinking coffee with his wife in the afternoon they're joking they love one another he gives her red rose and she tells him that my friend's husband divorced her and she fell more and more in love after he divorced her though they were in love so the husband says oh is that the case i divorce you and they laugh divorce takes place i was joking i just wanted to show her that i would love her more and more like her friend's husband did divorce took place one down two to go thirdly if the man did the divorce at court or in islamic center his wife's or ex-wife's knowledge is not impacting the validity of the divorce so if someone is overseas and he's on his own in his room and he determines to divorce his wife so he says verbally in a loud voice that he hears it my wife is divorced and he doesn't tell anyone after three monthly cycles his wife is not his wife anymore and she they're separated if he were to tell her after one year she has no waiting period nor da because it's already expired she can immediately marry someone else no problem in that therefore such issues must be solved with a scholar with a share with the mufti where he hears from you and can give you the um the answer according to the data you provide him with and allah knows best you"
