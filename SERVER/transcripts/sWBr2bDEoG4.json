  "transcript": "from the philippines he says that it takes him half an hour to urinate and then to perform wudu afterwards half an hour he too much and this is an indication that you have a problem this is an ocd problem people have been urinating since the time of adam peace be upon him so for hundreds hundreds of thousands of years they've been praying without any problem yet you find this problem particularly with the muslims why because this is how shaytaan messes up with their heads with their minds the disbelievers have no problem in urinating and just leaving because if anything drips if they get urine on their clothes so what they don't have any problem in defecating and not washing or not wiping properly because the issue of impurities are not related to their life to the religion it's only a question of hygiene for the muslims it's a different ballgame altogether because their prayer depends on their purity so this is how shaytan infiltrates our thinking and this is what i do in counseling sessions and i get like 80 of my counseling sessions talking to people with ocd and just simply explaining to me and it is easy the vast majority of them have already already been cured of it so all what you have to know is knowledge erases all types of ocds and doubts and this is what shaytan doesn't want you to learn if you learn the basics of purity in the books of fir you'll be saved and if you watch the series we have on youtube which is totally free on my channel and you go through the chapter that deals with purity and how to cleanse yourself from urine and from impurities you will maybe have 90 of your doubts gone down the drain because it's an issue of principles once you apply them legal maxims once you acknowledge them and learn them then you will not have a problem with that insha allah"
