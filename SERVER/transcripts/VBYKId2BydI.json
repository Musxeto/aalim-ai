  "transcript": "if we do W and then wear socks immediately what is the ruling I have read that a traveler can keep doing M that is wiping on the socks for 3 days but what if we are at home and do this due to cold weather I hope my question is clearly understood the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam gave us the off option of wiping over the socks or the shoes when performing wo instead of washing the feet and the verse of the Quran inah is recited in either or so if it [Music] is this is wiping and if it is this is washing anded Allah have mercy on his soul said that I reported more than 40 Hadith of the companions of the prophet wasam in wiping over the socks so I have nothing to worry about in my heart I believe that wiping over the socks is part of my religion and that is why some of the scholars me mentioned the issue of wiing over the socks not only in their books of of Juris Prudence but also in the books of because there are sets of in Islam that do not believe in wiping over the socks such as the Shia for example therefore it is part of Islam but how to do it and what is the time format of it the prophet allowed us to wipe over the the socks or the shoes if we are residing for a day and a night a whole 24 hours and the wiing extends to 24 hours but not not the actual wearing of the socks or not the actual maintaining of a wood so if a person offers W performs wo and wears his socks after and with the same now he did not wipe huh this was Saturday and he did not wipe over his socks yet he prayed and with the same and then he went and answered the call of Nature and went to bed and SLE slept when he walked uh when he woke up in the second morning which is Sunday he performed buo and wiped over his shoes now wiping over the shoe or the socks started on Sunday though he wore his socks on Saturday so the 24 hours starts from F of Sunday so he can mify his W on then perform W and white and does this on Isa and wife Monday morning before F he woke up he performed he wiped over his socks and then he played fuder of course now by fuder time it has completed 24 hours so he cannot wipe anymore but this does not mean that his W is nullified because if he wiped Monday morning or before on his so and he kept his W by praying since he wore the socks and he's still residing he wore it for 3 days and three nights but he only be white for a whole day and a whole night which is 24 hours now a traveler is more the prophet told us that a traveler can keep on his socks for 3 days and and three nights wiping so imagine how long that would be it would probably mean that he can keep on his socks for almost four days and nights depending on when he started to Wi over the the the sock and when he actually uh finished the 7 I hope this answers your question if you are residing in your town you are you are are allowed to keep on your socks performing wo wipe over them for 24 hours the wiping begins and it ends within the 24 hours period however this is only applicable if you answer the call of nature but if you engage in something that requires Ral or mandatory bath and in this can answers your question"
