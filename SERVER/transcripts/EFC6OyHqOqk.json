  "transcript": "aasif says nowadays these birthdays are prevailing and they're taking place over and over with our relatives with the children of the cousins and brothers and sisters and in-laws so what to do okay again the same answer you have to hold your grounds is it something that Islam allows was it something that the Prophet did are they so some of the Companions or the tambourine or the tabi tabi een if the seller of our ummah did not do it and it is not something that is known from our tradition and customs rather it is known from their tradition and this is why we use their cake their candles and their song as well in Arabic sand hello egg amel in the same tone same melody this is taken from them all the way therefore you have to draw the line because if you don't eventually your children would demand having birthdays themselves why is my cousin having a birthday and you're attending and today is my birthday you're not throwing a party but having said that you have to compensate the children if the children want to go and you prevent them you have to give them an alternative take them to the fun fairs take them to the corniche to the beach that give them a day out give them some quality time if you can afford that so that they would feel that there's a balance but if we and unfortunately we all do this if we are good in prohibiting things Haram Haram Haram its imitating it is not part of our Islam it's an innovation but we fail to give alternatives then we're actually pushing our children to go to the other side which is something we don't want and may Allah protect us all"
