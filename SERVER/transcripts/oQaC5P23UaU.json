  "transcript": "Miriam says is it true that when you look at the Kaaba for the first time and you make duaa it will be accepted by Allah this is not authentic again looking at the Kaaba is something beautiful to tell you the truth I'd go to the harem and maybe spend five ten minutes just looking at the Kaaba and enjoying its majestic view but is it a form of worship as there is no a lot of the worshipers by the way when they pray instead of looking down at the position of prostration they look straight up at the Kaaba thinking that this is a form of worship and this is totally wrong and against the Sunnah so looking at the Kaaba by itself is not a form of worship when you look at it and make duaa does not guarantee your dua would be answered but it is something beautiful surreal it brings you tranquility to see this view in front of you there's no problem that but do not associate it with answering your dua like in the subcontinent again and so many other Muslim countries they say that when a pilgrim comes back from pilgrimage from Hajj his dua is answered for forty days where did they get this from I have no idea it does this have any authenticity to it none whatsoever it's totally fabricated so base your belief and conviction not on what share so-and-so say on YouTube or on TV not on what share so-and-so claim or write down but rather base it on Quran and on the Sunnah you"
