  "title": "Can we make tayammum instead of wudu if we're getting late for fajr & time would end assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um I was wondering if uh you can make tum if you're running late for your Salah and making woodoo would make you miss your Salah I was wondering if it's permissible to do that if a person wakes up like a minute Before Sunrise and he estimates that if he makes W he will miss one raak and hence the Salat would be out of the time so he asks is it permissible for me to make t which takes a couple of seconds and I can pray the answer is no this is not permissible you must perform your or your W as it was prescribed for the fear of the time coming out is not a legitimate reason and if you are as I've described someone who walk up late there is no sin on you even if the sun rises or the time expires and Allah Knows Best"
