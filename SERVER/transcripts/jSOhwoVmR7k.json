  "title": "Spotting after taking pills to delay Menses - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sister sends us an email she says I'm going for Umbra so I after consulting a doctor started taking pills to postpone my period and to make a long story short she's consuming these pills but she's still seeing spots of blood and it's not the time for her menses what should she do this is a common mistake that a lot of the women fall into when they try to manipulate when they try to play with their monthly cycle by delaying it taking these pills the deceptive x' or whatever what's the ruling it's hard if it is medically safe this is Hallel but in the majority of cases this has dire consequences on the regularity of their monthly period so before they used to have six to seven days on a fixed time after consuming these pills now they it's irregular and they don't know what it's going to come and it's it's prolonged for more and more so I advise that they should not take this nevertheless we have an ongoing problem what to do if these spottings are colored discharges or a drop or two of blood they has they carry no weight these are impurities when the iodine is called clean yourself perform Woodill and go and pray and come perform your Umrah it does not affect your ROM what effect your harm if the blood is flowing this is your menses even if it comes in times that are not your regular menses regardless what counts is the flow of blood so if you're just having spotting then there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
