  "transcript": "a sister says in India and Pakistan people think it is ok to mix with cousins of opposite gender and they feel we are extreme if we say we shouldn't mix as they're our non moms how should we respond sister this is life you have to deal with it you have to live with it as I've stayed in the earlier earlier in this episode we live in a test Allah is testing us and these tests vary you cannot just expect things to be smooth all the way with your Road in front of you paved with red roses this is not possible there's a oh there are always be ups and downs and this is where you will be scrutinized for your response for your reaction for how you behave all of these will be taken into consideration people will never ever be satisfied with whatever you do if you crack a joke like I sometimes do people start pointing fingers and say oh he's too funny is doing cracking jokes this is inappropriate he's not a true Sheikh and if you serious and you make people cry this is depressing what is this I'd rather go to the graveyard and visit a grave and feel sorry and listening to this no one is going to be happy with you no matter what you do so the best thing to do is to be sincere do whatever you believe that it pleases allah azza wajal and move on now coming back to your question is mixing with the opposite gender who are non-muslims permissible or Haram regardless of what people think this is an Islamic ruling so you need to have a mufti a scholar a student of knowledge looking into the Quran and the Sunnah and tell you yes or no right or wrong no Muslim would say that it is invisible the Prophet himself alayhi salatu salam said do not enter upon women folk so a man stood and said o prophet of allah what about Al Haman what about my brother what about my uncle they are so close to me they're related and I'd like them to mix and enter upon my wife I my brother i thrust my uncle the Prophet Aslam responded in two words only in Arabic al hammo el motive the next of kin your brother your uncle and the likes are exactly like death if you would like death to come to your wife then allow them to mix with your wife crystal-clear you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand Islam promotes segregation between the genders this is safer for them and for us FBI statistics for the year 2015 AHA 95,000 rapes declared officially in the United States of America alone 95 thousand what kind of civilization is this in another report independent sources said the real number of cases of rape in 2015 announced and not announced was four hundred thousand-plus which means approximately a thousand rape cases per day you do the math per second and per per minute a day in the United States of America so when you come and criticize the social system of Islam you guys have to look a little bit in your own backyard how many great cases do we have in Saudi Arabia and Allah so nothing is announced who do you know among the millions living that have been raped there are always black sheeps in the family there can be such crimes but not in proportional to what's happening in the US and elsewhere therefore Islam promotes aggregation between the genders for the betterment and for the benefit for the Society for the community and for the individuals as well therefore you tell them that this is the ruling of Allah Azza WA JAL if they're happy with it at hamdulillah you managed to do that WA if not the who cares who cares oh what I care about is that Allah is pleased with what I do it is a form of worship that I'm doing and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
