  "transcript": "sneha rahman al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen solo la jolla mubarak rd he wore a pseudonym in nabina muhammad in Kuala early he was happy judgment I'm bad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we continue to study the book that deals with fasting from the blessed book off home that will a calm and hadith 183 the hadith of abu hurayra may allah be pleased with him a drama it is related that abu huraira rosalyn who said while we were sitting with the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam a man came to him and said i am doomed the prophet asked him what made you doom or what is it man said i had sexual intercourse with my wife while fasting he said can you find the means to free a slave he said no the prophets lost them said are you able to fast two consecutive months he said no the prophets allah salam said can you find the means to feed 60 poor people he said no the prophets lost them sat silently while we were waiting like this the prophet sallallahu wasallam was brought a big basket of dates he said where is the man when the man stood up the prophet salallahu alayhi salam said feed the poor with this the man said to people poorer than me by Allah there isn't any family in any house between the harrahs more needy than us the prophet sallallahu lism laughed until his teeth were seen he said feed it to your family this hadith we learn from it the expiation of having intimacy with one spouse during the day of Ramadan while fasting and these are all restrictions or guidelines because if someone has intimacy during Ramadan at night this is permissible if you have it with your spouse but during the day it is not and if you have intimacy during the day of Ramadan while you're not fasting if you're traveling for example if you're ill you have the excuse to not fast then again this is permissible and there is no problem in doing that the man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he confessed of being doomed and when the Prophet asked him what did you do and he told him the Prophet did not tell him that no you're not doomed the prophet approved of it meaning that it is a major sin it is so major that the expiation was made so severe and that is the Prophet told Emily salatu salam can you free a slave and he said no I can't so the second level for those who cannot free slaves the Prophet asked him to fast 60 consecutive days to months not 60 consecutive days but two months because the month can be 29 and it can be 30 so if it's 29 this is a whole month and when the man said I cannot and another narration Oh prophet of Allah what made me fall into this except that I cannot fast so he knows of himself that he's unable to fast then the Prophet instructed Emily salatu salam to feed 60 poor people the Prophet instructed him to feed 60 poor people the man raised the white flag saying I cannot feed any soul I am so poor Allah Allah knows help where I am so the Prophet did not speak on a lobster until he was brought up by a basket of dates and this basket carries 15 Tsar so these 15 saw approximately 70 kilograms of dates that's a handful so the Prophet said that is a lot Salem go and give this as Sedaka as expiation to 60 poor people and the man said by Allah there is no one between the harmless and these are the mountains with black volcanic stones and rocks so he said by Allah between the borders of Medina there is no one poorer than me and my family so the Prophet is one laughed until his teeth were shown why why did he laugh he wondered and he was amazed by this man who came frightened claiming to be doomed and now he's going back home with a basket full of dates how hopeful he was when the Prophet said give it to charity said I'm the poorest person around and he was greedy not greedy he was hopeful and wishful and so had a lot of profit was laughing on how people change all of a second from being frightened and afraid of being dumped into looking up and saying now we may get something out after all in this hadith the scholars say that this is the greatest expiation for those who fall into such a sin nevertheless there are a number of lessons to be learned and topics and issues to be discussed among them if a person has sexual intercourse during the day of ramadan is he obliged to make up for that day or not scholars differed the majority say he has to make up for the that day he intentionally broke so he has to make up for that day what about the woman is she also required to pay the same expiration or it's only for one they say because the prophet alayhi salatu salam only instructed the man to free a slave and he did not say also your wife should freak another slave so what is the ruling an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that both of them have to pay the expiation if both of them we're willing but if the wife was forced and she said no fear Allah this is not permissible we're all fasting and he forced her to do it and she continued to resist then she is considered to be one of the three cases we've mentioned you have to if you're forced or if you forget or if you did not know then there is no expiration on you and the fasting is correct one of the issues that scholars also discuss and talk about is what is the ruling if I go home during the day of Ramadan and I feel the urge to be with my wife and then I say to her bring us some food let us eat break our fasting and then do our hanky business what is the ruling on that scholars say that this is a form of tricking allah azzawajal it's the same methodology that the Jews did when Allah prevented them from fishing on the Sabbath so they dug trenches so that the fish would fall on a Friday and then they would catch it on Sunday and this is the tricks that are not permitted in Islam likewise if someone is fasting and he wants to travel for the sake of being intimate with his wife so it tells let's go and travel to somewhere so that I can break my fasting and then we can do what we want to do this is also Haram and they have to give the expiration but if someone is actually traveling and came back to his hometown or to his city at ten o'clock in the morning so he's not obliged to fast is he know that day he is exempted from fasting those is traveling so can he have intimacy with his wife if his wife is a resident and she's fasting definitely not and if she allows him then she has to pay the occasion he doesn't because he's not obliged to fast and some scholars posed the question what is the ruling of a man masturbating during the day of Ramadan while fasting would it be considered the same and would he be forced to pay the same expiration the answer is no this expiration this afara is only for intercourse whether he ejaculates or not the act of intercourse itself mandates it which leads us to something else which is if a person is intimate with his wife but without intercourse and he ejaculates without intercourse is he supposed to give the expiration or not what do you think those who say no raise your hands 13 for those who say yes raise your hands 1 2 3 4 again the question is if a person is kissing and hugging but without intercourse and he ejaculates is he supposed to pay the expiation mentioned in the hadith or not those who say he has to pay the expression raise your hands they also say he does not have to pay the expiration raise your hands I see the hands are fewer yes we've mentioned before only if intercourse takes place he has to pay the expiration but if he ejaculates without intercourse he's sinful and the day is considered to be invalid and he has to make up for that day but there is no expiation the expiration is only when a person has sexual intercourse now if a person does not have money of course you cannot free a slave he cannot fast 60-day if he doesn't have money what's the ruling on that scholars deferred and the most authentic opinion is if he does not have money to expiate then it's gone alonzo gel forgives him and if he gets money after a year or two is he supposed to pay it or not some scholars say he has to others say no the time is gone at the time when he was supposed to pay for the expiration he did not have time and therefore even if he gets money after years he's not obliged to pay it like a poor person if I'm poured for 20 years and then I become rich should I pay the cut for the 20 years that passed no because I did not have money at the time and it goes we have a short break stay tuned inshallah with assalamu alaikum and welcome back we would like to see the questions that some of you may have hammered imma check there are some most of women who miss their fast and we see that there are many of them who couldn't make it up until 2-3 years so what should they do maybe they have their fast spending of maybe 10 years 15 years so what should they do the most authentic opinion is that a person when he misses days of Ramadan for a legitimate reason such as traveling being ill or if it's a sister who has her menses they are allowed to postpone making up for these days until the following Ramadan just before that if they do not make up for these days and the following Lord on is due scholars differed whether to pay an expiation plus fasting the days or only fasting the days some scholars say that because you delayed making up for these days missed in Ramadan until the other Ramadan was do you have to feed a poor person with every day you make up now I'm talking about delaying fasting or making up without a legitimate reason if a person has a legitimate reason then definitely he's not at all requested to do anything the second group of scholars said no there isn't any expiation for skipping Ramadan or two or three even if you don't have a legitimate reason your sinful but you're not obliged to feed any one and this is the most authentic opinion that was the opinion of Sheikh definitely means Allah have mercy on his soul having said that if a person has a legitimate reason then he's not sinful an example a woman got married immediately got pregnant Ramadan was due she is pregnant she did not fast any day because she was afraid on her child she gave birth she started suckling the baby the following Ramadan was due she cannot fast because she needs to circle the child after that she got pregnant again and then she started suckling and pregnant and suckling and I know women like this who used to ask me and she says that for the past 16 years I did not fast a single day of Ramadan because I did not have the chance to do so what to do it's very simple 16 x 30 on average maybe 29 depending on the month that she skipped and she has to make up for all of these four hundred and eighty days now once she is not suckling or breastfeeding she should make up for these days on the way or the fashion that suits your best some of them would decide to fast most of them during winter because the day is too short so it's about in Europe for example it can be eight hours or nine hours so this is beautiful fasting so they would like to make up all these days and winter no problem others would like to fast mondays and thursdays mondays and thursdays throughout the whole year this is also applicable so you have to make up these days but there is no expiration noka fara through a while doing that or while in the process yes brother suppose someone has mr. fasting of Ramadan do traveling so can II fast under arafah in tanjung that for off as well and for that he is mr. the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that whoever fasts the day of arafah allah would expiate allah would forgive the sins of how many years two years and that is why scholars say that if a person intends to make up for a missed day of ramadan in other phone he will have both rewards the day of ramadan and also the two years of expiation for his sins slang damn she is my question is regarding the voluntary fasting for example on the Day of Ashura if after I have fasted on the day of ashura I realized that I had missed fasts in Ramadan and so after fasting on the Day of Ashura can i change my intention and sink that type of fast was an expiation for the fast lost in ramzan anyone who could help me in answering this question please with justification yes sir fessor Nia cannot be done later after the action it cannot be done yes we said that one of the conditions for fasting mandatory fasts is that the NIA the intention precedes the break of dawn so if you intended to fast the day of ashura the break of dawn is at six o'clock and you intend it at six-fifteen to make it a day of ramadan this is not applicable at all so the mandatory fast you have to have the intention before the break of dawn yes slow lucious around as we know that llaman la Ruffa is on 9th of the lucha is not is on 9th of villager ok but now this ninth of Xillia may differ from Saudi Arabia and our country it might be the next day so when should we faster llamo larva as when it is younger fine Saudi Arabia or where is 92 litter in our country you fast the ninth of the ledger in your country regardless when the people will stand on alpha in Saudi Arabia because as you know we as Muslims identify the beginning of the month through sighting of the moon and we've stated before that the sighting of the moon may differ from one country to the other correct so maybe ramadan begins in saturday in Saudi Arabia and India it always begins on Sunday true there's always a day or two difference between us cube this means that Ramadan and Ramadan is different in both countries likewise when we come to the picture it is not because the people are standing in a lava that we fast that particular day it is the ninth of the ledger so if the ledger the ninth of the hedger coincides to a Friday and in Saudi it coincides to a Thursday then you have to fast in according to the sighting of the moon in accordance to the lunar month in your country regardless of Saudi Arabia and regardless of the day of arafah yes brother Shaikh is there anything prescribed from Sunnah what should we take her in sufu regarding the menu yes no there isn't anything in regards of the menu of the sort you could have seafood you could have steaks you could have rice you could have whatever you wish the menu of futur breaking the fast is yes the prophet used to break is fast on dates and a salatu salam draw dates that is Rotem if not then the dried dates if not then sips of water as for the suhoor you can eat whatever you wish providing it is halal of course and a large dojin knows best yes sir I wanna come tram shake my question is an advocate in the earlier hadith that the time after sahu and the Salah is around 50 vs that is if it is red so buddy another narration it comes that till the azaan if you have a bowl of drink you can complete it and what people do in india is that the eat till the azaan and as the azaan has been given they have a thing ready of drinking both then the drink it during the gun is that till the gun is completed so is it hello the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam said in an authentic hadith which was reported by al-hakim in hempstead rock and elsewhere whenever any of you holds a glass of water or container that contains liquids juice water whatever and then is called he is permitted to drink of it until he's satisfied now this is different than when i hear that I than I rush to the kitchen and open the fridge and make some juice and put some sugar and some and then start drinking this is not the case the case is if I'm already holding the glass and it calls food are done in this case the Prophet tells us drink as much as you wish no problem of that so I hope this answers your question check we learned about sue but can you just put some light on the issue that there are some people who recite many duas before the sewer or many duas related to the intention can you just put some light on that to say verbally the intention is Abaddon we went through that when we studied the chapter dealing with prayer you do not say I intend to fast tomorrow which is saturday the 15th of so-and-so from break of dawn till sunset this is an innovation do i if related to say  also it's an innovation but if it's doing because it is the last third of the night and after a while it's going to call for fire and it's a blessed time there is no problem but you have to know the intention if it's only in Ramadan that I do this then this is not permissible I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
