  "transcript": "uh I live in the United States and I recently learned that if a girl's father passes away only her paternal Uncle can be W for her Nika and not her maternal uncles when I married my wife two years ago her father had already passed away and only her uh maternal uncles were in United States and all her paternal uncles were in Bangladesh uh due to Visa issues they couldn't come over so we did our nikah in Islamic Center and uh no one said anything about Uncle so N I know about this like do we have to redo our nikah or is our like nah valid of course your uh nikah is not valid and unfortunately most such Islamic centers may be following the hanfi school of thought which out of the crowd gives the right to the woman to marry herself while the prophet himself said there is no marriage valid without the consent and approval of the guardian and two trustworthy male Witnesses and this is the opinion of the majority of the schools of thought including the students of Abu hanifah may Allah have mercy on his soul nevertheless those who are blind followers of this of this school of thought they they ignore the hadiths and the opinions and the verses of the Quran even that state that such marriages must be done through the W through the guardian and the maternal uncles can never be Guardians even the maternal grandfather cannot be the guardian of the woman so now alhamdulillah because this mistake was done honestly and it's a mistake and it's attributed to the ignorance of such so-called imams of the Islamic centers who usually they're not qualified they're just people who memorize yeah verses of the Quran some suras or maybe the whole Quran but they don't know Arabic they don't have knowledge in F they don't have the proper tools that qualify them to become imams and to give such rulings this can be easily rectified with the grace of Allah call her uh uh paternal uncle in Bangladesh and most likely and I hope that by now they know you and you know them and just simply renew the contract via Skype or Zoom or whatever convenient platform that is available he says to you I give you my niece fatimaa Khadijah whatever in marriage and you say I accept her marriage in the presence of two uh uh male Witnesses I'm presuming that you don't have sons who are uh uh have reached the age of puberty because in that case they would have been uh your wife's guardian and I'm presuming that your wife does not have any male siblings because then they would have been uh her guardian more than the paternal uncle's uh Authority and Allah Knows Best"
