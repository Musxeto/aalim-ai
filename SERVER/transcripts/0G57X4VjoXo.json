  "title": "Intended to pray witr with 2 tashahhud, forgot,didn't sit after 2 rakahs & stood up what to do Assim",
  "transcript": "i intended to pray with your two raka's with salam and then one rakah with salam but in the second rakah i forgot and i stood up to the third rakah i didn't sit for the teshahud so i got confused should i just combine all three together as if i'm praying three raka witcher with one salam not sitting in the second raqqa or what should i do well actually because you intended it before salat you should immediately sit down from the third rakah going back to the tisha and offer you to shahada and salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi then and then offer two prostrations of forgetfulness then offer salam again because you intended to pray two so if you add one more this one is invalid if you add two more or five more or whatever it is all invalid because your main intention was to pray to and allah azza knows best"
