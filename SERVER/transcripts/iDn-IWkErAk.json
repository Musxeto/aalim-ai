  "transcript": "AA from Gambia asked a very valid question how would a Layman know whether a Hadith is authentic or not well let us expand this a little bit AA how would the Layman know whether the ruling on a particular issue is halal Oram and if we go a little bit further how would the Layman know if this antibiotic is good for his uh sore throat or not well when it comes to Medicine you have to go to the doctor and it when it comes to uh car problems you have to go to the mechanic but when it comes to religion you have to go to a scholar so it is exactly the same thing if you have a problem with religion you have doubts you don't know you must go to the scholar that other Scholars acknowledge his knowledge and know that he is follower of the Quran and the Sunnah and that he is well known to be uh someone like that and you follow him as a Layman you follow follow him blindly because you don't have the means and tools to differentiate whether the Hadith is authentic or not likewise when your doctor says I have to cut your stomach open so that I can uh remove a tumor or something you wouldn't say so show me the procedure I'd like to know I'd like to uh see if it's the right one or the wrong one no you blindly follow him and you just surrender so this is the way of doing it and Allah knows"
