  "transcript": "if you are out of the house for example a restaurant and the time of Salah is about to finish can you wait till you get home and then pray if I understand the question correctly if a person is at a restaurant at M time and is is about to be due this is what I understand that the time for Salah is about to finish to postpone the prayer until you reach home would mean that Isa would be already called for you cannot pray M after is has been called for because you don't have a legitimate reason if this is how I understand it from your question it can also be understood from your question that you're talking about Jama prayer so you're saying that I am at a restaurant and it's time for M but the pray the prayer in congregation is about to be over and I know if I go to the Masjid I'm not going to be able to pray it so can I postpone it until I go back home and this would be half an hour or an hour uh uh before the answer is yes you can though you can because you are excused uh for being in a place where you are eating the prophet told usam that it is best to eat rather than pray so he told us that if it is if dinner is served and the prayer is being being called for then eat your dinner even the has been called for eat your dinner now uh this is uh an excuse a legitimate excuse however if you had already eaten and you're full and you know that if you go to the Masjid the prayer would have been over but you can still pray a second Jama a second congregation this is is uh uh what you should do and Allah Knows Best"
