  "transcript": "well these are one of the things that Allah has prescribed upon females and as we know that if a woman gets her menstruation she is not allowed neither to fast nor to pray so what can she do nothing she must not fast the day of araa okay but she wants the reward she compensates can she fast other days the answer is no because this is a one one shot uh deal throughout the whole year however if she fasts the day of of Ash which is the 10th of muharam and a day before it Allah will forgive her the sins of one year and I pray that if she had the intention to fast arat and she wasn't able to do so due to her excuse due to her period I pray to Allah and I wish that Allah would give her the same reward as those who are fasting because there is an authentic where the Prophet sallallah alai wasallam says that Allah would register for his servant he is ill or traveling Allah will register whatever he used to was well or residing so Allah's Grace Allah's generosity because that you are accustomed on doing something that is good once you for fall ill and you are unable to do this for example night prayers Allah would register you though you are ill every single night pray night prayer why is that because Allah the almighty would not forget the good things that you have done likewise if this sister is intending and is desperate to fast this day yet Allah prescribed that she gets this period at that that particular time well she should not be worried I pray to Allah and I wish to Allah that Allah with his kindness would give her the full reward as if she has fasted and Allah Knows Best"
