  "title": "Is Slavery found nowadays? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "last question was is slavery found nowadays and as it is to my knowledge no nowadays we don't have any slaves that are legitimate or islamically accepted because we know that slavery in Islam can only be channeled through prisoners of wars and those who are born out of slavery but to simply take someone or get someone in captivity or someone sells his daughter or son to you because of poverty or because of a loan this is not legitimate slavery and it's not permissible to do such a thing the Islamic slavery is abolished at the moment until Islam regains its strength and Muslims go back to their honor and dignity and practicing Islam and when we have the strength for that then it can only be under the flag of a Muslim ruler a true Muslim ruler not any Tom Dick or Harry in one of the caves here or there"
