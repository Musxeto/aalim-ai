  "transcript": "she says that there is a wedding and this wedding is mixed with music men and women are gathered there they don't care about hijab they don't care about anything i being a practicing woman she says i wear the nikab i cover my whole body and i attend due to the fact that my father would be angry and would go ballistic as they say if i were not to attend so what to do well the way i see it allah is that there is no obedience to any of allah's creation in disobeying allah allah prohibited us to attend such gatherings if people are offended if relatives are angry there is no problem in that when muawiyah ibn abi sufyan may allah be pleased with a man with his father assumed power and he became amir al-mu'min the ruler of the muslim ummah he wrote a letter to aisha the mother of the believers the wife of the prophet saw he said assalamu alaikum give me an advice and be brief that's it so she said to him i heard the prophet saying whoever looks for allah's pleasure by angering people allah would be pleased with him and would suffice him and whenever a person seeks the people's pleasure by displeasing allah allah azzawajal would put him to himself to take care of himself and allah azza would not take care of him was so this is an advice you have to obey allah regardless of who gets angry or mad with you as long as you're doing it for the sake of allah allah would make everybody happy with you allah"
