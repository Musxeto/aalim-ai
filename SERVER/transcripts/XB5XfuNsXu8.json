  "title": "Should women cover the hair when at home, reciting Quran,dhikr,when going to toilet?Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so lie bus' question was about being told as a girl to cover her hair by a scarf or ash wall because she was told that there are creatures that we cannot see and we must cover ourselves from them when are we our home this is baseless this is totally baseless and none of the companions of the prophet Sam used to do this nor did the Prophet Azzam ever ordered the women to do this if a woman is in her home and she's alone or surrounded by her husband children and muharram then she is not at all obliged to cover herself or to wear a scarf etc she can wear normal clothes that do not expose what must not be exposed to others her husband of course is an exemption because an exception because she can show him he can show her what no one else can see but generally speaking this is totally baseless that she has to cover herself when she is in the vicinity of her home she can wear whatever she wants if she is alone not only that it's also a misconception among people especially in the subcontinent that whenever the event is called they have to cover their hair whenever they eat or recite the Quran or enter the toilet they have to cover their hair some people send me questions saying that it is prohibited to take a shower to take a bath naked and they have to wear clothes or - what is this next time you're gonna tell me I'm gonna wear a three-piece suit in order to have a proper hustle or a proper ritual bath this is nonsense this is baseless there is nothing in Islam that recommends this let alone to mandate it so I hope this answers this question"
