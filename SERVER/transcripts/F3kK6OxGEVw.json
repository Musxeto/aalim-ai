  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim (35) Dhikr before sleeping (3) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign a lot of us may consider these athkar before going to sleep at night to be long and they say even 10 or 20 percent or halfway reading it we fall asleep as long as you're trying your level best to do it practice makes perfect you will inevitably and eventually reach there with the grace of allah azza but you have to try you are helpless without allah's assisting you so this is your life raft in the middle of the ocean if you don't say your car if you don't depend on allah you will be at loss try your level best and insha allah allah would help you part of the atkar that the prophet isaiah used to say before going to bed allah protect me from your punishment on the day your servants are resurrected now the compiler of this booklet said to say it three times and the most authentic opinion is to say it only once as indicated by sheikh al-bani may allah have mercy on his soul so three times is not authentic saying it once before you go to bed is authentic now the following hadith hadith number 105 also when you go to bed you say bismika in your name o allah i live and die again and again and again cementing the concept of depending on allah the almighty emphasizing the fact that we're not here to stay forever we are transiting in this life has a beginning has an end and when it ends we die so we have to work to whatever is after death which is the day of judgment which is eternity which is paradise which we focus on attaining hadith 106 this hadith the prophet said shall i not direct you both to something better than a servant when you go to bed say subhan allah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times allahu akbar 34 times okay what is the origin of this hadith because the prophet said at the end for that is indeed better for you both than a servant what is the origin of this hadith the origin of this hadith that fatima may allah be pleased with her went to the prophet alaih and asked him for domestic help for a servant that would help her in the house shores and she showed him her hands where were that were affected by grinding the seeds and the grains and working in the house the prophet did not respond to her ali saw some rather came to her house at night where she and ali her husband may allah be pleased with them were retiring to bed so he told them that it is best and much better for you to recite this before going to bed subhan allah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times allahu akbar 34 times and he said to them that this would be better for you than a servant sheikh hasn't been tamiya said whoever observes saying this before going to bed allah would grant him the strength throughout the day that would make him not in need physically for such assistance of a servant the dua gives you momentum gives you power and some folks and i know that who don't have iman in their heart who say come on what would vicar do to you this is not logical this is not realistic this is islamic this is conviction this is related to belief in allah at the end of times when the antichrist that the jal would roam the earth in 40 days as told to us by the prophet there will come a time where there will be total drought and famine not a single raindrop would fall and not a single plant would grow so the companions ask the prophet assalam if there is no water there there's no livestock there's no plants how would the people survive so the prophet said to them by saying subhanallah alhamdulillah allahu akbar this vicar gives them energy that would suffice them from eating and drinking and the hadith is in the sahih so those who don't believe would not believe us muslims we take this for granted and we believe in it and this is why we continue to recite and read this hadith throughout before we go to bed having said that people would say is it mandatory it is is it wajib and the answer is no this is not why egypt but if someone were to tell you if you stand in a queue at the end of the raw they will give you ten thousand dollars it takes you five minutes would anyone say is it mandatory is it obligatory or can i skip it you can skip it but everybody would look at you and say this guy is crazy wasting ten thousand dollars just for standing for five minutes in a queue and likewise those who neglect to say this beautiful dikkar are crazy because they're losing so much reward from allah azzawajal this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave allah [Music]"
