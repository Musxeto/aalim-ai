  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to this 7th episode of our islamic classes and today in sha allah we will be talking about the chapter that deals with food animal slaughter and hunting of course these are long topics but we will try to discuss it bit by bit and we will begin with the chapters that deal with food so the basic rule is defined that everything is permissible through the quran and the sunnah so the default is whatever allah has created it is halal and the haram are limited and these rules are very important because it saves us from a lot of confusion when a man came to the prophet salallahu and he asked him what should a mushrim wear now if someone comes and says what is halal to eat that would be too difficult to answer because you would have to list the halal things for you to eat which is very difficult while if you reverse it by limiting the things that are haram which are far less than the things that are that would have been easier so this is what give me a second i forgot to hook the microphone to the mobile that is live on facebook but i think that the voice has reached it and this maybe also gives us input whether i should use the microphone or just leave it without the microphone so again this limits the things that are haram because they are far less than the things that are halal and this is also an indication of how a wise person answers questions not every question is worthy of being answered so when a man came to the prophet islam and said o prophet of allah when is the hour where is the day of judgment the prophet could have given him a particular date if the prophet knew that date but the prophet doesn't know it nobody knows it except allah however the prophet directed the man to what is more useful to him than knowing the timing and the date of the day of judgment so he said what did you prepare for it so the man answered by saying that i haven't prepared a lot of good deeds except that i love the prophet islam i love allah and the prophet alissa so the prophet told him you are with whom you love on the day of judgement so this is more beneficial than to know it is on year so and so month so and so days also likewise what does a muhrim wear so the prophet assam limited what the prophet cannot wear so the prophet indicated that a muhrim should not wear the turbans or whatever takes its ruling so anything that is worn on the head to cover it is not permissible for this is not permissible for the thing i'm wearing underneath is not permissible for a mushroom a baseball cap is not permissible for emo and you can go on the shirts the trousers and the list goes on but there are five of them other than that the sky is the limit you can wear whatever you wish and whatever you want likewise when we come to food allah says in the quran say o muhammad i do not find within that which was revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be dead animal or blood spilled out or the flesh of swine for indeed it is impure or it be that slaughtered in disobedience dedicated to other than allah but whoever is forced by necessity neither desiring it nor transgressing transgressing its limits then indeed your lord is forgiving and merciful allah also says and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibited for them the evil and allah azza also says say who has forbidden the adornment of allah which he has produced for his servants and the good lawful things of provisions say they are for those who believe during this uh the worldly life but exclusively for them on the day of resurrection so from all of these verses we understand that everything is halal allah azza made everything for us to consume and there are limited things that are made haram for us to consume allah says in the quran he has clearly spelled out to you what he has forbidden you to eat unless you are driven to do so by sheer necessity so the spelling out takes three forms allah has explained and spelled it out either it is something that is well known to be hala eating apples or something that is well known to be haram like eating ham and there are things that are in between and these things that are neither or haram these are the things that scholars said that it was not mentioned the prophet says allah has made certain things obligatory so do not neglect these and he has made other things forbidden so do not approach them and he has set certain limits so do not transgress these and he has left things unspecified without forgetting them so do not search after these now this does not mean that things that were not mentioned are by default but the majority of things that are not mentioned and they do not fall under the category of haram they are by default what the hadith means is that we should not keep on investigating things at the time of revelation after the death of the prophet there is nothing wrong in searching and asking and looking but at the time of the prophet saws during his life your question may lead to something halal becoming haram and this is why when the prophet said alaihis and that allah has obligated upon you to perform hajj a man said once in a lifetime or every year so the prophet sallam was not happy with this question and he said leave me as long as i did not mention anything to you about it for if i said every year it would have been made a law and it would been mandatory upon you to be every year so this concept of burdening people due to your question was only applicable at the time of the prophet because it could have been changed into becoming obligatory but after the death of the prophet islam the religion is complete and no one can come and add things to it says the prophet used to leave things that he loved to do for the fear of it becoming mandatory upon his ummah and he did not want to burden his umm you all remember that taraweeh the prophet performed it in congregation with the companions for three or four nights and then he quitted it and when they demanded him offering it he said i was afraid that it would become mandatory upon you and that would be burden to a lot of us so the prophet left it as it is so what is permissible to eat as i said the principle is everything is permissible for you to eat unless proven otherwise from the quran and the sunnah for example number one water animals are those which live only in water everything that lives in water and cannot live without water is halal to eat providing that it is not poisonous or harmful or causes harm to the muslim and fish whales dolphins sharks snakes living in water all of these are halal to eat even if they have a name that they share with haram land animals so sea lion lions are haram on land but sea lion because it lives in the sea this is halal and there's nothing wrong to eat it snakes are haram to consume but when snakes live in water totally then it becomes halal providing is not poisonous and it does not harm us there are some exceptions and this is an issue of dispute whether crocodiles for example because they're amphibious they live both on land and in water so some scholars say if they cannot live outside the water at all they cannot live and exist without water then they take the ruling off sea creatures but if they can live without water they can exist without water then they are land animals like lizards etc and some scholars went to say that animals like crocodiles alligators are haram because they live on land yes they live in water but they also live on land and they share with the prohibited animals the fact that they have teeth and this is a description to animals that feed on meat which we cannot generally speak speaking uh consume and we have a rule that whenever two factors collide one stating that this is halal sea creatures and one stating that it is haram land creatures with teeth that attacks and eats animals other animals and flesh with then we give weight to what prohibits so this is a general rule that is applicable almost to everything whenever there's a conflict between something that permits it and something that prohibits it we always give preference to the thing that prohibits it generally speaking this is always applicable but not all the time there are exceptions with every rule so a lot of them the scholars like um and so on they say that the meat of crocodiles and alligators is haram due to that fact some scholars say that it is halal because it's not mentioned and it cannot live without water it will die if it stays out of water for a long time and personally i am among those who are hesitant to give a clear direction yes eating the meat of it is not permissible due to the ambiguity regarding it but it seems that using its leather after tanning it is halal and allah azzawajal knows best so what about other amphibious animals such as frogs for example well frogs is not an issue of being a sea creature or an amphibious uh creature there is a specific ruling for that because the prophet allah islam prohibited their killing and whatever the prophet alaihis hassan prohibits killing then it becomes haram to eat and consume a man came to the prophet salallahu salaam and he was a doctor so he said the prophet of allah we use frog meat in our medication so the prophet denied him and prohibited him from killing frogs and in another narration the prophet alaihis salatu said that i don't know what you call the sound of frogs but the sound of the frogs is this be it's praising allah azzawajal it's glorifying allah azzawajal so the prophet prohibited killing it now allah says lawful to you is all water game and whatever food the sea brings forth as a provision for you and for travelers even ambassador please with them said water game refers to what we fish and the food refers to what the sea washes off this means that seafood does not required does not require slaughtering so whatever you fish and you grab you can cook and eat no need to slaughter not only that whatever dead fish you find floating on the water which you did not fish it died by itself or it was eaten by another shark you can consume that as well providing it does not harm you to do so and the hadith well-known hadith that a a group of people came to the prophet and said oh prophet of allah we travel by sea and we carry with us little water if we are to use that water for abolution we will run out of water and become thirsty can we do our evolution with sea water the prophet salla sallam said the sea water is pure and its dead animals are lawful to eat this hadith here in our book it says maybe there is another narration i remember it since very long time that it is narrated by even abbas but it can be two narrations i'm not sure um so the hadith was about water again the prophet islam tells us how a wise man would respond to such questions imagine the prophet did not answer the question about water yet yes you can use sea water to perform evolution but because they traveled at sea so he gave them an extra beneficial information so that if it crossed their mind while they are at sea they would remember that the prophet gave them the uh solution so he said to them and the dead animals are lawful to eat meaning the fish you find floating or on the shores you can use that and eat that so this is the first category of halal food generally speaking which is sea food anything that lives in the sea snails oysters calamari squid all of these are halal to consume and to eat now what about um okay one of the brothers just text me saying that it is hadith it's not even abbas though i recall it from to be even abbas maybe i'm getting old anyhow both of abu huraira and basma allah be pleased with them were great companions so the second type of food that is halal for us are land animals now remember the default is everything that lives on land is halal until proven otherwise so among the things that are halal and we will briefly talk about this because this is logical and then we will speak about the haram food to consume so cattle livestocks these are halal by default whether they're camels cows buffaloes sheep goats you name it it carries the same principle it is halal to consume providing watch out that it is slaughtered and that it is mentioned the lame of allah when doing so and this the person slaughtering must be either a muslim jew or christian now we're talking about domestic animals these conditions are apply if we are hunting a game with the exception that the slaughtering can be dropped if we kill the game by shooting it with bullets with an arrow with something that penetrates it but this is a different issue so allah says in the quran he creates cattle which give you warmth and other benefits and from them you obtain food and allah says lawful for you are the animals of gazing livestock except for that which is recited to you so we can eat that without any problem we can sacrifice that without any problem number two horse meat and a lot of the muslims don't know this because we're not used to eating horse meat horses are so expensive and rare to find that rarely you will find someone sacrificing not sacrificing slaughtering the horse and eating horse meat but in principle it is pleased with a man with his father said on the day of the battle of khaibar the prophet allah prohibited eating the flesh of donkeys and permitted horse meat so domestic donkeys are prohibited but horse meat is halal i think with abu bakr may allah be pleased with iran with this with her father also narrated the hadith stating that a they've slaughtered a horse and ate its meat thirdly something that is quite awkward to the vast majority of muslims and to non-muslims as well which is the desert lizard in arabic we call it bob and it is a big uh lizard that lives only in the desert and it has a very fat meaty tale so this is something that the arabs used to consume and eat that a desert lizard was eaten at the presence of the prophet alaihis allah and the prophet when the food was served was about to eat from it it was meat so the wives of the prophet assam acknowledged that he did not know so they said to the companions tell him what he's about to eat because he does not like it so when they told him it was desert lazard he refrained from eating it so the companion said and asked is it haram and the prophet says no but it is a type of food that my people are not acquainted with they're not familiar with which means that even if the food is halal and you don't desire it you're not used to it there's no problem at all from refraining from eating it such as what such as the locust the locust is permissible to eat we joined the prophet alice islam on six or seven military expeditions and we ate locusts with him so these swarms of locusts in the millions that occupy and destroy the crops and and the farms and the green areas these locusts are totally permissible to be consumed of course they are not slaughtered because they're not animals and to many people they enjoy eating it i personally have not tried it and would definitely not go for it simply because i'm not used to it not that it is haram it was done by the companions may allah be pleased with them and approved by the prophet islam so definitely there's nothing wrong with it but it's a cultural thing so the prophet did not eat the desert lazard and he justified this by not liking it simple as that so if someone serves you some type of food that you don't like there's no problem in refusing it and rejecting it among the things that are permissible to eat are the zebras now the zebras are not donkeys so what's prohibited for muslims to eat is the domestic donkeys and of course mules are also prohibited to eat because they are an example of the rule i've mentioned earlier whenever there are two conflicting rules one permits and one prohibits we give weight to the one that prohibits so as they say i don't know they say that a mule is a result of a domestic donkey mating with a horse and this what results from that i personally don't know i don't have uh enough or sufficient knowledge in zoology geology or whatever they call it and in the animal world but this is what i had read and feel free to correct me if i'm wrong even i remember some folks say that mules don't have offspring but i still don't know how authentic this is so mules because of the mixed parents of it and one of them is a domestic donkey it becomes also haram to consume and allah knows best while zebras being wild donkeys are halal to consume and of course you cannot catch them you usually hunt them but if you were to catch one and you would like to eat it it has to be slaughtered properly among the things that are halal rabbits and all what carries the same ruling among these small animals that eat grass so if you hunt it or if you catch it and slaughter it it is permissible to be eaten and as may allah be pleased with him uh took a rabbit may allah please with him slaughtered it and sent the legs to the prophet allah who accepted it so the prophet h rabbits as well now this is a controversial issue which is the hyena jabber reports i asked the prophet about the hyena and he said it is game meaning that you can hunt and eat if it is haunted by a person when he is in the state of uh okay the haram thing we spoke about that before so this was haunted at the time of the prophet it was consumed by the companions may allah appreciate them at the present of the prophet why is it controversial because usually we think of hyena as being an animal similar to canines similar to lions that are predators that eat a prey and they have teeth so they eat meat but the hadith exempted it and considered it to be a game and therefore it is permissible to eat and to consume poultry includes all types of birds that are not birds that hunt and attack prey so and we will come to the forbidden types of animals to eat inshaallah later on that hawks eagles [Music] and the likes are haram to consume but when we talk about ducks we talk about geese when we talk about uh penguins when we talk about any uh ostriches any type of bird the generally speaking pigeons chicken they're all halal to consume by default and this is might be irrelevant but it is relevant and we spoke about this in the beginning when we talked about purity that the feces the droppings of such birds such animals that we are permitted to eat and their urine is pure which means that if you're walking and a pigeon poops on you the poop is pure you can pray without needing to change of course it's not hygienic people would not would be discussed by it but the principle is can i pray and if i do is my prayer valid or not yes it is valid without a problem and the locusts and we spoke about that before now if we were to speak about what is specifically forbidden to eat that would take us more than the time remaining and maybe we should leave that to the following session on monday so we will take your questions in the remaining time so the first question is from nanuzi proceed if i sleep astray and wake up when sophie surat is late how can i arrange my surats when performing them witter supe and sunnah when it has been my routine so i do not understand though i'm originally indonesian but i don't know a single word except maybe surat surao surao which is masjid i think and this is i learned from malaysia not from indonesia so if i understand nanuzi's question correctly if a person who's used to praying with her and then praying sunnah till fajr then farbel on time happens to sleep and over sleep and wakes up after sunrise what should he do the answer is he should read begin with the sunnah of after that he has the time until before the adhan of three four five hours maybe he has the time to pray or to make up his night prayer his witter so if he's used to praying three raka's when he makes it up he adds he prays turaka then turaka if he used to pray seven lakas he adds an araka so the total is eight he prays two two two and two and so on this is the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu the second question is from aminu abdul rahman he says what of those who have 24 hours sunlight or darkness how do they determine prayer times so abdul amir abdul rahman is asking about people in finland maybe or in the arctic or in uh the north pole where they have sunlight for maybe five six months and total darkness for five six months so how would they pray first of all prayer time is determined by the position of the sun so if there is a distinction during the day between day and night in this case one must follow the prayer times according to the son and we went through that into saying when to determine the break of dawn how to determine the lahore how to determine the asa how to determine sunset uh a maghrib and then after the twilight the red twilight it disappears this is the time of asia the second possibility was which is very rare and and by the way number one is regarding areas where there can be distinguished times between day and night so even if we go to north of england or to some of the scandinavian countries where they have day time reaching 20 or 21 hours and night time reaching four maybe three maybe a little bit less hours a day this is still applicable they have to fast the whole day time they have to pray according to the sun the problem is as amino abdullah is when we have countries that do not see the sun for so long how could they determine when it is no break of dawn and there is no sunset or the opposite when it's all day long the sun rotates over the 24 hours and never sets so how can they pray this is a current situation that was not known to those before us so the the scholars had to dig in the evidences in the quran the sunnah and they found the hadith where the prophet was telling us about the jal or the antichrist and how he will come at the end of time and he will roam the whole earth and he will stay for 40 days one day of these 40 days is as long as a whole year so the sun takes a full year to rise become in the middle of the sky and to set a full year 365 days and one day is equivalent to a month and then one day is equivalent to a week so these are three days minus 40 we have 37 days so the length of the jail staying actually on earth is one year two months two weeks and what else and 37 days yeah that's it one year two months and two weeks two months and a half how did we calculate this 40 days one is a year one is a month one is a week so 37 days take the seven days that makes it a week so we have a month 30 days and we have a month these are two months and we have a week and another week these are two weeks so one year two months and a half this is how long the gel would stay on earth the companions left all of this information because this is something that will happen in the future and they will stand up for him or to him and fight him if he were to come out but this doesn't concern us at the moment the companions were more concerned about salat so they asked the prophet isaiah o prophet of allah the day which is equivalent to a year do we pray the prayer of a day meaning only five prayers so the prophet said as some answer them by saying no you have to estimate meaning a day that requires a full year for the sun to rise and set you have to estimate it so with watches it's very easy to estimate we have ams and pms so we have to pray during the day time five during the period of 24 hours five prayers the following 24 hours five prayers so the prayer of 360 or 365 days is going to be prayed during that long day okay what does this have to do with the question of amino abdullah well the scholar said that from this hadith we understand that when daytime is three months in a row without a single hour of night we as muslims have to estimate the prayer times and how is this done some scholars said that you have to apply the prayer times of mecca which is very far and it is far-fetched because there is no resemblance between makkah and these countries or these regions the second opinion which is the strongest and this is the choice of sheikh min bas ebin the permanent committee of ifta and a number of councils is that these countries these regions must look to the closest adjacent regions to them that have a distinction between day and night so for example in the scandinavian countries when they have daytime constantly if we go a little bit south and find find that for example birmingham or scotland of the uk are the closest countries to them that have day and night then so be it they should follow their prayer times so if they pray at let's say 11 and well actually at maybe one or two assar at five or six marilyn at 9 30 er risha at 12 and fajr at 3 then they should follow these timings though they cannot see the traces by following the sun either because it does not set or because it does not appear and this is the most authentic opinion and allah azza knows best najiba says is it permissible to watch non-muslim chef halal cooking recipes that says yes as long as the program or the show does not have anything haram such as music such as free mixing with women flirting with them or cooking haram recipes such as using wine using ham using haram stuff if all of these are avoided there's no problem in watching such uh cooking programs remiss zacker says what's the ruling on giving the cat of gold is it once in a lifetime or is it for every year for the same gold is no dispute among scholars of islam that the cat is to be paid annually providing that there is the threshold or more that is the nisab of gold or more in your possession no one among the scholars to my knowledge had ever said it is to be paid once in a lifetime this is not hajj to be performed once in a lifetime so whether it's gold whether it's cash whether it is stocks whether it's an investment whether it is livestock whether it is crops that you farm all of these must be given zakat continuously throughout your life and i think that there is uh um someone in india who they claim to be a scholar but he's not definitely who is confusing the muslims by saying that you pay the cat once a year once in a lifetime and this is not true and this person is not known among the scholars to be a scholar and unfortunately with social media now any tom dick or harry can come and claim that he is a scholar or knowledgeable and we don't have any proof to back that up from real scholars of islam and even if he was a real scholar what he is saying goes against all what the scholars of islam say that is the cat is due once every year on your gold until you die mariam says can we wear prop proper without wearing the kaab just wearing hijab so i believe that maryam is asking about covering the face is it a must or not this is an issue of dispute among scholars and whenever there is a dispute among scholars as muslims we should not take the easiest so so many people say alhamdulillah this is an issue of dispute meaning that we can choose whatever we want and this is not true allah says in the quran foreign whenever you dispute over an issue don't go to this scholar or that don't go cherry picking don't choose whatever is easier for you or more convenient for you rather you should refer back to the quran and to the sunnah nowadays with search engines we can easily find some person stating that this or that is halal and this is convenient for us so if i am if i'm a smoker and wherever i go and check and ask they tell me tobacco is haram it's harmful there is tar there's nicotine and it harms your body and i don't like this frankly so i google it i search for it and then i find that there is a scholar somewhere who's a real genuine scholar but he made a ruling and he gave a fatwa stating that it is halal it's strong this does not discredit this scholar because if we look in his work we would find that he has done great job but he is not infallible he makes mistakes and this is one of them now for me as a cherry picker i would highlight the book underline it photocopy it expand enlarge the photocopy and show everybody that chef so and so the great sheikh the great allama the great scholar said it's halal this doesn't work this way this is religion this is deen the egyptians are witty people and they love to joke so one of them used to say about smoking pot smoking grass marijuana hash whatever you want to call it and he was stoned like crazy and he said listen if it's haram we're burning it and if it's halal we're smoking it so the end result is one he is smoking it and if it's haram okay i'm burning it why are you why are you mad i'm destroying it but i'm inhaling not like clinton he did not inhale no he did so this way of cherry picking is haram when we come to the issue of niqab the covering the face we find that there are many evidences commanding a woman to cover her face and there are a handful few evidences stating otherwise so when an objective person looks into these evidences he finds that so many talk about niqab and it being mandatory and obligatory and there are five or six incidents where might insinuate that it is not mandatory anyone would logic say would say that yes the vast majority of the hadiths and the evidences prove that it is mandatory so we would consider the other four or five or six handful of evidences stating otherwise to be either an incident isolated from the general trend or something that was abrogated later on if you look at the quran you will find that allah in chapter 33 orders the mothers of the believers to cover their faces in verse 53 no one argues about this verse and whenever you ask them for utensils ask them from beyond a visor a hijab so all schools of thought say that it is mandatory no difference of opinion that the wives of the prophet of salaam must cover their faces agreed everybody says yup we agree to that okay go six ayah is later on verse 59 and you will find that the prophet is instructed by allah azzawajal to order his wives daughters the women of the believers to draw down their jell-o beep so that they would not be recognized and hence harassed so the reason for drawing down pulling down your jalapene the plural of jilba is that you are not recognized enhanced abused or harassed so this is addressing the wives of the prophet isa if you combine this to the ayah number 53 which we all agree that it is mandating the women of the prophet islam to wear the niqab to to veil their faces so allah is telling them to veil their faces here again so we know their hijab but he's including with them the daughters of the prophet islam and the women of the believers and justifying this by saying so that they would not be recognized and hence harassed and abused and how is a woman recognized by your face so if she covered her face no one no one would dare to harass her or to abuse her and there are so many other evidences that this is not the time to expand upon them therefore it's an issue of dispute yes but the most authentic opinion is that a woman's face is the most beautiful thing in her if a man were to marry a woman the first thing his mother is going to say to him well i should her face is like the moon no mother would start by saying she's like a four foot nine or uh five foot and she is petite she has this body figure so and so on so her hair is so and so so when she has the face of a monkey the first thing that a man looks for is a beautiful face to walk to wake up looking at and to go to sleep looking at so the figure the body the hair all of these are secondary important but the most important thing is the face so if the face was exposed and everybody can see it that would cause a lot of fitness in the world and this was not the case at the time of the prophet sam it should not be the case at our times as well and allah azzawajal knows best ah this is all the time we have until we meet you inshallah next time on monday i leave you for a man cato"
