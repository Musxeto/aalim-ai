  "transcript": "the prophet saysat when Allah created the creation when Allah created the universe and was done with it stood up kinship stood up is kinship a creature of Allah yes it's a creation of Allah asael like death like life so it stood up and said oh Allah this is the standing up the position of someone seeking refuge in you from being SED so Allah Asel said yes wouldn't it please you that I connect those who connect you and civer those who civer you Alim said yes this pleases me Allah said I shall do that and your prayer is answered so the issue between you and your siblings is not rivalry is not something that to be taken lightly it is something that may make you enter Jenna and it may make you enter hell the prophet said the one who Shivers his kinship will never enter J whoa that is scary I pray five times a day I make omra once a year I pay charity I try to do many good things but I have problems with my siblings well you have a problem with jenah nowadays we are seeing so many problems surfacing in our communities problems between the siblings problems that turned into to enmity and hatred they have become real enemies we have case issues court is cases between the siblings do you have it here we have it a lot in where I come from siblings they are filing cases against their own siblings not only that it Cascades to their children so my children must not communicate with their uncle and his might must not communicate with mine and they're total strangers sometimes they live in the same neighborhood they don't talk for 10 20 years and if my son speaks to his cousin I will cut him off and kick him out this is Shan's handiwork the bond of Brotherhood is one of the greatest of Allah's favors upon us to feel the pain of your brother when he's tired when he's suffering to support him to give him the impression that your strength is mine and mine is yours your weakness is mine and my weakness is yours Allah asael says in the Quran and hold firmly to the Rope of Allah alt together and do not become divided and remember the favor of Allah upon you when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together and you became by his favor Brothers Subhan Allah Allah is showing his favor to the companions that they've become brothers and this shows you the strength and the beauty of this Bond so Brotherhood and I'm talking about that between the siblings your Brotherhood with your brother and sister from the same father and mother this is not a list of names found on your ID cardim Muhammad no no no no the Brotherhood is not a list of names it is not leaves in the family tree that we're proud of oh this is my lineage it is not a friendship that I can end and terminate when my friend betrays me or stabs me in the back this Brotherhood is not related to if you visit me I visit you and if you are kind to me I'm kind to you no it's not like that with your brothers and sisters the prophet saysat the one who maintains a relationship with his relatives only because they maintain a relationship with him is not truly upholding the ties of kinship the one who truly upholds those ties is the one who does so even if they break off the relationship the beauty of Brotherhood is when you make your sister or your brother feel their value in your life when you make them feel that you miss them that their issues and worries are your own that when they cry and shed tears the tears come from your own eyes before it comes from theirs the real Brotherhood is when you're brother or sister is inclining and about to fall you're there to help them it's when you are their cane without them asking you to assist them you are siblings brothers and sisters you have been made in the same womb drank from the same milk ate from the same plates lived in the same house have the same Memories the same DNA runs in your veins the blood it's the same it is very important to know the status of your siblings not only for yourself but also for your wife or your spouse and children you have to draw a red line that is not possible to cross because the vast majority of problems between siblings are caused by the spouse and the children and they put fuel to the fire and they say no he did this he did that you should not have remained silent you should respond you should make a stand to it Subhan Allah don't allow anyone to come between you and your siblings and I mean anyone anyone not a wife not a husband not children all can be replaced not your siblings this Dunya Wallah is not worth an hour of boycotting your own siblings one smile one SMS one phone call one message that you give Salam to your brother or to your sister it will demolish and annihilate mountains of hatred and enmity one smile it will fill his spirit with joy and with love for many many days to come you need to make the first step this is where shatan stands firm no after all what he had done to you after all what she said about your wife about your children this is Shan the more you listen to shatan shatan is happy with you and he's pleased with you the bad news is when Satan is happy and pleased who's angry Allah is angry with you one meeting with the familyes it cleanses your heart it relieves you from stress and problems but you have to make the first step"
