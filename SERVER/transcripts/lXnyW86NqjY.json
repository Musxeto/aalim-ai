  "title": "How to wash a thick beard in Wudu? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is regarded regarding washing the beard so this is my beard okay and it's a thick beard hamdulillah when I wash my face the skin under my beard is not going to be washed by water so the Sunnah when you have a thick beard is after washing your face you get water in your palms of your hand and you just insert it inside that's it I don't have to bring the shower and you know spray it or whatever No so our friend asus is asking is it ok if I do this after I wash my feet as I'm leaving the answer is no because there is an order that we must follow and if you miss something and you do not do it what comes afterwards is void so for example if I wash my face then I wipe my head and then I wash my feet and find out that it not wash my my arms so I wash my arms would that be sufficient the answer is no I have to repeat wiping over my head and then washing my feet again why because these are the pillars of Moodle the four pillars washing the face washing the arms wiping over the head washing the feet the fifth pillar is the order I cannot bring one above the other and the sixth pillar is it has to be contagious I don't wash my face and then five minutes later I wash my arms this is not acceptable so I hope this answers your question"
