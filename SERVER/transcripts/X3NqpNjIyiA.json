  "transcript": "um is it permissible to wear a sweatshirt over there and Dubai if it's like loose and thick because it was probably like still sugar shoulders and um do you mean like uh it's Haram if it shows the like exact shape or um it's around the way you feel like Selma let me get this straight are you asking me about the ruling on wearing a sweatshirt underneath your Abaya over sorry come again over over no this is totally prohibited because when you do this you are actually showing the figure of everything that's underneath the reason of wearing the Abaya is that it's oblique it's white it doesn't reveal what's underneath it the size of the shoulders the chest the waist Etc so uh oblique but when a person wears something that's fitting on top of the Abaya as if he's not wearing Abaya what's what's the purpose of wearing that so no this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
