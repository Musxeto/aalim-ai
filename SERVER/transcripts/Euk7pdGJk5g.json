  "title": "Can we recite ayat al kursi & last verses of baqarah in one rakah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from china he says can we read in the first ayah and the first track of fajr ayat al-kursiy and then jump like 30 verses to the end of surah al-baqarah and read or recite the last two verses there's no problem in that now whatsoever there's nothing binding you to recite them in a sequence so you can leave a gap you can jump entire surahs and read other surahs after that"
