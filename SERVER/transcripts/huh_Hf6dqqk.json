  "transcript": "uh so if a rapper or a celebrity is in a collaboration with a brand and they make shoes together uh but if the rapper like broke up with the brand can I buy the shoes that was made in collaboration basically speaking the issue of buying a brand whether it has the name of a rapper or a singer or an actor or an actress or any other thing the issue is what am I buying if it's a shoe if it's a bag if it's something that can be used what's the ruling on buying such a shoe or a bag and using it it's Hal now is it haram to buy a shoe that has the name of an actor or a an openly sinner person because this is what concerns Muslims a rapper a an actor or an actress or the likes the these are people of sin they do sins they go against Islam and they are famous because of their sin So when you buy the shoe most likely you're not buying it because it is something that is good or of an excellent quality or that it can make you run faster or it's more comfortable rather you're buying it for the name so I'm wearing my Jordans we all know what Jordans are so you're buying it because it has the name Jordan if another Chinese company manufactures something more comfortable more uh um practical but without the name Jordan or without the brand Nike it's a Chongqing nobody would buy it even if it's half the price or 10% of the price so the ruling technically it's Hal whether the rapper is still in collaboration with the brand or not but is it advisable the answer is no it is not advisable it's not Haram but why would you associate yourself as a Muslim with such a an open sinner as if you're endorsing his name or his music or the Haram that he presents maybe this is something we should think about"
