  "title": "E codes - How to deal with food containing pork, haram animals derived substances? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the second question is about e codes what is the ruling on using foods that contain pork derived substances and how to deal with them e codes for example well it is a rule of thumb that anything that contains haram ingredients is harambe itself and nowadays with modern production of food canned food and the likes we have a vast array of products that are either ambiguous or confusing and we spend a lot of time on the shelves in supermarkets reading the uh ingredients and what is what does it contain and this may cause a lot of hardship however it is best for a human being to be safe rather to be sorry so if you live in a muslim country like saudi arabia like kuwait for example and you know that the authorities there go out of the way to ensure that everything that comes through their borders is halal i personally when i shop i don't look at the ingredients because i'm confident that it is halal i buy anything and i eat anything it's so legit with the grace of allah if i were to go to europe or to the to the u.s then i would be hesitant to buy things i don't know and hence i would read the ingredients now most of these products have e codes on them e 250 735 etc i don't know what these codes are all about when you look into them some straightforward say it's haram why because it contains ingredients that have that have uh pork fat uh or pork meat or haram meat in it if it were vegetarian it's kosher it's halal if it were derived from sea creatures then it's totally halal the ambiguity comes whether it is from halal meat such as cows and sheep whether they were slaughtered islamically or not or whether it's from haram meat such as dogs and and dead horses and maybe uh pork so what is the ruling there are two opinions one says that it's haram until proven otherwise and the other is halal until proven otherwise and the e codes usually refers to glycerin or whatever is reddit related to it such as gelat gelatin and these products a lot of the scientists say that they undergo a vigorous and rigorous if this is even a word a process that would change its chemical and physical characteristics beyond its original form so it changes it transforms into a new substance and in islam when a substance changes drastically to another substance it becomes halal so if i have juice and i left it forgot about it came back a few weeks later and i found it turning into vinegar i know that it went into being wine then from wine to vinegar so can i consume it the answer is yes if it's not deliberate then it changed by itself it changed from wine which is halam into a halal substance likewise if you irrigate a an apple tree with sewer water the sewer water is transformed formed into something that is sweet and pure and and healthy and in an apple so you can eat that without any problem and allah azza knows best you"
