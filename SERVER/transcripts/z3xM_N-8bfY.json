  "transcript": "what a salam my name is sundus um my question is generally to all of you who can answer a the women that go to Western countries usually get her ass especially hijabi orna kabhi women and I would like to know how to deal with people like that you know we have family in Western countries you know and checked off you can I at least you know I'm especially spent quite a bit of time in the West as well so and there are instances where you know things are said but overwhelmingly i think that the Western countries have provided an opportunity except you know certain European countries i can understand it's far worse but in a case like the united states you're asking for a lawsuit if you mess with a Muslim woman you know there are I know when we first moved to Texas we were really scared cuz you know Texas you be sure we know our vision of what Texas was gonna be like but and when we moved one time my wife was standing in line and she wears the new club so when she's standing in line at the grocery store somebody in the line said go back to your country you know and she turned around and said i was born in california where do you want me to go you know so we can stand up for ourselves and actually those kinds of circumstances they are there and i think they are not just the challenge but an opportunity for our women to learn to stand up for themselves and not take this garbage from anyone and we have to stand by our women and allow them to function in any society in the world you know in a dignified fashion and not take this from anybody you know it's it's high time that muslims take pride in their faith and they take pride and confidence in who they are and once we learn to do that this is not being aggressive this is just standing up for yourself and human dignity is a part of peaceful existence if you don't have dignity you don't have peace within yourself you know so we have to do them we have to learn to deal with that and those of you that are from Western countries that have experienced this kind of harassment I would urge you to raise your daughters to learn to stand up for themselves despite all of the challenges that are outside and shall I instill where their religion would pride just to add on to what my brother said brothers and sisters it's the way of the cowards to become the weak ones you know what you know bullying is bullying is a guy who thinks he's strong pics on someone week in the playground and tries to harm that person through verbal or physical abuse this is what is happening today they're trying to bully the Muslim woman thinking of the Muslim woman is suppressed she's oppressed she is under the thumb of the men she needs to be liberated and she needs to be mocked at and jeered at and made fun of I think it's high time that sisters take the upper hand in these matters and that's why I know our brothers and myself as well we work towards this we want female scholars we want females to take up that responsibility in their own hands do not give up the hijab do not give up the new club don't give up your dress this is who you are this is your life your well-being they are attacking our way of life and they're attacking our right to decide the way we want to live they have no right to do so so at the end of the day my sincere request is for sisters in slam to strengthen yourselves and to build strength within yourselves and to become from those people that can help your own affairs insha Allah and we're here to give you that platform inshallah I lost"
