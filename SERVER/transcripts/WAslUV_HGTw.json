  "transcript": "can we name our children with Angel names such such as jiel Etc using the names of prophets and Angels is permissible according to the most authentic opinion some Scholars did not like calling or using the names of prophets and Messengers and this was refuted by the prophet himself Alam calling his youngest son ibraim so calling or using the names of Messengers and Prophets is totally permissible s abias was known as Abu ish and the prophet used to call him AB ish as for the names of Angels the the most authentic opinion is that this is permissible whether it's jiel jbra mik mik or israfil providing one does not use such names with females so it can be only used with male children because we know that the idol worshippers and the disbelievers as mentioned in the Quran used to describe angels to be females and the daughters of Allah and the likes may Allah Asel be exalted from all of this nonsense so it is not permissible to call a female jiel or ISF or mik or to call her an angel like M or Malak all of these are not permissible"
