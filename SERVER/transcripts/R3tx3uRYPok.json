  "transcript": "ald the prophet s alai as a human mother AA may Allah be pleased with her was asked about the prophet's Behavior what he used to do when he was at his home so she said he was a human being like all humans and you have to underline this he is making a statement that he was a human being like all humans he used to clean his clothes milk his sheep and serve himself and this Hadith was narrated or reported by IM Ahmed in the musn and also in the bukari and Muslim the prophet Alat told his companions that I am merely a man I'm a human being like you I forget as you you forget and I remember as you remember as well and this goes without saying that all the messengers of Allah to the humans were humans themselves yet the pagans the disbelievers rejected this they rejected the prophethood because of the Humanity of these Messengers Allah the almighty says and the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting in the Hereafter and whom we had given the luxuries and comfort of this life said he is no more than a human being like you he eats of that which you eat and drinks of that what you drink if you were to obey a human being like your like yourselves then verely you indeed would be losers so the reason for rejecting these messages of Allah that the disbelievers thought that it cannot be for humans to be prophets Allah the almighty says and nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them except that they said has Allah sent a man as his messenger say if there were on the Earth Angels walking about in peace and security we should certainly have sent down for them from the heavens an angels an angel as a messenger so the disbelievers rejected the prophethood of The Messengers because of their Humanity on the other scale the innovators who claim to be Muslim those sects that consider themselves to be within the loop of Islam rejected the humanity of the prophets especially our Prophet Alat and they said this is not possible that they're human we accept their prophethood but we do not accept their Humanity the disbelievers accepted their humanity and rejected their prophethood so now you find sexs you find people claiming to be Muslims and they claim to love the prophet Alat wasam but they go to extremes so they say that the prophet Alat wasam was created from a Allah's light subhanahu wa ta'ala and that from the Sparks of his light the Angels were created and this is falsifying the Quran as Muslims we do not list listen to this Sheikh or to that Sheikh because Allah on the day of judgment would only question us about the Quran and about the Sunnah and this makes life life easy don't let yourself be a football everybody kicks you to the other side and they play with you you have the Quran it's in your hand you have the Sunnah it's available follow it you enter paradise and that is why Allah the almighty says in the Holy Quran say oh Muhammad I am only a man like you but it has been revealed to me so these are two characteristics of our Prophet he's a man like any other man but at the same time he's the messenger of Allah so when someone looks down and says Muhammad peace be upon him he's a man we say no he's not just a man he's on the top of humanity he he is the perfect human being as a human being there's no one perfect except himat but of course he's not perfect as an individual he's a human being with flaws with human characteristics he sleeps he wakes up he gets sick he dies he he gets happy he cries sallallahu alaih wasallam yet you can not discredit him at all for being a human being because he is the perfect human being not only that he has an edge and that is he is the prophet and messenger of Allah the almighty so those who claim that the prophet Alat wasam was created from Allah's light they're falsifying the Quran they are accusing Quran of lying because Allah the Almighty says Allah said what prevented you El that you did not prostrate yourself when I commanded you El says I am better than him that is Adam you created me from fire in him you created from clay So Adam was created from clay and he was a human being and he is the great grandfather of our Prophet Alat and he's a Prophet himself so he was not created from light the only creatures that were created from light are from light are angels or Jin Angels or jins Angels Jin were created from fire the prophet saysat the Angels were created from light and was created from smokeless fire and AD peace be upon him was created from what has been described to you and this Hadith is in sah Muslim what was described to us that he was created from clay so was the prophet human definitely he was born to abdah to human beings and he was born as a child he was given to who breastfed him and raised him until he was four or six years old he went back to live in Mecca and grew up in Mecca he worked his youth he used to Shepherd sheep for people for a small amount of money and then he got married and then he had children and then he died sallallah alaihi wasallam so was he a human being if you scan if you go through the Quran it clearly states that he was a human being if you go through the Sunnah it states that he was a human being he used to sleep like any human being isn't that true the prophet Alat wasam in the Hadith of anas a a group of companions came to check on the prophet's forms of worship and they belittled it they thought that this is not a lot Allah forgave his previous and upcoming sins and we would do something maybe that we would catch up with himat so one of them said I would not eat meat he was a vegetarian because meat was a something that a delicacy so he said okay by preventing myself from eating meat I may get more reward the other one said I would never sleep on a mattress the third one said I will Fast and never break my fast every single day I'll keep on fasting and when this came and and the fourth one he was the luckiest of all I would not marry so when this reached the prophet Alat the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam praised Allah glorified him and then said why do people say so and so and such and such I sleep and I pray and I fast and I break my fast and this Hadith is in Muslim so this is an another indication and I yeah know that this is something well known to all of you that he was a human but every now and then you have to emphasize and reiterate on this fact so that when someone talks to you about it you have your evidence with you so the the prophet used to sleep did he sleep like anyone else yes and no so there is a difference of opinion among Scholars alhamdulillah as it's usual no he he did not sleep like everyone else generally speaking because may Allah be pleased with her stated that the prophet once slept at night and then she she heard him snoring which meant that he was in deep sleep and then he woke up and went to prayer and she said prophet of Allah you slept until you snore and now you're praying without performing W he said yes I knowa I sleep physically but my heart is awake meaning that I feel if my woodo was nullified I can sense this not like us nowadays A lot of people do this they sleep after they wake up in the F Mah straight to the Masid what is this he said my heart doesn't sleep your heart doesn't sleep your heart is dead it doesn't have to sleep so this is a big problem I've seen Brothers in F you know do they don't doze they sleep until they SN especially in Haram if you go if you go to the Haram in Ramadan they sleep and wake up and go prayer masallah what is this a Sunnah no it's not Sunnah this is only for our Prophet sallallahu alaihi was abdah tells us another characteristic of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as a human being and that is that the prophet used to get ill he used to get sick he visited him once ABD may Allah be pleased with him and he put his hand on the prophet's chest and it was boiling it was hot the prophet had a very strong and high fever and Abdullah was shocked and said Subhan Allah oh prophet of Allah we talk among ourselves and say the prophet of Allah gets sick twice as one of us the amount of suffering and pain that he gets is twice as much so the prophet said yes and then Abdullah Mas elaborated and said and we say that this is because your reward is doubled is this true so the prophet again saidat wasam this is true and you know the Hadith that Allah increases in the calamities and hardship depending on the amount and the level of your Iman so the more Iman you are in the the the stronger you are in your Iman the hardship is further and stronger and the Lesser your level of Iman is the Lesser your hardship would be and if we apply this Hadith to ourselves we get the answer that we have a big problem with our IM because everything is alhamdulillah going beautifully in our lives right we have like what three meals a day some of us have five meals a day we have shelter on our heads we have air conditioning when it's hot alhamdulillah we have um things that makes thing warm I don't know what you call them fire fireplaces we don't have them in Saudi Arabia because it's always uh warm so alhamdulillah we have everything made for us yet we're still complaining and this sheds some doubt over trying to say that we are strong Believers Allah is not testing us and we don't want Allah to test us with with something that we cannot bear or cope with we ask him for a we ask him for forgiveness and to Pardon us not only that the prophet Alam not did not only get sick double the sickness or illness of people he even as part of his Humanity he even had a spell cast on him it is well known in the that a Jew by the name ofid cast a spell on the prophet and he was under the influence of this black magic but this was something physical that had nothing to do with the Shar did not did not have anything to do with the Quran the Revelation the Sunnah the Hal theam it was like an illness and what was it about he thought due to this spell because he had nine wives at the time and this showed how strong he was as a man and this made the Jews Furious they could barely live with one wife nagging all the time and not and complaining for not getting her rights and this man who claims to be a prophet and he has nine wives and he is keeping them all happy so they made a spell so that the Prophet alai would imagine that he has the marital relationship with his wives while he does not approach them and they used to wonder the wives of the Prophet Alam of his negligence to them but they thought that maybe it's he didn't like us anymore this stayed for a while Scholars say that it stayed for 6 months he imagines that he goes home and H uh uh Associates himself with his wives but he doesn't until Allah sent jiel and mik and they give him R and they taught him that the last three chapters of the Quran would reveal him from that and they told him that the spell was made in a well and was put inside of that well and he got it out and burnt it and it all went away this is another evidence that he was a human being sallallahu alaih wasallam the prophet sallallahu alai was made of Bones flesh and blood so what's new well there are people who say that he wasn't he was made of light that whenever he walked to Earth he had no Shadow and he was made of light though if he was made of light he would have lit the house and we did not need any candles and this is against what the Sunnah taught us may Allah be pleased with her said I woke up in the middle of the night and it was pitch dark and I missed the prophet so I started feeling the surroundings and I found his uh uh feet erected and he's prostrating Alat and he said the well-known famous Dua and this is in Muslim so if he was light she would not have needed to touch and locate himat because she could have seen him the prophet Alat was made of Flesh and Blood he as in the Hadith of s may Allah be pleased with him he got injured on the battlefield in the Battle of and he got a cut to his forehead one of his teeth broke and the helmet he was wearing to protect him was smashed when he went back Fatima may Allah be pleased with her his daughter was trying to make the bleeding stop and he kept on bleeding Alat wasam alali used to pour the water and she used to wash his head hoping to prevent the bleeding from continuing and it would not stop sallallahu alaih wasallam until she got a piece of a rug made of straw and she burnt it and she took the ashes and she put it on the wound and it stopped the prophet as a human being he had feelings and we talked about how he cried he also felt the grief he felt the pain over a number of incidents for example in more in not less than six locations in the Quran Allah mentioned the word grief over the prophet Alat wasam and his grief was not for losing a business deal his grief was not for losing a position his grief was for the people not accepting his message he did not take any money from them all what he wanted was to save them from Hellfire Allah says the almighty and whoever disbelieved let not his disbelief grieve you to us is their return and we shall inform them what they have done so this was what used to eat his heart out his love for all of humanity to come and embrace Islam whenever they rejected it he felt sad and grieved over that he also grieved and felt and felt pain and sorrow for the death of his uncle hamah ABD mutalib not only that they mutilated his body they chopped off his nose his ear they opened up his stomach so when he saw him he felt bad about it and the companions of the Prophet the Anar also felt bad for their relatives who were mutilated and cut up in this uh um barbaric way and they pledged to do the same next time they meet with the disbelievers but Allah forbade them from doing this as he revealed the Quran telling them that it is not for them it's up to Allah to forgive them or to guide them or to punish them he also Alat as a human being cried for losing ibraim his son and for not allowing him to ask Allah for forgiveness for his mother he also used to get angry angry with his companions and when you hear this you think that oh the prophet Alam was an impulsive person he used to get angry and if when someone gave him something he smacked his hand said didn't I tell you put two spoons of sugar not one no no the prophet was not like this his anger was because of the actions of the individual and not every individual so with the youngsters with the ignorant he was very calm and tolerant now this beautiful Gathering of brothers and sisters in this Masjid if someone comes I'm not pointing at anyone just any indiscriminate if someone comes and starts to urinate in the what do you guys do attack we will you know tear him into pieces what is he doing he's un in in the Masid and in the kill him that Infidel no this is not what the Prophet didat this was an ignorant person what did he do said leave him until he finishes otherwise he would have scattered everything around the Masjid so the spot would have been much bigger so the prophet's wisdom he eliminated it in a very small place then he told him to pour a bucket of water and then he called the man and said my son or my nephew this is an Arab terminology who's ever younger than you you say he's my nephew if he's older you say he's my uncle so he said my nephew these mids were not made for such filth they were made for prayer remembrance of Allah for reciting the Quran and all the companions were you know they just wanted to kill the guy so when the prophet taught him thisam the man said oh Allah forgive me and Muhammad and don't forgive anyone else only me and Muhammad and the prophet told him my nephew Allah's Mercy is much bigger and vaster than this so with the ignorant he was tolerant and kind with the youngsters he was tolerant and kind as well Omar AB may Allah be pleased with him he used to eat with the prophet Alam using his left hand and the prophet would always prevent vent him from doing this and said oh boy eat with your right hand say and eat from what's in front of you don't eat from the whole dish from front of other people and don't use your left hand neither in drinking nor in eating while another man as in theah of Muslim and this shows you what a human being he wasat tolerant with those who need tolerance but tough and strict with those who need to be dealt with in such a fashion he saw a man eating with his left hand so he said use your right hand when you eat the man out of arrogance not accepting the prophet's advice he said I cannot and the prophet knew this and he said you may not and the man's hand was paralyzed he could not lift it up to his mouth because of the prophet's supplication against him why because he did this out of arrogance abari for example who was one of the great Companions of Islam one of the first to embrace Islam when the prophet was in Med was in Mecca and he was beaten until he turned into red because of the the blood that covered the whole body and they left him when they thought he was dead and he hid between the um curtains of the Kaa and the Kaa itself for a whole month abari until and he had no food no drink except zamzam nothing came into his stomach except zamzam for a whole month and he said I became fat and you can see fat coming off my body because of zamzam this blessed water which the prophet tells us that it is food to those who intend to to consume it as food and it is a cure to those who seek Allah's cure out of it abari once had an argument and he's a human being as well he had an argument with Bilal the Aban and through the argument he got carried away he was angry and he said you are the son of a black woman so what was bel's color he was black what is was his mother's color she was black so so big deal no it wasn't a big deal because he said it in a context which meant that I want to humilate you by your mother that she's black as if she's nothing and who he is talking to to bil the abian slave so bil did not reply he went to the prophet Alam and he told told him about what had happened the prophet as a human being got angry and said Abu you are a man with Jah you have ignorance and arrogance with in you and Abu stepped back and said me oh prophet of Allah I'm your companion said yes How would how dare you say this to your companion to your friend and say this to him about his mother what did Abu do he went to bil he lied on the ground he put his cheek on the ground and said B put your foot on my other cheek because you're the black you're the son of a black woman show me how black you your mother is he wanted to humilate himself so that it takes every single atomweight of arrogance in his heart what did B do step with his two feet on him no said come on may Allah forgive you my brother come on stand up it's gone it's history their their hearts were pure as milk may Allah be pleased with them and join us with them abdah and this I I I quote and theith is in Muslim and I I always quote this to my younger brothers in in Saudi Arabia because their influence by ironically speaking you so now you're wearing mashallah uh uh Saudi clothes Islamic clothes um yeah clothes that shows your identity there they wear the opposite and nothing's wrong with wearing trousers wearing uh a suit this is nothing wrong at all but when you are in the land of the Muslims and you should be proud of being a Muslim you find out people are wear wearing low weight waist pants falling down and they intend to show you their boxers why you doing this so yeah this is the fashion wearing long jerseys and the caps on the side and you know abdah one of the great Companions and his father was a great companion may Allah be pleased with them both came to the prophet one day and theith is in Muslim wearing two thobes two pieces of clothes with dye on them with has a reddish color and this Muslims don't wear let me scan quickly do we have anybody okay well it is not permissible for men and women to wear 100% red clothes so if you wear something with stripes in it black blue white whatever it's okay but when it's completely red this is Haram and uh it is mentioned in the Sunnah as well but these type of clothes with such a d were customs of the pagans and it was the fashion these days so abdah came to the prophet with these clothes the first thing that the prophet saidat wasam To His companion his student did your mother order you to wear this look at how hard har it sounds I would have said maybe this is not appropriate the prophet used hikma and what is the meaning of hikma hikma is wisdom and what is the definition of wisdom wisdom is putting the right thing in its place so you have to put the right thing in its place we don't have hikma we use violence in times of peace and we use tolerance and peace in times of defense and it goes all the way around you have to use the methodology of the Prophet Alat wasam the prophet spoke to his disciple to His companion your mother ordered you to wear this Abdullah Omar did not argue and this is something we do quite well whatever whenever someone gives you an advice what would you do yeah the scholars have different opinion this is Haram yeah but she so and so says so and so and uh no the it's all the shakes say that it is Haram probably there's a shikh in wakwak country that would say differently how do you know and let me check with she Google maybe he knows best so argument is in our blood abdah when the prophet told him your mother ordered you this what did he say he said prophet of Allah should I wash it I know I acknowledge should I wash it the prophet said no burn it destroy these clothes don't leave any strings attached stay away from disbelief now you're a Believer you have to leave everything behind so that it never brings sad or bad memories back to you how much time 15 also the prophet was as a human being felt sad and grieved when the Hypocrites slandered his wife AA and Allah Asel kept away Revelation for a whole month and the prophet did not know what to do he loved his wife but there are people talking and he cannot testify for something he did not see until Allah revealed her innocence as inah the prophet did not only grieve and felt sorry but he also at times would enjoy and be happy he would enjoy things that bring joy to him to himself for example when someone was away and came back and the prophet am on the seventh year of Hijra as we know was conquest and that this Big Rich Village of the Jews was taken by the Muslims and at the same time jaali came he came back from not London definitely he came back from ABIA he was his cousin jaali the the the brother of ALB and he loved him a lot so he said I don't know what to be joyful with more the conquest of or the return of Ja so he showed his happiness he showed his happiness when people gave to the cause of Allah for example in theah people from mud a tribe came with torn clothes and poverty showing on their faces the prophet was angered he praised Allah and he encouraged people to pay for charity a man came with a big pile of food and clothes that he barely brought and carried and once the people saw this they immediately started going back and bringing food and clothes to the prophet Alam the companions say the minute the the prophet saw thisam his face would glow and it would shine whenever he was happy people could see it as if they're seeing the moon in the middle of the month sallallahu alaihi wasallam he had a beautiful face and once he was happy he would glow and Shine sallallah wasallam the prophet married and we know that he had wives Allah the almighty says and indeed we sent Messengers before you and made for them wives and Offspring so all the messengers of Allah married or will marry true will marry married will marry there's one left right Isa Isa Jesus Christ peace being upon him and he will get married and he will have offspring of his own and the prophet as a human being loved women and he said that among the things in D Allah made beloved to my heart perfumes women of course lawful women that is and I had my I have my satisfaction in in prayer in offering prayers now why would we emphasiz ize on the humanity of the Prophet Alat wasam because Shan has steps you know this there are steps for Satan he never comes to you directly and tells you to drink wine intoxicants or use drugs the first thing he says it's okay to sit among people who smoke after a while smoke a cigarette after a while try you know roll a joint or something just puff don't inhale after a while it goes on and on and on and then Halas he becomes into the mainstream of Shan Subhan Allah footsteps now people are being fooled by Shan in the same manner do you love the prophet Alam yes I do okay let's prove that let's talk about the prophet alham he was the greatest man ever walk to walk the earth it's true he was so great that Allah loved him it's true Allah so loved him so much that he created the earth and the heaven for his sake the well you don't love the prophet I do love him then okay it's true and the prophet is not like any other one he was the light from Allah that shined over the humanity and his light went into people's heart debatable but okay it's true then this means that he's not a human being he was created from the light of Allah as in the Hadith of Ja abdah and he quotes a long Hadith that all the Arabs would laugh about when they read it because this is not Arabic and with all due respect to the non- Arabs but when you hear someone who's non- Arab speaking Arab iic you laugh as when you hear me speak English you laugh so but this is English so the prophet because you love him sh Satan comes with his footsteps so that you would go out of the Sunnah out of the correct belief and this is what the prophet warned us from Alam Subhan Allah as if he knew he didn't he does not know the Unseen but Allah reveals it to him he said do not exaggerate about me as was exaggerated about peace be upon him say the slave of Allah and his messenger and this Hadith was narrated by the bukari so the prophet was a slave and a messenger but what did the Christians say he's the son of God he's God he's one out of three and so on and this is blasphemy and that is why the prophet warned us from this a lot of these sects claim that the prophet is still alive in his grave how can he be alive when Allah the almighty says verily you will die and they too will die as well no they say he's he died but then he's alive in his grave he eats and drinks and mates and everything like exactly as he was before he died in his grave yeah I asked you a question if this was true why do we leave him in his grave get him out let him solve our problems if he was alive as he was before he died there are people the Deviant sects of Islam I've read their books and I advise you don't read it without Parental Guidance it it is it is awful one of these books says that if you say Sal on the prophet muhamad 500 times every single day what would happen he says you would see him alive not while in your dreams but you will see the prophet alive so okay explain this to me I was talking to one of the brothers and said yes my Sheikh he used to do this and he went to Medina he went to the grave of the Prophet Alam and by Allah a hand came out of the grave and he gave to the prophet and I told him why didn't he grab him why didn't he pull him out come on what kind of religion is this Subhan Allah but people laugh about it people fool others with it why because they're not following the Quran and they're not following the Sunnah one of these sects where I come from from Saudi Arabia from Mecca to be specific there was this deviant scholar who compiled a book and he filled it with all nonsense he used to say and I'm quoting in this book he says that the grave of the Prophet Alam not his body but the P the space of the Grave itself it is more purified and honorable than the Kaa he goes on to say no it is more purified and honorable than the of Allah he's not talking about the body he's talking about the space that occupies or is occupied by the bodies of the Prophet wasam what kind of blasphemy is this Who Dares say such things people who pretend to be Muslims he says in one of his books when you come to the Grave face the grave in Medina and give you back to the and say these are the four beautiful attributes of of Allah as in the third Ayah of how dare you use these names to the prophet I spoke to one of their shaks he said yes yes this is correct he was defined Subhan Allah enlighten me he said he's a the first to come out of the Grave said yes he's the a to pass on the okay and he started explaining said okay why don't you continue and say he's and use these explanations of yours what kind of religion is this therefore the best way of Salvation is to identify this human being as our messenger and leader we follow the Quran that he brought to us and that was revealed to him and we follow his Sunnah that we he taught us it and he guaranteed us that as long as we abide by the Quran and sunah that we will be with him on the day of judgment in Paradise but to follow deviant sects lunatic Scholars who are getting rich alhamd Allah guided us to guided us to this beautiful religion had I not been guided I would have been rich I could be rich easily if I do like these guys do fool people and lose my but I can make it easy in this life don't follow people follow the Quran follow the Sunnah because this is what Allah will hold you questionable about on the day of judgment"
