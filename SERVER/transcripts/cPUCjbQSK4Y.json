  "transcript": "Abdi Carney says I've seen some Muslims when in a sitting position especially at the jihad cross their legs is that allowed of most likely those who sit cross-legged in prayer do this because of an illness with their knees even Omar may Allah be pleased with him at the end of his life used to pray like this so if this was for a reason there is no problem in sha allah and even if it wasn't for a reason it is against the sunnah but the prayer is still valid"
