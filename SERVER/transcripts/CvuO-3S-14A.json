  "transcript": "what's the sunnah after reciting the whole quran because i heard that first you have to recite first three queens then go and recite fatih on the first page of bakara as an indication that i'll recite the quran again then go and reset that whole dua is it from the sunnah no there is no sunnah as such reciting the three calls or the fatih or the beginning of the surat al-baqarah to re-um reignite or or to rewind the process of reading the quran once again there is nothing prescribed in this issue you finish you close the quran if you want to continue you go and recite the fact you have from the beginning then if move on as per the dua it was reported that ana malik may allah be pleased with him whenever he finished reciting the quran he used to gather his family and make dua and this is not a confirmed sunnah from the prophet isaiah samsung of a sahabi if one does it for himself there is no problem uh in it insha allah and if he does not do it this is more likely and allah azza knows best"
