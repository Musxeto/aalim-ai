  "transcript": "foreign deals with what the prophet Allah used to recite in the prayer of Fajr on Friday and the prophet said the authentic Hadith that the best prayer among the mandatory prayers is the prayer of Fajr prayer on Friday unfortunately the majority of Muslims skip this prayer because it's the weekend they're lazy especially in countries where people stay up late up till 2 or 3 A.M either attending a wedding or just playing with their friends and they go to bed late they will not be able to wake up for Fajr and they often miss this great opportunity of doing something that Allah loves a lot Hadith will be recited by the brother second one yes narrated The Prophet sallam used to reside in the salatul Fajr on Friday these two surahs the prophet Allah used to always maintain reciting them in Salah and Fajr prayer on the Friday this was not once or twice every single Friday which emphasizes that Imam should also follow the Sunnah why because these two great surahs include a lot of advice reminders speaking about the origin of the creation of the man and also promoting doing good deeds and description of Jannah and description of Hell Fire as well so Muslims Imam especially should always maintain to recite these two surahs every single Fajr of Friday and with the grace of Allah there are a number of masjids worldwide apply this especially in the haramain in Mak and Medina they always recite these two surahs and as you know that foreign of recitation and those who do not know the Sunnah they think that it is part of the Fajr on a Friday that you recite any Surah that has sajdar so you find imams reciting in the first raqqa for example Surat alak some of them recite parts of Surat and najim others do even more than that they recite the portion where it has the sajdah in Surat only three verses before and two hours after and that's it thinking that what is needed is to pray something that includes sajdah and this is wrong either you pray the full two surahs and the turakas or pray anything else but don't try to camouflage it or to cut and paste what you like you have to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah and this brings us to an issue that we did not discussed before because it was not in our chapter but I just remembered it what is the ruling on reciting or that is what is the ruling on prostrating for verification is it a must or Asuna the most authentic opinion is that it is a Sunnah meaning that if the Imam recites the Surah with sajdah he has the right not to offer it if I'm reciting the Quran and I pass by an Ayah with sajdah I have the right not to offer it but if I offer it those listening to me it's recommended for them to offer it as well so Scholars say if there are two one of them is reciting the Quran and the other one is listening if the one who's listening when the person reciting the Quran prostrates it's recommended that he prostrates but if he wasn't listening if the man is deciding the Quran loudly and the other one is on the phone is talking not listening not paying attention that then it is not recommended for him to prostrate and among the rules that need to be also explained that how many or what are the types of prostrations that we may offer outside of the prayer that are not related to prayer there are two types of prostration prostration of recitation and prostration of thankfulness okay sahu is related to the prayer it's connected with the prayer we don't include this now these are the only two prostrations allowed in Islam outside prayer and therefore we learn and we know that if I concluded my prayer with the Imam I see some ignorant people offering sujud one and they prolonged it after finishing the Salah and when he raises his head what are you doing brother he said I was doing the sugar I am always grateful to Allah for doing things to me so I thank Allah azzawajal by this I say that this is an innovation they are not prayers why because prayer is inaugurated and it begins with takbeer and it ends and concludes with Salam taslim and these two prostrations don't have this they have the takbeer when you prostrate Allahu Akbar and when you raise your head you don't offer takbeer that's it only one Tech beer when I prostrate and there is no Salam that is why we do not need the conditions of prayers when offering these two prostrations what do you mean Sheikh I mean you don't have to be in the state of wudu can I prostrate without being in the state of voodoo yes you can you don't have to be in the state of covering your aura come on I can prostrate while wearing my shorts yes you can you don't have to face the Qibla no this is too much with all due respect check I don't want to hear more this is not from my pocket this is what the scholars say and this is what sheikhil Islam even Tamia said as well as Sheikh ebenez a number of Scholars these two prostrations are not them whatever I want a woman does not need to have her hijab when or hamar when she prostrates for recitation if she's in her home if she is wearing normal clothes and she decides it and she wants to prostrate prostrate the cryblies to this direction I can do it in this direction no problem in that and I thought that it might add a little bit value to you to know because I know that some of you may not know these rulings and I prefer that you hear it from me rather than hearing it from someone else so this leads us to know that the prophet Allah used to recite in al-fajr of Friday these two great surahs all the time and what did the prophet Allah recite in the Friday prayer itself this was not mentioned here in our book The Prophet used to recite two sets one of two either he recites and in the second Russia and the second set he used to recite Surah is foreign a lot of the people only pray only and unfortunately I've been to some Masjid where they do not read these two at all this is the Sunnah but if you recite anything else your prayer is valid and acceptable and as re if you remember we said in the beginning the longer your prayer is and the shorter your is a sign an indication that you are knowledgeable we have a short break so stay tuned inshallah we'll be Allah and welcome back with this we conclude talking about the verdicts and the rulings over Friday prayer and we start and begin to talk about the rulings on Aid prayers but I believe that we should begin a new session because it's a new topic therefore I would like to see if you have any questions that we would inshaallah try to answer them yes brother suppose if I'm trying to memorize a particular Surah from the Glorious Quran by listening to a time and again on my mobile I am traveling in a train on a bus and if at all I come across a Aya offers frustration it's not possible so on reaching home is it mandatory to perform the frustration of recitation okay we've stated before that the ruling on the prostration of recitation is not mandatory it is mustahab it is recommended therefore if you're listening to it on your MOBA or in the radio while driving all while on the train or a bus you are not obliged to do it if there's enough space for you to do it you can do it if you wish but it's not mandatory and that is why may Allah be pleased with him once on ajuma he recited a verse that included prostration of recitation he went down from the pulpit and he offered the sujood and everybody officer Jude with him the second jummah he recited the same verse or another verse that had the prostration of recitation and he did not prostrate and when he saw that the people were a little bit either confused or annoyed he said oh people I deliberately did this just this so that I would teach you that it is not mandatory it is something that is recommended you do it alhamdulillah you don't do it you have no problem in that regard I have been to Masjid where in the first rakat when the Imam says everyone they say subhanallah aloud and after Surat al-qashiya they say Allah is it permissible this is all part of the Innovations this is part of the things that are fabricated in Islam for example it is similar to talk shows when you have a host and a guest this is what the people are doing now when the voice then makes he says and the people say Maha when the Imam says seriously this is what's happening in Arabia they're answering back so the Imam says they say and they offered where he says they say is what is this this is not a conversation you are innovating and you're doing things that are baseless and has no relation to Islam or to the sun of the Prophet Allah that is why when the Imam says everybody says and when Allah says he says of this is nonsense it is not related to the Sunnah if if there is a Hadith that supports this and the Hadith is authentic not fabricated then yes you have an excuse to say but if it's not then it comes under the category of innovation yes brother Sheikh in India there's a tradition I don't know authenticity but people here pray to rakat of sugar as a prayer how far is it authentic when do they do this when some something blessed happened to them like some good news a good job or if a child passes the exam well to my knowledge there isn't anything as to raka of shukur there is such that Ashoka there are two rakas of Toba of seeking Allah's forgiveness and repentance but to my knowledge I do not know of these two rakas of gratitude however any voluntary prayer you offer it's considered to be out of gratitude to Allah so not necessarily when something happens whatever you pray it is a form of gratitude therefore I believe that if you pray two records tendrakas voluntary prayer General prayer as a sign of gratitude to Allah this is inshallah permissible but is it part of the Sunnah not to my knowledge yet the concept is there be grateful offer prayer inshallah this is sufficient yes faisa as you said for the before question that uh it's all Innovation to reply to the Imam or whatever is saying but I don't know about the authenticity but there is a Hadith that whenever the prophet used to hear read something about Jannah or something about good used to ask for it and whenever he read about hell used to us Refuge from it so should we do what the prophet only did at that place or can we do it wherever we find it first of all this is something related to a specific issue and that is whenever the prophet Allah passed by a verse that talks about Mercy he would ask Allah for his mercy and whenever he passed by a verse that spoke about punishment he would seek refuge in Allah this is it's different than whatever comes else such as when uh saying subhana or as in the last Surah of a teen Allah foreign and also people say yes or no these are things some of them are backed by weak Hadith so wig Hadith to some Scholars is acceptable because it is in something that is not related to Haram they say it's okay to do it I believe that it is not as long as it's not authentic you should not do it but regarding the issue you're saying Scholars say yes if you are reciting the Quran and you pass by such a verse you ask Allah for his a blessing and favor and you seek refuge in him is it permissible for people listening to the recitation of the Imam Scholars say no it is not unless the Imam himself while reading says and you hear that you can say but if the Imam is saying whatever he's saying asking Allah azzawajal or praising Allah in the Quran he's not saying it he's reciting Quran you are not allowed to say or speak or talk or supplicate unless he does this and this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars so that you would listen or wholeheartedly to the Quran see this is regarding the prostration for uh the Quran is there any difference or any Dua that is to be recited while in in prostration which is different from the other prostrations some Scholars say that there is a particular Dua for the prostration of recitation and they say who foreign and all of these don't seem to be authentic in the recitation of frustration there are General supplications that you say in your recitation and that is why Scholars say is sufficient but if you like these supplications which are authentic and beautiful to be included there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah usually many times it happens when a person dies the family members and Friends get together and they recite Quran two times three times four times but they hardly do the frustration of tilawat I have not seen anybody doing it and it is not done so first of all is is this sort of getting together for recitation of for the after the person dies is it recommended and when they don't do the prostration what is the ruling first of all it is not permissible to gather and make Dua for a deceased person or to recite the Quran on behalf of a deceased person all of this is considered to be Innovation not only that the companions of the Prophet Allah foreign he says that we used to consider Gathering and making food for the on behalf of the deceased form of niaha which is a major sin form of wailing so even to gather in one house and people come and they drink coffee and tea and give their condolences at a specific time this is not permissible you want to give your condolences you see someone you tell him may Allah reward you for your loss in the Masjid and the street in the market but not to go and gather in one place and even worse to make food and invite people to come and eat this is all part of the Buddha reciting the Quran there is no evidence that it would reach the deceased and it is a bitter when you have 30 people coming to give their condolences and they give each one one juzu so each one reads it in about 10 minutes and by this they have all finished the Quran and they requested to give the reward to the deceased as if mashallah they're making a bank transfer or an ATM so please put your number pin number okay I'll transfer this much and much to the deceased we have no evidence behind that the only authentic evidence we have is that you can first supplicate to the deceased or asking Allah for forgiveness reaches him two charity reaches him authentic Hadith states that whatever charity you give on behalf of the disease reaches him three performing Hajj and Scholars say umra is as well so if you perform Hajj on behalf of a disease this will reach him and finally fasting from his relatives if he died unable to pass or has missed fasting such as Oaths or pledges or expiations it is permissible for them to fast on his behalf other than no reciting Quran no doing forms of worship other than that all of this is considered to be part of innovative things and I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
