  "transcript": "uh she recently I've become a part of this uh language speaking like or no language course for German right and in this course there are three men including me and three women and I was wondering if it's okay to like go to this course and learn German um if there's these women here in this group and is it permissible to like interact with them as long as it's like school work and stuff like this and you live in Germany no I live in Bosnia and BOS I'm just learning German in Bosnia like a course okay first of all necessity is determined by its nature and this means that whenever we have to do something and this thing may be Haram we cannot justify it by saying it's a necessity because we have to determine the level of necessity a person who's hungry and he has no other means to eat but a dead dog we cannot advise him to eat until he reaches a level where it is critical for his livelihood if he doesn't eat he's going to die he's starving to death plus the fact that there is no Halal food in the vicinity but if he could walk for 15 or 20 minutes or half a day and find Halal food it is not permissible for him to eat from this dog and if he's not starving it's not allowed for him to eat from this dog only if he's starving and he's about to die and there is no chance of him getting any Halal food in the for seen future he may take a bite or two only to sustain his life not to have a feast on it and enjoy eating it this is the necessity now you're in Bosnia and in a it's an Islamic country free mixing is not permissible so we have to look into learning German is learning German one of the essential things in Islam the answer is no but I'm thinking of moving to Germany to look for work and I need to speak German in order to do this we have to look into your circumstances if it is a necessity for you to travel to Germany and to learn in this case we say you may indulge or go to participate in such a course your interaction with the opposite gender must be minimal so you have to try your level best to ask the teacher to segregate you from the opposite gender and to limit your interaction with the other two or three men in that course if this was not possible and it is a um work group that you are forced to be involved with then you have to lower your gaze fear Allah and keep it limited to what is needed without any socialization so socializing or uh chitchatting or any of that sort and Allah Knows Best"
