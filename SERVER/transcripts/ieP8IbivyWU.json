  "title": "Can I touch non mahram woman 2 stop her from crossing in between me & my sujood spot assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "stating can we touch a non-mahram woman from Crossing us when praying as our prayer would be invalid if they cross between standing and prostration spot if not then what's the solution we all know that it is prohibited for any person to cross the boundaries the area of a worshiper praying and this area is between his feet and his prostration spot this is his Sanctuary no one is allowed to pass through and if a woman passes through this invalidates a man's or a woman's prayer it doesn't matter whether the person praying is a man or a woman if a woman crosses this place or this spot then the person's prayer is invalid now narian says what if a man is praying and a woman is attempting to cross if it were a man we would have put our hands and prevented that man from doing so but this is a woman so we have two evils one breaking or invalidating our Salat two touching and mahara movement and definitely breaking the Salat is the Lesser evil usually we would say to a person try to get as close as possible to the barrier in front of you whether it's a wall or a pillar or someone praying so that anyone wanting to come in between would not find enough space and when you want to prostrate you go a step backwards and you prostrate with ease but if this is still not possible and this woman is insisting on going through let her go through and restart your prayer all together and Allah Knows Best"
