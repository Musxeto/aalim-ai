  "transcript": "well if this person takes the pill only at 12:00 noon he can shift this and take it only at 12: midnight because if he's taking it once a day he can fast and make this appointment at nighttime but the problem is if you tell me that he has to take a pill every 12 hours which means that death Ely he has to take it while fasting in this case if it's a life and death case or if it's lifethreatening or if it is a case that would postpone And Delay his recovery from an illness that he has in this case it is permissible for him to break his fast that is not to fast and take the medicine and make up for the days later on inshallah"
