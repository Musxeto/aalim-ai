  "title": "Switching on all the lights & closing all doors at Maghrib, is this authentic? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says i have heard that during maghrib time we must turn on all lights of our house and close our doors is this authentic the answer is no the hadith stated that whenever it is maghrib time you should refrain from sending your children out unaccompanied so the time between magrib and isha children must not be set free because this is a time where the devils have they're spreading and kidnapping and you don't want this to happen to your child and the prophet told us that we should also close the doors and mention allah's name so if you enter you would close the door and say bismillah because the devils won't be able to enter a house where the name of allah was mentioned while closing the doors as for turning off the lights or turning on the lights there is nothing as such only that when you go to sleep if you are using lanterns and there is a candle or fire that you have to put it off before going to bed so that it won't be the cause of uh fire due to the mice getting close to it and maybe causing something like that and allah azza knows best"
