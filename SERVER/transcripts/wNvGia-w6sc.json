  "title": "Imam doesn't sit properly between 2 sujood nor says 'Rabbigh firli', Is my prayer valid Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "it says i prayed behind an imam and the imam is without any doubt does not sit properly between the two sajdahs like a lot of the hanafi followers from the subcontinent especially they just touch and go they do this prostration and they sit and they come back immediately to the second prostration they don't sit between the two prostrations which is a pillar they don't say rabbit fairly which is an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is it's mandatory and this is due to their ignorance and lack of knowledge they don't care about following the sunnah of the prophet alisal they care about following their scholars their school of thought their customs how they were brought up so abu uh faizan says is my prayer valid i'm not too slow the answer is no inshallah it is valid so even if he raises from the sujud and is in the sitting position and by the time you sit he goes to sujood say rabbi firli once and follow him that would be okay in sha allah"
