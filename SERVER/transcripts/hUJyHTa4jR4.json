  "transcript": "says in the subcontinent during weddings elders swirl money on the head of a bride and groom and give that money to the poor people saying that it will prevent evil eye and that this is for charity even parents do this with their kids is this permissible the answer is no this is a clear innovation and it might be minor shirk if you think that by swirling money and giving it to charity this would protect you from evil i this is unfounded in the quran or in the sunnah so this makes it a minor shirk may allah you"
