  "transcript": "slava manova him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad and in halloween nabina muhammad in wada yo zombie war money be Hadiya western visuality hidden me teen and maja before the break we talked about what signs of the hour masha'Allah Malak Allah it's like the frequent question when I say when did companion so-and-so died this is long time ago correct correct so the whole seminar workshop is about the size of now or what are you talking about what was it about this is the high elastic buildings always talk about six-seven things afterwards another brother I sent very good the uplifting of knowledge and I bought you with my story which Edwin Basavanna they mean Abu Bakri society okay this is one aspect also there will be a time that zina is widely spread illegitimate sexual relationships between men and women this is one of the signs of the Day of Judgment is it found nowadays unfortunately yes is it only among the disbelievers the answer is unfortunately again no this is taking place all over but alhamdulillah it is not physical ahem widely spread in the sense that in every hundred we have maybe ten no it's a negligible percentage but it is on the increase and why is it on the increase because we find that the things that call for it are increasing such as lack of hijab when women do not abide by the hijab this is inevitable it has to happen also the free mixing and this is prevalent in Muslim countries in companies in shops in Airlines in hospitals that is the concept of free mixing that even institutions are making strategies for it to inject it into Muslim societies make it the norm and when this becomes the norm you have a problem when women and men mix and you tell the brother a heat mixing is how Hamas's it's all in the heart I have no problems with that and have delay you Muslims move over you have a problem your dirty mind I sit with my coworker nothing happens nothing happens because you have a problem with your hormones go and check the doctor you're not the real man if nothing happens what is this the Prophet told us it has it has it has to happen and you say it doesn't happen I met a brother mashallah practicing in his way he thinks of his own martial mother what do you mean practicing I pray five times a day mashallah and he is a personal trainer and he says I have two ladies that I'm coaching them I said what kind of personal train what kind of practising Muslim are you you know he's doing this new sport what is it called CrossFit he's a CrossFit personal trainer I said what do you mean he got mixed with the same Ally I have no feelings towards among so hard from them I said to him I might believe you there might be elders they might be not so good looking but I'll ask you one simple question hypothetically speaking you're not affected by them can you guarantee that they're not affected by you although he posed I said hmm I didn't think of that and this is a problem it takes two to tango Islamic tango of course with the sheet with your spouse not yeah they're haram tango we have a problem when the measurements are not fixed when we weigh things not with the scales of Islam this what happens so every one of us is so influenced by the environment by the community by the policies and procedures put by man that he is distorted he doesn't see what is wrong to be wrong and what is right to be right he sees the opposite the wrong to be right and the right to be wrong Xena will come to that to a time where people would make it hala the Prophet said alayhi salat WA Salam there will come a time when a group of my Ummah will make Haram things Helen will make silk for men Helen yesterday lune they will make it Hannah and here which is Xena and hurry silk and Hum intoxicants which we will come now to and musical instruments and we will come to that as well shaman so part of the signs of the day of judgment that the spreading of drinking intoxicants in the Quran it's called has what how much anything that covers your conscience and makes you intoxicated is considered to be harmed there will come a time where people would give it names other than its original name so we know how now people have drugs and this falls under common cocaine heroin meth crack marijuana pot hashish the list is so long intoxicants wine said no no we don't drink wine we don't whiskey oh yeah whiskey no no no what I said what hum-hum has made of grapes dates barley wheat we drink whiskey tequila vodka gin bourbon scotch and they give you a full desktop and talks to kids but this is not coming does it intoxicate you it covers your conscience and the ability to decide and choose so this this is Haram look at the Muslim world don't look at the kafir world the vast majority of Muslim countries serve intoxicants to my knowledge except Saudi till now Schama Kuwait and Yemen I don't know about other countries maybe there are some but this is what I know they do not serve the rest the vast majority of them serve it some of them would put you know a disclaimer Muslims are not allowed to they go into nightclubs that they buy in the cases you go to the airport you fight duty-free and all what they sell is alcohol this is a great warning from Allah Azza WA JAL that the day of judgement is coming close but people are not paying any heed the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said that there will come a time where people of my Ummah will make in toxicants halal but give it different names beer anything that intoxicates but give it in Arabic we call it spiritual drinks because of the presence of spirit and this is alcohol much Roboto here in Arabic so they change the names oh it's spiritual so it enhances my spirit could put me one glass please hold the ice there's a big problem among the Muslims the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam curse wine and intoxicants curse those who drink it those who pour it those who sell it those who buy it those who prepare it those who it is prepared for those who carry it those who it is carried for and those who consume its price selling it anyone related to intoxication he is cursed from allah azzawajal part of the signs of the Day of Judgment that women far exceed men in number so the percentage is different the prophet alayhi salatu salam said part of the science of the Day of Judgment is to uplift knowledge and appearance of ignorance that zina and fornication is widely spread that intoxicants are consumed and that men go and women stay and till fifty women would have one guardian so the percentage is one to one one to fifty now why would that be some scholars say because men are the people of war they fight so they die but women stay home and they live longer others say that because men are more inflicted to illnesses and diseases so they go out and they drive they are susceptible to high blood pressure because of the way people are great Drive believe me you drive like excellent drivers compared to us in Southie and I come here everything is normal these guys are disciplined the way you guys drive you're disciplined compared to us in Riyadh Orange it then here we'll know what driving is and men have high blood cholesterol they have diabetes they have high heart problems I've seen so many men friends of mine me personally having so many diseases while the women masha'Allah they live like 150 years 300 years they have a live long why because they're not in really susceptible to such illnesses like men we are always under pressure while their hand Allah they have their own problems with bad spouses children but they're confined to their homes they don't have the same problem and if it had journalists Pilate said no no no no all of these are reasons but the actual fact is that a lot shows that women to be more than men and this is why even in Paradise a man has two wives which means that the percentage itself is far greater for men and for women rather than men so this would happen and as we progress I can see that this visibly in front of me 30 years ago or 40 years ago what you wanted to get married you would look hard because there were not as much choices as you have today nowadays the supply is far greater than the demand the amount of women is a lot so men when they want to get married they start to they can choose no I'd like modify please the hell the height okay education has I'd rather the father to be a billionaire they start to pick and choose and this is why I always tell my daughters I have 13 of them no boys hamdulillah so I'm beginning to grow a uterus myself all of them are women not everything I see is girls I tell them when you're married grab to your husband obey him respect him overlook his shortcomings if you divorce no one will marry people are very selective nowadays they marry in two and three because there's so many of them so either stay unmarried and this is not natural or try to overlook his shortcomings and mistakes and insha Allah will reward you but you will have a husband to take care of so this is happening and it is prevailing unfortunately but this is part of the science of the day of judgment also the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam i think i have it translated no it's not translated or maybe you see a man came to the prophet erase salat wa salam and said to him when is the hour so the prophet incident and he said when trusts are neglected then await for the hour the word amana trusts has two meanings one meaning as someone mentioned at the end of certain has a in our man a man at our sorority or abdul-jabbar trust sheer means anything that Allah obliged upon you salat cm zakat and also what is between the humans themselves contracts not to lie all of this falls under the category of a man and another meaning which we will not look into so the Prophet is saying when the amana is wasted wait for the hour meaning when people do not abide by Islam do not honor salat do not observe obligations or refrain from Haram then this is when the hour will come so the man said o prophet of allah what is wasting a mana give me something that I can understand something concrete so the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam when positions of authority are given to people who are not qualified for them then await for the hour and this is exactly what's happening and I cannot go further and explain but you have to think and may Allah make it easy for all of us to understand part of the signs of the hour is the close intervals between time the Prophet signaling salat wa salam the hour would not be taking place until time is so close so that year would be as long as a month the month would be as long as a week the week would be as close as a day and the day would be as short as an hour and the hour would be like when you lit a match when you light a match you just see it flaring and it dies is it like this for me I remember when I was in primary school high school college work marriage children my eldest daughter is 33 years of age I remember well why today and I tell my wife you remember that when she was born when would it be the time when she is 7 or 6 years of age running to the door taking my bag as I come back from school and saying daddy daddy how are you now she has her own children and Intermediate School her eldest daughter is like 13 years of age or something like that God it feels old but this is time drama bond was yesterday no it was three months ago and drama bond before it was a week ago no it was a year and a half it's time flies what is meant by the time is close some scholars say and this is the most authentic that there is no Baraka there is no blessing in time I need the biography of share of the live in G brain who died about 12 years ago near lavish and so one of the major scholars of Islam or contemporary times and I find that he conducts on daily basis not less than 12 lessons well this is before fetcher with the shiftin selected group of his students after fajar in the masjid and then from that till bahar time and then before door after door before also after a sir after mother after isha three four classes what is this what kind of a life is this yet he wasn't happily married with his children goes visitation and towards Saudi Arabia from Mecca Medina Riyadh Jeddah Dammam and he goes and gave lectures plus his day job and excuse me come on what is this he's the magician Houdini could not do something like that this is Baraka when Allah puts Baraka in your life you compared to one spending so much time working over time meetings yet there's no balakay and his wealth all the money he's making the first week of the month is gone his children don't see him he doesn't call his mom he doesn't have time for leisure or sport but the other man he works eight hours and he saves money he's building his house back home another second home his wife and family and children have quality times every day not every week they go out shopping together they go for holidays all of his kinship know him he calls them they call him what is this there's something wrong it's the same effort education family status the problem is with Baraka you may earn 200 dinars and you're building an apartment in your country and you may earn two thousand dinars in the middle of the month can I borrow something from you where is your money in school no Baraka so the best Baraka is in your knowledge I have so much here am i sharing it with Muslims in my teaching people I remember share Hamid in the Salah had managed it may Allah preserve him I am envious I'm not a person of hate but I'm envious whenever I see that he has Islam Q&A website the guy is asleep and he is getting credit the world from people's benefitting 2017 in that year 9 0 million visitors to his website in Ramadan 2017 only 15 million visited the website what kind of rewards the man is getting well I am envious why is he getting it easy and I'm not getting it easy because there is barakah in his life I said I him and I we shared the same platform we have sad TV channel he has so many clips he goes to the channel this is ok let's make one for a sure the nature one for Ramadan one for Baha pray and he makes certain it's for the public you get it on your whatsapp you get it on your email dream and I struggled to make one program a week and this is no Baraka so this is from Allah solution but the sign do you all feel it that the time is getting closer this is a clear sign that the Prophet used to say I'll give you a final example there's a possibility would not be for Asia but you shall out with we are on the schedule and he shall go he will finish the motorbike insha Allah Lyudmila the happiness of the Prophet item that I've mentioned yesterday today Allah don't remember I mentioned it in my visit the Prophet said Alex auto salon after salat a fetcher who among you is fasting today Abu Bakr raised his hat who among you fed a poor person abu bakr raise his hand when did you get the time to feed a poor person it's fair prayer which means that the guy is working at night as well it's not only daytime the prophet said who visited a sick person abu bakr said i did who followed a funeral until it was buried Abu Bakr said I did among all the Companions these four things were done by Abu Bakr in a single day this is bark not from our mattress my Abubakar this is why it's the first of the old woman to enter gender after the popular sir he seeded number one because he deserved it he worked hard for it and Allah bless him may Allah be pleased with him among the things among the signs is the widespread of usury known to us as Arriba now Reba is in everything you do financial institutions are the biggest the richest and it is one of the lucrative jobs any fresh grad would dream to own or to have I worked in conventional banks 40 years ago before even knowing that ribeyes haram and it is the best environment working suits ties lots of cappuccinos meetings training courses like crazy highly paid jobs you learn something new every day very beautiful but what does the Prophet say alehissalaam Sarah the Prophet said that there will come a time when people would take money carrying less whether it is halal Haram and the Prophet also said that no one would gather a lot of money of RIBA except Allah would make his end to be less you'll find them the richest you will find them collecting money in millions it is that it would be less and this is why we always hear about financial institutions countries that have so much strength in their finance all of a sudden the bubble burst and they are begging people no jobs no economy nothing because they are fighting Allah and the Prophet Allah so Allah has mentioned in surah al-baqarah fact then will be happening there will come out a war waged against you by Allah and His Messenger for those who consume RIBA now if we want to go into details we will not finish until future but each and every one of you has a credit card each one of you has money in the conventional banks that they are taking without your consent lending it to people with RIBA taking the interest and maybe give you interest and you think that this is okay this is profit people have mortgages and mortgages are all most likely to be RIBA based yesterday our brother asked us in the lecture he said someone a brother asked that somewhat asking him for investment so he gave him a hundred thousand and this is for two years and each month the businessman is giving him return of 20,000 fixed the capital is guaranteed not to lose a penny this is RIBA and I know for certain that the vast majority of Muslims are dealing with this out of lot of out of ignorance they don't know so many people come to me in the message saying we have a problem that you would like you to judge and to solve I gave my friend money to invest and he said that he lost the money and I want my capital back Geneva if you get it back this means that it was alone and now you want your loan this is your right was it the lonely you know and then this this is gone oh he treated me how much it hippie do  well I think this is problematic then Reba is widely spread be careful of it we can't move on any explain more because it's so clear to people nowadays people try to justify by saying no no no no no technicality rebate is only in six things gold silver wheat barley dates and salt how I said this is deer ham dinner there is no Reba in that they tried but they have no knowledge one of the science of the Day of Judgment is the existence of musical instruments Allah Masoli wa sallim ala muhammad said at the end of time there will be landslides stoning from the sky and transmutation into animals we will see this you will see humans turning into pigs and monkeys this is not a figure of speech you will see this Darwin would have been happy but this would happen what is that the Prophet says are some when stringed instruments and female singers will be widespread and wine will be permitted this is the voice stars Academy Americans Got Talent UK Got Talent I don't know who else has talent so you can so you think you can dance or something like that programs based on what on music it is infesting the Muslim world especially the Arab world concerts everywhere women coming and singing orchestras being conducted what do we do with the hadith the no no no sure you've got it all wrong music is inspirational music calms the soul cleanses the heart when I listen to Beethoven or to Mozart or to Bach Allah Akbar some had Allah what what happened to you oh I feel so calm even the cows were being milked the productivity of the milk increases when they listen to Bob I said are you a cow you want the productivity to be increased what is the relationship share beautiful music is good for the soul what's wrong with music what's wrong with music what's wrong is that a logical prohibited it in three places in the Quran and the Prophet assalam prohibited it in sahih al-bukhari and elsewhere and the four schools of thought Abu Hanifah Malik Shah freely and happily pampered agreed on prohibiting it I would if I went an extra mile and he said that anyone who enjoys listening to music his school of thought anyone who enjoys listening to music is a kafir this is the Chanukah school of thought which people say our happy is not that strong this is what they say so now when we come to this what do we find we find that we have a problem I enjoy music shake I like to listen to my every single male or female and this is why I have it on my mobile phone then so large we're praying and we hear not a ringtone we hate Justin Justin people singing or Madonna or beyoncé or what are you doing sure sorry Ally I forgot okay this you forgot the Salah outside of Salah well I love this miss song sure I gotta I'm helpless okay now lasagna combined you both under the objections in the same place what are you doing nothing this is Haram so why is it Hannah it corrupts your heart I get youth people young men coming to me and say Cher I have a problem I pray five times a day but whenever I make record or should I say subhanAllah BRB or subhana wa balada in the same melody of a song it is corrupting your mind why is it when you listen to soft music you tend to drive 30 km/h in the highway people are giving you high beams and hoping you as Celine Dion but driving but if you listen to pop music or hard rock you're exceeding 200 kilos per hour who's playing with you go to the gym like I do and I tell them to turn off the music everybody else in the gym are not capable of lifting anything turn on the music masha'Allah they become Arnold Schwarzenegger's why because this is from shaitan allah Sojin said in surah that islam chapter 17 verse steps is manna stop ottoman whom basaltic provoked them with your sound in a Mujahid said the sound of Shaitaan is the musical instruments it gives you power we do aerobics put Musharraf a see you're gonna sleep but put music with beach and you find that you're strong and this is from Japan this is an addiction and this is why we fast Ramadan to get over the addiction of eating and drinking we fast from her arm because once you're addicted to the music to the lyrics to the way of life this corruption Islam but people are taking it lightly part of the day the science of the Day of Judgment is the widespread of naked women who are closed and this is what the Prophet said that is awesome there are two types of people of hell that I have not seen yet men with whips like the tails of cattle with which they strike the people and women who are closed yet naked clothes yet naked walking with an anti sighing gate a way of walking that makes people head turn the Prophet says are they saw it was Salam with something on their heads that looks like the humps of camel and this is prevalent here and in the Gulf countries women locals especially wear these hair like the humps of camels and they were there are buyers etc but you can tell the Prophet says Allah his salat WA Salam leaning to one side when they walk they don't walk straight they lead and they make men when they look at them lean as well being attracted to that they will never enter paradise or even smell its fragrance although the fragrance of Parana can be detected from such-and-such a distance this is scary how can a woman be naked while close scholars say either wearing tights and this is obvious women wear nowadays what they call leggings and there are they is open if she wears our bio so when she walks you can see her thighs and legs her body shape as if she's naked these clothes covered the imperfection and her skin but you can see the shape and this is more beautiful than when you see it nude or they wear transparent clothes and this is very famous among the ladies especially in weddings where only women are there so they were transparent very short mini skirts or dresses that show and expose everything underneath and my women folk come back from so many weddings not attending them what happened said what why we went in and we were afraid that allowed collapse a ceiling aren't they Muslims to Allah hey they are Muslims and from reputable families but when you don't have Islam in your heart when you don't have the correct measurements to weigh the good and bad the pros and cons this what happens all what you care about is fashion and this is a defect in your belief part of the science of the Day of Judgment is good vision good dreams the Prophet said are a solid sternum towards the end of time hardly any dreams that the Muslims he will not come true the one whose dreams are the most truthful will be the one whose speech is the most honest the dreams of a Muslim from one of the 45 parts of prophecy I will not go into details because this requires etiquettes of Dreams and false dreams and good dreams and the interpretation but if there will come a time when you see a good vision a good dream that does not require interpretation it is so clear and it will happen as you had seen it and this is part of 46 parts of prophecy prophethood is divided into 46 part what are these six parts scholars say that the time of prophethood of the Prophet our assertion was how many years 23 6 months of them before he became a prophet where crystal-clear dreams where for six months whenever he saw a dream it came like the break of dawn and his awesome so scholar said 6 months out of 23 years this is a portion of 46 portions of prophethood and this is what was meant by the Prophet SAW - Salam nowadays people spend so much time in looking for interpretation of their dreams I get so many calls sure I saw a dream and I'd like you to interpret it I don't know I don't have knowledge and dreams I can make up things for you if you wish but this doesn't work people are obsessed by saying by asking people to interpret their dreams for them this is not the Islamic proper way of doing it but this is what will happen at the end of time so the most truthful in speech in honest a person who does not lie he would be the most who would get dreams that would come true and be truthful some scholars say that this can only be at the end of time when risa peace be upon him would descend because then there would be no lying no cheating as we will come to discuss it tomorrow insha'Allah one of the signs is mentioned in the authentic hadith the Prophet told us alehissalaam Asura that the hour would not be called until the Arabian Peninsula becomes as it used to be grazing grounds and rivers share have dilma sheet as then Danny one of the scholars of contemporary time who specializes in studying the miracles of the Quran and the Sunnah through the spectrum of science he said I met one of the greatest geologists of our times and I told him this hadith and the man was not a Muslim he said yeah this is logical due to global warming and through due to the change a change in the environment and the climate this will happen the rain will be more on the Arabian Peninsula and it will be grazing grounds for cattle and there will be jungles and do big green areas we'll be rivers so this is not a prophecy this is normal Cheryl machine said to him I'm not talking about the future the Prophet said Ali Saleh to us on the day of judgment will not come until the Arabian Peninsula will be grazing grounds and rivers like it used to be now you tell me how did the Prophet know as I saw to serve that thousands of years ago this was the fact the man was shot sin in the future can be predicted but in the past who gave him this information and the man accepted Islam and Hum Dil a soldier in the past tens of some tens of thousands of years ago this was the fact in their a B Peninsula there were ostriches there were Tigers there were wild animals that we see in Africa but without the proper instruments and knowledge you could not know this this will happen now and we see in the global warming what's happening in the earth that this is coming people in Spain Portugal people in Europe are crying from the temperature of 40 degrees 42 degrees come to hear doctor quit it I just passed by the condition the temperature is 43 and there are people cooking in what are you doing I was shocked a man from Jeddah but not as hot as this Jerry people are normal so there will come a time where insha'Allah the Arabian Peninsula the temperatures be moderate and fine and we would have as the Prophet had said re salat wa salam among the signs is boasting with messages the Prophet erase a lot of among the signs of the Day of Judgment that people would boast about their misdeeds places of worship and this is happening now I personally know a lot of the people who build message and decorate them and spend so much money in them that they do not pray one single prayer in it why did you build it said well my friend builded the billionaire built a Masjid and it's called Masjid awesome so I'd like to build a message it and call it after me and this is what the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam even a bus may Allah be pleased with him said by Allah you will decorate your message it's like the Jews and the Christians decorate their places of worship do they decorate their places of worship enter any church and you will find Michael Angelo's drawings and beautiful statues colors windows and this is why we tell people when you go abroad do not allow your children to enter much churches and places of worship of other religions why because your children are not that strong in the Eman they go to churches and they see that the priest is coming with a three-piece suit beautiful type clean shaven looks like a Hollywood actor when he gives a sermon it's very nice educated eloquent you look at the church beautiful pictures clean then it's time for a Friday prayer he goes and he looks at the Masjid a bottle here a napkin there the cher comes wearing a maxi Thor shorter and he has a dream pocket miss wad and he shouts and scares the hell out of them and he will enter hell and you were this in the well I think the other one is better if you don't have strongly man you will be fooled though you don't know that underneath the three-piece suit is a person that does not clean himself when he urinates or difficut Islam is beautiful inside and out their religion is beautiful from the outside and but not from the inside the Prophet settling salat WA Salam if you wear to decorate your messages and beautify your forehand now we have rainbow color Quran well you have pink pages read pages blue pages decorations you have quran's will cover of hello kitty what is this where are you taking us guys so cute so cute I would be like a miniature television the Prophet said if you decorate your messages beautify your core and destruction from Allah will fall upon you these messages are not made to boast about it's made to worship well lie I remember till date one of the most beautiful Friday prayers that I've offered was in Mumbai in India I was doing some shootings for peace TV and doctors Atkins Allah had appointed one of the drivers to take me somewhere close the driver was a shepherd an orthopedic surgeon a famous orthopedic brother surgeon who took me to a machine had no ceilings except from you know Peck shift four or five fans I'm coming from the Gulf amuse air conditioning well I don't know carpet only Haseeno get this made of strong but the prayer there was so close to my heart I felt like I was among the Sahaba nobody is showing off people are coming from their work from their jobs praying to Allah so virgin nothing while we have other intentions we have to be careful of the kind of root we wear in our deeds so that when people give Salam to us we have to have certain types of carpets of loudspeakers of amplifiers there the salat is easy this is the salat that I would never ever forget then we wish for death this is one of the signs but I think that we are approaching our time tomorrow we will finish like 8 or 10 of the remaining signs and then we will go to the major signs the 10 major signs some of them would take us a good hour and three of them would take us a good couple of minutes so inshallah we will try to wrap things up tomorrow I pray to Allah Azza WA JAL that he makes me and you steadfast on Islam that he increases our knowledge that he purified purifies our intention for his sake and that we would not be tested or tried beyond our ability in our adalah kappa dear villager hej dear o sallallahu sallim ala nabina muhammad"
