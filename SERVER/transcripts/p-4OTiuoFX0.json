  "transcript": "and today's reminder as usual is what everyone is talking about the covered 19 or the coronavirus and you as well as I have heard tons and tons of posts information sound clips read about it and a great chunk of it is nonsense is baseless is not authentic yet we tend to have this addiction to receive and send on whatsapp on Facebook on Twitter without verifying things which led people to be one of two either the vast majority who are panicking who are going to the supermarkets buying things that they don't need just in case you never know and stacking things in their homes overreacting to anything isolating themselves beyond logic and reason or those who are careless who keep on gathering defying the recommendations and the instructions of the authorities and deciding to act like Rambo not paying attention to anyone's laws or legislations endangering themselves and others yet the middle path which we get from the Quran under the Sunnah dictates that we take the necessary precautions while connecting our hearts to Allah trust in allah believing that life and death is in a las hands take the necessary measurements but don't panic don't overreact or do it because inevitably you're going to die and there are so many reasons for dying and with the grace of allah azzawajal this calamity this crisis will pass will weather and go away and what remains is how we reacted so people have to believe that such a calamity was preordained fifty thousand years before allah before allah created the whole universe it was written down so believe in that when you believe in it your heart becomes calm you get a lot of tranquility instead of seeing people restless depressed stressed anxious having panic attacks why because of the amount of media displayed to them every single day five hours six hours fatalities ins in Italy six hundred plus died today five hundred died as a day and people panic and there's no need to panic if you are a healthy person if you do not smoke if you consume a lot of fruit and vegetables especially c√©dric's and oranges Kiwis lemons vegetables green leaves vegetables and you're healthy and you're taking the necessary precautions you wash your hands thoroughly and you try to avoid public places without overreacting you go shopping you do see people you mix with people this is normal but keep your contact away if you manage to do that your belief in destiny grants you a good life everyone asks how is life to you and you hear complaints I'm out of job I don't have money I can't go out I can't go to the gym I can't go to weddings my son's wedding has been postponed the gatherings the graduation the work that cetera complains those who know that this was predestined are okay with it Allah chose this for us and it's good for us so they are comfortable with it they're calm and they're making a lot of dua for a lot to protect them and their loved ones but they're not stressed they do not have anxiety or panic attacks they're mellow they're okay and to have a good life in this world Allah tells us man a -
