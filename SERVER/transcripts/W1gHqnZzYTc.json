  "title": "Husband doesn't like my parents & speaks badly of them, what to do? Must we keep ties with in laws?",
  "transcript": "my husband is good with me and our kids but he does not like my family and he doesn't want to meet them and whenever their topic comes up he uses bad language for my parents and siblings and it hurts me immensely any advice well we have the long virgin and the short version so the short version is don't ever bring the topic to him that's it never discuss your parents or your family or your siblings at all the longer version would be everybody has a particular shortcoming we have our own flaws and if you look in the mirror yourself you'll find a lot of flaws so in order for us to understand that we want others to accept us with our shortcomings and flaws we also have to accept them with their shortcomings and flaws as long as your husband is kind to you and to the children and he's a good man he simply doesn't want to meet your parents or your siblings or your family he doesn't want to visit them and he doesn't want them to visit him he simply doesn't like them so why shove them down his throat why force them upon him when islamically he is not at all obliged to go and visit to go and speak to them to go and be courteous to them though this indicates if he does that he is almost perfect person if i love someone i love those whom she loves so i don't care about her parents and siblings but because they mean so much to her i would be kind to them and always try to make them happy to see to see their daughter happy but this is not mandatory upon me so if i don't want to see my in-laws at all there's no harm done i'm not sinful because they're not my kinship my kinship are from my father and mother's side these are my in-laws i'm not obliged to meet them though it's against the norm so i would highly advise you to put a lead on it and not to bring their topic to him at all especially when you know that this triggers him off leave him as long as he doesn't stop you from going visiting communicating with them leave him never ask him to come and meet and tell them that because of you you don't want any of them to speak with him or to invite him to weddings just let him be in peace and inshaallah this would work just fine"
