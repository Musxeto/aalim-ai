  "transcript": "says is it true that when Maham asked to see Allah Allah told him to look at the mountain and he placed the tip of his fingers and the mountain crumbled I don't know if this is true as Allah is high above all his creation the answer is no this is not true and it's not authentic it was narrated that some of the Companions and this is where people may get lost in translation whenb Abbas for example was uh explaining the Ayah and he said that Allah unveiled himself to the Mount and the mount crumbled and it was turned into dust and he he did this so with his thumb he took a very tiny bit of the joint of his uh uh pinky finger I think they call it meaning that Allah unveiled himself this little little much to the Mount which made the mountain of crumbled and turned into dust not that Allah has placed his own finger subhanahu wa'ta'ala though we acknowledge and we believe as Muslims that Allah has two hands that Allah has fingers but all of Allah's attributes and beautiful features are unlike anything that we can imagine so the only thing that is shared is the name but the actual uh uh similitude of it this is something that Allah knows knows and Allah subhana tala knows"
