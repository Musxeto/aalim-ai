  "title": "Can we lend money or give zakat to help someone pay off their riba loans or mortgage assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what can I do for you yeah I have a question uh our relative has taken with loan about how she wants her roll back because she don't want to deal in River but does not have full amount of money is it permissible for me to help her by providing some amount of money so that she gets her gold back by paying the riba and she promised to give my money back if you're asking about lending her money and she's going to pay you back this is permissible if you're asking about assisting her paying her riba based uh interest and the answer is no you're not allowed to give from charity or from zakat to someone who's paying off his river-based loan because this would be assisting them and encouraging them to do it over and over again so many people say my father took a mortgage on the house and now he's asking us to help him pay the installments no this is not permissible helping him meaning that you're paying interest to the bank and he will take another loan as in many cases I've seen in the UK and elsewhere where the father just keeps on buying houses on mortgages and doesn't care the sons will pay people would give me from zakat this is not permissible but lending a particular individual money whether they're going to pay their interest or they're going to buy something or there's no problem as long as they will pay it back"
