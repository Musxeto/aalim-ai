  "transcript": "uh there is a sister who used to commit all types of major sins she used to go to dargas not pay the daily prayers Etc now later she quit all this since and she has a good Iman now and she is fearful of Allah and she is a practicing Muslim alhamdulillah but she did not fulfill all the conditions of the repentance like having the remorse so does she have to list all her past sense and repent for them individually then uttered the shahada and take gusul now Salman Bhai what do you mean by she did not fulfill the conditions and she doesn't have remorse do you mean when she she remembers her days in dargas and committing Shirk and different sins that she feels happy and miss these days no no no so then she's remorseful I will answer your question this is one of the ways where shaytan messes up big time with our heads I have a lot of brothers and sisters coming to me in counseling sessions and they complain that they feel fear hypocrisy that they get these Whispers of shirk and that they're disbelievers and they're entertaining it and blah blah and some of them even weep and cry during these live sessions as if I don't know what's happening with the people and I tell them take a look at the mirror look how shaytan how Satan is messing up with you he's playing with you there's nothing wrong with you said no all my remorse is doubtful I am committed shirk I committed and none of this did take place likewise this sister repented started to practice he's a good Muslim she observes her Salah she's way way far away from kufer and shirk shaytan is coming to her and say you don't you do not have remorse what is Remorse by the way is it a red light that ah lights on your head showing people that oh he's remorseful no it's a feeling in the heart were you regretful and remorseful of what you had practiced and done in the past someone who used to be a playboy fornicating and partying and doing all types of sins repented he's chased married with kids and he leads a good Islamic life whatever he remembers these Wild Nights he doesn't have a smirk on his face he doesn't smile he doesn't feel man those were the good days I wish I could you know have a Nitro too no when he remembers it he's remorseful immediately he says oh Allah forgive me oh Allah was ignorant oh Allah I didn't know what I was doing May Allah's forgiveness and mercy fall upon me this is remorse someone who is not remorseful is someone who brags about it hey remember what we did in 2012. remember what we did in this city or in that nightclub oh we had a good time I wish we could do that again next time we should book in a better Hotel because that hotel was lousy we should do this we should do that this is a person that has no remorse so get out get these ideas out of your mind because this is the objective of shaytan and Allah Knows Best"
