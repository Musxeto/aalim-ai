  "title": "Sisters struggling with identifying discharges ( OCD ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um you said in a previous video that as long as the discharge has a light yellowish to it then it's fine but then I get a discharge it looks white but then on the White surface I see yellowish into it but I don't know if this is slightly yellow you know yellow that is not just so the yellow the snatches is supposed to be yellow that you know it's very obvious that anyone can see it is that it's when it snatches how would I know and I get so many questions like this and we have limited knowledge as men in what women may suffer of so I don't believe that it is appropriate to keep on asking the Sheikh and digging in into small details and oxidization some sisters send me questions about oxidizations and it's white but after a while it might have this I'm not a chemist how would I know so I would advise sisters who are getting these ocds and so many questions similar to this to ask the Elders of their women folk ask your mom ask your aunts as your cousins and they as women have a collective information about this and what is doubtful or what is clear maybe they will all say them yeah you're crazy this is white this is not yellowish and so many times this does happen so I would highly advise you guys to do this and Allah Knows Best"
