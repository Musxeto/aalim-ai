  "title": "Zakat to Syed - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh ibn zaheer says from india i have a cousin who is poor and he belongs to the descendants of the prophet sallam he's a saiyid so can we give him from zakat the answer is it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that they can be given from zakat as long as the muslim government does not provide for them because it is part of the muslim government to give for the descendants of the prophet saws they have a share in the treasury of the muslims unfortunately this is not being practiced and hence you can just ask them to die so they are eligible for zakat if they are poor or need you"
