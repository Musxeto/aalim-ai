um I will explain all that at the end inshallah but for now cuz we've already start late as it is in I'll bring the she to speak to us about the position of women in Islam it is another is exclusive event and he came all from Jed Saudi Arabia all welcome sayd [Music] it would probably cause me a sports injury if I keep on looking to the right and to the left so I would request the brothers to be here the topic is women in Islam and to tell you the truth when I started thinking about this topic I said to myself why women in Islam why not men what's so special about women that we should give them a full lecture this is the time of Human Rights this is a time of equality so when you talk about women in Islam as if you're saying that they are of a second degree a second level and by Allah they're not whenever you come to think about women in Islam who's the first woman that comes into your mind Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her that wonderful woman the prophet tells ustic Hadith that so many men have reached the level of completion they were complete as men as people as humans in women only four reached that level and among them is khad may Allah be pleased with herad why if you read her biography you would not find a lot of achievements she wasn't a biochemist she was she did not introduce the nuclear bomb she was not this or she was not that she was the perfect woman to her husband the prophet Alat wasam when he was first revealed to he came back home shivering he was frightened he wasn't feeling good and he said by Allah Khadijah I'm afraid for myself for my sanity I'm afraid that something wrong had happened to me today's wives if the husband comes home shivering and shaking what is the first thing they do cover him with a blanket turning on the AC or turning it off why are you late where are the groceries you've been with your boys you've been with your buddies and she starts snagging for a couple of hours until he gets a heart attack that's why women over live man mashallah not all of them of course not of all I'm I'm just joking huh don't quote me and put it in the newspapers I'm just joking khad may Allah be pleased with her said to him NE be of good cheer don't worry no don't worry Allah will not do this to you she says for by Allah Allah will never disgrace you you uphold the ties of kinship you speak truthfully you help the poor and destitute you serve your guests generously and assist those who are stricken by Calamity this is the woman that every man looks up to of course every woman as well but this is the woman the first person on Earth to believe in the prophet Alat before Abu Bakr before Ali may Allah be pleased with them all she's the first one to believe and accept Islam when you look at the first martyr in Islam who is she who is she sua the mother of amarb Y may Allah be pleased with them all the first to be martyred in Islam when you look at the first one to assist the prophet she was also a female asak when the prophet migrated and he was hiding in the cave she used to bring him the food she used to bring him the water so if you look at even those who used to give advice to the prophet Alat wasam among his wives so many men nowadays feel arrogant feel that they are way above the level of Consulting women in some parts of Arabia when they call or when they mention the name of their wives they never do that when they mention women they would say may Allah have any excuse me for what I'm going to say so he said my family excuse me for what I'm going to say as if they're calling something as dirt or something that is disrespectful this is the ignorance that some who claim to be Muslims may have the prophet used to seek the advice of his wives and he did not feel bad about it he did not feel that he was doing something unfitting of a man may Allah be pleased with her he consulted her he used to consult her he used to consult all of his wives but the most famous uh story is in the Battle of hudia when he signed the treaty with the kufar with the pagans and within the conditions of the treaty is that they go back and come for the following year so the prophet talked to the sahabah may Allah be pleased with them and told them to shave and Slaughter their sacrifice none of them moved the prophet was angered by this and he went to um Sal and he told her don't you look at your people they're not complying with what I tell them to do she said no problem prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam go out and call the barber to come and shave your head and see what happens and the prophet did this immediately all the men all the companions jumped to shave one another until they were in dangered inuring themselves of injuring themselves or killing themselves just to comply with the action of the Prophet so women in Islam has a special status I'll not speak about women in the old or new testament I'll not speak about women at the time of the Greeks or the Romans or the bantian and you can find this easily if you Google it and you will see how horrendous they used to treat women I'll not speak even about how in some Nations women when wowed they are buried they're criminate with their husbands so if a man dies they would burn his wife with him and and this is still happening in the 25 uh 20 what Cent are in 27 21st anyway this is for the recording so it would and he be fit in seventh Century's time in Arabia before Islam females were subjugated big time to the extent that if a man gets a girl a child he will kill it he will execute it he will burn he will bury it alive and this is mentioned in the Quran Allah says and when the female infant buried alive as the Pagan Arabs used to do shall be questioned for what sin she was killed in Islam Islam came to change all of this Allah made it clear to us in black and white men and women are equal at the sight of Allah so if I pray and my wife prays I would not look down at her and say listen my prayer is better my prayer is more complete I'm closer to Allah it's all the same Allah says oh mankind we've created you from a male and female and made you into a Nations and tribes that you may know one another so it is not me responsible only for the family the whole family is been created by the two of us Allah created both of us and the family was created through US Allah says never will I follow never will I allow to be lost the work of any of you be male or female so at the sight of Allah Asel males and females they all offer good deeds and this is what will decide their position in Paradise with the grace and mercy of Allah however ever men have an edge and this Edge is necessary it's not something that is complementary you cannot have a ship with two captains one says east and the other one says West it will sink you have to have a captain but having a captain does not mean that he is the best on board this me this is something administrative it has to do with Administration so you may have a wife and a husband but the wife is far far superior than the husband and the one of the four women is a clear example which one Asia Asia the wife of pharaoh no one thinks that Pharaoh because being the head of state because of being so and so and so is better than Asia Asia by far is there's no comparison she's in Jenna and he is in the depth of Hellfire Allah says in the Quran and they that is the women have rights over their husbands as regards of living expenses Etc similar to those of their husbands over them as regards of obedience and respect to what is reasonable but men Allah says and but men have a a degree of responsibility over them so it goes without saying to any Muslim that a Muslim woman is so protected in Islam far more than a Muslim man you agree can you give me examples no okay I I'll do this so that we would save the time in Islam men are instructed are ordered to lower their G days whenever a woman passes by especially if she's beautiful she's ugly nobody's going to look at her but especially and she's beautiful you it's a must that you lower your gaze not only that to increase her protection and to safeguard her from these human wolves or vampires depending on your culture Allah instructed them to wear the hijab and not only that imagine a word in a society that Praises free speech and honors it so they claim a word in Islam that comes out of the mouth of a person whether male or female against a chaste female this is punishable in Islam Allah says in the Quran and those who accuse chased women and produce not for Witnesses flog them with 8 stripes and reject their testimony forever do not accept their testimony at court forever they indeed are the they are the Liars they are the rebellious they are the disobedient to Allah imagine one word you say about a woman you see walking on the street and you say that uh she's she's she's not clean she's not a righteous woman she's doing Hanky Panky she's doing this or that and you say bad things about her okay produce four Witnesses I have no Witnesses even if you saw that then okay this is what you're going to be be punished in Islam not only that in this life also in the Hereafter Allah says in the Quran verily those who accuse chased women who never even think of anything touching their Chastity and are good Believers these women are good Believers and they never go that road Allah says at those who accuse them they are cursed in this life and in the Hereafter and for them will be a great torment who's doing this why is this being done to protect women why is this being done to protect women women are so valuable you can't even say a bad word against them in Islam a husband has no right in beating his wife he has no right in saying something about her face commenting on her her face in a negative s in Islam it's completely forbidden for me to go to my wife and say you have an ugly face even if we're fighting it's it's it's un Islamic it's a sin I cannot beat her I cannot uh insult her the prophet tells usam that a lot of women passed by my wives yesterday complaining of their husbands beating them by Allah they are not among the best of you these men are not not among the best of you they are among the worst of you and that is why the prophet said the best of you to their wives are the best of the Muslims and I am the best of the Muslims so the more you are good tolerant forgiving kind loving caring to your Ms to your wife the better Muslim you are and Islam relieved women from a lot of responsibilities by putting these responsibilities on the shoulder of men for example women are not obliged to provide for the family A woman it's not her responsibility to work it's not her responsibility to help her husband financially not only that even if she was a multi-millionaire and her husband was struggling to make ends meat Islam tells her you are not obliged to pay one penny he has to buy you the dresses he has to buy you the perfume he has to send you flowers if he wants to do that you are not financially by any uh uh chance or case obliged to do any of this Allah is protecting women so Allah tells them that pray in your houses you don't have to pray jum you don't have to pray mandatory praise in the Masjid this is an obligation only on men so this is for their protection they're not requested to go and defend the country to give Jihad it there are our precious stone they should stay at home we protect them some would say okay my my wife is much stronger than me she has black belt and Jiu-Jitsu she always beats the hell out of me let her go go and defend no she islamically has to sit home and be honored and uh respected it is a mistake common mistake when you have these forms that women fill name Sur name family name and then working woman or a housewife this is wrong the best of working women is a housewife if you're working in a job usually you're working from 9 to 5 correct a housewife a mother she works 24 hours 7 days a week if you work on a job if you have to come for a meeting or for a a dinner meeting from 7 to to 900 p.m. you get overtime a housewife a mother does not get over time she wakes up at 1:00 to change her diapers she wakes up at 3:00 in the morning to feed the the child she does this so she is 24/7 working assisting and she is being reward for every second that passes a woman in Islam is she's either a mother a daughter or a wife and each one has its own god-given right the prophet was approached by a man oh prophet of Allah which one of my parents I should go out of my way to do good things and to obey and respect the prophet says your mother and then he said okay who's next and he says your mother and he says who's next Prophet says your mother he says who's next then he said your father so 75% of your obedience and respect and compassion and love and care should be devoted to your mother unfortunately this is not the case whenever I come back from F prayer I wake up my wife if she's not awake and I tell her to go and wake up the children and she goes and spends half an hour waking them up I can hear her shouting screaming jumping hanging at the chandelier dropping and doing whatever she can to wake the children and no soul is moving and the minute I come and I say wake up everybody's awake and she says why don't you relieve me from this Duty because they listen to you and they do not listen to me and I said because you did not upbring them correctly they should have this respect This Love This care for you more than they do for me but because the mother is more uh loving car merciful than the father they usually are taking it for granted they're intimidated by the father but not by the mother and this is not the Islamic way as for the girl the daughter of yours has more responsibility than the boys and that is why the prophet told us about the great reward of having girls those who have girls are blessed before Arabia in the old times of Arabia before Islam those who have girls are doomed that's why they want out of Shame boys can go out and play and at the end of the day they repent they prolong their their beard and shorten their th they become good Muslims but when girls go and fool around the glass once broken is very difficult to be amended and and and fixed so by Nature people think that ah girls must be protected but they may bring shame they may bring uh a sorrow to us so let's kill them that's what they used to think in Arabia Islam came changed this completely the prophet saidat only on girls not on boys whoever is tested by Allah with these girls but he up brings them in an Islamic way they will be a shield for him from hell in another narration they will take him into Paradise so that's why Muslims when they are blessed with girls they feel happy and they feel content because alhamdulillah they have means of getting to Paradise other than the normal means as for the MS is already time okay as for the wife it is yeah it goes be without saying in Islam those who are kind to their wives they're the best of Muslims and that is why the prophet was the best of men to his wives the prophet tells usam that this world is transient comfort and the best of it is what huh a righteous wife this is the best thing on earth a righteous wife the prophet tells us a woman is usually married or sought after for her beauty for her lineage for her wealth and for her religion commitment the prophet says take the one with the religious commitment may your dust be uh uh uh may your hands be dusted and as if you're holding dust if you refuse to do this or may you prosp as in other interpretations if you take the one with the religious commitment this means that inshallah you will prosp you will prosper however this does not mean that you choose someone who's religiously practicing and ugly if you can choose someone who is religiously practicing and beautiful mashallah and if she comes from a good family Subhan Allah and if she's wealthy usually this is only found in Paradise but you cannot yeah give up keep on looking and inshallah Allah will bring you and as long as we're talking about marriage and maraging the one with the religious commitment does the father have the right and ability to give his daughter in marriage without her consent no it's a misconception among the Muslims they say yes he's the father he can do this a lot of the sisters email me telling me that my father is forcing me to marry my cousin my father is forcing me to marry someone from my own sect from my own country I live in the UK my father is forcing me to marry someone from uh uh our country so that he comes in and takes the Visa and then he gets the national sh the citizenship and so they asked and I say this is Haram it is your god-given right to stop and say no she says I'm you have to stop your father from forcing you to do something you will regret for the rest of your life this is an Islamic obligation okay if you're okay with the man it's okay alhamdulillah but if you're not do not agree a woman came to the prophet Alat and said oh prophet of Allah my my father gave me to his cousin or to his nephew in marriage without seeking my permission or consent and the prophet Alam revoked that marriage he said he has no right you can separate from him she said no I I would like to stay with him but I just wanted to make a point so so that the women after me know that they have the right to object and to reject such a marriage so a a girl or a daughter is not something that you sell is not something that you put for auction she is a human being and she has to have a say in the most important thing in her life which is her marriage yet in Islam she's protected by two means her father cannot give her in marriage without her consent and she can not marry someone without her father's consent because both uh uh uh approvals should be uh prior okay the most honorable woman now let me rephrase that can you that okay the most important role for a a woman is being a wife and a mother and this doesn't mean because now I I if I wear in my my daughter's shoes of my wife's shoes they wouldn't have any problem with homosexuality now this is a rephrasing it if I were in my daughter's shoes what would I say you're telling me father and the sometimes my my daughters claim this you're saying that the best role is to be a mother or a what or a wife but we have high aspiration we would like to work we would like to do this we would like to travel we would like to do so many things and I say okay no problem as long as it is within the Islamic limitations but what is more fruitful for you as an individual to stay and raise a family of imams of callers of so many uh uh uh beneficial people to the society to be the wife of a man who does so many great things for the society and you're honored you don't have to work you don't have to suffer and Allah is rewarding you by J if you look at the list of the things that women have to do in Islam to us it's very easy the prophet says if a woman fasts her uh her month Ramadan and she prays the five daily prayers like us huh fasting like men fasting and praying and she preserves her Chastity like men presumably men a little bit Y and finally she obeys her husband four things what happens the prophet says she'll enter Jenna she'll enter Paradise the men say I'd rather be a woman I have to pray for times a day in the Masid I have to provide for my family I have to smile in my boss face when I just want to smack him in the face I have to tolerate my neighbors I have to go and and and and do this with the car and the garage so many things to do and the women have only these things as if they were easy it's not I know it is one of the most difficult thing for a wife to be tolerant and obedient and loving to a husband that does not shower except once every couple a couple of months and whose mouth smell is as rotten as your socks and who does not care of how his hygiene and how he looks and all and Subhan Allah he the minute he enters the house he becomes crippled paralyzed he sits on the couch he's got the remote controls in his hand bring me a glass of water bring bring bring the the the ice cream make some popcorn do this do that Mash he sits on the couch he's got the remote controls in his hand bring me a glass of water bring bring bring the the the ice cream make some popcorn do this do that mashallah this is all what he does until it's 12:00 and then he goes to bed like a dead Beast it's a difficult thing for a sister to be a sister we have to acknowledge this but the reward is so huge it is Jenna and no one said that a woman may not work a woman can work a woman can be productive she can work in fields that suits her she can work in fields that suit her so if she works among the females in a in school in if she works in a hospital with the other sisters and it's an Islamic environment alhamdulillah let her do this no one ever objects on that the objection is when she works in an environment that may affect her negatively affect her Iman affect her Chastity affect her reputation in this case we draw a a red line maybe orange maybe depending on the country and say this is not the thing you should do because the best thing for a woman is to stay away from nonaham men and the best thing for men is to stay away from non Maham women you can be with your husband father brother uncle nephew stepson stepfather all the mams you have and do whatever you want but when it comes to a stranger who is not mam to you this raises the flag and that is why because of the impact of a woman over men Allah protected them does women have impact on men men ask answer yeah a little do men have impact over women sisters no bring 20 men and put one of the celebrities one of the actresses you know young I don't want to bring any names because m is soon so and then throw her in the circle what will happen to the 20 men you'll find their heads going like this 36 30 360° maybe one or two would say people are looking I can't look but the the rest would say the hell with it now do the opposite bring 20 sisters and put Tom cruzin in the middle maybe one would look and the rest alhamdulillah why because women are more content than men we we have a saying in Arabic men their eyes are not fixed it keeps on going left right and Center women are more content more focused more determined and that is why Islam preserves the community by segregating them in a sense of not looking down at them but as a protection for them and that is why Islam orders women to wear the hijab not only that Islam for bits seclusion so I cannot sit oneon-one with a sister teaching her the Quran well even if I teach her the Sunnah I cannot sit okay even you cannot sit with a sister who is not to you on onetoone basis because the prophet tolds usam that if a man is in seclusion with a woman the third one with them isan even if she's 10 years older 20 years older Shan is always there maybe it will not happen to first time maybe it not will not happen the first year but you have a a head of state in a country I would not say that's USA but something like this who fell to an entran and he had a beautiful wife and he's not a Muslim but he went and fell in Haram so what about us no we have a we have Quran we have barely what keeps us as Muslims Islam forbids a woman from traveling alone without a one would say why this is segregation said this is for her own protection imagine her traveling from here to rra in Mecca and the volcano in Iceland was it is erupted and she had to uh uh uh land somewhere for 3 4 weeks without a Maham without someone who takes care of her this is UN Islamic even for Hajj the prophet said that it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to to travel without a m one says oh prophet of Allah what about Hajj my name was registered an expedition so and so but my wife went for Hajj without a Mah she said he said leave your Expedition and go and follow your wife he did not ask is she beautiful or ugly he did not ask if she is she white or black is she young or old does she have a company of trustworthy women or on her own he did not ask immediately he told him this is not permissible no conditions under any condition she cannot travel she has to have a m Islam forbids a woman out of protection not because we want women to be ugly on the contrary women on the street must not wear things that draw attention to her so she's not allowed to wear makeup she's not allowed to beautify herself because this would be disrespectful for her if a sister does this as if she's saying look at me and Islam does not want her to do this you can be the most beautiful woman to your husband in your wife my English is awful in your in your what in your house edit this huh you have a lot to do editing to do in your house the wife can be a beauty queen and she is a beauty queen whether she does it or not every single woman is beautiful but unfortunately the media now is making our parameters of beauty change so it has these figures and these colors and these so and so before we had the media a black woman would love a black uh man and vice versa um a Chinese man would love a Chinese woman and a European would love a European now it's all European this is something to do with the medium so in your house you may become the most beautiful woman woman in your eyes or in the eyes of your husband when you're outside you are only secluded for the eyes of your husband not for the eyes of anyone else not only that Islam tells us that women must not soften their voice when they speak to I receive hundreds of calls a day and usually my wife is there and she says say this is a woman right I said how do you know said it's apparent when he sayum different than so this is a man Subhan Allah this is human nature when you speak with the opposite sex you have to be very careful you have to you know how to present yourself Islam tells the sisters do not use soft voice with men be serious do not joke some of the some some lectures I go to and I hear the sisters cracking jokes and laughing their heads off and I'm from here I'm sweating what are they doing they're not supposed to do this and that is why some schools of thought went to the extreme and said women's voice is and they should not speak and this is wrong nowhere in the Quran or in the Sunnah on the contrary a woman comes and complains to the prophet while all his companions are around him so he' not say sh don't speak no go ahead but it depends how are you going to speak hallelujah what are you doing be serious yes this is the way you should talk to a she or to any Tom Dick or Harry if it's needed so Islam emphasizes on taking care care of the girls especially when they're young and to be kind to them to give them love to give them affection to take them places to show them that they are a precious thing in our life and without taking care of these girls our society is bound to be destroyed they that is the girls the wives the sisters the mothers they are the same valve if we don't have it we will be doomed and therefore I could comfortably say that I can speak from today or from now until F time about the role of women but it's all rhetoric it's all words to to be said what is intended by this short reminder is for the brothers to know the importance of their wives sisters mothers and daughters to to honor them to respect them to do what Allah has ordered us and to follow the footsteps of the Prophet Alam when dealing with them and also for the Sisters to know their position in Islam and to reckon that they don't have anything to prove to us all what they have to prove is for Allah know your position know what you're required to do don't look what I want you to do or your father father want you to do or your your husband wants you to do look what Allah wants you to do and do it and inshallah you'll be among those going straight to paradise brother can you hear me we'll be taking the questions immediately"
