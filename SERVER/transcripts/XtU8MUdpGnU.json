  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to a new series of Mercy to Mankind on my right brother Sami HEI and to my left brother Muhammad alhilali they are going to participate with us inshallah in these series trying to discuss trying to learn and trying to know more about our Prophet Muhammad s and I believe that the importance in studying this division of Science of Islamic Sciences because this is a great an important division of the Islamic Sciences along with the Sciences of the Quran along with f along with so many other uh uh division visions of science it is important for us to study it nowadays due to the ignorance of people of his status may Allah exalt his mentioning so uh uh before we go into the importance of it now uh uh brother Muhammad what do you expect the proper word uh uh to be translated into s the biography of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasall so the biography of the Prophet is the equivalent to S and S is a very easy word so I hope that uh our viewers would get to be acquainted with it because we will be mentioning it on and on inshallah throughout these Series so the S of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is his biography now uh um brother Samy why do you think we should study the of the Prophet Alat from my point of view I think first of all that Allah the almighty said in the Holy Quran um you as Muslims should take the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam peace and prayers may be upon him as the role model for you okay then we should uh so you think know and um and um learn more and correctly about our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam so this means that although we have the Holy Quran for us to read and learn from yet we need a raw model an example to follow him in all his deeds in applying these instructions from Allah Asel so this is a very great and important objective by itself to study the S of the Prophet do you have any other reason yeah I think our Everlasting miracle in Islam is the Quran is the qur the Holy Quran okay and how would we understand the Quran without studying the biography of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he was the manifestation of the Quran and when say AA may Allah please with her as was asked about the prophet sallallah wasam she said he was a walk in Quran among the people okay so it's the only way to understand the Quran is to study his biography well to correct this uh uh uh brother Muhammad the uh uh Hadith was not as you have mentioned it because may Allah be pleased with her was asked about the morals uh uh the ethics of the Prophet Alat so she asked this gentleman or man who's asking her uh do you recite the Quran so he said yes I do so she told him that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam ethics and morals were the Quran so he was not a walking Quran this was said about the companions being applying the Quran in their life as if they were walking Quran with the instructions manifested in their behavior so again this is a very valid point we need to study the S of the Prophet Alat wasam because it explains to us the Quran in the best way possible whatever the prophet Sall alhi wasallam did was by the instructions and Orders of Allah so you will never ever find any conflict with the Quran and with the teachings of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam which you can easily find out through studying the of the Prophet Alat wasam and again we have to study the S so that we could inform others the non-muslims about this great man and if you ask anyone of the non-muslims about the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam you would find the majority not knowing about him and this is partly their mistake yet it is mainly our mistake because we have not done our role we have not done our homework in sharing this vast and important knowledge with the others one may ask again why Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam why the prophet of Islam and not any other messenger it is common knowledge it's only basic and uh basic knowledge to all that Muslims believe in all Messengers and prophets of Allah and any person saying one single negative thing about a prophet or a messenger of Allah is not considered to be a Muslim nullifies his Islam so if any one comes and says well Moses did this and that and he is not so and so this is a negative thing whoever did this is not a Muslim so we all we respect all the pro prophets and messengers of Allah so why pick Muhammad to study his biography and the answer would be uh is that the only messenger of Allah the only Prophet that we have documentation of his life of every single thing he did is the prophet Muhammad wasam no one on earth can come and say well we have the biography of Buddha or of confucious or of Moses or Jesus may Allah be pleased with Moses and Jesus uh uh all no one can come forward with such a biography because it does not exist and very little we know about uh uh the prophets and messengers of Allah through their books and also through the Quran this this is the only source of knowledge we have yet the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam we know exactly what happened before he was born we know exactly what happened when his father married his mother and we know exactly what happened between that that marriage and the day he died it is all documented it is all accepted by historians by Everyone by Scholars Muslims and non-muslims alike to be the uh uh preserved biography the the preserved s of the the prophet wasam and indeed the more you learn about him the more you get to love him and as Muslims loving the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam is not a choice it is a must you have to love him to uh uh be able to call yourself a Believer or a a mmin otherwise if you do not love the prophet Sall Ali wasallam you're not a Believer you are not a real mmin uh um I think that we should go on and and and set the the scene for uh uh uh the viewers and for us how was it like before uh the birth of the Prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam so how would you expect it to be like Sammy I think um and when when was that we're talking about about uh 15 15 centuries 15 571 yeah ad so you're talking about 15 centuries almost ago it's it's it's a long time so would we expect that the people had cell phones electricity no definitely not did they have any civil institutions any uh uh uh police departments fire departments they had governments yeah no it was chaotic yeah they used to call it the days of ignorance of course the days of ignorance but this is compared to what to to to that of the Prophet sallallahu alai which is Islam so we have the days of ignorance or the age or era of ignorance compared to Islam but what I want to talk about first of all is the location the geographical location the events mainly took place in Al hij District the environment surrounded the yes which is Mecca T and Medina so Mecca itself is in the middle of a valley surrounded by black mountains and Mecca was a sacred place it originated way back at the time of Abraham may peace and blessing be upon him as we know Abraham had two wives Sarah sah and hajer and hajer was from Egypt she was Egyptian so hajer was from Egypt Abraham was so old and he did not have any children and when he was about 80 years old he was blessed by Allah and haer gave him his first child ish and to his surprise when Ishmael was just an infant Allah ordered him to go to Mecca then his Elder son is Isaac no this is something disputable but the authentic would be that ishma is the the eldest older than uh Isaac so they moved to Mecca but Mecca was an empty deserted area it's a valley and there was no one there so he left them he abandoned them and walked away so hajer told him what are you doing there's no one here there's no grass there's nothing and he did not look back so she told him was it Allah who ordered you to leave us here of course we cannot do this because we don't get any revelation of Allah but he was a messenger of Allah and he was ordered to do this so he said yes Allah ordered me to leave you here so she said Allah will will not abandon us go on your way I think before we know what happened to hajer and her son Ismael that we will take a short break so inshallah we will be right [Music] back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in [Music] it M asalam alaykum and welcome back just before the break we reached the point where Abraham wasam abandoned hajer his wife and her son and infant son uh Ishmael and it was they were stranded there was nothing so she kept on going from one Hill to the other from the Safa to the mara trying to locate someone or some thing that can help them in her situation and their crisis and she could not find anything and the child was thirsty and hungry so he started hitting or digging the the ground with his very small tiny feet and the Archangel Gabriel came with his wing and dug that ground and to their surprise water came out from the ground and hajer started trying to ice contain the water so it would not go away because she did not have anything and that was known to be The Well of Z Zam Zam a while afterwards a tribe of Nomads was traveling and they showed the birds and they realized that there was water but they know that the land did not have any water so they came in and they saw the the woman and her child around that well and they requested to settle there she allowed them to do that and life began you said may Allah please he said Allah will will not abandon us yes and Allah indeed did not abandon them and this shows you the more faith you have in Allah the more you will find the results immediately because as the prophet says Allah the almighty says whenever my servant thinks well of me I'll be up to his expectations and that means that we all have to think well of Allah Asel so that whatever we expect will come to reality Ishmael grow up and when he reached a certain age Abraham was told to come back to Mecca so he did but to his surprise Allah tested him again and Prophets and messengers of Allah are tested not like any other who can abandon his wife and child in the middle of no one of nowhere maybe some would say well I can abandon the wife but the child no well this is a different story no seriously speaking no one can do that and Abraham was torn from inside but it is the reation of Allah and he has to obey it now when the boy was almost reaching the the age of puberty he was told to go back to Mecca so Abraham went to Mecca he met his son and to his surprise he had had a revelation in his uh dreams ordering him to slaughter his only son who just reached the age of puberty and was able to help his father support him when he is like 90 or 95 years old you are in deep need of such a child and a son to be with you to inherit your name but again Abraham may Allah be pleased with him sallallah Alam peace and blessing be upon him was up to the test and he told his son this was the revelation of Allah I have to slaughter you the son did not say are you out of your mind you are asking me you're telling me you want me to die maybe you this is something out of Allah's um instruction to you maybe this is Satan maybe it's so no no Ishmael knew that this was a revelation because the dreams of The Messengers usually are a revelation Satan cannot come and intervene At All by this test Brahim seems to be to deserve to deserve the uh the title of uh the messenger of strength yes and and also he deserved to be the one loved by Allah and you have you know stages of of being close to one but Allah has chosen Abraham and has chosen the prophet Alat to be uh uh the loved ones uh uh by Allah the almighty and KH could be translated as the friend it's it's a higher degree than friend friend every you can have friends and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when talking to the companions he said that if it were not for the fact that I am the of Allah the beloved one of Allah I would have chosen Abu Bakr to be my KH to be my loved one but your friend he's talking about himself is the is the beloved one of Allah so the test was not for ibraim only and is the test was for ishma and ha well hajer was out of the question because she is an OB obedient wife and she was not mentioned in the Quran regarding this incident and I presume that Abraham did not tell her and he has all the right not to ishma immediately said do what you told father this is a revelation of Allah and once he had put him down to slaughter him ishma told him that well I'm going to look downwards so that you won't look at the expressions of my face and then you may hesitate imagine this strength and Devotion to give one's life in obedience to Allah's instruction and the minute Abraham wanted to slaughter him Allah gave him the like Tiding of saying that you have passed a test and you have um you deserve what you will get and Allah Asel gave a sacrifice instead to slaughter instead of his son and then he left back again to his home in uh uh Iraq region after a few years Ishmael became a big strong man and Abrahim came back to Mecca and we were told that they both uh uh uh joined hands in building the sacred CA the black house the black uh uh structure which is at the moment in Mecca where we find it where all Muslims face in prayer and in the direction of it they've built it to be the house of Allah which means that it is honored that people pray to it not that Allah is in it may Allah be exalted no it is honored by adding the name of Allah to it and it is sacred because it is the house of Allah and the tribe of jaram has expanded and Mecca has become a place of worship of Allah this is the very beginning of the tribe or of the city of Mecca and the descendants of Abraham and uh the tribe of jam cons were the ones to live in Mecca were the ones to form the uh the tribe of qur sorry I have a question did they build the the Caba or this building as it is now well that's a very good question some say that there were traces of a building there built by Adam and they built it on the foundations of it others say no they've erected it from scratch but it is not exactly what it is nowadays because the Kaaba if you look at it inshallah we will try to do something about this uh uh if you look at the cubic building you'll find that at one end of it there is an ark like wall where people do not go inside it but go outside it they call it hij is I think they call it hij is and this name is wrong it has nothing to do with ish it has nothing to do with hij this is called Al the thing that was demolished and fell down and why was that because at the time of the prophet wasallam and we were supposed to go through this but we will come inshallah later on on on later stages the Caba as it was built at the time of ibraim was there until a flood came and made some parts of it fall so the people of qur before Islam decided to build it but they decided to build it from their own pure Halal money which meant that no prostitution fees would be included that no uh uh interest money would be included no money of wine selling or no money stolen money would be used so they agreed they've gathered the money they started building the Kaaba and made it a little bit higher than it was because it was this high they made it higher two or three meters high but at the end of the day they were short of money so they had to leave this area without any building so they just simply put that Arc so to indicate that these are these are the foundations of the real foundations of the Kaa and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tolda may Allah be pleased with him his wife that the only reason that is preventing me from demolishing the Caba and building it all over again on the same foundations of Abraham and Ishmael is that your people uh were you know almost few years ago non-muslims they were in the ignorance the era of ignorance so if I do this they may reject uh what I'm doing otherwise I would have demolished it and built it on the foundations of Abraham and had two doors for it one for people to enter from and one for them to exit from so yes true the Foundations at the moment are not the same as the times of Abraham but we can clearly see it thank you coming back to our story now the tribe of qur is there it's existing and remember that Abraham was told to slaughter son Ishmael because we're going to get back to the slaughtering bit uh uh uh um later on inshallah once everything was settled and the the the the the offspring of ishma started spreading and multiplying Mecca which became a sacred place and people started performing p pilgrimage to it also increased in its status by adding commercial and economic economical stus to it because it was in the middle so they had trade Caravans coming from Yemen trade Caravans coming and going to uh the North to the Sham they have uh they had uh Ships coming from from from from Africa from abisinia they had Ships coming from India and they started exchanging silk spices uh wine food and uh uh clothings and so on so it became a very important Village in City at that time religiously and economically bearing in mind that the people did not have any industry they did not have any farming so they were relying entirely on uh h a trading you said a place for pilgrimage yes you mean Islamic pilgrimage no no it's kind of yes no no the people living in in Mecca were following the religion of Abraham and that is why people used to perform pilgrimage on the religion of Abraham I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah we'll keep on enlighting all of us with the beautiful of the prophet and until [Music] then [Music] m"
