  "transcript": "I question a brother and his brother sorry his father talks to his talks to his relatives on The Voice call but it's like on on speaker so the thing is he can hear this from another room I think and he's asking is it is it going to be considered a spying for him because if he can hear or listen to the other person on the end because this is a question he's actually bothered with he wants to know the answer to this if the Call Comes to your attention Without You intending it then there is no spying in it because I can't put off my uh uh hearing ability if I'm in the Next Room and still I can still hear it there is a difference between listening which is done attentively and willingly and hearing which is not something that I can have any control over and I hope that yeah he's not sinful for that he would try to not pay attention and to focus on something else inshallah there's no sin on him"
