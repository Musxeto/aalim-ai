  "title": "Fam doesn't wear hijab Is he sinful if he joins them on trip & enjoys himself #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um I know a family that is going on holiday to Muslim lands however the hijab is not properly observed and the son does not want to go and but he is dependent upon them they insist on him going and may be badly shouted at would he be sinful if he goes and actually enjoys his time and wears a th since he cannot normally do so since he feels like this would be assist in him having enjoy his time so would he be s Adam are they abiding by the hijab in their own country no so what's the difference nothing so there's no problem in him going with them with a positive attitude trying to let them feel close to him bond with them let them see his respect to them and at the same time hit two birds with one stone show them how a Muslim should behave how to give dawa directly or indirectly in a very diplomatic way and try to little by little influence them to see where he's coming from why is he doing what he's doing instead of always being the religious police no this is Haram you should cover your hair you should do this don't speak like that don't stand in this fashion don't eat with your left don't drink with this don't do that this is all what they see from you so you being in their shoes how would you react when someone comes to you like this the difference between you and them is that Allah has thrown the light of Iman in your heart so if I were to come to you and speak to you rudely about something that you should do backed by Quran or Sunnah you would be offended because of my rude Behavior but you would accept it because you have Iman in your heart so you would take it on board and you would do it now with them it's different even if you show them the Quran or the authentic Sunnah they will not accept it because they don't have this Iman in their heart yet so you would be plowing in rock rocks and stones nothing would ever grow up from there you need to cultivate the land first and you do this by making them respect you love you trust you think that you want the best for them not that you want to control them and to police them and to be able to act upon what Simon says I don't know maybe this makes sense inshallah"
