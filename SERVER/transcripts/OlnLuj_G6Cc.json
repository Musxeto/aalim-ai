  "title": "Can the girl come out in front of potential suitor's father, brothers, uncles etc - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Munira says when people approach the father for his daughter the boy's parents his sister's as well as his brothers and sometimes even his uncle's come to see the girl and after they have approved and liked her then the boy comes to see her is this permissible that the boy's father brother and uncles come and see the girl I'm not sure whether this is the right way of asking a question the father the brother and the uncle of a person proposing to a woman are none muharram to her at the moment which means that the father who's proposing for his son could change his mind and marry her the brother could also change his mind and says no I don't want my brother to marry her I like her more my brother didn't see her I saw her and the uncles are likewise I do not understand the cultural things that the people have and again this is unfortunately is white spreading in the subcontinent that the proposal is done in the presence of the parents the father that is and his siblings and sometimes his uncles and they all watched the woman and look at her and then give their approval or disapproval why not put her in a car showroom so that everybody else sees her maybe make a census among your friends as well let him see her and who knows what else they could do our Villa women are more valued they're precious how does a parent allow his own daughter to be displayed in front of non muharram men like this and at the end of the day they decide and they disapprove after all of this sinful act they say she doesn't fit our standards and this father of this girl has gone with the shame and with the sin this is totally prohibited when a man is interested in marrying a woman he sends his mother his sister his aunt to go and only meet the mother of the girl and the girl and her sisters only totally segregated meeting they come back to the man and say to him Allah we saw this and that her her hair is this long it's this soft it's this black and she's a little bit fair she's a little bit dark she's this is that and they give him a description he likes what he hears then he goes and proposes to the man to the to the father he sets an appointment the father checks on him looks at him speaks with him if the father is happy with that he asked his daughter are you okay with the specs of this person she says yeah she's she's shy she doesn't comment so he tells her okay I'm gonna invite him tomorrow between mother Benicia and he invites him in and then he invites his daughter to come and sit only the three of them nothing big the father the girl and the boy interested and he sits in between so that when he speaks to the boy the girl can take a good look at who is interested in marrying her and when he speaks to the girl the boy has the ability to check her out and after an hour maybe an hour and a half a little bit less a little bit more after they exchange questions and they feel that there is chemistry the interview is over the boy goes to his mom and tells her I like what I see and I'm interested in her the mother calls her mother and says that my my son is a fan of your daughter he's Yanni in loving her and she likes her and the mother says wallahi my daughter also likes your son alhamdulillah then the men speak together they appoint a time of engagement of making the marriage contract etc and a happy story ends here not with the marriage but I mean this marriage takes place and it is inshallah a happy story so this is what usually takes place this is a slaw way of doing it having it mixed men and then muharram your parents as a boy have no right to mix with her parents as a girl this is free mixing what does your father have to do sitting and talking with her mother and your mother talking and sitting with her father this is free mixing this is Haram so you have to pay attention that this is not permissible and you should not go through this type of engagement and alonzo gel knows best"
