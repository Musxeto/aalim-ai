  "transcript": "foreign 151 this hadith relates to what to be said when you are on your dying bed mother aisha tells us that the prophet alaihis allah during his illness in which he had which he passed away from he would dip his hands in water in a container next to him that had water in it and then he would wipe his face and say none has the right to be worshipped except allah death does indeed contain agony so the prophet sasam was suffering at his death bed and this confuses people because they think that the other hadith hadith of goes against it the prophet tells us in the hadith that the believer when the angels of death take his soul they take it so nicely and softly and kindly as if it's a drop of water coming out from a skin container so when it drops it drops nicely and gently unlike the soul of a disbeliever they take it as if they're taking a rod of iron with thorns in it from a wet piece of wool so as they take it out it snatches the wool into pieces so this seemed to confuse some when the prophet says death does indeed contain agony there's no contradiction at all the agony and the hardship a muslim suffers is before his soul is extracted from his body and this is to erase his sins if he's sinful like me and you or to raise his status at the side of allah azzawajal if he is sinless like the prophet but when the soul is extracted taken out it is taken out softly and gently without any hardship so this i hope manages to erase such confusion the following hadith is something that we have to do our level best to uh memorize the prophet said to us allah has the right to be worshipped except allah and allah is the greatest now focus on these words none has the right to be worshipped except allah and allah is the greatest the hadith the original hadith says allah says none has the right to be worshipped except me and i am the greatest so allah reiterates and emphasizes what is being said and confirms it none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone allah says this about himself none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone without any partner allah repeats this none has the right to be worshipped except allah to him belongs all sovereignty and praise none has the right to be worshipped except allah and there is no might and no power except with allah what is the use of saying these words over and over and over again well the hadith that the prophet sallam says whoever says this while he's sick and he dies fire will not touch him so memorizing these words and when you're ill and sick repeating them over and over again definitely would add a lot of value to you so that this would be your pass not to touch or be touched by hellfire chapter 52 instruction for the one needing death what if someone is dear to us or next to us or we're close to them in their about to die what should we do what would she what should we uh um help him with well hadith 153 the prophet says he whose last words are none has the right to be worshipped except allah will enter paradise so the sunnah is that when someone is on his deathbed and we can see that that we say to him say to ensure that this is his last words not to repeat it over and over again so if he says it once and does not say anything else till he dies he falls under this hadith and will enter paradise with the grace of allah but we should not repeat it if he does not say anything else so even if he says and stays for a whole hour not saying anything that's sufficient but if he says and after a few moments he says i'm thirsty give me a drink we give him a drink and say to him if he says it we refrain from saying anything if he says what time is it we tell him it's five o'clock so we tried our level best to ensure that this is the last thing he utters without shoving it down his throat or nagging him and and so that he's not fed up of it but if he says it and he says nothing else then he falls under this beautiful reward which is insha allah that he will enter paradise this is all the time we have until we meet next time um [Music]"
