  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah now we've learned to the best of our ability things that are related to Evolution or wo but what breaks the woodo what invalidates it and mandates it upon us to go and perform another woodo because this is an ongoing process you perform wo after a while you break it then you perform another woodo and a third and a fourth and this goes on until we meet our maker subhah so what are the things that invalidate W if you go to the books of or Juris Prudence you'll find a lot of differences among Scholars but there are points that they don't differ upon so in order for us as Muslims to know what is right and what is wrong as mentioned in the Quran Whenever there is a dispute or a difference of opinion we have to refer that back to Allah and to his messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam and this is done by referring it back to the Quran and to the sunah of the Prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam so they all agree Scholars agree that anything that exits the private parts whether it is the front passage or the back passage this invalidates the woodoo so whether a person urinates defecates passes wind or discharge comes out from his private part such as Medi or W or any discharge that comes out out from his passage this invalidates W of course there is a difference of opinion when it comes to vaginal discharge but we will not go into that and if this happens then a person's prayer is invalid they have to perform woodo after they clean themselves why because the prophet said Allah does not accept the prayer of any of you if he invalidates his woodo until he performs woodo again so this is a or one of the things that it is agreed upon discharge from the private parts anything that is emitted or comes out from a person's private parts number two any form of loss of consciousness either due to intoxication fainting sleep or Insanity so the loss of reason or Consciousness this invalidates the woodo because the prophet used to order the companions not to take off their socks when they're traveling for three days and three nights unless they fall in the major ritual impurity status unless they have janaba but if they answer the call of nature if they sleep if they urinate then they do not have to take their socks off rather they perform W and wipe over them this Hadith indicates that these three things defecating urinating and sleeping invalidates the woodoo and Scholars say the reason that sleep invalidates woodoo is because when you're asleep you are are uh unconscious so you don't feel yourself when you may pass wind and there is another Hadith Sall Ali wasallam said that the eye is the knot that ties the anus meaning if the eye is closed and a person falls unconscious and asleep then the knot that ties the anus and controls it is untied and the possibility of passing wind is there and this is why it invalidates Wu likewise if someone is intoxicated or fainted or falls into temporary state of insanity he doesn't know what had happened during that period it invalidates the woodo as well now the exception of sleep is that if a person's sleep is something that is not considered to be deep sleep so if a person's dozes and does not sleep and he's aware of the environment though he like takes a a very very power naap that he's aware if someone puts his hand in his pocket sometimes he's aware of what people speak but actually he's in a trans he's half sleep half awake so Scholars say that in such a state this sort of uh um napping it's not a nap but sort of to to doze a bit is not considered to be something that invalidates the w why because of the Hadith of an Malik may Allah be pleased with him that after prayer remember that the companions used to work before Dawn Till prayer so when Sunset comes they're totally tired and almost burnt out so they're waiting the Masjid for Isa prayer and they would doze a bit like this while sitting but they would stand up for Isa prayer without renewing their woodo why why because they did not fall into deep sleep so this is the difference between deep sleep and other than that the third nullifier of Budu according to our textbook is to touch the private part of a human being without a barrier due to the Hadith of bash B safwan may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet alai wasam said whoever touches his uh uh penis must perform woodo and umab may Allah be pleased with her our mother said the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam said whoever touches his private part must perform wo and the word private part includes male and female Gentile and front and back passages well while touching the testicles or the butttocks would not be included in Breaking the woodo and this is an issue of dispute because there is another Hadith where the Prophet was asked about touching the private part and he said it's part of you it's part of your limbs so touching it or touching your nose is the same thing it's part of your own body body and these two hadiths conflict with one another which made the scholars be divided some say it breaks your woodoo some say it doesn't break your woodoo and some Scholars took the middle path by saying that well if one touches it with lust and desire it breaks the wood and if it's touched like when drying yourself after a shower without any desire at all then it does not impact the woodo and Allah knows best number four eating camels meat and this is only found in the hamali school of thought the other schools of thought say it does not impact the woodoo however the most authentic opinion is that it does impact the woodo because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the Hadith is in sah Muslim was asked about eating mutton meat should we perform Wu The Prophet said if you wish and of course mutton meat is cooked with fire immediately afterwards the prophet was asked we if we were to eat camels meat should we perform W the prophet said yes so look at the comparison can we eat mutton meat and then pray without woodo should we perform woodoo if you wish it's not mandatory meaning your woodo is inval is valid after eating mutton's meat but when he was asked about camels meat he said you have to perform W which clearly indicates that it breaks the woodo why this is something we have no justification for and like lots of things in Shar this is an instruction and a command from Allah we follow adhere and Obey whether we know the reason and the justification of it or not we just simply do it so what is the ruling when people doubt whether they have passed wind or not whether the wood is broken or not this is a problem that a lot of the Muslims face alhamdulillah Islam is a religion of ease and simplicity it's very easy to determine the rulings so don't be confused or dragged by the traps of Satan there is a legal Maxim or an Islamic rule that states certainty is not affected by doubt what is certainty I'm a human being what is doubt I feel like a bird well this feeling this doubt is tossed in the garbage because it cannot impact the certainty of me being human likewise if I perform W I know I'm in the state of wo 3 hours later I get a doubt did I pass went did I visit the toilets I don't have any certainty in it so does this doubt impact the certainity of me making woodo and invalidates my woodoo the answer is no because doubt has no impact on certainity phrases of doubt maybe I think I feel perhaps throw it in the dust bin ignore it because certainty is not affected by doubt however if you reverse this you would understand it better I woke up from my sleep and I went straight to school or to work when it's time for I scratch my head not because I have dandruff rather because I'm thinking did I perform woodo or not I'm doubtful what is certain certainty states that I woke up from sleep which means I'm not in the state of wo to move out from the certainty to confirm that I'm in the state of wo I have to be also certain that I performed wo because I don't have this certainty I toss it and throw it in the dust bin and I must go and perform wodo again where do we get this legal Maxim from the Hadith of uh uh the prophet when a man came to the prophet Alam and he said oh prophet of Allah I have this problem I keep on thinking and feeling that I've passed wind so I don't know what to do and this happens to us while we're sitting while we're praying while we're walking I feel something popped the prophet said do not leave your prayer and which which means do not perform wood until you hear a sound or you find a smell certainity so the feeling of movement in my stomach I felt something came out if I'm certain of this feeling even if I did not hear a sound or find a smell if I'm certain 100% yes I pass wind in this case I have to go because there is certainity but in the case of doubt I have a feeling this feeling has to be thrown in the dust bin until there is proof of a sound that you passed when or a smell an offensive odor that you pass wind and Allah Knows Best [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
