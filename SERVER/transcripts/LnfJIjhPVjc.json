  "transcript": "U so my question is my mother has a dog and the dog licks my mother hand and my mother without washing her hand touches wet clothes to dry them on a rope from the washing machine so my question is what should I do though I told her to wash her hands you're speaking like 60 words per second your a dog licked your mom's hands and your mom touched dry clothes aan wet clothes wet clothes she touched wet clothes and then what happened yes and then she put on a Rob to dry them from the washing machine well when the dog licked your mom's hand did he lick the back of her hand or the palm of her hand the palm the palm of her hand this means that there is saliva on her hand if she touches wet clothes the wet clothes she touched the first time would become impure but she cannot continue to distribute impurity all of her life for the rest of her life on everything she touches just because of the lick of the dog the moment she touched one dry clothes and hanged it up most likely the NASA has depleted and gone you cannot Cascade this to the rest of the bucket of wet clothes in there and you cannot assume because everything in this world is pure until proven and we don't have any proof except Vis visibly seeing the dog licking her palm and touching a wet piece of cloth and hanging it that would be considered to be NES but the rest won't be considered to be NES and Allah Knows Best"
