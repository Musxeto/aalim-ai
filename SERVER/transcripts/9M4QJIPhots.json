  "title": "Can women pray at home before the athan is called, if time for prayer has entered? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "first question for tonight is from Aisha Aisha says can a woman pray at home before the event is called as long as the time of prayer has entered in many countries there is this conviction that a prayer cannot be established at homes until the Akama in the masjid is given so many women ask this question and they say that for example in friday they tell us that we're not supposed to pray for her until the Obama is given and in other countries where they do not follow the proper Islamic timing for prayers so some countries or some people some messages may delay her prayer by an hour or so or may delay Fechter until it's almost light according to some schools of thought and this is wrong so a lot of the sisters ask are we obliged to wait and the answer is no if you are following the correct calendar or timetable of prayers then in this case there is no problem for you to begin your prayer regardless whether the Adhan was given or not regardless whether the men had started to pray in the masjid or not why because allah azzawajal has made the prayers on prescribed times so once the time is due once the time has entered whether the Adhan was given or not you are entitled to pray as long as you have started to pray after the time was due so there is no problem in that insha'Allah bearing in mind that the Prophet as of salaam when he was asked which of the deeds are most beloved to allah azza wajal he said to pray on time and in an other narration he said to pray at the beginning of the time so for fajar it is best to pray it at the beginning of the time for us or for Maghrib it is best to pray it at the beginning of time as for war if it is summer and it's too hot and it would be cooler for you to postpone and delay the prayer just before us our time is do then this is sunnah but if you prayed that it's regular time this is okay and there's no problem in that and finally as for Alisha the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam instructed us to delay it if there is no hardship upon the people so praying it at the first third of the night and just before a half or just before midnight this is the best time for it so if a woman is at home it's best for her to pray it at 10:30 11 o'clock but if she fears that if she delays it that she would forget it and midnight would come and without her paying attention in this case no pray it as soon as you are as soon as the time is due"
