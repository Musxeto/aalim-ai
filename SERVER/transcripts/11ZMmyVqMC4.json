  "title": "Can we say bismillah in a bathroom where the toilet is separate? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if you go to a toilet and the toilet is separated the wash basin is separated from the toilet seat uh with a door so basically speaking the area is considered to be out of the area that we answer the call of nature there's no problem in saying Bismillah but if the toilet seat is present there and you can see it and there's no partition or separation with the uh Basin or the sink some Scholars say even though you can say Bismillah how they say these are not places of answering the call of nature like in the old times at the time of the Prophet Islam when they did not have lavatories rather they had an open area that was known to be to answer the call of nature so it's just an open pit far away from the town where people go and answer the call of Nature and leave so the whole area is for answering the call of nature where you can actually find traces of maybe thesis or urine or the whole area is a an open lavatory they didn't have anything else at the time nowadays our toilets sometimes are even cleaner than some kitchens they're tiled floors they're always washed hygiene is very high always putting detergents smells nice and there are no traces of impurity none whatsoever everything is flushed down the drain so some Scholars say that even these places it's okay to say Bismillah I'm inclined to be rather safe than sorry say it before you enter the whole area and you will be safe insha Allah"
