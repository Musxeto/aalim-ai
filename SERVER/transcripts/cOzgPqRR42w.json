  "title": "If an Islamic ruling is decreasing my iman, would I be sinful if I don't act upon it assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is if I get a ruling and I start acting upon it and I feel a production in my Iman would I be sinful if I stop acting upon it how would I know if the ruling is according to Islam you have no choice whether it raises your Iman or lowers your Iman you have to abide by it so generally speaking such generic questions without examples it's difficult to identify but because it's a generic question you get a genetic answer if a ruling is part of the Sharia and once you apply it you feel that your Iman is being reduced you have no choice a woman says I just learned that hijab is mandatory so I'm wearing it but I feel that I'm intimidated by The People's looks and my prayer is not on time and I I feel a lot of hardship so is it best for me to take off the hijabs answers no even if your man a man is reduced this is reduced do to due to other factors and not to implementing Sharia this cannot be when you obey Allah and implement the Shariah in your life this cannot reduce your Iman this is attributed to something else and Allah Knows Best"
