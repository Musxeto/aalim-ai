  "title": "You said all Religious Relics in Turkey ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· are fake, what's your evidence? #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Some days ago I asked you about the religious relics at the top of Palestinian stumble Turkey and you said all of them are fabricated and bogus. Uh do you have any evidence suggesting that they are fabricated? No no no it doesn't work this way Ahmed now don't let your nationalism kick in the way. You who claim that this is of the prophetam you have to prove it. It's not the other way around. Otherwise I would say that D was used by so and so of the companions. He used to drink green tea in it and you can smell the green tea. You believe me? People bring a hair braid and it goes like 15 mters and this is this is from the prophetam and it keeps on growing and growing and growing and they put perfume on it and they put it in a glass and and gold box. What is this? All of this is bogus. So when you come to a sword that is 3 mters high and you claim that it is a prophet prophetam you do the math and get the uh um archaeologist to do the carbon uh radiation carbon or whatever carbon 14 I don't know what they call it to check the time and you will find it's 400 or 500 years old not six 15 centuries old garments that have not worn out and again and helmets that people and historians say that no these helmets were Not the one that the people of the prophetam time used to wear. This came 300 years back or afterwards. These things, anyone claiming these things, they have to bring the proof. And it doesn't work the other way around. And besides, don't be offended. If you don't like what I've said, disregard it and move on."
