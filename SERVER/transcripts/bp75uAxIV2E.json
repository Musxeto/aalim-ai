  "transcript": "Islam promotes segregation between the genders this is safer for them and for us FBI statistics for the year 2015 AHA 95,000 rapes declared officially in the United States of America alone 95 thousand what kind of civilization is this in another report independent sources said the real number of cases of rape in 2015 announced and not announced was four hundred thousand-plus which means approximately a thousand rape cases per day you do the math per second and per per minute a day in the United States of America so when you come and criticize the social system of Islam you guys have to look a little bit in your own backyard how many rape cases do we have in Saudi Arabia hamdullah so nothing is announced who do you know among the millions living that have been raped there are always black chips in the family there can be such crimes but not in proportional to what's happening in the US and elsewhere therefore Islam promotes segregation between the genders for the betterment and for the benefit for the Society for the community and for the individuals as well therefore you tell them that this is the ruling of Allah Azza WA JAL if they're happy with it at hamdulillah you managed to do that WA if not who cares who cares all what I care about is that Allah is pleased with what I do it is form of worship that I'm doing and a large that we gel knows best"
