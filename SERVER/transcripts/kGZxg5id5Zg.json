  "transcript": "does cleaning or changing babies dirty nappy washing after they use the washroom invalidate our woodoo the answer is the most authentic opinion is that this has no impact on a person's woodo now we have to differentiate your wood is a ritual state so if if you break your woodo you are in the minor ritual state of impurity and if you perform wo and complete it you become in the ritual impurity State this is not invalidated by touching an impurity because once I touch an impurity while I in the state of wo my hand is impure all what I have to do is wash it off that's it but my state of ritual impurity my my state of ritual Purity is not affected touching the private part of children is an issue of dispute because there are hadiths that state that touching the private part would invalidate the woodo but the most authentic opinion is that touching the private parts of infants and children in the state of impurity when cleaning them does not impact your own woodo and Allah Knows Best"
