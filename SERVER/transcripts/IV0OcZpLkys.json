  "transcript": "a way of life a brothers and sisters in islam welcome to a new episode on the topic of marriage and in our last episode we started to speak about the idea of the in-laws in this marriage contract and uh however we did not dwell into this issue enough we just basically scratched the surface so how about we try that the in-laws what is their role how do we understand them what are their rights to what extent can they get involved in the whole marriage contract perhaps uh you would like to elaborate on this my dear guest i'll start off with this one i um i think there's a principle that the husband and wife need to agree on from the beginning it's we call it the principle of sugar albeit means this is the affairs of the house they don't go outside the house this is the advice you hear she'll say again and again that what happens in the house stays in the house and even if there's children there that might know like stories of what's happening that even the children know what happens in the house stays in the house and i think if a husband and wife that even when you're when you're looking to get married from the very beginning say of course we respect our you know our in-laws but let's agree from the beginning that what happens in the house stays in the house is it possible that someone takes this to some extreme and therefore when consultation is required they don't consult anyone because they say well everything should remain in the home or do we have to explain that there are times when you have to go outside to to resolve internal domestic problems that for sure um those situations will will come up right where maybe the woman is being physically abused and he's saying just keep it in the house or something like that she might need to go and speak to somebody but obviously those are going to be cases that um they'll come up one of the one of the issues that i find myself dealing with sort of a lot of extremes in this case of the in-laws i mentioned in the previous episode the husband often uh listening to his mother so much that he actually talked to allah even makes dulham on his and i deal with this a lot very sad then another thing that often happens still we're sticking on the topic of the men a little bit here is that he doesn't encourage or sometimes he totally neglects his in-laws and i think i'm guessing there's this sort of culture is that the man's job is to look after the mother the man thinks that now you're my wife your responsibility is to look after me your parents are not important this is totally wrong he should be encouraging his wife did you phone your mom did you phone your dad we need to go and see your parents because you still have to care for them and look and he should help her to keep this connection with her parents not prevented as unfortunately we find in some instances which is a very very wrong thing do you agree with him the issue of the in-laws before we elaborate more on this issue i would like to talk about love yes love in marriage yes life okay is based on love and when you love someone you will sacrifice and life is about sacrificing and life is about give and take okay and every one of us should memorize and should keep always this law in front of him the law of love the love love states you love what your beloved loves and you hate what your beloved hates this is the law of love if i love someone i will love whatever he loves as long as what he loves is not haram and that you will hate what he hates and an english man would say love me love my dog right that's what the english man says love me love my dog which means that if you love me you will love me not my family but my relatives and likewise if i love you i will love you your family your mother your father etc and other poet said what would hip buha were to hit bunny when this is what he said this is love brothers and sisters the meaning he said this is before islam he said i love her and she loves me and my camel loves how she comes that even the animals they love each other so if you love your wife really only if you love your husband you love her parents and if you love your wife you will love her parents and if he loves you she will love you your parents because she loves you they become her parents naturally true or not they are exceptions some ill laws may be giving you tough time and things like this but we are talking about what islam is teaching us what islam is teaching us that we have to be nice and good and not depriving her or encouraging her to cut the ties with her kindred with her kiss and kin some husband unfortunately they do that i wanted to make it very much what the chef said yes many they do this and they we face problems which is wrong you are committing a sin even some maybe you will not allow her to call them or to to help them are you telling her that i am not obligated yes it's not a matter of obligation but they are muslims and that you are one of and they are in need what is wrong with this so this what will actually bring the ties and strengthen the ties of the marital relationship that when this mutual respect and love is there dominating the marital life of course i have to say this for the viewers we are speaking about what to look for in the potential spouse no one is insinuating that you fall in love before marriage and you become madly in love so that that will happen afterwards okay because some may think okay no no no no no i think i think their marriage yes after marriage love is the one that will resolve the the problems but now before marriage that is something you can't possibly figure out and also if i may comment i beg to differ because the terminology love is not what marriages are based on not all marriages are based on love so you find someone who is married for 40 years to his wife and not necessarily he's madly in love with her as the word love means there's respect there is affection there is mercy and there is repose in them but not necessarily the word love as any people may think of first of all second of all i beg also to differ with him okay the love is there and we go back brothers and sisters who's your example rasulullah and see his love for his wives for aisha for all of them so this is very important because we have to keep in mind some of us as men due to the upbringing especially i want to admit the arabs in particular especially those who grew up in arabia it's because of the environment and the harsh we have this in us but we our criterion and what we refer to is the islam and our example is prophet muhammad that is the and love is essential love not only ascension even the ibadah is based on love can i say something in defense of sheikh asim just a little bit i think i think he's he is of course agreeing with you totally on the importance of love and we should i think we need to make more of an effort if you don't find this why don't you make dua to allah increase the love for my wife but i think this is making a point that actually in reality out there i'm sure there may be people watching us who don't feel that love in their relationship but you know for them it's a relationship that works maybe it's based upon family ties that's something that keeps it together maybe it's the children that's keeping it going maybe they don't feel this type of love but that doesn't mean they can't have the mutual respect for the in-laws and so on and so forth so i think is this i was going to say the same thing because there's no love and therefore there should be divorce said i agree with shaykh but i beg to differ for the second or third time i lost count with me as well okay i agree with you what i meant when i said about love is mentioned also in the sunnah or the afar of the companion the peace with him was met by a man who wanted to divorce his wife so he asked him why do you want to divorce her he said because i don't love her and omar almost beat him with a stick in his hand and say yes are all houses built on love meaning that houses marriages are not built only on love that the one we see you know candlelight dinner and the violin next to you in the villains haramah can the light is okay uh dinner but it is not built on that kind of love maybe we may interpret or define love that shaykh is talking about is respect compassion love mercy etc this is point number one but i i think we have a break there is another point i'd like to pick up afterwards and you shall inshallah we'll be right back stay tuned way of life and we're back so love is in the air or is it well the second point is i don't know what if love is in the air or not but inshallah it would be um and love would be spread all over the entire earth the second point i wanted to bring up is that once a couple of years ago i was driving and this guy behind me giving me a high beam and low beam and honking me and i the road is so wide what is this guy doing so you know i got hot tempered and i parked and i came out of the car and the guy came out of the car and he said salaam alaikum said i cool down then guy wanted to ask me a question he didn't want to pick a fight to alhamdulillah so i said what's wrong and he started complaining about his marriage and he said that i want to divorce my wife so i asked him is she evil she's not mashallah she is half of the quran she is a wonderful wife always neatly dressing dressed in the house and she takes care of my child and she's a good cook and my family loves her i said so why do you want to divorce her says i don't find this gut feeling of love and i say okay subhan allah you have a jewel do you watch tv a lot well this is what i asked the guy and the guy looked at the ground and said yes and he said you watch soap operas and movies said a lot i spent like six seven hours this is what's corrupting your your house because now you think that the love that is found in movies where when you don't see your loved one you your sleepless nights and you write poems etc this is not the actual love that is found in our houses all of us we're all married alhamdulillah we love our wives but it is not the love that sustains the marriage it is the responsibilities that i have to do it is the rights my wives give me and it is the mutual respect and compassion and affection that's with us okay and no one will disagree with this but love the problem that the concept even of love today is misunderstood okay so we are talking about the real love when you love someone if you love your wife isn't a sign of love that you don't want her to go to hell and that's why you are trying hard to improve her iman and to encourage her that means you love her because the true love is that when you love someone you want to save him you want him to to save him from the hellfire you want her to be with you in the next life this means that when even jealousy is very important element a husband has to be jealous good jealousy yes and a woman likes that when you feel jealous over her not over jealous but do you feel jealous or subhanallah many of them can you give okay so this is this is it that you feel that this is a woman this is i have to protect her i have to she's a jewel he is a piece of diamond i don't want anyone to touch this precious stone to something valuable so this is creates that jealousy in you and the sahaba one day the prophet sallam said that if you god forbid if you find a man okay with your partner go and bring eyewitnesses said nassar said what want me to wait and go and bring with eyewitnesses by allah i will cut him into pieces with my soul and the prophet said i'm saying oh sad this is the ruling of allah the sahaba the answer oh prophet of allah forgive him we know he's very jealous he's the most jealous among us right the most jealous even they said if he married a woman any woman that was married to him then he divorced her none of us would dare to marry her this was pre-islam islam and if any one of his wives okay she road or a beast or a camel the moment the camera reaches the destination he would slaughter the camera oh boy he would not want anyone to sit on that camel that his wife mounted so this was but this is of course going to the extreme that's an expensive ride okay this is going to the extreme so the jealousy is needed and love is needed but not loving the in the sense of the what we read in the novels and the movies no not this love we are we are talking about but it is an important element in the marital life she needs to hear from you and let us i'm talking about myself a woman he needs to hear from you this beautiful word yes darling yes sweetheart yes love yes honey yes so he should basically saying  he should be romantic exactly i was in boston in the united states and the brothers they say give a talk to the sisters and i gave a talk to the sisters and i was talking i telling them you have to be this take care of yourself and this and that one of the sisters you know masha'allah many of the american sisters they call his paid speech what are you talking about okay we have a problem here i said what is it all of them screamed simultaneously romance we want romance romance is essential in the medical life yes what is wrong if you go and bring a bouquet of flower too expensive this is a stinginess yes we talked about generosity yes no you're okay drink this bouquet of flour bring her a gift and come is that darling you know guess what close your eyes yes yes close your eyes masha allah masha you make her day you make her day the girls are very poor mr queen wala when they hear these beautiful words she will we say in arabic he will give you her eyes listen to this my dear brother the prophet sallam in the hadith carry her sahara delicia the prophet sallam he hates staying awake after isha except with his wife chatting do we do this do we sit with our wives and chat let them do the talk and this is very essential we have to keep just nodding our heads don't interrupt yes let her bring his everything he needs the poor girl wants to to bring everything out let her vent it let it come out listen this is very essential be all is attentive to her and even if she says something he is wrong he said yes you are right you are right another way of of showing love is uh and famous hadith at the women quote i was always thinking of compiling a book the 40 hadith that the women quote one of them is the hadith the prophet saw allah they said i'm kind of human at the end it's their favorite hadith that the prophet saws used to be in the service of his wives they love that but i'm saying uh for the men that they also can when they're going into their marriage show their love by washing the dishes sometimes shoulder looking taking the yeah cooking i don't know all of them are good not good at cooking but take the garbage out i'm gonna you know uh fix the bed after the the brother gets up taking the garbage out is the man's job right i mean you should the wife shouldn't be taking the anyway no but i get what you're saying and i believe that there are lots of qualities needed as a future spouse for future husbands so the sisters for example would look for someone showing his jealousy in a positive way and that is by concealing her secrets there are men who are male but not a men actually they're male they go and sit with the boys and say well i did this and that with my wife and they exposed their secret and they talked dirty and the prophet told us allah that this is a feature of the people of hell and any person doing this and talking to others about their intimacy and the secrets is like a donkey or a male and female uh devils uh having intercourse in the middle of the road and this is not uh befitting a muslim man so this is what a wife what a woman looks in a husband also i don't know if you may agree with me self-hygiene a woman looks in a man to be clean to look representable and to smell good so many times sisters complain from practicing brothers that their husbands their beards smell awful their mouth smells awful and we as men expect our women to be in top-notch form but we know we fail to do this ourselves the prophet assam used to begin the first thing when he enters his house is by brushing his teeth and he used to love perfumes so a woman looks in a man such a feature no and other qualities elaborate and this is very important for me they issued that to looking presentable and smelling nice and the prophet is always the example and the reason that he would wash his teeth because the the first thing he would do that he would kiss his wife this is sunnah and this is part of showing your love right yes and he would kiss them even before he went to pray in the masjid he would go very very so this is sunnah so the having good smell and look presentable it is he's a human being at the end of the day not that you come from outside sweating and this and and you want her to come to bed that doesn't work that is hard right by allah allah azzawajal made it that is her right just so there will be no misunderstanding we sometimes we i find some things that i interject for the benefit of the viewers um the case that we're speaking about is not that other kind of case before you go to the masjid now that is becking in english right like someone just they're not french not that you know big it's not the french kiss yeah otherwise you cannot go to the masjid okay that is it should be clear to the people so the prophet sallallahu sallam he is the example and the woman who came to saydna uma is before the salah is going to make you get excited it will nullify your wudu unless unless unless something gets wrong with the no no maybe you just need more to get you excited so now so here this woman came to say na um he said i don't want to live with him i don't want to live with him he said why what's wrong call him call her husband how the husband came masha allah his hair every stand is standing i can imagine visualizing the seed dirty clothes said go take a shower comb your hair dress up and come nicely put on new clean clothes mashallah he came back like a groom how about now he said i have no problem so this is something natural this is right this is our islam the problem brothers and sisters everywhere that we are away from our islam the solution is in our deed and muhammad is the example just learn your deen and you will have the best life in this life and in the one to come alike"
