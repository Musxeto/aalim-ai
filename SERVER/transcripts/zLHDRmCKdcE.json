  "transcript": "U.S us out Allah so I know that the largest jamarat that Pilgrim's Stone during Hajj is referred to as Gemini what are the names of the other two chammarat and what is their significance in Islam thank you Sheikh Ramadan about it and Mubarak too as well so the middle Jamar is called the middle Jamara and the third one is called sora the minor the little Jamara what is their significance it's a ritual of Islam and Hajj and the prophet salallahu alaihi sallam told us to take his our rituals in Hajj from him so the prophet stoned them we stoned them some narrations say that this or these are the places where Satan intercepted Ibrahim peace be upon Him thousands of years ago and Ibrahim stoned Satan whenever he intercepted them I don't know whether these narrations are authentic or not some Scholars authenticate and some do not either way we don't really look into the origin of it because it's part of our Hajj and it's a ritual of a religion and we follow it for this reason"
