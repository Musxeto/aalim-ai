  "title": "Why was Prophet Yusuf put in prison even though it was proven that he was innocent? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "here we know that Yusuf may peace be upon him was accused by the wife of al-aziz and she wanted him to be thrown into prison but he was proven innocent because his shirt was torn from the behind but later on in the Surah we see that he actually was sent to prison so I was wondering why he was sent to prison because they were unfair and unjust it was obvious that the Aziz of Missouri of Egypt who is the husband knew that she was lying but after discovering that she was lying that was Yusuf was innocent after a while probably the nagging of the wife and the talk of the community made pressure on him to exonerate himself by just throwing him in prison and this is what all tyrants do the easiest thing is throw the opposition or whoever causes you headaches in prison so he did this they did not follow the right procedure they did not fear Allah they did not know even Allah azzawajal and this was already planned for Yusuf peace be upon him so that he would become the Aziz of Egypt himself at a later stage"
