  "title": "I have repented from my sins but my family & friends have not How to give them dawah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh Sheikh ever since I made Toba I got close at Allah and as time passed by I started disliking the prohibited things like music smoking uh and other things and but I see my family and close friends they still do some listening to music some still smoke and other things uh how should I deal with this should I let the me or should I be telling them this and that and blah blah blah because I fear that they might hold me accountable in the day of judgment okay thank you first of all you have to be diplomatic and you have to be smart because Sharia came to obtain benefits and complement them and complete them and prevent Haram and reduce as much as possible it can't be prevented at all so when you do something and this is the beauty of Islam you judge the thing you're doing or saying by the consequence so before you do it measure what is the consequence there are Idols Buddha there is a lot let's blow them up okay blowing in the map is good but what is the consequence oh they're going to close Islamic centers prevent people from praying in the Masjid and put us in jail incriminate all people with beard ah no no no wait wait this is not for you this is for the authority so you judge by the consequences Allah says in the Quran do not curse the idols that they worship why so that they do not curse Allah in return so if I curse the idols is it a good deed yes but because the consequence is cursing Allah I will stop now you go to your family and I spoke to my brother and my sister this is Haram you should do this you should do that following day they're doing the same Haram you should not do that you should not do this this is Haram Okay the third day I say the same what will they do they'll fight you they'll insult you you'll interfere and put your nose in something that's not of your business if I'm going to hell I'm going to hell not you don't do this you cause the Gap that cannot be closed except after six months or one year this is wrong I cleared my conscience with Allah now next time I come here he listens to music I don't sit with him I go and sit somewhere else without saying anything he knows and they all know but you're not the religious police it's not your job that okay grow your beard no don't do this your trousers are below the ankles uh you wear the hijab you wear them it's not your job you have to give Fair preaching with wisdom knowing where to put things to know where to put the things in the right places so as long as you did your diligence and you did your duty the first time pull back what to do lead by example now when they see the transformation you have gone through oh he doesn't smoke he doesn't listen to music he doesn't watch movies all of these things are negative to them to me as a sinner this guy is crazy with Isis or not yet my question is this is what goes into their mind so what to do lead by example be honest be generous be courageous be caring be joke humorous why is it when we commit to Islam we become grumpy and foreign so your role model is who Muhammad Allah our Prophet do exactly what he did now if you manage to grab their attention and hearts and make them love you wallahi they will follow you in Everything But first you have to reach that level in their subconscience in their mind oh this Punk he just came out of the shell like an egg he just came off the egg now he's giving us that what what does he know about Islam is this is what they will label you with but no win their hearts try to grab them and draw them closer by your actions not by your preaching I am good in preaching I can sit here and oh you do this you do that you do this I do this but this is not the best way because you guys came in I don't know who's paid among you alhamdulillah I hope so 23 years ago in Huda TV so there were students in the Masjid about 50 or 70. none of them speaks English they just come and give the money and a lunch and there comes all what you have to do is do this I didn't know that I thought they were speaking English I was giving my lectures and and they put four students from international schools who speak English to ask questions after three four programs only these four are asking questions what about the others they did not know anything anyhow this is beside the point so coming back to the point my announcement seriously I'm not grumpy not anymore I try Allah if they love you if they trust you they will come and ask you I was in your shoes 41 years ago when I started practicing everybody in my family hated me literally everybody my own mother when I got married I told her mom on Friday I cannot sit in a mixed Gathering my wife wears an app we cannot sit together so we have to segregate she says no I want to sit with my my sons and my their wives you come on another day is that okay immediately a couple of days later she said talas will segregate I came everyone my cousins my family my own uncles hated my guts and I wasn't this wise I was with an AK-47 you know just going there and wanting to shoot someone but it took me a couple of years some knowledge some thinking I'm not getting feedback come down come down come down and after that it took me maybe eight years until they trusted me nowadays they all call me with the grace of Allah with love with compassion with Mercy asking me questions it feels good but it's not me it's Allah making a lot of Dua and let them love you and Allah Knows Best"
