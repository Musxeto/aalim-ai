  "transcript": "assalam alikum it gives me great pleasure to welcome shik aim Al Hakim on behalf of the parents volunteers and staff of Al Manar tbia school we let Manar have a constant commitment towards nurturing productive Muslims through imparting Knowledge from the kitab of Allah and the sunnas of the Prophet peace be upon him I would like to give a brief introduction of shik aim shik aim is of Saudi origin and is a prominent propagator of Islam in English shikh aim is the Imam of for Masjid in jeda besides speaking at our very own peace convention shik gives sermons on various Islamic topics I would first like to call upon brother Mahmud alhak for the recitation of Quran brother mmud a [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] in [Music] [Music] in [Music] in [Music] in [Music] brother mamm now I request shikim to Enlighten us with the speech shikim Al our topic for this morning is directed to the parents and the role of parents in Islam is huge and extremely important to the extent that Allah has made the biggest and most major sins in Islam to be disobedient and disrespectful to your parents after shik so shik is number one the second biggest sin is to be disrespectful to your parents and why is that because of the great role and importance of the Parenthood in the life of an individual it is so huge as a sin that there is no prescribed punishment in this world so if you steal we chop your hand if you kill we chop your head if you are disrespectful to your parents there is no punishment for you worthy of such a sin in this life and it would be stored for you on the day of judgment and parents must be aware of their influence and great role towards their children unfortunately Parenthood is like all other matters in life there are obligations upon you and there are rights of you as parents we always demand and acquire our rights my right over my my son to get married and live in my house and serve me and my wife and his siblings and his and and everyone else in the house his wife is not obliged to do this no I'm not going to discuss this this is our culture he has to do this I want my rights he has to give me money and I take this money and I give it to my second and third and fourth wife and maybe to my children other children and he is working like a mule no the I'm his father the these are my rights what about my obligations usually they would say what obligations as a father I don't have any obligations I did my role no there are a lot of obligations upon you and because this is directed to the parents we're not going to talk about the parents rights we're going to talk about the parents obligations and why do we discuss the parents obligations it's very simple ask anyone do you want your son to pursue a career being uh for example a janitor or being illiterate or being a Shepherd in the desert or do you want him to be a doctor an engineer a pilot an administrator a manager a CEO of a company of course you will choose always what the best yes the best for your son everybody nobody says no no I'm I'm happy I want him to sell miswak you know mwak I don't know if it's legal here in the Emirates or not no they're banning it everywhere even in Saudi you cannot buy this we used to buy it at the doors of the masjids now they're I'm not going to go into that anyhow so what do you want him to work what do you want him to do I want him to have the best okay what about what you invest in him we have a saying pay [Music] peanuts get monkeys when you invest in peanuts you will not get lions and you will not get strong uh things and and a good investment of Return of investment you'll get monkeys so what you invest in your child this is what you will get of course with the grace of Allah in the beginning at the end but you have to take the means and that is why they say what you saw you shall reap so if you put seeds of watermelon you will get watermelon if you put strawberry you'll get strawberry depends on what you saw itself so what are the rights of my child over me what are my obligations toward my child so that he will not be questioning me on the day of judgment it's your mistake father right number one you have to choose the right wife because she's the mother of your child now everybody's looking so oh it's too late sh uh me maybe I can go for a second one and while he was thinking he would find a stick on his head B I know what you thinking she says the wife okay maybe you can but the poor woman what can she do she already chose the wrong husband she has no other alternative now but basically speaking Malik one of the great uh uh thinkers of last century was asked I want to raise my child on a proper Islamic way he said how old is he the man said 3 months old he said too late too late 3 months old yes because you you should have worked and planned for that before you got married and we know the Hadith how to choose a woman and we know the Hadith how to choose a man so we will not get into this but this is something that you have to put in mind after that even at times of intimacy before intercourse you have to say the Dua you have to mention Allah's name you have to supplicate which means that ah Islam is not only praying and fasting and then you know half an hour a day and the rest of the day is for me to do it no it is a connection that is 24/7 in every single thing I eat I drink I say Bismillah I go to the Masid I have an intention when I pay sodak not to show off but for the sake of Allah so a parent must be fully integrated and synchronized with Islam teachings so that he is implementing it in his life and we know the Hadith that if through that blessed intercourse resulted a a child thean will not be able to harm him when you say this Dua must be memorized by every single Muslim before meeting with his wife the child is born what to do there are a number of sunnas such as which is a Sunnah that is long gone and it's a different of opinion among Scholars is it specifically for the prophet or is it for all technique whenever a child was born they used to bring him to the prophet Alam and he used to Che a small piece of date until it is almost dissolved then he takes it and he puts it at the upper uh uh ceiling of the child's uh mouth so it's not a big thing it's not hard it can easily dissolve in his mouth so this would be one of the first if not the first thing to enter the child's stomach some say that this is specific for the prophet others say that it is for all also one of your obligations as a father to give a good name to your son and a lot of the Muslims are not doing this a lot of the Muslims especially in Arabia it's a habit that they give the name for their first firstborn after the name of the father and this is no problem if your father's name is Muhammad ABD Abdullah there's no problem but it's a problem when your father's name is the you know what the is Wolf so we in Arabia they it's it's a compliment you know if you're aggressive and and and you cheat people and you beat people you're a meaning you're a wolf what kind of a culture is this this is the culture that we bring up our children to be be aggressive aggressive be strong you know step on people don't let anyone step on you this is UN Islamic so who cares we're Arabs so you have to choose a good name for your son and a lot of the cultures I've come encountered with they give two or three names for an individual so the young boy is muhammadan husin the son of Muhammad Iman abdah the son of Muhammad Imran Ahmed so to to to to say his full name it would take half an hour and this is wrong give him a good name so some of us may give his daughter a name from the culture but it is UN Islamic that's wrong when the child grows up he looks up to the name what's your name s oh S I know one of the 10 bound I know I know and he knows that oh I have a history rather than what's your name Justin I know Justin Timberlake I know Justin Bieber this is your Idol this is your role model so you give him a good name and also the you know the we're not going to get into this one for the girl and two for the males now one of the greatest obligations upon a parent is to protect his offspring his children from Hellfire and this is a must this is not a recommendation Allah Asel says in the Quran oh you believe who believe word off from yourselves and your families a fire whose fuel is men and Stones over which are appointed Angels stem and severe who disobey not from executing the commands they receive from Allah but do that which they are commanded so this is your obligation and unfortunately if you look at the deteriorating situation of the Muslims you will find that rarely you will find Muslims abiding by this instruction seriously speaking we take the best best care of our children when it comes to health when it comes to education when it comes to feeding and that's why obesity is one of the highest rates among Muslims mallah you'll find a young child 5 six years and he's like 200b you said what is this Mah it's bulky he cannot move he doesn't need to learn how to swim you put him in a swimming pool he floats that's one of the advantages of being obese but this is wrong where is the agility where is the strength where is the why because I feed him well I clothe him well I choose the best for him what about his prayer the prophet saysat order your children to pray when they're seven and spank them when they're 10 how is your child's prayer for fer prayer do you you wake him up for fer you wake him up it's 5 18 or 5:20 in the morning it's very early and the school is maybe 8 or 9:00 here I don't know and he will not have enough time to sleep but you have to wake him up for faer she he's young he's 36 years old inshallah in the future he will grow up wah I know people 36 40 50 years and they don't pray fa and I see a lot of the parents look downstairs I don't know how many of you pray for on time she I want my son to be Imam bukari Imam muslim okay well let's look at his father no his father is uh Abu jahal maybe why well I did not have time to learn about Islam and you know I work from 9 to 5: and I do this and that but my son inshallah would be a good Muslim and practicing uh uh uh individual yes you are his father the prophet says every newborn is born on the F and his father either makes him a Jew Christian or fire worshipper this is your influence you have to lead my example but most of us they say the problems we live today are the cause of the previous generation and it will be solved inshallah by the Next Generation so what is your role what is your role if the problem you live in today is the last generation our parents and it will be solved by our children okay what is our role we just watching Sheik living the American dream living the Emirates dream the Saudi dream as if we have dream it's all nightmares we don't have dreams anymore our dreams is our aspiration for Jenna this is what we want we have been living on Earth for too long and the longer we live we think alhamdulillah we're closer to Jenna but when we do the calculation we find that we are getting further and further long ago people used to work hard so that they when they come to the age of retirement they spend the rest of their life near mecah near Medina worshiping Allah reading Quran doing he mashallah nowadays when you reach the age age of the retirement you don't want to retire and if you retire and you want to pray fer you've been living 60 years and not praying fer in time do you think you're going to change now you can't and this is why it is our duty to feel humble submissive humiliated to Allah express our poverty to guide us before it is too late so it is your duty to ward off your family from Hellfire commercial break welcome back so how to do this it's not the religious part is the most important part because we're Muslims we're not uh uh people of uh uh atheism or secularism or what whatever they call it no we are people of Islam what deres US what what triggers us is Islamic belief first thing comes Islam and then yes so if I was given the choice be a doctor or be a Sheikh and a scholar the majority of Muslims would say be a doctor then be a Sheikh no if you had the choice be a scholar why with scholar you give healing for the heart and you give guidance to humanity yes but I cannot buy a a latest model car sh you know Islam doesn't pay in this life it pays in the Jenna I need something in here and Jenna inshallah everybody will enter it no you have to set up your priorities first so you have to take care of your child how religiously bring him up as a good Muslim firstly by practicing Islam yourself 24/7 it is ridiculous when I smoke and I tell my son smoking is bad when I curse the people in in the market you stupid you don't understand and cheat and I say clean your mouth when I embezzle and steal and I tell him you have to be honest he's looking at me he says when his mother tells or her mother tells the girl you have to wear the hijab and every time she goes out she puts a mascara and the eyeliner and the foundation the lipsticks and the perfume and she puts her hair out bye honey this is not the hijab that Allah ordered us she hears something in the Masjid in the school and the parents are doing quite the opposite this causes conflict in the child's chest now my parents want me to be a good Muslim in the house it's all Bollywood movies uh uh uh shukan and whatever and dancing and rolling and climbing on trees and falling in rivers Mah super Super Man W he cannot even do these things but this is what they see 24-hour culture and you want them to become a good Muslim the child is torn in between you cannot have this you cannot do this you have to be a total Muslim who who surrenders his will to Allah if you look in the Quran and the Sunnah you will find hundreds of verses lman my father's name is lman and he was advising his son not me definitely and not my father but this is a problem I say to people my name isim they say don't the Quran yeah we related what can you answer people when they ask such questions a brother was with with me yesterday when I coming to uh the airport we were in the in the bus going to the airplane in jida uh Airport so we're in the bus going to the airplane and he sees me mallah where are you going where are we going we are in the bus going to the airplane going to Dubai and you're asking me where are you going and what kind of a question is this so what does he advise his son do not associate others with Allah when was the last time you advised your son like this and sat with him and told him and brought him with the Islamic character and moral conduct my son lying is not good my son cheating is not good my son being generous being courageous being kind being truthful and give him examples give him quality time the prophet wasam used to teach the companions how to train their children when they were seven and eight years of age to fast though fasting is not mandatory except when they hit puberty and this is 5 6 years from now but still they used to train them and whenever they cry they used to give them toys of wool why because this is what they want the children to believe in Imagine instructing your child to pray when he's seven until he is 10 3 years multiply by 360 plus days multiplied by five no spanking no punishment it's almost 4,000 plus times you tell your child pray pray pray pray pray when he's 10as he's programmed some people come to me and say my child is 40 years of age and I take him to the to the Masjid with me and I said wrong don't take him to the Masid why because he's not instructed to do this yeah but he loves it he said no whenever he says daddy take me to the mid tell him not now not now okay once every month you may take him as a for a change if he wants but you keep on building in him the urge to go to the Masjid until he's seven and he's dying to go to the Masjid like a man when he's seven said now you come to me with to the Masjid and take him for f to the Masid take him for to the Masid even if he's sleepy with love with care and he will inallah never leave Salah after that the prophet Alat wasam used to teach preach and mold the children he was with towards Islamic uh principles IB Abbas his cousin almost the age of puberty 12 years of age 13 he used to make him ride behind him and he is is like 50 years older than him yet he's his cousin and he's a learned boy so the prophet invests in him he looks at the boy sometimes you have a good child who loves Islam who is intelligent invest in him plan for him to be a scholar of Islam rather than oh he will be a great doctor okay we have hundreds and thousands of doctors we have hundreds and thousands of Scholars as well we don't we have graduates with certificates but not real Scholars not real implementers of the dean and callers for the dean we don't want a long beard than a short tho and this is it so the prophet what does he say to the boy behind him how is your father my uncle Abbas how is your mother how is your siblings where did you go yes no small talk is not the problems it's it's not the prophet way of speaking utilizing every single moment he said I am going to teach you words oh boy hear them Well Be watchful of Allah and he will protect you Be watchful of Allah and you will find him in front of you and you know the the rest of the beautiful Hadith when we want to speak to our children do we speak to them in such level no no they cannot understand sh what do we teach them oh these are and maybe the best would put somei that's all this is the Islamic teaching no don't look down at your child treat him as a man and he will become a man treat him as a child and he will remain as a child what was the name of the mother of Zu anyone anyone she was the aunt of the Prophet y h who's the aunt of the Prophet wasam the Muslim Prophet uh the Muslim Aunt the one and only saf sa her son was and she used to not beat him she was very harsh on him and they told her why are you being harsh on him she says I love him so much I want to be to become a man and he was that man when he was 10 years of age or 12 some say and he accepted Islam after reaching the age of puberty maybe 14 or 15 but he was very very young he heard in Mecca that someone killed the prophet Alam he took a sword of his father that was longer than him and kept on dragging it running in Mecca and people are looking at this child with without any shirt on him what are you doing he said I'm looking for the killer of the Prophet to kill him and he was 15 or 14 years of age and we know that he was one of the Fierce and strongest Companions of the Prophet wasam because of his mother and you know that his mother in the battle of the trench of alh his mother was a real woman she killed a Jew with the Stick of a tent when he he was trying to spy at The Fortress of Hassan sabit she told Hassan go and kill him this is a Jew he's spying on us and all the Muslims were at the trench he said W you know that I'm good in poetry but I'm not good in fighting so she took it and went there and killed him with one stroke so how would the sun be of course one of the nights of Islam the prophet Alam whenever he sat with children at the table in the Hadith of Omar Sal he was young like five six years of age yet he narrates this Hadith he says I was a young boy and my hand used to go here and left and right in the big plate it's Sunnah to eat from the same plate so he was eating from in front of people and he doing this so the prophet said oh boy say when you teach a child of five years of age bah and eat from what's in front of you and eat with your right hand now how many times do you tell your child do not eat with your left eat with you right she is young no you teach him from a very early age he will become a practicing Muslim you neglect him he's going to be like everyone else and he will hold you responsible it was my father's mistake he did not upbring me on the right thing after the Islamic teaching and and courage and kindness and and everything else comes the worldly matters now when I say up bring him in an Islamic fashion I never said that ignore him in the worldly sciences and matters no it is part of your duty to also ensure that he is topnotch in the worldly things in the etiquettes of uh uh speaking e eating in living in Walking In talking communicating with people and riding the horses if we had horses or riding the cars and driving so he has to be the best because he's a reflection of your own family when I look at a boy who is well-mannered I wouldn't say a what's your name I would say what's your father's name what's your family and I say masallah tab this is a pleasant sight for the eye when I see such a child and when I see a one who is devilish and doing bad things and he says this is my father I resent the father I feel sorry for him but I resent him because this is a manifestation of hisia of his upbringing of the child which he failed miserably IM says it is the responsibility of the father to ensure that his son learns all these etiquettes and if the father is gone it's the mother's responsibility to do this and if she's unable she has to hire someone to upbring him in a good manner and this was the Arab's way you remember that the prophet in the early ages uh uh in his early age he was sent to the the the desert to the bedwin why to upbring him linguistically and in manner to the top level after that all the CFS all the rich people used to hire Scholars to stay 24/7 with their children teach them Arabic teach them poetry teach them Quran teach them how to pray teach them how to uh uh uh behave so this is all part of Islam nowadays we do the same but according to our uh uh uh income so we take them to schools like this Friday school and we ensure that our teachers are the best teachers and we tell our teachers take care of my son and I want him to do this and that listen he did this in that in the house so I focus on him being a brave not coward I want him to speak publicly he's a little bit shy I want him to be generous so even if you give him money to give to charity or sodak this is good for you I think we have like 5 minutes or 10 minutes alhamdulillah so uh what else part of your obligations is to be fair with all of your sons this is one of the biggest mistakes that Muslims do you have three or four children one of them is an a student and the others are B students or C students or even not good every year or every semester you give a priz to the a student mashallah he's best in Quran he's best in school what will happen they will take him one day to the desert to race and then you'll end up finding him in a well not promising you that he will become aiz of Egypt because this doesn't happen all the time now do you mean Sheikh that Prophet y was unfair no he's a prophet and the son of a prophet and the son of a prophet he cannot be unfair to his children but the love you have and you Express is too obvious it was reported that a man was with the prophet when a boy came his son so he took the boy and kissed him and put him on his lap and minutes later his daughter came so he took his daughter and sat her next to him the prophet said by Allah you're not fair with them the son you put him on your lap the daughter water on your side meaning you're favoring one of the other and they're children they're infants yet they know so you must be fair in expressing your love you must be fair in uh uh giving them uh uh what they need and not to differentiate you have to differentiate between gifts and their need so if I have two sons one goes to University and the other one is kindergarten I would not give them the same pocket money the the eldest goes he has a car he has needs so this is not gifts this is needs but if one needed to go to the hospital and be operated and I paid 10,000 Dirham the other siblings would not say give me why oh you give him 10,000 this is something gifts yes I give all of you the biggest and the youngest 500 Dirhams 500 Dirhams or five Dirhams depending on your income they're all equal in gifts not in what you uh give of course the Hadith of bash is well known that did you give all your children the same gift said no said then I do not testify on transgression onul this is transgression don't you want them all to be good to you equal said yes so you have to be equal to them in Gifts of course your obligations towards the girls is far greater the Hadith shows that by Nature we are inclined to our sons more why because they are the bearer of my name they will help me when they grow up and work and do this and that the girls usually are neglected though they are the softest of hearts and they are usually the one who takes of the father and the mother when they are old no son would come and say I will take of my care of my father and be with him 24/7 only the girls do that and that's why the prophet said whoever takes care of these girls of his Allah would make them a shield from hell if you upbring them well if you treat them well if you're kind and loving and caring and you give them to a righteous husband they will be your shield from Hell nothing is similar to that for the boys maybe the boys will cause you to go to hell may Allah forgive us because of what they do also you have to to be moderate a lot of us and and this is an important topic but there are so many things no not enough time when we treat our children I know a lot of the Muslims they seem to steam off the pressure of work on their children of course when I go to job my job 9 to5 I have problems with the boss with the co-workers with my subordinates with the Cent cents when I drive crazy people drive here in in Emirates you haven't seen a thing come to jida we play like Atari you know the chicken crossing the and you do this you do that it's fun to drive in jeda you have to be a real good driver to not to have an accident so we are so tensed when we go back home we are so filled with with you pressures and and tension and the son comes to you oh daddy my brother hit me and he did this and he did that and he cries to you and you talk to the brother the eldest why did you do this and you steam of him and you put all your worries and pressures and and and stress on him will he grow up to love you and to love his siblings never some of us even may do the wrong thing by saying when he's angry did you pray what does prayer have to do with my problems with my siblings or being disobedient whatever I'm angry did you pray you didn't pray go and pray as a punishment no this you have to be very careful with every word you speak because it is like a nail in the wall you can take the nail off but the trace you can never feel it's there forever and some of us do not discipline their children at all and some are so aggressive I know a brother of mine a friend a very close brother his child was 8 months old 8 months and she used to play with her belly not something below up huh belly and he used to spank her spank her I told him this is 8 month she cannot understand she no no I and there's nothing wrong in the belly what's what's wrong in playing your belly and he keeps on spanking her one day W he brought a light bulb and he burnt her hand and he's and I said you are one of the most ignorant people on earth now alhamdulillah now he's grown up and and he's much better but unfortunately you have to look in your psychology because this is what is going to affect your child some on the other hand do not have any discipline the son does whatever he does the the daughter does whatever she does and wants and he doesn't even speak or reprimand or punish we have to be in the middle the prophet says in the authentic Hadith sallallahu alaihi wasallam put your whip you know the whip they they beat people with in our time Karana a stick put it in somewhere visible for the household because this is better for their upbringing when they know that there is a possibility not necessarily use it just put it there so when the child does something look at this and the child is terrified I will not do it again but not to use it at all or to use it every single minute of the day you have to have the balance and uh uh you have to deal with your children with total and complete unconditional love he is not your enemy she is not your enemy 24/7 love Plus love plus love but be balanced so even when you reprimand them you kiss them even when you punish them you encourage them and not always be negative lots of us in the house why is your hair untidy why are your clothes dirty look at your fingernails when was it last you prayed H this is always the way you did not do your homework look at how you speak to your mother look how you speak your your when did you do this why did you do that it's always criticizing when did you say what was it last when you said a word of encouragement when you have guests and your son comes look at you look at him look at in front of him look at him he's always like this untiy unclean you are demoralizing him no when he comes oh look at my eldest son he's 9 years old mallah yesterday he gave aan he led us in Sunnah Mah he knows wonders of Quran he is the man of the house how will he grow up to sincerely and really be the man of the house and I have a lot of things to say but unfortunately we don't have time last thing last thing I promise inshah I promise because I don't have coffee so last thing never ever give up this is the supplication the of the righteous slaves of Allah Servants of Allah oh Allah grant us from our spouses and Offspring a satisfaction to the eye and make us IM to the Believers so in your supplication in in or innah always humbly ask Allah express your poverty that make me and my Offspring leaders imams for the humanity and supplicate to your child every single day because your supplication is heard and it will be answered and I pray to Allah Asel that he makes us among the outstanding parents not for the sake of people pointing out at us and say mallah he's outstanding but rather as the prophet saidat and this is one of the return of investment a big return of investment is when you are in your grave you find that Windows of paradise are being opened Allah where is this coming from I didn't do this and they tell you this is because of the supplication of your son when an individual dies all his Good Deeds are cut off except three one of them a righteous Offspring whether boy or girl that's licates to you when you're dead so look at your legacy when you die will they pray to Allah or will they curse you while you are dead in your grave"
