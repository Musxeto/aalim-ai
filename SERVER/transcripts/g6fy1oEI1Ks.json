wabarakatuh we're still studying the book of boo luhan maram in lessons in fact last time we stopped at hadith 66 I think and today's hadith is number 67 so who's the brother is going to read brother Sam snoring narrated by Ali ibn Abu Talib Oh Joel oh I know the prophet sallallaahu Selim had appointed three days and nights as a period when a traveler may do it and one day and one night as a period for one who was not traveling that is the wiping over the shoes okay so again we come back to the subject three days and three nights for those who are travelling and those who are residing like us in a city where you live you may wipe on your shoes or your socks for one day and one night this means 24 hours but don't get the idea that after 24 hours your Woodill is void and this is a misconception that a lot of us have what the Prophet permits us to do some of our said them is to wipe over the shoes from this period to that which is 24 hours now let me give you a scenario where this 24 hours is extended let's imagine that you wake up in the morning you'll perform Moodle you go and prefetcher and you're still preserving your ruble you didn't pass any when you didn't urinate you put on your shoes or your socks you go to work you pray the you did not nullify your woudl you pray answer you pray Maghrib and you pray Asia your septic tank is very big but it's a hypothetical it happens some of us don't go to the to the toilet Jonnie except once every 18 hours it happens and once it happens remember that I wore my shoes Roger prayer I prayed five times now it's evening time it's night I go to bed with my shoes on I wake up in the morning now this is the second day by sleeping I have notified my mobile so I go to the toilet and I perform Moodle and I wipe on my socks so the clock starts now so I pray the second day five prayers whether I notify my widow or not whether I wife or not I began in the fire of the second day and I continue I go to bed in the second night I wake up just before Pfizer I perform Moodle and I wipe on my socks so by now by Pfizer I finished 24 hours but my wood law is still there so I pray the third day furlough Horace or Maghreb and Asia with the same wood o of alpha G so in this sense though I'm residing what was the period that I have prayed while putting on my shoes it was three full days and nights yet the period of wiping was only the second day because the first day I didn't notify my Widow the third day I didn't well I didn't notify my Widow so the 24 hours was in the middle so this is for the residing person did I make myself clear anybody has a question should I ask questions another thing so do you think is it understood you have only 24 hours of wiping but that does not mean that you may not wear your socks without wiping before that a whole day and that does not mean you may still keep on your socks after the 24 hours are over you still have the option of doing this at hamdullah and then this misconception must be removed from our minds that after the 24 hours are over Carlos you have to take off your shoes and wash your feet this is not the case as long as you have your woodlawn even if you've wiped your water is still on you did not pass when you did you did not urinate you did not sleep then there's no reason for you to perform Moodle again fati say for example someone has the period like he did he he has the 24 hours period time to wipe on the front of his feet okay and the next day or he was supposed to take off his socks he didn't like the next fresh or the next after they've gone beyond that period he wiped again on the whole vein or on his feet and he went and prayed like what is what is the state he is in for further ado Annies prayer at that time if 24 hours pass from the first time he wiped his feet after that he may not wipe on the on the socks again he's not allowed to if he and if he does his would would not be accepted it would be void because it's obligatory once the 24 hours are over and he nullified his Woodill it's obligatory for him to take off the socks and wash his feet and then he may wear the socks again and another day and night ah renewable automatically but if the 24 hours 24 hours are over he still preserves his wool he may pray but if he notifies his widow after 24 hours from the very of the first wiping then he should immediately take off his socks or shoes and wash his feet again now I may ask a question maybe Mostafa would like to answer this question give it some thought now assume that you have performed 104 badger prayer and you wore your socks Lahore prayer you nullified a yodel so you performing an ablution and then you wiped on your socks and you went into the mosque it's still not the time you wiped on the socks and just before the Obama the call for prayer you felt hot and you took off your socks should you go out and perform will do again or must can you pray and continue to pray what do you think if you wiped over it yes and you took it off then you must go and make ablution again okay this is a misconception that a lot of us have see once you take off your socks you did not commit something that notifies your boodle now you may not wipe on the socks again if you put them on again this is a different story but it's like exactly if you perform will do you wipe over your head your hair if you have here and then you go to the barber and you shave your head clean so must I perform what do again putting your example in mind said yes the hair that I wiped on is that is no longer there so I think I should wipe again on my head that should be no the things that nullify your Woodill are a number of things and removing issues are not one of them and it's not one of them and also shaving your head is not one of them so if I've wiped on my socks and I took them off I may still pray in my current situation as I did not nullify my model okay the following hadith narrated so Ben may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wasallam sent an expedition he commanded them to wipe over the headbands that is the turbans and the boots that is the shoes of course now when you hear the word headbands this is a translation a lots of the translations yeah maybe they're not well translated so one says headbands whoa headbands Rambo or something it's they didn't you we were not used to wearing these things like and lots of the things that the brothers in Muslim worlds where God did it's so weird you know you get people now Muslims are following the West and every single thing as the Prophet system has warned you get people wearing earrings we did the putting chains and bracelets and so on what what are you doing I said well it looks cool the looks is not important it the following of the Prophet guys decide to have your dignity to have your own personality to follow the Sunnah this is where you get your power from so headbands meaning turbans this is what they used to wear and the prophets are solemn before sending expeditions he used to give them advice they didn't have any mobiles so if they were in coucher encountered with a problem they wouldn't have the chance to wire the Prophet or Sasaram they would have to wait a whole month and come back and say well we face this and that and we didn't know what to do so the Prophet salah salem gives them a warning gives them advice it's exactly like when people came to the Prophet and this is very informative this is what we should always do try to add an extra edge of information the Prophet SAW Selim once a group of companions came to him and they told him that we travel by sea and quite frequently we are carrying with us a small portion of water drinking water because we don't have enough space on our boats and after a week or so we have a problem we are in a dilemma if we use the water to ablution then we will run out of drinking water and then we have a crisis and if we don't if we go and try to perform ablution using seawater its salty it doesn't taste good so is it water they're asking they're trying to gain knowledge to the Prophecy's assalaam yes the water of the sea is purer and also the dead fish of the water of the sea so he added this extra information because they didn't ask him but he figured it out that if they got to travel by sea probably they're gonna starve maybe there they run out of food so what then we know that Muslims may only eat animals that are slaughtered by the people of the book or by Muslims by Jews Christians or a Muslim other than that any other meat is not permissible for us to eat so I'm traveling on sea and I get this whale floating on on the sea or I get this fish so how do I slaughter it so the Prophet is telling them salah salem an extra piece of information that they did not think of but probably they would think of later on and again here this is an expedition the Prophet is sending them away so he's telling them that it is easier for you to do this what to rub on the turbans to wipe over the turbulence and whatever they wear on their feet we have gone through the turbines and we mentioned that now let's go to the things that we wear on our feet we ask a question and we said that do we wipe on anything that we wear on our feet that sir was yes providing it covers the whole foot to the ankles slippers do not count why because you can see the toes you can see the heel you can see part of the foot okay shoes yes you can wipe over your shoes one would say okay can I pray wearing shoes is it okay to wear to pray wearing my boots what do you think samer well as long as it covers the whole of the foot yeah there's no problem what do you think you stuffer as long as it covers the foot and it doesn't have impurity on it okay but why did you say as long as it covers the foot can I pray in my slippers fatty I can I can pray in my slippers but I cannot wipe on top of that okay that's that's the answer okay what else do you have an addition yeah of course I can I can pray with my shoes and if I have wiped on them as long as I've entered my feet in those shoes while they were pure excellent so if I wear my shoes as soon as I get off bed without breaking then without forming woudl then I cannot wipe on the shoes my cameraman says we have to stop so stay with us during the shala and we will continue after the break questions that bother you what about issues of concern to you would you like to share things on your mind with us are you interested in solutions based on an Islamic perspective please join me live in meet your advisor every Friday at 9 p.m. Mecca time here Oh salam aliekum wa rahamtullah before the break we're talking about the difference between praying wearing shoes slippers and so on and wiping over them we may pray wearing our shoes socks slippers whatever and nowadays a lot of people think that this is not proper it's not Islamic well actually it is Islamic the prophets of Allah how are you selling them said pray in your shoes pray in your sandals pray in your slippers because the Jews do not pray wearing their slippers sandals or shoes so this is part of having your identity part of having your own way of living to differentiate muslims from those who are non-muslims so it's whatever is convenient for you do it now putting in mind that i don't want people to listen to this hadith and the following prayer they go to the mosque to the masjid nearby their houses and say well the share said we could wear our shoes so i'm gonna pray in the masjid go all the way to the front row wearing my boots or my shoes and and pray this is unacceptable not because it's not Islamic because mosques nowadays have these carpets and rugs and your shoes are not that clean the Prophet tells us whoever wants to go into the message you should look into his sandals or slippers to see if there are clear or not if they're not you should not pray in them you should clean them and and move the filter dirt that is attached to it but if you are in you know in a journey or if you're traveling or if you're going outdoors and you want to pray with your friends and brothers and it's not a mastery to see you're an outdoors in the park or whatever you don't have to take off your shoes the sooner for you is to pray with your shoes on with your slippers on this is the Sunnah now if you don't feel comfortable with that it's another issue if you're wearing like Texican boots really high with with big stuff attached to it then this end may harm you take them off it's no problem if you're a soldier wearing soldier boots could take a long time taking them off is a horrendous job especially with all the straps and tying them up and so on so you may pray wearing your boots providing you do not provoke the Muslims you don't go to the mosque to the front row wearing your shoes but if you're anywhere else then other than the mosque yes this is the Sunnah for you to wear it we come back to the subject of wiping over the socks and the shoes scholars have different opinions because they have set certain conditions where Muslims should only wipe over the shoes or socks that follow the criteria they have set such as one they say that the shoe or socks should cover the whole foot from toes to the ankle they said that it should not be see-through and it should not have holes in it and they say it should hold by itself and what does that mean meaning that if you wrap it like Madonna bandages this does not hold by itself it's gonna fall so they say that this is unacceptable it should stay firm and fit by itself now other scholars did not like what the previous scholar said and they say that well we could not say that this is authentic or correct because we don't have any evidence now what's strong with a socks being see-through white socks what's wrong with that the majority say no this is unacceptable why is that they say because I can see the skin ok so what's wrong with seeing the color of the skin there's nothing wrong with that other scholars say okay what's wrong with praying with socks that have a small hole in it said Wow if you can see the skin if you can see the flesh this is unacceptable you may not wipe on that why is that they say because the socks should cover the whole foot and the authentic verdict the most correct verdict is the choice of even taymiyah may Allah have mercy on his soul Sheikh al-islam he said imagine the Companions of the Prophet RA salatu salam one of them had enough money to buy a full fetch socks that fits by itself and has no holes in it they were all poor they didn't have money and on the contrary when in one of the battles of the Companions the battle cook used to be called that au revoir Jenny the patches that they used to put on their socks because they used to walk and after 6 or 7 hours of walking you start having holes in your socks or shoes so they used to put patches and they used to wrap bandages over that over it so that they could be able to walk so do you mean to tell me that if I'm in such a situation if my socks has a small hole in it I'm not allowed to do this the answer would be no you are allowed to do it a small hole does not count if the socks is see-through this also does not count it's okay to wipe excuse me it's okay to wipe over the socks as the scholars say we move on to the following hadith narrated by omen brother aloha new without a full chain of narrators and ns with a full chain of narrators when any of you performs ablution and puts his shoes on he may wipe over them offer prayer while what offer prayer wide wearing them and not take off them if he wishes except for sexual impurity again this reiterates the previous hadith we gone through once you put on your shoes once you put on your socks while you are in the state of purity you don't have to take them off you can wipe over them with the exception with janaba sexual impurity okay follow me please narrated by abu bakr radiallahu anhu that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam gave permission for the traveler to wipe over his sous during 3 days and nights and for one who was not traveling during a day and a night if he had been in state of purity when he put them on again this hadith reiterates what we have studied previously one point is not to mention that of the narrator of this hadith is Abu Bakr and he's a different person than Abu Bakr Abu Bakr is the companion of the Prophet Elisha Salam he's one of the ten people that the Prophet SAW said I'm told him that they are in heaven insha'Allah he is the father-in-law of the Prophet as a son because he's the father of Aisha o muhammad abu bakr he's a different companion his name is abu bakr a thaka fee and he was a slave and when the Prophet SAW Solomon his army surrounded the city of Taif chief for three or four weeks or so the Prophet Salla sallam told those who were inside that the besieged city that if anyone comes to them from the slaves he is automatically freed so this was an incentive to the slaves to come to the prophets of Salaam and revert to Islam so Abu baraa was a slave at the time so he came down from the castle of Thoth by a rail and this is the meaning of baqara baqara is the rail so he came down from the castle the besieged city by a rail and the minute the prophet saw him the Companions called him Abu Bakr meaning the guy the man with the rail who came to us so again this reiterates what we've mentioned before that a traveler has the permission has the excuse to make it easier for him not to take off his shoes for three days and three nights he may only wipe over his shoes it's not must that he takes them off and wash his feet except in the case of sexual impurity and for those who are residing they may do the same even if there is no reason for that one would say okay I have a toilet that I can perform poodle on or would do in so should I take it off the answer would be no it's not a must you may perform wiping over the shoes or the socks but providing you do that within the span of 24 hours one day and one night and this tells us how easy Islam is it gives us a room to maneuver it gives us a room not to make life difficult on us but remember life is not difficult because Allah tells us to do this you may not choose things that conflict with Islam and say well this makes life easier you have to stick with the Sunnah and the origin of wiping over the shoes is mentioned in the Quran when it comes on wiping over the head and washing the shoes because there are two narrations of of the ayah below Julie ko Oh Fabio Sycamore Julia come out Barossa Kumar Julie come so it can go both ways and it's in the Sunna crystal clear it's a sign of al-sunnah wa l-jama'a as in Muhammad may Allah have mercy on his soul said that he narrated this hadith through 40 of the Companions of the Prophet eraser muscle I'll go fine this is all the time we have for today's programme and until we meet next time fee Amandla assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
