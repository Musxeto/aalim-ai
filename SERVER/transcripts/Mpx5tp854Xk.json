  "title": "Praying the Missed Sunnah of Dhuhr after Asr (during forbidden times) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what's the ruling on praying voluntary prayers after and the reason probably he's asking this question because we all know that there are restrictions uh restricted times of prayer during the day and night so the prophet told usam that it is not permissible to pray after until the sun sets and it's not permissible to pray after fud until the sun rises and these are known as prohibited times of prayer so he says okay what about in the case if I missed a voluntary prayer of of for example and I could not pray it on time can I make it up after it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and the reason for dispute is that the general trend is that you're not allowed to do this however there is an authentic Hadith narrated by may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet Alam came into her house and prayed two ra after so she protested in a sense and objected oh prophet of Allah you always prohibited us to pray after ass and now you're praying to raas what is this he said that there was an Envoy from the tribe of so and so who used to came and I could not have enough time to pray the uh Sunnah until was due so I had to uh make it up now this is the Hadith there is another narration where she said okay prophet of Allah can we do this okay should we do it like you and the prophet said no do not do this and Scholars differed whether this addition of not following him in doing it is authentic or not and the most authentic opinion that it is a weak narration however it is best and safe not to do it unless it is Once In Blue Moon and not a habit and Allah Knows Best"
