  "transcript": "so um sometimes in my class I hear like two guys or like they they be talking about like Islam and for example there was one person that criticized like the fact that for example men can marry like four wives and uh it was kind of clear that that person had like no idea about Islam in general so I kind of wanted to clear up the the misunderstanding and stuff but like I was not sure if I could do that because like I'm a girl and I don't know if that's even possible so yeah I don't know I hope you got my question I got your question protection is a priority in Islam and for you as a female to preserve your Chastity and your well-being is a priority so we from this perspective say that that you must not indulge with them in any such conversation even if it was to defend Islam because this opens the door for Shan this is step one step two let's go and grab a coule capino at Costa and have a healthy conversation I'm interested in Islam step three this is a PG uh rated uh show I can't disclose any further and I hope you understand what I'm saying preserve your Chastity and respect your hijab and stay away from such uh um debates or conversations if there is any good a Muslim man would come and uh bring them to their senses and Allah Knows Best"
