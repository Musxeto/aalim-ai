  "transcript": "from nigeria he says if one was to enter the masjid while the imam is giving the sermon of friday should he sit down and listen or should he pray to raqqa what we known what we know as the hate and masjid then sit down this happened at the time of the prophet when he was giving the sermon of the friday and a companion saliq or sulekh may allah be pleased with him entered the message and sat down and the prophet interrupted the khutbah and said to him did you pray two raka's and the man said no he said stand up and pray two raka's so the prophet interrupted this public general khutbah or sermon for a mistake that this individual had done only to teach the muslims that this must be done therefore this answers your question abdi mujeeb"
