  "transcript": "north from nigeria how should we greet the parents some people say that if they were lying down we cannot sit we have to do it standing up all of these things are cultural it has nothing to do with islam as long as you show your respect this is sufficient don't do anything that is haram such as squatting or bowing or prostrating etc this is haram but at the same time it's up to the customs if in the customs that you greet your parents while standing up no problem in doing that as for the boss when he comes in or the ruler or whatever and people stand up this is again according to the custom but the prohibition is in the heart of the person walking in for example i walk in a room where there are people sitting down i say salaam alaikum allah and no one stands if i feel agitated or i feel humiliated then this is a major sin that may put me in hell because the prophet has some said whoever likes people to stand up when they see when they see him then he should assume his seat in hell fire this is a sign of arrogance so this is not permissible for me now if i see while sitting down someone i haven't seen for a while and i stand up for him to greet him to embrace him there's nothing wrong in that however it's again according to the customs some countries don't know the sunnah so if you don't stand up to the one coming in that would be an insult so you stand just to avoid problems but if he knows the sunnah and you know that he knows the sunnah no you don't stand up he comes to you you shake hands while sitting down there's no problem in that and allah knows best you"
