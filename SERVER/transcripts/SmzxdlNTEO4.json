  "transcript": "um so she I have a question that is it Halal to trade Forex like gold and other currencies using swap free funded accounts so funded account is a fun account which you pay like $60 or more and they give you a kind of exam that if you pass they will give you the account which can be $5,000 of 200k depending on the amount you pay and that funded account have automatic leverage but it doesn't take any interest from The Leverage it just takes a few commission but no interest so you the only time you pay is the $50 and then after you pass and start trading gold or anything else the money that you trade with is not like your money uh after so when you start placing a trade and then if you win the trade you will take like 80% of the money and they they will take the 20% so was it Hal to trade gold or other currencies with funded accounts if if not what what is the Hal way because nowadays we can buy 3,000 gold worth of gold and bring it home and sell it when it's up well this is 110% Haram it is totally prohibited to deal with such leverage because this is all riba based and they are giving you a bait so that you would trade with so if you put $1,000 to trade with they will give you another $9,000 from their own so this is 10,000 you can trade with the moment the amount goes below 9,000 let's say 400 they will block your account take their 9,000 with share capital and 400 from you they will take as Pro profit so this is total gambling in riba based uh loan and Haram and every kind of trade on Forex is not something that's tangible that you have certificates on it's only digits on a monitor so it's all a hoax and it's not permissible for you to buy if you wish you can can buy a um a gold bar 20 G 50 g 100 G and keep it in a safe place in your house and the moment the gold goes up sell it and cash the money if you wish"
