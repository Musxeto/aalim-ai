  "title": "Is it allowed for women to visit Prophet's Grave? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that what is the ruling on visiting the prophet's grave salallahu alaihe wasalam for women we know that it is not permissible and it's an issue of dispute among scholars but the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible for women to visit the graveyards so what visiting the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam consists of visiting a graveyard it's an issue of dispute among scholars personally I would recommend that you only offer salutation to the Prophet Allison Sam without approaching his grave and standing there"
