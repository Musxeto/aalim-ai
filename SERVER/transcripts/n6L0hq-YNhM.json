  "title": "Is doing something haram out of fear of being punished considered shirk? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if a person obeys someone out of the fear of punishment the person would give or not out of the fear which is actually disobedience to allah and he admits that he is doing wrong does that come under  because he's feeling that person more than allah following his way can you give me an example um like maybe my father may have said that bring me the packet of secret and i did it maybe my out of my winds and by all by fearing his punishment okay now we have to understand what kind of fear is considered to be shirk there is natural fear and this is not shirk if i see a lion charging at me and i say to myself i'm not going to be afraid of him because i'm a muslim i will not commit shirk with allah he'll eat me he'll devour me this is not shirk run if the fear is something that is not natural and it is taking place in secrecy so i'm in my home and i remember someone telling me to do something or not to do something nobody's watching me no cameras and due to the great love respect and fear of that individual though he's not present i still have this conviction that he can harm me which is not natural only allah can do that i have this inclination that he can benefit me though he doesn't see me so i comply with his orders for the fear or for the love or for the glorification of that individual now this is fear that is shirk so you have to differentiate your shyness your embarrassment your fear of your father bringing him a cup of haram or a pack of cigarette though you know it's haram just because you're afraid that he might beat you up that he might not give you money this is not shirk this is sinful the shirk is when you fear someone for harming you or benefiting you which only allah can do or when you fear someone out of glorifying them and thinking that they are equivalent to allah azzawajal out of worshiping them this is the fear that may take you out of the for that will take you out of the fold of islam"
