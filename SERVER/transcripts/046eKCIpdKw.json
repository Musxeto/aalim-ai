  "title": "Can we give zakat to the poor without saying that it is zakat money? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for the zakat if you know that this individual is poor for certain and that he is one of the eight categories deserving zakat mentioned in Ayah number 60 in Surat Toba in this case you can give them the zakat without telling them because telling them might break their hearts or if they feel insulted but due to your knowledge that they are truly deserving then there is no need to inform that this is the cat money no just give them the money and leave but if you're doubtful if you have reasons to believe that they no are most likely they're not poor then in this case this is not permissible and you have to make sure that they are among the eight categories"
