  "transcript": "aldam we're still discussing the chapter that deals with the fifth pillar of Islam which is alh pilgrimage from the book of and the Hadith we have is Hadith number 224 this Hadith was narrated by Omar may Allah be pleased with him he once came near the black stone and kissed it and said I know that you are a stone that can neither benefit anyone nor harm anyone had I not seen the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam kissing you I would not have kissed you first of all this Hadith is regarding the black stone and what is the black stone it is the corner of the Kaa from the east in that corner there is an opening and there's a stone inside of it Muslims believe that this stone is from Paradise and that it was as white as milk and it was changed into the color black because of the sins of the people and we believe that on the the day of judgment it will testify to those who kissed it or wiped over it as it is the Sunnah Omar may Allah be pleased with him is clarifying a fact and that is this Stone he does not hold any benefit for us and cannot protect us from any harm and the only reason that Omar is kissing it the only reason that we also kiss it is because the prophet used to do this sallallah alai wasallam and this is a very important rule to be applied in our lives whenever you think that something is Worth Kissing something that is worth seeking the blessing of you have to think twice because if anything is more worthy of seeking the blessing of it would have been the black stone but the prophet Alat did not tell us anything that this Blackstone has for us and that is why the Companions and Omar is one of them believe that it has no harm to protect us from and it has no benefit to bring it to us one may ask was Omar address in the black stone communicating with it and the answer is definitely not he was making his companions listen to him so he was teaching his companions through talking to the stone but we all know that he wasn't actually speaking to the stone because the stone is not someone who you communicate with now again what is the ruling on speaking with things that are not alive is that okay Scholars say that this is permissible because it's part of speaking out I am not communicating with my laptop and I say oh laptop I wish you saw what happened yesterday why aren't you responding I can't read anything I power off no they say that if you speak for example like a lot of the people do with their plants when they're watering their plants they speak to the plants and yes yesterday I went to the supermarket and I met this nice man and mashallah he gave me a copy of the Quran what are you doing they say that this is not shik this is not something that is forbidden because actually you're not talking to it you're just expressing yourself and speaking likewise if you speak to your cat it is not considered to be sh you're not praying you're not worshiping and you're not expecting the cat to answer you back but it is not so don't go to extreme a lot of the Muslims think that everything they do is kufur I get emails from people saying yesterday I spoke on the phone with a friend and I did not say okay goodbye and hung up is this shik seriously people ask me questions like this I hung up without saying bye-bye is this shik I did this is this shik is this kufur so people sometimes go to extreme trying to protect their and this is where Shan comes and at the same time sometimes people neglect things to the extent that they think that everything is okay so my friend's name is for example F and I don't call him f a long name I call him RI hey RI can you do this what does RI mean my God so if you call him R just okay it's depend on the intention definitely this is not acceptable if his name is Abdullah and I call him Allah come let's have lunch I call him by the last name this is complete sh because you're calling someone with Allah's name and that name cannot be called to any other one it's different than when you call someone for example hakeim my name is alhim and this is one of Allah's name but is also shared by his creatures so Al my father is Rahe he's merciful the prophet was described in the Quran that he is so there are names that are shared and it's no problem but there are names specifically for Allah Alman when you say when you say for example Allah all of these are specifically solely to be used for Allah the almighty so Omar Allah be pleased with him was actually making his friends and companions learn from him and what are the things that are permissible for us to kiss are we permitted to kiss the Chamber of the Prophet where he was buried definitely not are we permitted to hang on to the curtains of the Kaa and kiss it no what about the other three corners of the ca IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him was once with mua IB ABI sufyan may Allah be pleased with them all and muaah was going around the Kaa making ta and every corner of the Kaaba he used to wipe on it when he came to the haar Aswad the black stone he kissed it so Abbas told him don't do that the prophet Alat wasam only kissed the black stone and wiped over the Yemen Corner the yemeni corner is the corner before the Blackstone so only these two the prophet used to touch and mua may Allah be pleased with him told IB Abbas who was much younger he told him Abbas there is nothing of this sacred house to be abandoned mua thought that part of glorifying this house part of looking at this house as a place of and direction for the Muslims it has to be honored and part of honoring it is to touch all four corners of it we do not neglect we do not abandon anything of it we think of it highly Abbas said yes this is correct nothing of the house is to be abandoned but Allah said in the Quran that the prophet Alam is an example for you and you must follow his example and the prophet did never touch or wipe except these two the Yemen corner and the black stone and immediately muawiya adhered to that becauseas he knows that this is what the prophet didam and the conception and the belief that he had before Islam that all the house is to be touched and respected and nothing of it to be abandoned was corrected by IB Abbas when he told him about the doing of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam moving on to the following Hadith yes narrated when Allah's prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his companions came to Makkah the pagans circulated the news that a group of people were coming to them and they had been weakened by the fever of Y Medina asalamu alaykum and welcome back so when the prophet came on the seventh year to perform om the people of Mecca evacuated it and they went on top of a mountain called ABI KU and this mountain overlooks the Kaa however it has a blind spot and this blind spot is from between the Y Corner till the Blackstone and they circulated the news among themselves that let us look at these infidels when they come and make ta and laugh at them because the fever of Medina which we spoke about before the fever of y y is the name that the non-muslims used before Islam after Islam we as Muslims do not call it as y we call it as Medina or we call it as or we call it as these are the names of Medina but y was only used by the pagans so that we do not use it so they said that let's laugh because we will see them going around the Kaa Tire because of the fever of Medina and when the prophet heard of thatat he instructed his companions to make what is known as raml and what is raml it is to shorten your steps and make it fast so as if you're jogging but you're not jogging you're just striding in a fast pace and with short steps why because this shows your agility how do sold walk in their marches they walk in a way that shows their strength and power and how do we walk we walk like this when we go to the Haram almost falling half asleep so the prophet told him no show them from yourselves strength and power so that they would fear you and be intimidated but when you come to the Yen corner and to the Blackstone walk normally so that it would would not Tire you so they did this and the pagans were shocked and they said what fever of Y are you talking about they're jumping like deers they're so light and so strong what fever are you talking about and this was on the known as or meaning that this is the that the two parties signed the truce and an agreement on which is to make it after one year after that in the prophet when they offered the TA he instructed them to make rumble all the way not to take a rest between the Y corner and the Blackstone no to make ta and do Rumble in the first three rounds and this is one of the sunnas of ta another Sunnah of ta is known as and what is that this is uncovering your right shoulder so when I have my upper garment covering my shoulders all the time only when I come to the Haram and I want to start my ta I bring it from underneath my shoulder and put it on my left shoulder so my right shoulder would be exposed this is only to be practiced in the first ta and that is it so if I'm making my I go out of my house making it yes or no no only when I want to start I make an uncover it after I finish immediately I cover it until the rest of my om if I'm making Haj the first ta I do I uncover after that I cover and any TA afterwards I always do it covered unlike what some people do some people all the time 24/7 they expose their right shoulder so that when they go home after Hajj you can see the tan on this shoulder and the rest and this is not part of the Sunnah at all only in the first ta also among the things that the prophet Alat wasam used to do is that he used to come to the black stone and the first thing to do before ta is to kiss it the first thing where do we start our TA from from the black stone but not after it so the Sunnah is the first time you go you go to the black stone and you kiss it and we know inshallah as we will find out if you cannot kiss it then you wipe it with your hand and kiss your hand if not possible if you have a stick with your hand touch it with it which is a bent stick if you are unable to do this just sayah allahar not like people say stand in front of the black stone allahar Allah what are you doing no just simply with one hand even if with two hands just say B abbar and move if you stop then you will cause the hundreds of thousands behind you to make a traffic jam and this would cause people difficulties so you have to do it while running around the Kaa do we have any questions yeah alikum due to the overcrowding in Haram what do you have to say about the people passing in front of you while you are praying even the women they pass in front of you what is the correct one if you recall we mentioned this in the chapter that dealt with prayer and we said that the scholars and among them is IB tamya he said that the only place that is Exempted from a woman a dog or Donkey from cutting or interrupting your prayer is the Haram because it is impossible to prevent people especially during the seasons and therefore if a woman usually a woman you will not have a dog nor a donkey in Haram if a woman passes exactly in front of you while praying continue your prayer and never ever think of stopping a woman passing because the harm is much much more if she wants to pass excuse me now this is not permissible at all so bassing your prayer inallah is valid in Haram of meca and Allah Knows Best she when we do the circum mulation the TA after let's say after three rounds it's Salah time the aans happen at Salah time so one of our shoulders is open so do we cover the right one the right one's open so do we cover it for the Salah or we leave it the way it is no you leave it the way it is simply because the prophet when he instructed us when we pray in one garment that we should should cover one shoulder if you remember whenever some of you pray in one garment he should not pray without anything on his shoulder so covering one shoulder does the job inshallah and if you cover both of them there's no problem but as long as it's going to be only for the time of prayer it is permissible inshah yes brother sh as you said earlier that we should not touch anything except the haad andini so some people place that chest they touch that CH to the wall of the Caba from Haj Asad to the door of the Caba is it permissible this is a good question this is known as Al the area under the door and to the but mainly that the area under the door and there is nothing authentic to my knowledge from the prophet side however some of the companions used to consider this to be part of the things to be done when a person is in need of Allah help and support they used to hang on that place and do it personally I would not do it because there isn't an authentic Hadith secondly it is not logical at all when you see the people fighting on there they would go out of their Islamic character and behavior just to get a place also to touch and kiss the black Stone it is not something that a person is instructed to do if there is crowd if you're a big person you can bully your way around you can hit this one and you can push this one and you can grabble this one put a choke hold on that one until you reach there but is this what Islam about no definitely not Islam tells you if you cannot kiss it touch it if it's too far just point at it and this is more than enough this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
