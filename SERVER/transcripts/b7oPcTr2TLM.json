  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah as many things in there are a lot of different opinions of Scholars and when it comes to Purity and impurity this is not a different case so there are few things that Scholars have differed upon for example when a Muslim Muslim dies does his body become NIS the most authentic opinion is that no it's not NIS because the prophet saidat the believer does not become impure so so this means that the corpse of a Muslim deceased is pure when touched when washed and and the likes why do we wash it before burial because this is an Islamic ritual that we follow secondly that which does not have flowing blood and with this we mean the blood that we have in our bodies is not similar to what runs into insects like flies and mosquitoes and the likes so such insects if they were to fall into liquid and die it's not like when an animal falls into it and dies because an animal has flowing blood and it would render the whole container to be NES because now it's a dead animal a dead meat unlike flying eyes scorpions and the likes if they were to fall into such a container it would not make it NIS and the scholars usually use the proof to bacce up by the Hadith of the Prophet Alat when he said if a fly falls into the drink of one of you let him immerse it fully then throw it away and in other Hadith the continuation is because in one of its wings there is the disease and the other Wing there is the um cure of that disease and this is something different as Scholars say to what lives and inhabits in impurities such as COC Roaches for example that lives uh that live in toilets and in sewers this is different because they're immersed and they live in such impurities but other insects the scholars say that in terms of Purity and impurity we're not talking about whether you like it or not whether it's hygienic or not we're talking about what makes it permissible for you to per form woo an evolution with that water or what makes it impure and NES and you have to get rid of it thirdly the urine the dung and the semen of animals which meat may be eaten animals are divided into two types animals that we can eat and this is after slaughtering in an Islamic way and animals that we cannot eat at all and it's prohibited even if it was slaughtered in an Islamic way so the animals like sheep camels cows deer rabbits and the likes these are permissible for us to eat the meat the scholars say that the urine the feces and the semen of such animals uh they are considered to be pure again this has nothing to do with clean or hygiene it has to do with Purity whether This falls into um a place where I'm going to pray in or in a liquid that I'm going to use for woodo purification and the likes and the proof that Scholars use is the Hadith where the Prophet said pray in sheep folds or where they in the Sheep barns where they stay and this indicates that their feces and and dung is pure and it is not a NASA to render your prayer invalid number four which Scholars differed upon is human Seaman and the prophet Alat was a human being his wife tells us how she dealt when there were traces of seen on his clothes so she said that she used to rub it off his clothes if it was dry and she used to sprinkle it with water if it is wet which means that rubbing it off when it's dry that it is pure and the prophet would go and pray with the same garment without being washed and this is an indication that it is uh pure and also one of the things that a lot of the scholars disputed upon is the vaginal discharges the normal vaginal discharges that women get so this is also pure and the most authentic opinion is that it does not invalidate the woodo and it is like human sweat women since the beginning of of time they've been having it and never in the Hadith of the Prophet Alam they were told to change their garments or underwear and to perform wood whenever they wanted to pray as this would be extremely difficult and introduces a lot of hardship number six whatever is left over from what a cat May uh drink or eat now we know that cats are not animals that we can consume or eat but at the same time these animals live among us and so many of us may have them as pets so it would be a lot of hardship if a cat would drink from utensils or from food and then that would render it to be njes and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam once he uh let a cat drink from utensils he had that had some water and he said they are not impure cats are pure they are among those who dwell or go around among you so there's a lot and great hardship if we were to say that whatever they touch or drink from would become uh NIS and Scholars said that whatever mingles with humans other than the dog would share the same ruling such as domestic donkeys so donkeys people live and work with a lot in their farms and the rural areas so they have to get in touch with and they may drink from your uh drinks and eat from your food and the likes so they have the same ruling as well now when we come to blood there's human blood and there is animal blood human blood that has no difference of opinion among Scholars is the blood of mansis and the postnatal bleeding this is agreed upon and the evidences of its impurity is overwhelming and so many of them and the prophet Alat wasam when asked about the menstrual blood on the Garment he said scratch it then rub it with water then Rens it then you may pray wearing it so it has to be washed and removed which indicates that it is a NASA without any uh uh doubt on that the second type of Bloods human bloods are anything else other than menstrual blood or postnatal bleeding blood and it's an issue of dispute again among scholar but the most authentic opinion is that blood that comes out of wounds other than from the private parts is considered to be pure as there is no evidence in the Quran or in the Sunnah backing the opinion that says it's impure and the companions may Allah be pleased with them since the time of the Prophet Salli wasallam at the time of wars or after the time of Wars used to pray with their wounds gushing with blood and with clothes with stain stains of of blood and this uh would not make them their prayer invalid nor the prophet would order them Alam to wash it off now when we come to animals the blood of animals either the animals are those that we can eat the meat or animals that we cannot eat the meat animals that we can eat the meat and it was slaughtered in an Islamic way that this blood is considered to be pure unless it's the gushing blood so the blood that remains in the veins of the meat after we Slaughter the animal and we take a big chunk of steak and we cook it and we find that there is traces of blood maybe coming on top this blood is Forgiven because it's not gushing and it's pure even if it comes on my clothes it's pure because I can eat the meat the evidence that is mentioned in your um books about the um the disbelievers bringing the intestines while the prophet Alam was praying and they brought the uh placenta of a camel and placed it on the prophet's back while he was uh uh praying and they say that this is an evidence that it is pure this is a wrong evidence why because this camel was not slaughtered According to Islamic way so everything in it is impure and NIS these are Idol worshippers so this is not a valid evidence to be used but it's in your textbook so you have to go through it and consider it but this this is for your own information any animal that is not slaughtered According to Islamic way it the whole thing is is NES the blood the meat and and and the likes so then what is the evidence that the blood of such uh animals that we can eat is considered to be Halal Allah says so I do not find within which was revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be a dead animal or blood Spilled Out of the Flesh of swine for indeed um it is impure so other than this it is considered to be uh uh pure and and this is why um the Ayah it says that U unless it is a dead animal or blood spilled blood Spilled Out meaning that it comes gushing when you Slaughter the animal or the Flesh of swine so these are the types that are prohibited as per the Ayah if it's not gushed out if it's just found there or in the meat itself then it is not considered to be pure so if an animal is wounded um a camel or a sheep or the likes the blood is considered to be pure without any problem inshallah and as for the blood of animals that we don't eat the meat then there is no uh dispute in that it is totally impure and NIS the exception is in the Hadith of the Prophet when he said there are two bloods and two dead meat that were permitted for us and we know blood and Dead Meat are Haram as per the Quran this is an exception what are the two bloods the Prophet The Prophet said Alam the liver and the spleen so these are the origin of blood in the human body and in animals so we can consume this when we slaughter a an animal that is halal no one would say that oh the liver is all blood we should not eat it no you can eat it and the and the spleen and the two dead are the fish and the Locust even if you find a fish dead on the surface of the water it is permiss ible for us to eat and Allah Knows [Music] [Music]
