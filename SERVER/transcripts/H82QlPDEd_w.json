  "transcript": "masu ma says please guide us can we distribute the cat until the coming Ramadan year long or we should give right away jazak allahu khairan so many people think that giving there's a cat at one go is not beneficial for the poor so I have $10,000 of the cat if I give it all to the poor he or they will spend it on the spot and then over the coming 12 months they'll keep on ringing my bell and knocking on my door asking for help rather I want to give the $10,000 $800 a month until the next Ramadan is this possible is it permissible the answer is no because once the zakat is due it must be given immediately and postponing it for this many months is not permissible however there is a way out so my zakat is due today I take the ten thousand and I distribute it to the poor I'm out of the cat then I say to myself this is another ten thousand of next year's zakat which is due twelve months from today this money I can give on monthly basis for a family of orphans and their mother who need expenses for the month so every month I give them $800 the following month $800 and it's from zakat when next year's a cat is do I calculate my wealth and I find that the zakat is actually $12,000 so I'm two thousand dollars short I take two thousand and give to the poor immediately or I may find that my wealth has decreased and I my zakat is nine thousand dollars so alhamdulillah I already paid nine thousand and a thousand dollars is extra charity and not zakat so I hope you understand that I give this last year's the cat I give it today next year's the cat I start giving it in installments till the dekat date is do twelve months from today"
