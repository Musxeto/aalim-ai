  "title": "Should a woman on menses make ghusl if she sees a wet dream? (To recite Quran) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "talking about which dreams during the period if a woman sees a wet dream during her period but she cannot see any emission due to being on her Menses should she take Russell or not the ruling that the majority of Scholars say is that water that is of Russell is a consequence of seeing water and that is the water ejaculated when a person has an external emission or has a wet dream so if a person sees and remembers and recalls an erotic dream he wakes up he checks he doesn't find any emission or ejaculation in this case we say to him there is no Russell mandatory upon you but if the opposite happens if he were to wake up not recalling any erotic dream and when he checks he finds a large spot of semen in his underwear or her underwear in this case we say you have to perform mosul therefore if a woman on her period she sees a dream she wakes up unable to distinguish whether she ejaculated or not due to the fact she has her period in this case she's a she's not obliged to perform Russell even if she remembers or she recalls seeing an erotic dream because the default is that she did not have one until she sees proof of it but due to the fact that she's on her Menses there is no possibility of her to figure this out therefore she's not mandated she's not obliged to make also but if just to feel comfortable and safe rather than sorry she takes also that would suffice to uplift her major ritual impurity resulted from the nocturnal emission but she remains on her menses and she doesn't pray nor fast one says then what's the use of having a Russell the answer is because without it you cannot recite the Quran while in the state of janaba in the state of major ritual impurity once you perform Russell even if you're in on your period you can recite the Quran you can read the Quran without any problem and Allah Knows Best"
