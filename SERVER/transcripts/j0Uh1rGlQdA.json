  "transcript": "uh there was a situation uh I had a friend who claims to be a say so he played what he claims to be a say how do you know he claims maybe he is okay maybe okay he says say so one one time we had a fight so he was saying that I will make a Dua you will be destroyed or uh if I made that it will be answered straight away since I'm a save so is that true or okay first of all there are two issues here number one doubting people's lineage is this permissible the answer is no people are entrusted with their lineage one asks me what's your name I said he says what do you mean no no no no seriously what's your name I'm from Alim family so no no you're not so this is Haram anyone who says to you I am from this family you should accept if I tell you this is my father you believe because I'm entrusted with those number two the conviction and the belief that anyone from the lineage of the Prophet Alat from a or from the noble lineage of the Prophet that their Dua is answered is bogus a bunch of liars y make money make Dua no I cannot make Dua to make money but I can make Dua Allah curse you why is it this negative I said well I don't know we have abilities we we superheroes but we have abil abilities no this is all lies Allah does not answer the curses or the duas or the likes just because of their lineage and if they were truthfully part of the lineage of the Prophet Alam they would have been humbled they would have acted like the prophet would have loved and not in such an arrogant way so don't buy it"
