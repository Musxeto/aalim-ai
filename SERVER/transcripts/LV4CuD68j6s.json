  "transcript": "Salam alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman a beer host our subject for today new Muslims our guest as always afford this episode for this show from Saudi Arabia we're honored to have with us Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalamualaikum and welcome walaikum Salam what often from lawyer what a catch and it's a pleasure for me to be here thank you as we said our subject is new Muslims we're looking in this show and how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with all the members of society today we focus on new Muslims without a doubt we know that the Prophet peace be upon him was given a very great and noble task that was to continue this calling of human beings to worship Allah support Allah alone continuing this long line of succession going back to Prophet Adam peace be upon him initially the Prophet was terrified by his encounters with angel jibreel and he was alone there was not a Muslim umma waiting for the Prophet to arrive this meant that he was in a position to receive all of the new Muslims the people we now know as the Sahaba did not meet the Prophet as Muslims but they what this means that we can draw upon some great insights about how he managed nourished nourished maintained relations with these new Muslims we look we want to be clear that we're not talking about making Dawa inviting people to Islam our focus in our in our show today is about nurturing that relationship after someone has made the decision to embrace Islam that's our focus let's start with the critical moment after someone has understood what Islam is what its principles and teachings are the critical moment when they make the decision to either accept or reject Islam let's look at the Prophet peace be upon him how what was his response his reaction to people deciding either to accept or reject some Nanak monitor him 'banahna mean Shalala aceldama bollocky Abdi he or Azula mean sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when it came to people accepting islam he was very jubilant and happy you see this was his purpose in life and that is to worship allah azzawajal mainly through calling people out from the darkness into the light so he spent endless hours calling disbelievers to believe in Allah and to follow his commands to the extent that he might have gotten into a phase of depression when they rejected him not that he was depressed audhu billah he had Allah the Almighty to comfort him and this is what Allah did in a number of verses in the quran allah azza wajal condole his messenger by saying perhaps you will kill yourself in grief or out of grief if they do not respond and believe and Allah is telling him don't do that don't be depressed don't be sad if they don't accept in your Dawa you've done your duty in your job and the rest lies in Allah's hands so whenever someone accepted Islam the Prophet Alice salat WA Salam can be clearly seen to be happy a Jew servant we mentioned this before yes just before he died when he was sick the Prophet visited him at a salat WA Salam and asked him to accept Islam and he did the Prophet came out from the house happy with a big smile on his face praising Allah and saying praise be to Allah for Allah has saved him from Hellfire because of me very crema even a bj we know Abu jahil the Pharaoh of this Ummah his son a crema when the conquest of Mecca took place he fled Mecca he didn't stay back behind and he traveled distances and he did not have an aim to go - and then he came in regret back to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam wanting to accept islam now his father was one of the biggest enemies of islam yet when his son Akuma came the Prophet jumped from his seat and embraced him and was so happy to meet him why because he came accepting Islam I'd even had him his father was one of the greatest men of Arabia known for his generosity and whenever you compare generosity to someone you always say he is more generous than had a map ie his well-known name his son ID when he came the Prophet hosted him in his house gave him a cushion to sit down and started to teach him and accept him he was happy Salah Lahore in Salem and this is how we should be when we hear that a celebrity embraced Islam mm-hmm we're happy not because he is a celebrity because a new brother of ours has joined the family if a janitor accepts Islam I'll be as happy as much we might not hear about it but what should be yes what but when we know we are as happy because he's a new brother of ours so that's a good picture for us that you're showing us that the Prophet peace before and was happy when people and concerned when they rejected this is important for us to help manage our expectations we put ourselves under a lot of Russia when we make Dawa I'd like to move to another part of this this also has to do with the context the early Muslim context because Muhammad peace be upon him the Prophet of Islam was drawing people to follow him they weren't coming from Muslim households they weren't they didn't have the teachings of Islam as generations of background that they were coming from so all this was was new and so the question is in terms of developing an Islamic heritage some of the first things the most important things that the Prophet peace be upon him ordered the new Muslims to do as a as a part of establishing this new look what kinds of things that he see were of utmost importance in the lives of the new Muslims if you're talking about what a new Muslim first steps should be this is different than what and how the Muslim community is supposed to deal with this new Muslim in a sense that if a person wants to accept Islam he pops the question what should I would I do it what should I do so the procedure is simple you take a full bath which is highly recommended so it is not mandatory but it's sort of symbolic because you're gonna cleanse your insight and purify your soul with accepting Islam and you are cleansing your body from any impurity and anything that is not worthy of Islam mm-hmm so there are hadith where the Prophet is also I'm used to instruct those who embraced Islam to go and have a notion total bath okay and in some incidents he might tell them to shave their heads but this is Ray and the scholar said that shaving the head is when a person has a haircut that is specific for the disbelievers like the Marines haircut for example is not for Muslims what's called Azhar or like what is it the tomahawk yeah haircut like mr. t or someone like that this is Una's lamech so he has to shave it so that when I see him I can tell that he is I can relate to him okay he's a Muslim and the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam looked at the biggest bigger picture and what is that you know what is the biggest problem new Muslims face is that when we call them to Islam and they make this massive shift from one religion to the other and they leave their culture they leave behind all what was normal for them all these years this is not easy you're letting go of everything that is dear to yourself if it goes against Islam the biggest problem is when people call them to Islam and then they abandon them hmm so now he's like a loner okay my community doesn't want me because I have left their religion and the Muslims are not taking me in because they're busy giving Dawa to someone else so this is like cultivating the land throwing the seeds and leaving hmm you're not irrigating it you're not taking care of it inevitably it's gonna die mmm now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam took good care of this and he made it clear to the companions not to let go of their brother so he would tell them to Mae a lot of duaa and this is step one a new Muslim and an old Muslim what is the most important door of all ask allah azza wajal to make us steadfast on Islam the Prophet Ali salatu salam most well-known duaa that he would not make any other door more than it it was all Turner's of heart make my heart steadfast on Islam and this is the Prophet that is awesome so you could imagine those who here are below him how vulnerable would they be to flipping and a lot of those new Muslims if not been taken care of did flip and shaitaan/satan is there he sees that there's great momentum when they accept Islam so he leaves them for a couple of weeks a couple of months maybe a couple of years until it fades a little bit then he starts his attack by trying to lure them back to their old ways and habits and if there isn't not a sufficient knowledge then they would not make it there are other steps in other ways that if you wish we could discuss that as well yes after the break I'd like I would like to ask you about the things that the Prophet peace be upon him did to help combat misconceptions false beliefs old habits all this kind of thing when we come back in Java assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet shake before the break we promised to get to the subject of how the Prophet peace be upon him dealt with the pre-existing beliefs and habits of the new Muslims around him did he change their names that he encouraged that to be changed how did he manage this process well the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did not use the same method with all okay so it is dependent there are so many Muslims who accepted Islam and the Prophet did not change their names are a thought okay and the vast majority of them their names remained as they were however there are people when they accepted Islam the Prophet Allison changed their names either because their names were inappropriate or it had a bad meaning we addressed this in one of our earlier children yes naming the children so it is not the norm for someone's name as david for example to come and call himself abdullah why is that should I'd like to change my name you don't have to David is a good name Michael is a good name John is a good name it's just a name but if it's something that is the servant of Jesus no this is not permissible if it is the name of their gods for example Rama or whatever this is to be changed if it is someone's name which is insulted insult yeah his name is it's not right yeah you change this mhm but other than that you don't have to if you wish it's okay but it's not a must the see these misconceptions Muslims have them superstitions Muslims have them not only new Muslims so what and how to deal with this the best remedy for ignorant is by far knowledge and this is exactly what the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to do one of his companions Tariq even ischium says that whenever the prophet alayhi salatu salam met a new Muslim he would teach him how to supplicate what to do whenever in the story of Rome Arab Nawab he was an idol worshiper he had a treaty with soft 100 Mia who pledged to pay all of his debts in order to go and assassinate the Prophet Isis on hmm so the guy goes from Mecca to Medina with a poisoned sword in his neck and the Companions saw him and wanted to prevent him the Prophet said leave him mm-hmm and when he came and he said why are you here from my he said my son what you took him as a prisoner of war and I come to pay his ransom so the Prophet smiled and said and what about the sword he said may Allah damn these swords they didn't help us in the Battle of Badr they were no good mm-hmm so the Prophet told him at Isis time what if what if I tell you about the conversation that took place between you and so fond of the Omega near to the cab three nights ago and no one knew about it so that you can come and assassinate me the guy opened his eyes and his jaw dropped to the ground and said by Allah you are the prophet of Allah not a soul knows what happened that night except me and soft one and he embraced Islam so the Prophet was very happy that his assassin need to be became a Muslim not only that the first thing he said to the Companions take your brother and teach him the Orang knowledge this is the greatest barrier and the most feared topic that Satan hates the most he fears it and he hates it because it would call people to get closer to allah azza wajal hmm knowledge the best weapon against ignorance pursuing knowledge I'd like to ask about imposing sudden changes these can come both from within you know maybe we say I'm a new Muslim now I have to do all these things and I have to catch up and there's so much and Islam is so vast or externally maybe the people who are in the relationship with me nurturing me maybe they may have undue expectations maybe they want me to run too fast in Islam what's the problem with making a change too many changes too fast if you cook something and you don't give it its paste it's gonna burn hmm and it's not gonna be good things have to take place in order Allah the Almighty created the heavens and the earth in six days where he could have created them in a less than a second but there is a reason there is a wisdom and that is when things mature and take place in its proper time it has strong foundation and this is why it is not right to flood people with knowledge so a person comes enthusiastic and would like to learn about Islam and I gave and I give him everything that I've learnt in the past 30 years in like five minutes he would not be able to comprehend a of this not only that he may find it an obstacle and a hurdle in front of him to move forward this is with Islamic knowledge in our what about our old habits as we were talking about earlier if I was drinking alcohol if I had many girlfriends if I had a loose jovial lifestyle social life whatever and I and all that needs to change does it apply to that kind of stuff we'll see Dawa and teaching is done with wisdom hikmah what is the meaning of hikmah in islam hikmah or wisdom is placing the right thing in the right place so it would be illogical for me to go to someone and in order to encourage him to come to Islam the first thing I say is partying all night long is haram booze is haram you're gonna stop doing crack you have to let go all of your girlfriend's you don't listen to music you don't watch movies you it's all the don'ts in the world in one pot and he would not take that but rather you give the positive things and this is why the Prophet is a lobster in some incidents for example when a person came to the Prophet Alice awesome and said I want to accept Islam but five daily prayers are too much so the Prophet allowed him to pray twice and he was the ruler and the messenger so he can afford to do this weekend another tribe the tribe of Akif who accepted Islam but said with the exception we will not go for jihad we will not fight and we will not give charity the Prophet allowed it hmm and the Companions were shocked how would you allow them to do this right the Prophet said I said once they become Muslim and strong any man they will fight for the cause of Allah and they will give each other it takes time so it is not at all wise to just bombard your selling and your pitch when you're selling or marketing you what you believe is that you have to be wise in pointing out things so a guy comes to the prophet alayhi salaatu sana and this is quite astonishing we as do add and colours to Allah we have to put this in our mind a guy comes to the Prophet as Salam and he says tell me about Islam he says do you worship Allah and nothing else but Allah okay then what is it to pray five times a day say anything else the Prophet did not say 12 records voluntary night prayer with her 8 prayers and the eclipse prayer nothing he said no unless you want to volunteer and do nothing tell me about Ramadan too fast the month of Ramadan 30 days or 29 anything else white white days Mondays and Thursdays out of our shoe the Prophet did not say no right this is what the guy after hearing the pillars of Islam said by the one who sent you I will not add anything to that the Prophet didn't say listen listen listen there are there's Louis - yeah yeah once he left and departed the Prophet said whoever wants to look at a man from the residence of Jena of paradise let him look at this man now this compare it to what we do with a new Muslim a guy who comes a rapper who is interested in Islam and we know how rappers live is it Oh first of all your body is filled with tattoos no this is no not sorry not good and you have this and you have that and your lifestyle and the money you have that you gain from Haram you have to give it in charity all your beautiful Ferraris and and and Sharons Bugattis you have to get rid what is this this is not Islam that is the ad should look at the bigger picture even if someone curses when I'm giving a Dawa and he curses or says Jesus what what the hell is this yeah move on yeah there is a bigger pie there's a bigger fish to fry this is what we learn from the Dawa of the prophecy not that it is holid but this is not the time to address it shake we have reached the end of the episode there are a number of things that we didn't get to I wanted to ask you about how the Prophet peace be upon us prevented confusion among the new from from being confused and also the subject of incentives incentivizing coming to Islam but the good news is that we're gonna come back again in our next episode to continue talking about new Muslims with Shaikh awesome until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahu apricot"
