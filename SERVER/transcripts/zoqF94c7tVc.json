  "transcript": "she never Haven gorillas Oh salat wa salam ala rasulillah he he he was happy here were many beholder am i bad now we come to the final chapter of this crash course and it deals with the difference of opinion among scholars so many times people ask if we have the power and if we have the Sunnah and we know what is authentic and what is not why do we have difference of opinion between scholars and why do we cater for it why do we accept it why do we tolerate it well first of all you have to understand that the amount of knowledge you and I possess does not come even close to a small percentage of the previous allama before us now when we go when we studied the school of Abu Hanifa Malik Shah very humbly and we studied their beginning and establishment and the final writing of and the scholars that came in it's even difficult for a student to remotely remember the names which means that there's so may of them now do you mean to tell me that you know more than them this is unacceptable so what and how do we deal with such difference of opinion between scholars how can we cater and tolerate this first of all when did the difference of opinion start it started at the time of the Companions why they were companions than you what we do not know yes but after the death of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam they traveled to different places and beloved miss root and robbed of the love Lamar is a meth habit we yesterday we took it huh Medina of the love that bus in Mecca and a beloved member of the last in Egypt because his father is the one who opened Egypt so when they went and they were scattered all over the Arab world because at the time of Roma Abu Bakr and Umar none of the companions were allowed to leave Medina they all were forced to stay in Medina and then roam are allowed even misrule to go to Al Kooper to teach the people and after his death they started to go and were spread around the Arab world now not each and every one of them memorized everything that the Prophet said that is a lot of sir some of them were present some of them weren't meaning even at the time of the Prophet Elisha some in sahih al-bukhari Roma says me and my neighbor of al-azhar we used to swap shifts so the day I go to listen to the Prophet s Salaam he goes to the market he has to earn living cells and buys and order to the farm and when he attends I go to the market so this shows that not every single companion was 24/7 with the Prophet Isis Abu Huraira accepted Islam on the seventh year of hijra on the year of hi MA and he remained only four years with the prophet alayhi salatu salam yet he memorized so much that he became the widest of narrators among the companions why he said because every one of the other companions used to go attend his family to the market attend his farms not staying with the Prophet except me I was accompanying the Prophet Isis Salam just to find something to eat so I no family no house nothing whatever the profit went I went with him this is why he memorized so many and that is why when they were dispersed to different areas some memorized some didn't and this is where they gave their fatwa if they had hadith Cristo clear if they didn't know the hadith they would improvise like Rama did with the issue of the plague we mentioned yesterday he didn't know the hadith he improvised came with a fat one but his fatwa was according to the Sunnah of the Prophet is awesome hamdulillah okay what are the reasons of difference of opinion among scholars there are two main reasons the first one is the dispute and that proof itself's authentication and validation what is it validation what is meant by this now we have a scholar and this scholar issues a fatwa into and a problem that arises now another scholar gives a totally complete different fatwa why would they differ one because the other person did not receive the proof he never heard of it give an example i'm Marubeni acid and now let me give you another photography Roman of the hubbub was once in his home one of the companions not the door he said a Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah he did not reply a salam aliekum wa rahamtullah assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah third time he left by the time he left roma attended the door and he saw the companion going said come come why are you going he said I followed sooner where the profit set gives around three times if not then move on where immediately said you bring me a witness that this hadith is authentic or I will flog you the companion was terrified this is crazy I went he said he went to the other companies and they saw his face pale what's wrong said Rama is going to flog me this and this and this happened they started laughing and he they said to him we will send the youngest of us the companions to go and testify with you meaning that this we all know the ruling so he went with this companion and he testified and he accepted he said I did not say this because I'm accusing of lying but I just wanted people to verify when they narrate the hadith of the Prophet it means that Rama did not know and he was Roman so one the proof does not reach the scholar and this is accepted long ago when a scholar in Yemen gave a verdict though there was a hadith with another scholar in a rock he did not hear and this is why if you read Abu Hanifa Malik Shah theory I am a didn't happen all of them in that biography say whenever the Hadees is authentic this is my mother meaning I don't know maybe I thought I missed the hadith but if the hadith comes and it's authentic Hamas and this is a reminder of what the Shafi said to Ahmed Shah he said amen whenever you get a hadith that is authentic update me because I will follow it number two the proof is not authenticated by the scholar meaning that the hadith or the proof reaches the scholar but he doesn't believe in his authenticity the other scholar believes in is authenticity that's why we have a different of opinion sample asma bint ABI bakr entered at the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam wearing thin clothes the Prophet looked the other way and said as map don't you know that when a girl reaches puberty and she becomes a woman it is not permissible to be seen from her except this and this he pointed to her fate his face and his hands so those who believe that face cover is not mandatory use this hadith other scholars say no this hadith is weak and it has three defects in it and they point out so they do not accept it so the hadith is the divider between accepting or not accepting this verdict so it might reach the scholar but he doesn't think of his authenticity or the other does and this is why we have difference of opinion finally and thirdly the proof does not validate it or is not validated by the scholar meaning that the hadith reaches me I believe it is authentic but I don't believe that it fits the problem that we are addressing and talking about I think that it has a different meaning to it and this is found so many times for example and this is I'm putting from my mouth my head and this is something I'm very angry with in I'll have very felt one of the things that invalidates your rule is not found in the other three schools of thought and what is that eating camels meat the only meth lab that says it invalidates Waddle is the matter of of an humbly I looked into it maybe the hadith is not authentic the hadith is inside Muslim so all of the scholars agree that this is authentic so why did honey abu hanifa Malik and Shari say it does not invalidate look into the hadith itself the Prophet was said asked al Assad was salam o prophet of allah do we perform voodoo from eating camel meat the Prophet said yes for supper and not only that he compared it within the same hadith so they said okay prophet of Allah do we perform wood Oh from eating muttons meat sheep meat not cheap sheep with this huh and the Prophet said if you wish meaning that it doesn't invalidate your photo if now these two hadith you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that yes if you wish it invalidates although it does not the same hadith is not a different chapter it's the same hadith okay abu hanifa Malik Shafi what's wrong with their minds well why would they reject such a hadith do not jump to conclusions this is what's happening when you jump to conclusions they don't understand I I don't believe in schools of thought these guys they don't praise the hadith of the Prophet they do not respect now you jump to conclusions and you base and you put facts and you accept them as facts while because of your ignorance you don't know where they came from okay where did they come from they came from the hadith of Jabbar and Abdullah may Allah be pleased with with his father when he said that the last thing we were ordered is not to perform would Oh from anything that was cooked with fire meaning that in the beginning of Islam any food that was cooked through fire you have to perform a loop that was established but then this was what abrogated so when it was abrogated the three schools of thought thought that the hadith of the camels meat was also included in that easy so the hadith reached them the hadith is authentic but it is not validated by the scholar they do not think it fits this issue clear now my understanding to it because I'm humbly I stick with the humbly because it goes in line with the Quran and Sunnah I would say their validation their acceptance of hadith of Gibran Abdullah is valid but the if the Prophet and his thought was Salam was asked in these two cases of camel and mutton he would have said in both if you wish because mutton if it was Haram - if it invalidated wood oh it would have invalidated it according to a Jabbar Abdullah before it was abrogated but this hadith proves that this was an exception so yes food that is cooked does not affect your you do accept camel's feet and the hadith is crystal clear in it so if you understand where each and every scholar and school of thought came from you respect them but when you have narrow knowledge you just simply saw a happy if you took it and you started pointing fingers that all schools of thought they don't understand they don't pay attention they don't respect the hadith then you prove you're ignorant to the whole world moving on to the second reason the second reason is that there is a dispute in the proofs meaning and understanding now the first we have the dispute whether it is authentic validated or not now in the understanding so one of the ways that would cause difference of opinion among scholars is that yes I have a proof it is authentic but the understanding or the meaning is a problematic so we encounter other proofs contradiction so for example we have an issue regarding touching the private parts does it invalidate widow or not those who say invalidate will do they invalidate the woudl they have a hadith those who say that it does not invalidate true though they also have a hadith so now we have contradicting Hadees so what do we do so many times we get conflict between evidences so what is the right way to treat such contradictions and conflicts scholars say one whenever you have two conflicting evidences are against aya hadith against hadith aya against hadith what do we do is it stage number one try your level best to reconcile what do you mean why reconcile meaning that in a soulfully in the fundamentals of fact we have something called meaning general and we have something called HUS meaning specific so if I come to an ayah where allah azzawajal says who dramatically accumulated - what demo what a McKinsey it has been made Haram and unlawful for you and later dead meat blood and the meat or the flesh of the swine this is what this is general but then I come to a hadith where the Prophet Allah saw two sam says two bloods and two dead meat are made halal for my ummah so the bloods are the the liver and the spleen and meat is the locust and the fish if you're sailing in a boat and you find a big salmon fish floating on the water dead can we eat it yes but Allah says surely metal a common mater it is made unlawful for you the dead meat so I mean conflicting what do you do what do i do then you get light on top of your head haha now I understand one is general meaning every single dead meat and blood is Haram and what is except this is specific so this in Oh solar fill you find this hundreds of examples in or an instrument without it you will not become Muslim this is why you need scholars to tell you that this is general and this is specific and there are so many cases even the eye itself though general it is made unlawful for you dead meat and the blood at the end of it except those who are forced to do it so now I'm in a desert I'm stranded I'm starving to death I find the donkey it's not even slaughtered its donkeys a dead meat should I eat or not I must eat I have to but I do not feast I eat just to live not invite the people kafka don't key we are making Rosco and I'm making a birthday cake and making t-ball and no no no you just eat what's sufficient for you and that's it so this is stage number one to reconcile I am met with two contradicting and conflicting evidences I try to reconcile no possible I cannot what to do stage two I have to look for the dates and the timing whatever comes before the other then it is abrogated so the later is abrogating the first how do I come to know this through the timing we have a hadith stating that it is prohibited to do so and so on so and after five years the Prophet said it's okay so for example one hadith the Prophet said as I do not visit the graves Hallows we are not allowed to visit the graves another hadith the Prophet said I used to deny you from visiting the graves now go ahead and visit them because it reminds you of the hereafter so immediately the first hadith if I take it and embrace it and neglect the other one I'm following the wrong methodology but when I apply the other one it is abrogated Hamas I'm in good hands number one trick aside number two try to no one is abrogating the other if I met with two evidences that are not willing to reconcile and I'm not able to know which came first because in order to know whether whether it's abrogated or not I have to have what the date without the date I cannot just simply say Hamas it's abrogated and by the way abrogation is mentioned in the Quran Allah says in Surat al-baqarah Malins min ayat in I will do not see how not to be hiding min ha I will miss leha so abrogation is uplifting of the ruling on a particular issue with another evidence so in the beginning mutrah marriage was allowed because they were in deep need the Prophet allowed it for a period of time but then it was made prohibited you cannot come to the first incident and say oh but I had a little odd because the abrogation is there but what are the types of abrogation there are let's say three types I don't know yeah let's see three types if there's a lot more I will add them shown on the way and we can edit filming so there are three types of abrogation one abrogation of the recitation while the ruling remains and you will open the Quran there is nothing mentioned in the Quran but the ruling of the ayah that was uplifted remains example stoning umaña pop said may Allah be pleased with him it was revealed in the Quran that we stone but then it was abrogated and the ruling remains and this is the consensus of all scholars of Islam stoning for the adulterer exists so this is abrogation of the recitation you don't recite it but the ruling is there number two abrogation of the ruling while the recitation reminds remains example so many one of them in Surat al mu J Dilla yeah you hella Deena Amado energy to move rasool fatima vania the energy welcome so Dhaka you know this and you know the meaning there Narvik this ayah is referring as I leave now be Talib says this ayah I'm the only one who applied it in the world when the people used to ask the profit that is salatu salam there were so many so imagine the profit is with you will you leave him you will stick 24/7 with a prophet of allah what's the running on this if I do this what I would do Oh prophet of Allah give me advice Oh prophet of Allah my heart is dying I need to revive my Eman Oh prophet of Allah my wife is nagging how do I treat him so they bombarded the Prophet as so many questions so Allah revealed this ayah whenever you want to speak to the Prophet give sadaqa nobody came this extensively I have to go to the speaker prophet I have to give money to the poor Heidi says I was the only one who applied this because when this ayah was revealed I wanted to speak to the Prophet I took my ring and I gave it in charity and I spoke to him then it was abrogated Allah uplifted it but we still recite the ayah and we do not implement it likewise in the ayahs of gradually prohibiting intoxicants so the first two ayahs are they applied applicable in the ruling so you do not approach Salah when you are intoxicated so now I can drink after Asia no this is abrogated it's totally prohibited so this is stage number two stage number 3 is the abrogation of the dissertation and of the ruling so what do we do with this so the biggest and most famous example as the scholars say is the hadith of I shall be Allah be pleased with her she said among the quran that was revealed to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam that ten sucklings makes prohibition this was revealed in what in the quran if a mother circles a child ten meals it will be that child would become her own and it was abrogated to five so now the five is abrogated recitation of ruling the second five say a recitation or ruling recitation is not found in the Quran but the ruling is applied five if she circles the child five meals he is her son the ten is abrogated recitation and ruling because it's not in the Quran and also the ruling is not applicable so I hope this and is understood the Shalom what brought us to this option okay yes number two huh what number one encountering proof contradictions this is abrogation etc number two dispute in the meaning of the words why would schools of thought differ if the ayah is crystal clear to them and I give you an example of well mu palapa two guitarra Bosna BMOC Hinda fellows at Apollo what is the meaning of this ayah in Chapter two deals with varied what is the meaning of it the waiting period whether it is after divorce after Haller or after death the right there can be as short as one minute it can be one month one month or one monthly cycle can be three monthly cycles or three months and it can be four months and ten days and it can be until she puts her pregnancy so it can be eight months maybe depending on how long it will take these are different types so when we come to the AIA of three peru there is a difference of opinion among scholars in the meaning of or is it purity or menses what is the difference no there is a big difference if I tell my wife you're divorced hey there was his wife no no this is an example people come to a luau if I show you the questions that I get from such wacko people they said Cher I divorced my wife in my mind a brother called me Allah from UK he said I got married with my wife we did not consummate the marriage and has remarried but I keep on telling myself that we're not married I'm getting this was fast so can I divorce my wife so I can dearly leave them marry her again poor people will live well I I feel sorry for them I said yes you divorce her but don't get her mother dead get married again since why she said so that she can marry man if you did not consummate the marriage and you thinking of whispers of Shaitaan for no reason it is that he isn't why I love her she's a good woman but I am possessed with these whispers so such whispers make a difference when you come to the explaining the word of all is it menses or is it purity I divorced my wife so when is it final because in the three monthly cycles she is still my wife though we don't have any hanky-panky no monkey business but she cooks she lives with me she sleeps in the same bed no intimacy at all after that there ain't a period is over ha ha she goes her way I go my way but when is it exactly over she gets the first menses she gets the second menses the minute she gets the third menses she's a stranger to me or after she finishes the menses and she sees her purity she is a stranger to me this is a difference of opinion so it there's a difference of seven days or six maybe more and and and this is why the difference of opinion among scholars is related to the meaning of the words to understand and so and again in the meaning of the words of the translator the meaning of the words in Arabic the Arabs know it so you cannot tell now when I tell you that it is the end of the menses the third which is purity then you took my word for it but there is a bunch of trusted schools of thought that say no it's the moment she gets the third cycle that is over with fine thirdly and lastly the dispute in achieving the desired goal whether it fits what you think it is or not and this deals with what is known as tap if Elmen opt does it fulfill what was it said in or it's a different goal it's a different meaning and this depends on the scholar and how they interpret it so we have a problem we have scholars we have different opinion of scholars and we are like a feather in a storm this says yes this is no this Hilal this is haram like if it has him he didn't pray go pray he wanted to pray sit down and don't pray why are you tossing me like a football now I don't know and this confusion can be positive if it encourages you to study it's positive but if it discourages you to study and think negative of Deen it is negative it's like fear so many people say share I fear death my father died or my uncle died or my grandmother died few months ago a few years ago and since then I'm so afraid of death I say fear can be positive and can be negative if your fear cripples you doesn't allow you to do worse for forms of worship doesn't allow you to acquire knowledge it makes you despair of Allah's mercy how loss I'm doomed why would I not do since I'm gonna do since in a whole bunch this is negative it will take you to help but if the fear of allah azzawajal drives you to repent to do more good deeds too fast mondays and thursdays to give charity to do this and to do that you will end up dying straight to paradise and this is positive field likewise when you see that the confusion because of the difference of opinion of scholars if this confusion makes you or hinders you from studying knowledge why aren't you studying - every time I study difference of opinion of scholars everything there is disputed upon I don't wanna give up I don't want to do I'd rather watch a movie this is negative but if it encourages you like it did would even hasn't why people are tossing me right left and center I'm gonna study my religion I'm gonna memorize Quran I'm gonna try my level best to reach what Allah is pleased with then this is a positive thing so what or how to deal with the difference of opinion among scholars one dispute should not be a reason of malice and discord if I disagree with you in an opinion that is legitimate you're following the Shafi school of thought I'm following the Hanbury school of thought I respect you a brother of two or three oh no no how many just asked me a while ago and I get this question so often on my website and they say in Malaysia and Indonesia they have pollute of Fajar according to the Sunnah this is not part of the Sunnah the Prophet did at one month has some dense fog because Allah ordered him to stop Schaffer ease don't believe that they believe it's part of the religion so people asked me share when I pray in a message and mmm is shuffling what should I do you have two options one fold your hands or put it down depending on what you believe and don't say I mean just wait until he finishes second is you participate so you raise your hands and you say I mean and this is what I would do sure you just said it's not from the Sunnah yes it is not from the Sunnah but that Imam believes it is from the Sunnah this is his conviction and all those who pray are behind him they believe that they're doing something that is according to the Sunnah and the math hub itself is one of the four accepted and renowned perhaps of the Muslims so why would I not follow out follow I have no problem I go to Pakistan I pray with him and the winter they pray the last three records like motherland in the second raka they sit for the Shah hood and the Prophet denied us a list of prohibited us from a hadith even Hajj Alaska Roni authenticated it so I go there when they do this I did know I pray with them share second sister only yes but the Imam believes it's part of the sooner my dispute should not be based on malice and hatred and grudges he believes that he believes the Imam he follows is reliable and accepted and school of thought I have no problem to dispute should be excused in areas of sh t hat again we accept one another's HT had the Imam of a Maliki school did his level best and reached a conclusion I disagree with but I appreciate that this is what he believed and I give him the benefit of the doubt not to start to clash and yes my way or the highway free I avoid the translation is good permission sniffing let let us let us call it a chapeau fatwa shopping let's call it cherry picking sniffing with heroin yes maybe but not with this so the translation is wrong and may Allah be pleased and may also forgive the one who translated is my brother I'm so lazy to spend time on this so I gave it I gave him this he designed it and he his retired his old grumpy but Zella hey daddy he devoted the time he translated to the best of his knowledge so okay it's it's Shady twin brother I don't have twins no the grumpy ass isn't family it has nothing I'll get you a Charmander you go walking huh so it is cherry picking now we've established we accept the four schools of thought right they are accepted to all of us what is not accepted is cherry picking meaning that I select whatever I desire by searching in different schools of thought I will definitely find it for example I'd like to drink wine red wine 1986 it was a good deal so I look in the schools of thought Geoffrey haha Malky Hallam humbly hi I'm Hannah v/o Hanafy has a very moderate way of looking at Nabil not original wine but they say that if you leave the juice for three or four nights until it stings a little bit then you can drink it the other schools of thought say no after the third night you have to throw it away and this is what the Prophet used to do the Prophet used to like to drink water that had some fruit in it so usually they would put dates so first night he will drink it second night he'll drink it there's not you throw it away because this is where it most likely would begin to change not intoxicating but it will begin so Hanafy school of thought they have a little bit wider time frame so I think okay then the beef is okay I will take it back to our shopping is very dangerous because you will be making a new religion how and this is why half a student of knowledge is dangerous to Islam then straight on what do you mean by half us is not full-fledged he's half so I am in Malaysia and I meet a woman and I say marry me she said yeah you have to come and talk to my father so no no no need honey if I says that the Guardian is not important yook this is this is a honey for school of thought they say that it is not part of the religion a woman who can sell and buy property she's entitled to give herself to marriage she doesn't need a guardian the vast majority of schools of thought say Haram because the Prophet says and there is no marriage valid without the Guardian and the two trustworthy witnesses so she said hmm okay you're the ship no guardian no garden but there are no witnesses says yes maíam alex says that it's not required to have witnesses she said but look I think no said you should have attended my class this is your problem she said okay whatever damaja said one of the opinions of Imam Shafi that matter is not mandatory Wow that's easy so yellow hand Allah let's go now if you go to imam abu hanifa he said you must have two witnesses at least animatic by the way he did not say two witnesses are not important he says that two witnesses are not needed but informing the people is so even if you don't classify one and two as witnesses just making it in an open area is enough these are all witnesses and the maha as well so you get into technicalities at the end of the day this is what is known as dating but you call it marriage because of your fatwa shopping selecting what you want according to your own desires my wife comes says I'd like to travel to medina by airplane I said I don't have time have money and I don't feel like going to Medina McKay is closer to me she's know I want to go to Medina this is mm okay they want control channel one and music is halal and you can do this because but you must not travel without a ma home channel to music is haram but travelling without a muhammad is permissible okay you can leave this is fatwa shopping and this is what people are doing nowadays you first come to a choice and a conclusion what do you want I want to smoke now I look for the justification and the reason Hanafy come very heavy ha ha ha man he harem everybody saying harem then I open a clip by an Egyptian actor in a movie he's a comic movie industry 30 40 years ago and he's talking about hash hashish drugs is it if it's Haram we're burning it and if it's challah we're smoking it so sit that's good good justification if it's Haram we're burning it so this is facto a shopping that will take you straight to heaven he shot why because you're bringing the conclusion and then you're searching for anything that supports it and this is not a Muslim a Muslim opens the Quran whatever is in the Quran Allah follow whatever is in the hadith I will follow not the other way around I do not bend the rules and formulate them so that it they would suit my own opinion and finally the last point of our course is that you have to acknowledge that there is only one correct opinion at the side of Allah with all these different opinions of the scholars only one of them is right if you acknowledge this you know that you have to thrive no you have to strive thriving is when you get knowledge and you grow up but you have to strive to reach which one is right okay so what do you mean by only one is right now for schools of thought one says on a particular issue obligatory one says Haram one says recommended one says mokuba not recommended which one is right at the side of Allah it is wrong to say all of them because Allah says fam'ly the battle ha Inlet Bilal what is there after truth except going astray in at the side of Allah truth is only one now he is rewarded for missing the truth but for doing his east he had and doing his best to ijen he did not make it he's rewarded once he is rewarded twice for doing his best and reaching the right conclusion so if we believe and understand this all the four schools of thought are doing their level best but only one of them is on the right path only one of them is accepted by Allah so that yet all of them are rewarded insha Allah we will not have any dispute among us and Allah who Adam when especially me alayhi assalam o allah wa sallim wa barik alaa Abdi he what a surah he nabina muhammad why the idea was obvious rain"
