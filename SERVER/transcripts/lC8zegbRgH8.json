  "transcript": "how to tell my husband to quit from smoking ever even though we are advising him he just says anyway I'm the one who's sinning well actually he's right he's the one who will be held accountable of the day of judgement as a wife you have to be smart you have to be intelligent and you have to weigh the pros and cons you do not kill a mosquito with a shotgun or a cannon that would be an overkill and the sin of smoking though it's sinful weed isn't it and it is foul smell for people who do it yet it is not one of the major sins that allow you as a wife to make his life miserable and maybe end up in divorce so all what you can do is give him advice and tell him that this is not appealing to me I can't kiss you when you smell like this if you want to have intimacy or come close to me please do something about the smell maybe eat some chewing gum peppermint take a shower put perfumes so that he would feel that this is something wrong but keep on nagging him this is haram this is how long what you're doing is haram I'm not gonna be happy with you this is not something that you should do this is not wise you have to do what results in things that are beneficial for your marriage so lay celica hooda home their guidance is not up to you o muhammad sallallaahu a celeb if allah tells the Prophet I assume that their guidance is not in your hands likewise your husband's guidance is not in your hands advise him diplomatically nicely try your level best but at the end of the day he is the one who's gonna pay for all of that"
