  "transcript": "sh I want to ask about U while fasting I know the which forids us to exaggerate but in my case what reaches to my throat when I rinse nose in wo because of the following reasons the firstly my nose is blocked most of the times secondly due to OCD I rinse nose multiple times seven or eight times and sometimes I restart wo sometimes I inhale harder as I feel that water has not gone inside and thirdly I think that I don't Snak properly as water it sometimes in first or second attempt when the nose is blocked as well as when it is open I try my best to spit it out but sometimes I swallow accidentally and sometimes I'm not sure so as long as long as it is done accidentally Sal man and not purposely your fast is valid and to do to try to sniff and blow your nose six or seven times this is not part of the woodo if your nose is blocked it's blocked you try to do it within the three allocated times of inhaling or sniffing the water and uh um pushing it out three times more than that is not needed and it's not a must to reach your upper part of your nostrils if it's blocked the moment it goes to the best of your ability this is sufficient inshallah"
