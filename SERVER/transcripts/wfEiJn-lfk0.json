  "title": "Weather forecast : Does it come under fortune telling? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdallah says is it permissible to engage or believe in weather forecasts as it predicts weather in the future prediction is different than claiming the knowledge of the unseen because what is unseen to you is not unseen to me it's something relative so if I tell you what is in my wallet there's no way for you to know that because this is from the unseen now I tend to know because I'm the one who put the money in it likewise when we speak about what is in that room if you did not go into it you would not know while I would because I have been there when you come to weather forecasts do they claim that tomorrow it's going to rain 100% it's going to reach 45 degrees centigrade do they know that there will be wind or it's going to be calm they don't know coat and coat they'd rather predict and their prediction is not based on what the jinn tell them it's not based on powers that they have been given we don't know the nature of whether it's based on calculations and whatever is based on calculations which people tend to know yes not every single person knows about it but it is knowledge that Allah has given to the people a selective number of a selected number of people this is normal so if someone comes to me and says on the 5th of December the Sun would set at this specific hour so I wait for 3-4 months and to my surprise it happens exactly as he quote unquote predicted so does he know the unseen does he know the lateness is no these things are known by calculations allah azza wajal has fixed this universe on calculations everything is calculated we know when the Sun is going to rise where we know when it is going to set we can also tell that the Sun would partially be eclipsed on that particular date in that particular year and all of this is well known to scholars and to scientists so there's no future prediction like going to a soothsayer and he tells you who stole your car or he tells you whether you'll get the job tomorrow or not this is fortune-telling this is Haram because this knowledge only allah azzawajal possesses and no one else"
