  "title": "Ruling on praying in a masjid where there is a grave - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from nigeria what's the ruling on praying in a masjid where there is a grave okay it's an issue of a dispute in the sense that if the grave was built that is let me rephrase that if the masjid was built over the grave meaning the grave came first then they built a masjid on top of it it has to be demolished and prayer there is not permissible if it's the other way around the masjid was there they introduced the grave to it the grave has to be dug out and buried somewhere else but if we have a situation where the complex of the masjid with the grave inside of it and most likely the grave came afterwards and it's not in the qibla it's at the at the side or at the back but it is included within the borders of the masjid and defense of the masjid and the ceiling of the masjid some scholars say that prayer there is permissible but it's not recommended i personally believe that it is not permissible to pray in such a place just to keep your toe hate intact because people that go in definitely have a specific feeling towards that grave of glorifying it and thinking that it brings benefit and prevents evil even if they don't say it but it's deep down in their heart so i believe that one should avoid that allah knows best hamsa you"
