  "transcript": "how much from Saudi aleyk√ºm selam or not Allah I have a question yes sir regarding the sacrifice of an animal is it permissible to sacrifice a pregnant cow okay any more questions okay so the question is clear a cow that is pregnant or a sheep that is pregnant is permissible to sacrifice it the answer is yes is what's in her belly halal for us to eat the answer is yes the Prophet said Alice also the slaughtering of an animal is a slaughtering to what it is carrying in its womb meaning that this makes the animal the sack the actual slaughtering makes the animal halal for you likewise the sacrifice or the slaughtering of the mother makes the infant or the baby or the calf or whatever you call it halal though you did not slaughter it but by slaughtering the mother it is sufficient slaughter for the baby as well and this is totally permissible for you to eat it without any problem"
