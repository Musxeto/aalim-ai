  "title": "Dozing off while listening to Friday Khutbah, will it break my wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "about man from saudi arabia he says that sometimes during the friday sermon i may doze off a bit so he may fall a little bit asleep and i don't know how long i had slept for well we all know that sleeping is one of the things that nullifies however the exception would be learned from the hadith of the companions such as anasabi malik where he reported that the companions may allah be pleased with them used to wait for isha prayer so the prophet used to delay it a little bit not like what we pray 15 minutes after the event rather he would delay it until maybe an hour or so so the companions used to wait in the masjid and they used to work from fajr until sunset in their farms in their markets so they were totally uh tired so they used to sit and they used to doze off a bit so their heads would fall and some of them their chins would reach their chest but when the prophet came to salat he never told anyone go and perform mudu so in order to balance and combine reconcile all the evidences because there is another hadith where the prophet said allah the i is the lock that protects a person's anus and whenever the eye is closed then the lock is opened meaning that a person can pass wind without knowing it because he's asleep so the scholars say that sleeping nullifies but if the sleeping is very little and minute to the extent that if a person tried to put his hand in your pocket you would have woken up sometimes when people speak and they mention your name you already are alert in addition to the way you're sitting so if you're sitting on your bum as they say then the possibility of passing wind is far less than when you're lying on your side or when you're lying down on the ground because this is much easier for wind to pass therefore you should be the judge if dozing off while the imam is giving the khutbah happened frequently but you were aware of your environment yes you're not aware of what the imam is saying but you were aware if anybody would take something from your pocket or if someone would to say in whispering voice ask them wake up or what are you doing and you would become alert in this case this wudu is still intact and allah knows best"
