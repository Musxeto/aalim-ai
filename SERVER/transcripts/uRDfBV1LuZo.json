  "transcript": "foreign and she receives her salary from a current account in an interest-based Bank is it allowed for her to do that because if it is a necessity uh kindly tell me how it is a necessity to I mean open the current account and working her in a mixed environment to treat the female patients there and uh um the transaction uh which the salary she is receiving is that is the transaction through that current account Halal or Haram kindly advice where is she working in Kashmir in India yes sir okay first of all insha in India to my knowledge they do not have Halal Banks all the banks that they have are conventional interest-based Banks which means that no matter what you do you either have a current account or a saving account in both cases to my knowledge they will give you interest whether you like it or not in such cases there is no sin on you as a Muslim to open a bank account due to your need to save your money in a safe place and to do your transactions we can't we do not we do not live in the Stone ages where we can tuck our money under the mattress people will drip you off in a heartbeat so there's no problem in doing this providing that you acknowledge that this interest is Haram and whatever the bank gives you you have to take it and dispose of it in means of Charity giving it to the poor and needy Muslims as for a female doctor that works in a mixed environment again this is a communal obligation a communal obligation means that if no women approach this field this would cause a lot of hardship for other Muslim women who are forced now to go and make their visitation with a male doctor whether Muslim or non-muslim so it's a doctor from the opposite gender and they may have to expose really private areas of their raura this is shameful embarrassing and unislamic unless there is a need for it and there is no other Islamic acceptable alternative now having said that with the grace of Allah azzawajal if a woman a Muslim woman can participate in the medical field while abiding by her Islamic ethics not compromising her hijab and not socializing when it's not needed in this case as mentioned earlier this is a communal obligation and a Muslim honors and is proud with her hijab trying her level best to abide by old Islamic etiquettes as a Muslim woman working in such an environment and Allah Knows Best"
