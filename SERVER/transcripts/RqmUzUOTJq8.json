  "transcript": "uh sh I know of a brother who does not wear underwear he forgot to close the zip in his pants and after praying two and half raas in behind Imam he realized that he did not close it so it was very much probable that his private part was exposed so is his Salah valid no if his private part was exposed for a ra or more then this is a lot of time time the scholars say if the was exposed for a little time and then concealed there's no problem but if it was exposed for a long time whether you knew about it or not the prayer is invalid he has to repeat the prayer"
