  "transcript": "um yesterday's lecture you mentioned um categories of individuals who you should Muslims should stand for in the USA Court it expected that people stand when a judge comes into the room and again when the judge leaves a room is this permissible islamically this is not permissible however if a person does it he's sinful he did not commit shirk if a person would be thrown for contempt of the court and for insulting the judge and they will throw him in jail for a day or more in this case yeah what the heck just stand up and sit without any belief in the judge or the court or what they mean to you but if your constitutional rights as they say in in the states give you the right not to stand up and you want to sit and there's no legal implication upon that no you should not stand up"
