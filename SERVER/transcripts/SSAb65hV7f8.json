  "transcript": "foreign among the famous duas that we are instructed to say before concluding our prayers and offering salam is the dua of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him he came to the prophet alaihi he said oh prophet of allah teach me something that i should say in my prayer so the prophet taught him this dua imagine abu bakr the highest in ranking in the followers of the prophet sallam the first one to enter jannah from the ummah of the prophet islam what would you expect the dua to be o allah elevate my status in jannah oh allah give me money so that i can buy slaves and free them for your sake o allah grant me long life long health a lot of knowledge listen to the dua allah [Music] the prophet said to him say o allah i have indeed oppressed my soul excessively and none can forgive sin except you so forgive me a forgiveness from yourself and have mercy upon me surely you are the most forgiving and the most merciful wow what a beautiful dua you have nothing all my cards are on the table i submit i confess i've wronged myself big time but there is no way for me to do anything but to run to you i have no other choice or alternative and i have full confidence in your forgiveness and mercy this is the attitude we deal with our lord the almighty this is how we submit ourselves and confess our sins and seek his forgiveness and mercy and listen to the following dua also this is a beautiful dua that the prophet used to say is forgive me for those sins which have come to pass as well as those which shall come to pass so i have done sins in the past and i'll be doing some in the future forgive them and though we know that the prophet hassam has been already forgiven that does not make him lower his guard part of his obedience and being worshipping allah azzawajal and serving him is to continuously seek forgiveness till the day he dies and then he says forgive me and those i have committed in secret as well as those have made public in public we all have a clean slate we are all a-okay we try to look as good as we can no sense the problem is when we lock our doors and we are at the privacy of our homes when only allah is watching us so i ask allah to forgive me what i've done in public and what i do in secret and also to forgive where i have exceeded all bounds as well as those things about which you are more knowledgeable o allah you are all mukaddim you are the one who makes precedences and delay things none has the right to work to be worshipped except you this is coming from the heart nobody is listening to you nobody knows what you're saying it's only you and allah the almighty and this is what allah loves when you express your need and poverty to him also among the beautiful dua that we say before we conclude our prayers is the dua of nijabal the prophet islam took his hand once and said to him o muhat by allah i love you by allah i love you do not abandon these beautiful words what are they the prophet said o help me to remember you to thank you and to worship you in the best of manners so you my friend and i cannot at all remember allah if allah does not guide us look around you how many muslims are neglectful are ignorant are unaware of what's happening to them and about their conclusion in this life billions allah has chosen you allah has guided you allah has given you guidance and this is why allah has made you capable of remembering him without his guide help you could have not have done that now okay and to show you my gratitude to thank you because without you helping me i wouldn't be grateful the vast majority of muslims are ungrateful because they're not worshiping allah as they're supposed to they're openly sinning so i need your guidance to remember you to show my gratitude and thank you and to worship you but here when it came to worshipping allah azza he made a condition and he limited the type of worshiping allah by saying to worship you in the best of manners why because you could be a deviant innovator and you claim that you're worshiping allah you may be excessively doing things that allah doesn't want you to do or not doing what allah ordered you to do in the sufficient fashion so you need allah's guidance to do it in the best of manners and in the best of ways that pleases allah the almighty allah that he helps us to remember him to express our gratitude and to thank him and to worship him to the best of manners in the way that the prophet used to worship him until we meet next time i live in foreign foreign"
