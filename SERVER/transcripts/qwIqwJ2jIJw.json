  "transcript": "me possible I was told to speak for about 20 minutes and I will try to make it as short and beneficial as possible when people look at Islam they look at it from different angles and subhanallah you get some Christians some Jews some Hindus they hate Islam and they wait for every opportunity to attack Islam but once they become Muslims they totally change they love Islam they look at Islam differently likewise you before becoming practicing you did not like Islam very much the beard is doesn't look nice hijab is very primitive I'd like to enjoy my hair once you become practicing Everything Changes what changed you're the same person okay you are the same person but what changed is this what is this my glasses the way I look at things and this is what Islam came with Islam came with new pair of glasses that makes you see things how Allah wants you to see them so it is not your intellect or mine it is not your logic or mind that makes things good or bad it is what these Islamic skepticals make you see things if you look at Islamic values you will find that a lot of things in Islam are looked at from different angles according to how people look in marriage for example the prophet said a woman is sought after for four things her beauty had wealth her lineage and her religious commitment then the prophet says take the woman with the religious commitment or otherwise your hands will be dusted meaning you will not gain anything so normal people would choose a wife number one for what huh Beauty definitely if I bring you a monkey with a lot of money Maybe but without money I will not take it so everyone when getting married wants a beautiful woman and every woman when she gets married she wants a handsome man not someone with five months pregnancy like so many people do let me Allah forgive us so the prophet says no no keep this aside a lot of men don't want to work so they marry from a rich family and he wants a sugar mummy she spends on him a lot of people don't care about money or beauty but they care about prestige oh my wife is from family so and so they're very influential they're very uh well known the prophet says all of this put aside because all of this without religion you'll be loose you you will be in loss as if you're holding dust so this is what Islam tells us and Allah azzawajal also tells the parents when someone proposes to your daughter if he has good religious commitment and good give him in marriage okay with his poor no problem Allah will make him rich if they're poor Allah will make them Rich from his grace likewise if you think about how we evaluate people I look at the brother and I say Masha Allah he is from a very prestigious family he has a good government position this is not how we evaluate people in Islam the prophet Allah was sitting once with one of his companions and a man walked and this man was very prestigious having very nice clothes from a good family so the prophet said what do you think of this man so the companion said oh prophet of Allah this man is very Noble he's from a very uh prestigious family this man if he would propose to a woman they would accept if he would intercede they would accept if he would speak they would listen this guy is very good so the prophet did not say a thing five minutes later another man walks so the prophet says what do you think of this man so the companion said oh prophet of Allah this guy is from the poor Muslims if he proposes nobody gives him in marriage if he intercedes they would reject him if he speaks nobody listens the prophet said this man is better than a thousand men of this one so the prophet is what changing our way of looking at people he says maybe there is a man who has uncombed hair who has dust in his hair who has poor clothes if he would raise his hands and say Allah would answer him so what counts at the sight of Allah azzawajal is not Authority it is not your wealth your money Allah says in the Quran so let not their wealth or their children Amaze you o Muhammad in reality Allah plans is to punish them with these things so the wealth that people have is not always a blessing it can be a punishment from Allah but we martial Allah he has a fancy car Masha Allah he has a beautiful house masha'allah he has a lot of money not knowing that they will pay a lot for this do you know that the prophet said the poor people like you and me will enter Paradise 500 years before the rich the rich will enter Paradise 500 years after the poor why will they go to hell no no no but they will spend 500 years answering questions where did you get the money where did you spend it in so the poor are always luckier than the rich when it comes to this also our definition of someone who's broke is a person who doesn't have money doesn't have credit card doesn't have any bank account but what does the prophet says he said to the companions do you know who's broke so the companion said someone who doesn't have money said no a person who's broke is a person who comes on the day of judgment he has prayers he has fasting he has charity he gives but he in this Dunya took the money of this man backbite this man slandered this man beaten this man made the Bloodshed from this man so on the day of judgment he will give from his Good Deeds to them what happens if his Good Deeds are over he will take from their bad deeds and it will be put on him and he will be thrown in hell although he used to pray fast and give charity this made him no better man he's broke this is how we evaluate people when you speak about strength one of the brothers I was with five minutes ago was taking selfie with me he says Sheikh do you do MMA I said no no alhamdulillah I do nine millimeter you know what's nine millimeter this is better than MMA MMA you have to work two three hours every day and shower and get injury nine millimeters no no problem alhamdulillah so when it comes to strength who's the strongest the one who bench presses the one who does 150 push-ups no the prophet said a strong man is not a man who fights a strong man is the one who controls his anger this is how we look at things we evaluate people by what we see and this is not right in Islam we evaluate people by what they can do for example I am a scholar I look at you what are you who are you what did you do I give lectures I give advice I travel I give I give DARS I'm better than you right no no it's not right how do you know Sheikh I'll tell you the prophet said one dirham out raised 100 000 dirham how's that one dirham is better at the site of Allah than a hundred thousand how the prophet said one man had only two dirham so he took one and gave it to charity how much did he give 50 percent and another man had Millions so he took 100 000 and gave it to charity how much did he give one percent so it shows you that don't look at how many lectures the Sheikh has given how many does how many because Allah knows I can do better I can do more but I'm not doing more why I'm lazy so when I look at you I cannot look down at you and say I'm better than you because according to your knowledge your ability you're doing far more than I'm doing so you are closer to Allah than me this is how we look and evaluate things if you look at quality versus quantity what is most important quality why listen the prophet said if one of you makes perfect voodoo and praise to without speaking to himself about Dunya what will happen Allah forgives all of his previous sins but at the same time how did he describe the khawaris he says you look at your prayers next to theirs and you think that we don't pray because they pray all day all night is there prayer valid no the prophet said they come out of religion as the arrow comes out from a prey so their prayers is invalid Allah will not accept it this is how you evaluate things in Islam by quality and most of us look at things in a bad way such as sickness I am sick alhamdulillah but I'm getting better how do I see my sickness oh it's very bad I cannot eat nothing like I didn't since I arrived I did not eat any Indonesian food I can't with my appetite so do I think of it as bad no I said alhamdulillah Allah erases my sin Allah makes me appreciate the long years I had of good health and Allah makes me understand how small weak vulnerable I am so I will not be arrogant I will always think okay any moment Now angel of death comes and says let's go go where you will find out come so I'm always ready because I have lived a long life alhamdulillah I enjoyed every moment of it this illness is enema from Allah imagine the prophet of Allah Ayub Allah tested him with an illness how many years 18 years he was ill people took him and threw him out of the village next to a dumpster because of his illness the way he looked he smelt he's a prophet of Allah 18 years and he was patient and he was tolerant and he was content after 18 years Allah made him well gave him his family gave him wealth what kind of wealth after being really poor Locust fell from the heavens gold and silver you know Locust they come in millions and billions of swarms they came gold and silver on him and he started collecting collecting collecting putting in his pockets Allah told him are you what are you doing I have given you so much and he says I cannot get enough from your grace or Allah and he keeps collecting this wealth so even illness we see it differently than others people with no Iman they complain why me I remember once I visited an old relative of mine he was 70. and he was a very good man so I came to him and I said Uncle may Allah cure you and get your health back he said my son I have no complaints but my only problem is I have been praying in this Masjid for 50 years every father and look how my health is my neighbor never prayed one raqarah in this Masjid and he's as healthy as a bull he's healthy and I said for Allah Uncle this is are you blaming Allah are you saying because I prayed 50 years look at me and because he did not pray for 50 years look at him this is how people with little Iman little knowledge can easily flip from Islam to kufur you should have seen this as a test and the uncle has lost his test he's failed instead of saying alhamdulillah so basically speaking when it comes to judging others and judging life we have to look at things not through our logic rather through the Islamic glasses if you go and visit some Arab countries they accuse one another of being extremists I come from Saudi Arabia women usually cover their faces if I go to another Arab country they say you're extremists why you make women cover our women don't cover says okay we're not going to cover if you go to another Arab country a little bit liberal like Tunisia for example they don't wear head scarf they were Maxi short sleeves and they say you're extremist why because you cover your women's hair said okay we take hijab off you go to France they say you're extremist why so you're not wearing bikini this is civilization you have to allow your women to wear whatever they want okay let them wear bikinis you go to Spain or to Greece said you're extremists come on Excuse me yes we have topless what topless topless topless and this is found in Greece and Spain in streets I've seen this I've been there [Music] so what is right and wrong you can attend only the Quran and the Sunnah would tell you what is right and what is wrong when you apply the glasses of Quran and Sunnah you become the Beloved servant of Allah Allah loves you and you will see people as Allah wants you to see them and I think this is the time because my Watchman is standing next to me telling me it's enough Muhammad"
