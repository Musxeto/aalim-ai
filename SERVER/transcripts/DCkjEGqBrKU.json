  "transcript": "and welcome to the 57th class of the islamic and today we are about insha allah to speak about the heirs you know that we are in the chapter that deals with inheritance we spoke earlier about the pillars of inheritance the causes of inheritance the conditions of inheritance etc so now we speak about who are the heirs to inherit and scholars have made a number or a list of these heirs so there are 10 male heirs for a deceased i know that in your book it says nine but again this is related to the reasons of inheritance which we discussed last monday and we said that the first two reasons are agreed upon scholars the first reason of inheritance is marriage the second reason is kinship the third reason which the vast majority of scholars say is allegiance and this is related to slavery and we spoke a lot about that so there's no reason for me to repeat it again you can see it in the videos if you wish again but the harafi school of thought was awkward in singling the fact that a man and another person can have voila between them as a condition so if one of them dies the other inherits and the majority of scholars say that this is not applicable anymore therefore the author of this book did not include this person among the heirs which we will do in sha allah so among the male heirs there are ten who are they one the son definitely any person dying leaving heirs among the first to inherit is his son and number two the grandsons and lower male grandchildren of course this is providing that there is no one blocking them no one excluding them so if a man if i die leaving one son behind and ten grandchildren only the son inherits because he is my son and he blocks all grandchildren and great grandchildren as well but we're just talking normally so does a grandson inherit yes if he does not have any of his uncles alive and if his he is a grandson son of my own son because the grandson of my daughter from my daughter's side does not inherit either way so the son the grand sons and lower male grandchildren my father is a must if my father is dead then my grandfather and higher male grandparents that is from my side my father's side the brother so my siblings have a brother meaning that we share the same father but different mothers the nephew so the son of my brother or half a brother we share the same name the son of my daughter the son of my sister he's a nephew but he doesn't inherit okay the nephew he is who is the son of a half brother who has a different mother is if the deceased has the same mother then his nephew does not inherit meaning if we share the same mother but different father he doesn't inherit seven paternal uncle eight son of paternal uncle meaning the cousin the paternal cousin uh who is a full brother of the deceased father or half brother born from the same father same thing number nine husband and allah azzawajal as we've stated before allocated something for the husband whether the marriage was consummated or not and number 10 the master who freed his slave and the slave did not have anyone to inherit him when he dies so these are the ten male heirs of a deceased similarly there are seven types of women who would inherit a deceased and the deceased can be a man can be a woman so a daughter inherits like a son a granddaughter who is the daughter of a son providing that there are no upper people blocking her a mother a grandmother a sister or half sisters a wife and of course the one the woman who sets a free a slave free and the slave does not have anyone to inherit him then she becomes also an heir of him when he dies or her when he dies so these are the types of people that would inherit and it's like swimming you can read a book for a couple of hours about swimming about the techniques about the breathing method how to lift and your arm while the other one is under water to raise your head to take a breath and how many types of strokes you have to do with your feet and with your arms simultaneously you can spend the whole day reading a book once you get into the water you're gonna drown because it requires practice and likewise this is all theoretical when you don't have problems to solve so this might be a bit ambiguous if i tell you a man died leaving behind a wife a mother a father a son and three brothers and two half brothers and one brother from his mother listen uh i don't know what to do no you know you when you look at this and apply it and practice with time you'll master and perfect it insha allah but again this is not a detailed course this is just to give you a preview of what is so after clearing this book you would be a student of knowledge a very first stage elementary student of knowledge which has covered all the fair in a very brief and concise fashion and is capable now to explore and to go further in new endeavors in learning his religion properly so inshallah you have no problem with that none whatsoever now the types of inheritance now we need to know how do people inherit what do you mean sir i'll tell you what i mean there are people that inherit only through what is known as what is farcher we mentioned that in the beginning and said that is a portion designated assigned share this is called so there are a type of heirs that only take what is prescribed for them whether it's half a third whether it's quarter to third whether it's a sixth or an eighth these are the six percentages this designated or assigned shares you don't have any other than this six of them usually there is a seventh one which is in rare cases where we have to deduct from the mother's share though she is supposed to get one-third but we have to deduct it it becomes one-sixth of the entire wealth which is actually a third of what remains after a signing for the husband and the father etc but this is something else so who are given a defined share this is number one then we have a group of heirs that only inherit through the virtues of kinship this is called tar shreeb meaning that they don't have a particular share of a third or a half or a quarter etc no they are given among others either the rest after dividing the different portions to or the shares to those they get the rest or they share the rest with others so we have fart we have taosi then we have a third portion which is a combination of both they get a group of heirs get their share prescribed chair and then they get tarshabe with others in the same incident and the fourth type who either get this or get that but not combined and we will give examples i hope inshallah you will expand your horizons try to be a bit vigilant and agile in understanding maybe a pen and a paper would help just in case we need to mention something that you need to write down maybe maybe not so who would inherit the assigned shares known as these are seven types of these heirs one the husband and we always know that the husband either inherits half of his wife's wealth or a quarter depending whether she has children or not this is mentioned in the quran chapter four surah nisa crystal clear if his wife dies leaving no children he gets half if she has a child or more he gets a quarter full stop but he doesn't get more or less than these two shares number two the wife likewise mentioned if her husband dies leaving no children she gets a quarter if he has a as a child or more she gets one eighth number three and for grandmothers paternal and maternal providing that the mother is dead number five the actual mother so if a person dies leaving a mother behind she either gets one third or one sixth nothing less nothing more and it says in your textbook please correct this because this is wrong and her two sons and this is wrong what the author wanted to write but failed to do so in translating it is the mother and her two offsprings meaning the deceased siblings from his mother's side i have three types of siblings one a real brother or a sister meaning we share the father and mother to have a brother or a sister meaning we share the father our name is the same family name but we have different mothers number three are only brothers and sisters from the mother's side only so our names are different if people see us in the street they wouldn't recognize that we are siblings because he's from a family and i am from a different family but we share the same mother and these brothers to the mother i divide into two types a brother and a sister so instead of the one who wrote the book writing the children of the mother meaning the brothers ancestors of the deceased from his mother's side he wrote her two sons and they're not males one male one female and each one has its different ruling so if and this is going to take a lot to explain but you have to understand that two sons is wrong crush it off and say the son and the daughter of the mother of the deceased so we are referring here to the two sons not of the deceased rather to his mother they are his siblings only from his mother's side the brother and the sister and what after it is also wrong the full and half brothers of the disease this is you have to cross it out because it is not uh correct and allah azzawajal knows best number two the heirs who do not have assigned shares there are ten of these known as so those who inherit such heirs are not inheriting through a fixed share they don't have a percentage they iraq they are inheriting rather through the virtues of kinship and who are they the son the grandson the full brother your sibling his son half brother from the same father his son full paternal uncle and his son paternal uncle from the same father and his son these are called asam and their rulings also cascade when it comes to blood money so those who are your asaba are supposed to share and pay off the blood money if you kill someone by mistake it's their duty to contribute in paying for the blood money but and also the asaba can be the guardian of a woman in marriage your relatives from your mother's side can never be the guardians in marriage as in the case of your maternal uncle he cannot be the guardian of his niece they don't share the same name this is the asaba that we're talking about thirdly heirs who inherit as fart that is a fixed portion sometimes and in one capacity and in tarsi virtues of kinship in another so they combine both these are the father and the grandfather how is that done i'm unable to understand i'll give you an example a man dies leaving behind a mother and a father by default in the quran the mother as we've just stated are among those who inherit through a fault so she because the deceased did not have any children nor siblings she gets one-third and the father through the quran also gets one-third so these are what these are two-thirds these are assigned shares mentioned in the quran for the father and the mother okay then we have one third left one third for the mother one said for the father these are two thirds there is one third left what to do with it ah because he did not have any offspring then the father being the closest to the deceased after his son he doesn't have any sons takes the rest even through the virtues of kinship because he's related to him and likewise the issue of tasi maybe is not very clear let us assume that a man dies leaving a mother a wife and a distant cousin no one closer to him than this distant cousin paternal cousin so the mother gets one third the the wife gets a quarter what about the rest the rest of the wealth goes to that distant cousin who shares the family name why they haven't seen each other for forever they've never met yes but he is his kinship he is asaba so everything goes to him so this is the meaning of tarsibo virtues of kinship the grandfather is the same thing if the father was not there then the grandfather takes everything now four are heirs who inherit but before we go to four let's go to number one those who inherit assigned shares we've gone through this number two heirs who do not have assigned chairs and the first one is a son so explain to me how does the sun thing work okay a man dies leaving one son and a mother and a father and a wife so the wife automatically takes one eighth because the deceased had a son and the mother and the father both each one gets one sixth the same reason because he had the son so 1 6 and 1 6 these are two thirds and we have a 1 8 for the wife we have to uh make a calculation i don't know what's called in english i think to look for the common denominator on the lower part of whatever is called and then we reach a conclusion and know the portion of or the rest of the wealth where does the rest go it goes to the sun whether it's big it's small it is cold the rest goes to the son virtues of kinship and he's the strongest the son is stronger than the father in inheritance the father gets only one sixth he doesn't get everything else because there is a son preventing him from that right of his so number four heirs who inherit as a fault in one capacity and are saved in another capacity but do not combine both i don't know if i made some uh examples here but it seems that i have not made it i did not save it apparently which is very smart of me i'd often do this no problem so going back um they cannot combine both so these are the ones who jointly inherit in the text it says those who jointly inherit one half of the estate except the deceased husband and the ones who jointly inherit a share of the two-thirds this is too confusing who are those who can inherit both and the scholars say that there are four types of heirs one the daughter two the daughter of the son the grand the granddaughter from the sun's side three the sister full sister for half sister which is sharing the same father how would these people inherit both a combination of fart and taci share and virtues of kinship this is understood when a woman a man dies leaving one sister and one daughter so the daughter by default [Music] if he leaves behind one she gets half so he left one daughter she gets half but now we have a sibling a sister and both the sister and the daughter are considered to be women and the ayah says if they were two or more they get two-thirds what to do okay we're not gonna deprive the sister the daughter got one half how to combine this with the sister so that they both get two-thirds we allocate one sixth to the sister so one-sixth plus the half that was prescribed for the daughter equals two-thirds bingo so alhamdulillah both of them got their shares according to the quran but the sister also is one of those who inherit through virtues of kinship so now the two-thirds are allocated one-sixth for the sister half of the daughter what do we do with the remaining there is no living male kinship of the deceased then it goes all of it back to the sister because she shares with her brother and she is asaba and she gets both fart 1 6 so that it completes the two-thirds and the rest of the remaining wealth because of her kinship to that person and the same thing goes with the the um the granddaughter and the same thing goes with the sister and and the daughter etc as we have described and again most books that speak about inheritance you will find that one third of these books maybe or more are all problems a woman died leaving a husband a stepdaughter a two brother two brothers one brother from her mother's side and a grandmother so these problems make your head work and hence you would have to it's like calculus it's like mathematics and you will become good in it and you find it easy insha'allah right the book says all together there are 21 kinds of relatives etc okay that we said that there are more uh the assigned shares from them differ according to the types of relationships and maybe so when we look at the assigned shares we said that they are 99 6 shares so you have the half third quarter um sixth and eighth and two thirds so you have the half and half of it which is quarter and you have the two thirds and half of it which is one third and you have the sixth and you have the eighth these are the six assigned shares for the inheritance now the other classification when we talk about inheritance is something that would be easier than what we have studied and heard and what it how is that it is to tell you exactly who inherits this assigned share so for example when we come to speak about the half which is the biggest share which is the second biggest share we have two thirds and we have half so who inherits the half in the book it says there are five kinds of heirs that may take share of one half so once you program yourself and remember this this would easily help you solve problems of inheritance in the future so the husband this is mentioned in plain black and white in the quran his wife dies leaving no children he gets half who leaves no children the deceased so if i'm married to a woman and she's barren or she never had children or all of her children died in her lifetime but i have 10 children of my own and my wife dies how much do i get from her wealth half of it it is not my children that counts it's the children that she gave birth to and if they're all dead when she died then i get half of it number two the deceased daughter and this is only one so if a person dies leaving a daughter behind the first thing we do is give her half of his wealth this is the first thing we do thirdly the deceased son's daughter when she's the only heir so a man dies leaving no children behind so all of his sons and daughters are dead but he has a lone a single and only granddaughter which is not from his daughters rather from his son so she's the daughter of his son carrying his name she's the only heir she gets half number four the deceased full brother when he has no siblings to share with him and that he sees as neither offspring nor parents nor grandparents so this is uh the full brothers getting half of the siblings but we have to also uh look into this to see where the other half is going to be allocated because usually if he's the only one who's inheriting he will get everything so whether it's half or not so but again and fifthly the deceased half sister born to his father when she has no siblings to inherit with her and the deceased has neither offspring nor parents or grandparents nor a full brother or a full sister so this is what makes it easier for you to comprehend a little bit more before going into solving problems of uh such and maybe next time i will be a little bit more careful to note down some of the problems so that we can discuss them so that not just only to solve them because we have to understand how inheritance is divided and without solving problems we will never ever be able to do that without jumping into the pool we will never ever learn how to swim so insha'allah if i don't forget i will try to note down some of these um problems to be discussed insha'allah uh we i think we will stop here and and go to the questions and we have uh from alpha to meme says what if you she i don't know what does that mean what if you she initiated to be divorced and left without staying for three months enforced her way out and deposited the ola without your consent in the bank account aki i have no idea what you're talking about may the best i could have made was that a woman is requesting divorce the husband is refusing and uh she goes leaves she runs away leaving the home and she deposits i think her dowry in exchange for her without the husband's consent because the husband did not agree for holler and she deposits it in his bank account would this count the answers no it is not the wild west which where she can just barge in or barge out from a marriage either he divorces her or she applies for her and he accepts and if he does not accept to divorce or to give her she has to go to the islamic center or to the muslim court and demand that she is separated from him but running away and depositing the money in his bank account this doesn't make any difference and she's still legally and islamically married to him until it's resolved in a muslim court karima if you were in the u.s and gave someone a hundred dollars which equaled 20 kuwaiti dinars after 10 years the same 100 dollars equaled 33 kuwaiti dinars is it riba to pay it back in kuwaiti dinar's currency with the new value or to return it in u.s dollars same amount well this depends karima on the agreement if the person when he borrowed from you borrowed a hundred dollars then you must return a hundred dollars if he borrowed kuwaiti dinars and you transferred from the us to kuwait this amount in kuwaiti dinars he is obliged to return it in kuwaiti dinars so if i'm in kuwait city and you are in washington d.c and i give you a call and said karima i need 30 uh 20 kuwaiti dinars she said okay i'm going to transfer it to you now after 10 years when i return the money i have to return it to inquity dinars but of course due to the fact that you're in the states i have to transfer it to you in dollars i have to transfer it with the rate of today which is um equivalent to maybe seventy dollars or sixty dollars but i cannot transfer it to you in a different currency because this is what i bought it from you querydinars if i called you i'm in quake city and i said i need a hundred dollars asap so you sent to me a hundred dollars they transferred it into 20kd when you ask me back this money i'll send it to you in dollars which is 30k 33kd because i have to give you a hundred dollars that i borrowed from you so i hope this answers your question faisal says what happens to the miscarriage of six weeks to eight weeks will they go to jannah will the children go to jannah six multiplied by seven days is 42. so 42 days 50 days pregnancies 70 days pregnancies 110 days pregnancies these are all a piece of meat that has no soul in it and hence they will not be in general the soul is breathed in the fetus when it is 120 days old four months this is when the soul is breathed in and this if a a woman miscarriages such a fetus that the soul has already been breathed in this is what will go to jannah and this is what will intercede for its parents on the day of judgement yasser says will my qurbani be acceptable if i only sacrifice one goat from my family can i do qurbani on behalf of the prophet allah you see when we ask questions we try to be careful in how we write them when you say will my urbani be acceptable if i only sacrifice one goat from my family this gives me the inclination to think that your family are made of goats you should have said i only sacrifice one goat on behalf of my family or for my family but i know english is not our first language you and i so we tend to make so many funny mistakes i made one of the most serious funniest mistakes ever when they've suspended my twitter account when i was asked is it permissible to eat mcdonald's and kfc in the west and i said the slaughtering of i didn't say that i even said slaughtering of jews and christians is permissible now i'm talking from an islamic background which any muslim would understand that i was referring to the slaughtering of a jew person to an animal or a christian person the slaughtering of an animal is halal for the muslims to consume but they understood it differently because of my failure in explaining myself so we have to be really careful they thought that i meant that slaughtering jews and christians people to slaughter them as people is permissible though the question is clear they're asking about eating mcdonald's and kfc but anyhow be let's let's be careful rather than being sorry so yes to answer your question we have to know that the prophet allah slaughtered one sheep on behalf of his nine wives so one sheep is sufficient for your whole family that you are that the families are dependent on you and scholars say that if a family lives under one roof and there are 20 or 30 of them and maybe five men are working so i have a joint family five of my children are earning and they have wives and children of their own yet they all eat from the same kitchen that is my kitchen that i provide with money and food scholars say one ram is sufficient now i have the option of slaughtering anything of behemoth whether it is a camel a cow or a sheep or a goat so if you sacrifice a sheep the minimum age is six months you can't sacrifice someone that is younger six months and above is okay when it comes to goats it's one year and above is okay less than one year is not permissible so if you slaughter a goat or a ram or a sheep all of this is okay in sha allah without any problem in that can i do qurbani on behalf of course urbani is the urdu word for sacrifice the arabic islamic terminology is and we should stick with that so um can i do on behalf of the prophet salam well did the prophet al-salam ever instruct his ummah to do so that's just no did the companions ever did something on behalf of the prophet hassam though we acknowledge the fact that they've loved him more than any one of us the answer is no so this clearly indicates that sacrificing on behalf of the prophet islam is a clear innovation and that it is not permissible and allah knows says if a father's will says all the all goes to one son and he had other son and daughter how his wealth after his death be distributed very easy you take the will and you tear it apart and you throw it away because this is an invalid will the prophet isam invalidated it when he said there is no valid will to someone who will inherit so i have a son i have a daughter and i have a wife i write in my will after my death my wife takes the house and the rest of the wealth is distributed according to sharia after my death the will is thrown in the dustbin because my wife has no right other than one eighth in my wealth she cannot take or accept anything more so this is an invalid uh will that cannot and must not be fulfilled and the father for writing such a will has written a prohibited will and he's sinful for that and he will be held accountable on day of judgment if he had knowledge number two is one son if one son has helped his father building a home what are the rights of the other siblings on that house please clarify we've answered this before i think and we said this depends on the intention and whether it was documented or not if i have four or five boys who are earning and i'm about to add a floor or two to the existing house or i need money in building a new house and one of the sons generously gives money to me and there is no agreement neither verbal or in writing that this is alone ask his siblings and they say wallahi our brother is the most generous he gives our father money without account to build his house ask the mother the mother says yes my my dear beloved son he's so generous he's giving us and helping us to build the house once the father dies this beloved generous son cannot come and say listen guys i paid for 40 of the house it belongs to me this is not permissible because as a father had i known that my son is lending me money i would not have accepted it i would say no i don't need your money this house is mine and when i die i want it to be distributed among all my heirs equally and according to sharia so it is your fault as a son for not clarifying it there's nothing wrong at all in saying oh dad listen i'm gonna transfer half a mil to your bank account but this is a loan either you pay it off in your lifetime may i'll prolong your life or i will take it from the wealth you leave behind after your death is that okay if he says yes son of course this is your money then i said okay i'm gonna write a paper you sign it and i'll have two of my siblings or two of our cousins or two strange men testify to it this is right and you can claim that money if you wish afterwards but not before that and allah azzawajal knows best habib says one very important question i need to ask please i joined maghrib and asia but because i had very less time for isha just because before the midnight so i decided to pray asha first then i prayed maghrib are my both prayers valid or should i repeat both or any of them i don't know allah i have so many questions and i keep losing track if i have answered this before or not but this is the responsibility of the um administrators of the islamic webpage it's their duty to sure make sure that i don't get repetitive uh questions because like i said i have so many different places where i solve so many questions so i don't know which one is which but nevertheless maghrib has been already missed so now you want to pray it at risha time so when you pray mahrez would it be a prayer offered on time or a prayer offered as ada definitely it is prayed because it's not prayed at maghrib time therefore scholars say if the following prayer time which is isha which you did not pray has come to an end which allows you only to pray one prayer if you prayed marip then the time of isha would expire and you would pray as well so you prayed both and this is not right so scholars say you have to pray the prayer of the present time if it's going to expire so that you would have prayed it on time so you prayed asia first and afterwards you pray malibu and maghrib both ways is and it's not being offered on time and allah knows best idris says is it permissible to buy a car with zero financing especially if i have enough to pay it back immediately if i were to die again i'm not sure if this is a repeated question or i've answered this on huda or zad tv anyhow when you say that they are giving you the car with zero financing meaning that you are paying it in installments i think they call it emi or something like that and it's zero financing if the statement is 100 true then the answer is yes this is permissible however there's always a catch in the west they would never ever give you something on zero financing yes it's true they're selling you this beautiful corvette c8 stingray 2 in 320 model beautiful car and they're selling it to you for 80 000 dollars on installments over the period of three months three years time zero interest wow what a catch man get me one but people don't ask and don't read be between the lines and the fine print what happens if i'm unable to pay it within the three years period ah if you're one month late we're going to charge you five percent for your delay whoops so you mean that the three years are zero percent interest but anything that exceeds that it becomes ribba based and this is yup in this case this is haram even if you have money to pay it once you die then repay it cash why pay it in installments this is totally prohibited it's like credit cards visa credit card you have a limit of ten thousand dollars wow that's great so i go shopping for ten thousand dollars do i have to pay any interest no no no you have a grace period of 40 days you can pay these 10 000 any day of these 40 days without a single dime extra wow this is great but um what happens if i'm fail if i fail to do that on the first 40 days and i paid on the 30 45 first day so one day late so we will take seven percent interest and it will be added to you this is riba yep so this is totally halal and it is not permissible for us to indulge in such transactions please assist me to understand the ayah on 24 of surat al-anfal as in the translation i found that allah says he stays invisibly between human and their minds no i don't know first of all i don't like interpreting verses of the quran without proper knowledge and without going back to the tafseer books so this is definitely not a good thing and i ask you and urge you not to ask me questions about the quran and the tafsir it's not something you can shoot from the hip but this ayah yani i i just happened to look at it and it says that allah says in the quran allah says in the beginning all you who believe respond to allah and to his messenger when they call you or when the prophet assam calls you to what gives you life to what revives you in this ayah it was said that the prophet has some once saw a man praying and he called him and the man was praying so the prophet read this ayah and told him why did you not respond to the allah and to the messenger of allah azza when he called you to what revives you so the man explained to the prophet that i didn't do that purposely i was i was praying as i was waiting to finish my prayer and allah gives a serious strong warning afterwards and says so if you do not respond to allah and to the call of his messenger then be aware that allah stands between a man and his heart meaning that allah azzawajal would prevent iman from entering your heart as a punishment for not responding to allah and to his messenger so there's nothing invisible in it there's nothing referring to mine it is telling you that when you when you fail to respond and to comply with the deen allah will punish you so that you won't be able to understand or comprehend the deen any longer and this would prevent you from becoming a true sincere and practicing believer and allah azza knows best so the final question is from mahmoud aisha he says i'd like to ask if it is permissible to write the will to give my house to my daughter if my son is not responsible person at this moment i am a widow and i have non-muslim relatives and i believe my daughter she will divide after selling the house portions according to the sharia to her brother and sister but i'm afraid my son will make or do wrong decisions suitable only for him no the answer is this is not applicable such a will is invalid but if you are interested in saving the money that your son may inherit or you're afraid that after your death he would overrule his sisters and take everything in this case you can put in your will that after my death the house the property the wealth i leave behind are divided as follows so if you have a son and two daughters only no parents no husband you say that the son takes half of it and each daughter has quarter of it the other alternative is that you sell the house you give your daughters their share as a gift not as inheritance so if you have two daughters and one a son you give your daughter one third the second daughter one third and you keep one third of your son in a bank account until in his name maybe or uh in a fixed deposit box in an islamic bank or whatever in his name so that he can only catch this after your death this is also a possibility and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet inshallah um next monday i leave you soon"
