  "title": "How did The Prophet ﷺ‎ & The Companions spend the month of Ramadan? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "slamming over him alhamdulillah wa salatu salam ala rasoolillah yad he was happy here many today Buda am Abbado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato many times people say what was the routine of our prophet a little person during the month of Ramadan and they failed to know that the Prophet is awesome and his companions lived the whole year as if it was Ramadan the only edge that Ramadan had was that they would raise the bar during the month of Ramadan so the Prophet irresolute Salam as a means of preparation he used too fast the vast majority of the month before Ramadan which was Shaban and some say that he used too fast it all so that when Ramadan was due people would hit the ground running they used to fasting they used to night prayer they used to reciting the quran the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to give the glad tidings of ramadan to his companions where he said o people this month has come and in it there is a night that is better than a thousand months whoever is deprived from doing good in it he's deprived from all goodness and no one would be deprived of its goodness except someone who is doomed and wronged the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to fast every single day of ramadan so what was special in his fasting nothing much he used to have the pre-dawn meal he used to say that eat the suhoor because having sir hood is a Baraka is a blessing and he used to instruct us to delay this whole to the very last moment before rather than a fetcher and he used to break his fast immediately once the Sun had set and he used to say the people would be in good terms they will be all right as long as they hastened in breaking their fast throughout the day it was the normal day the Prophet used to bathe wash his head he used to use them as whack frequently without any problem even while he's fasting even after the horn before the break before the sunset there's no problem in that because the Prophet used to do it all the time the Prophet used to travel as I saw to some through throughout Ramadan sometimes he used to go for battle and go out in expeditions and he would instruct the Muslims to break their fast if they were to fight so that they would become stronger so the Prophet used to travel and he used to fast while traveling and sometimes he used to break while traveling we know that the Battle of batter and conquest of Mecca were in the month of Ramadan so it is not true what so many of us do in Ramadan when we think it's the time of being tired being lazy not able to work this wasn't the case at the time of the Prophet Oh sir the companions and all the Muslims throughout the centuries they used to be active even if it were Ramadan I know a lot of people who go to the gym while fasting I know people that go and play tennis while fasting and this does not hinder them from offering night prayer with taraweeh and having a good futur and reading great portions of the Quran it is their shackles we tend to tie ourselves in that prevent us from moving forward fasting is not something that hinders us from behaving working and being active it's all in here the prophet alayhi salat wa salam during ramadan used to pray night prayer has every other night but in Ramadan he prayed taraweeh a night prayer is divided into sub categories such as Tala we too had Jude with it all of this is called night prayer in Ramadan the Prophet is to do that in congregation he led his companions in 3 to 4 nights and then he stopped because he feared that Allah might make it mandatory and obligatory upon the Muslims and he did not want to burden his Ummah and that is why when the Prophet died that is Assam and the revelation was over Omar may Allah be pleased with him went into the Masjid once and so the people praying during Ramadan night time either alone or in patches so he said that if we combine all the companions and all the people to pray behind one Imam that would be a good thing so he revived the sunnah of the prophet has some which he had done three or four nights and he appointed obey even a cap and to me matt darey may allah be pleased with them to lead the people in taraweeh they used to lead the people from after Isha till just before Fez your time and the people used to carry staffs and sticks to lean on because it was they were too tired to stand this is how the Companions used to spend their time during night time in Ramadan and the Prophet I racism used to also encourage the Muslims by saying whoever prays night prayer during Ramadan out of conviction and anticipation of the reward allowed forgive his previous sense and the Prophet as I am used to perform ehtekaf or seclusion in the last 10 nights of ramadan tracing and trying to pursue the night of decree like a little other which is better than a thousand month he never missed the serta calf except once and his wives used to perform at the calf with him as well in the Masjid and this is where the ehtekaf should be done what was prominent in Ramadan that the Prophet a lustrum used to revise the Quran every single night with gibreel and he would revise the whole Quran during Ramadan except in the last year before his death he devised it twice rather than once and also even Abbas tells us that the prophet alaihi wa sallam was as generous as the wind and he would be mostly more generous during the month of Ramadan when gibreel used to revise the Koran with him this means that the Koran ignites the will to give in charity because it makes you believe in the promise of Allah that if you give Allah would double that to 10 times to 700 times for you only if you believe therefore Ramadan is like any other month but the rewards multiplied and the atmosphere supports you to go ahead and excel and raise the bar and do exactly as the Prophet Allah saw some had done trying to achieve the utmost possible rewards from allah azza wajal by utilizing every moment during your day and during your night i pray to allah azza wajal that he makes this ramadan the best of all Ramadan's that we had ever witnessed with the grace of allah subhanahu wata'ala assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
