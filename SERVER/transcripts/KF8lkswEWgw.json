  "transcript": "okay we have size stuff from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia it's another question about abortion she says a family member they were having a baby they were expecting a baby but the mother insisted on the father to have an abortion who was the pregnant yeah the mother but she insisted in doing the abortion okay that for the husband to give her the permission that's why she was insisting she didn't know the exact date of the abortion but they want and she says their main reason why she was insisting on the abortion is because they had a little child so the husband wants to know that if there is any expiation or what they should do because they've already did the act of abortion if the the the the fetus was below four months old this means that it was before the Spirit was breathed onto it then there is no expiration except repenting to Allah as well but if it was after four months old then they'd have to pay the blood-money to the inheritance of the child to be or that was not and they would not inherit anything of it and the majority of scholars say that they have to fast two months continuous two months as a form of expansion"
