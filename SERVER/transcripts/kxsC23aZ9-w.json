  "transcript": "exactly defies water if you limit it if you know the things that nullifies will do he'll us anything that comes out of it I say one two three four five not among it it doesn't nullify likewise Islam I know that the things that nullify Islam are 1 2 3 10 if anything comes out and not among these things it does not modify Islam Allah knows best dan said the question what was the question if he dies yeah yeah i did answer do it so if a person dies on us in committing a sin is not notifying his islam his he man is decreased he's in danger of being prosecuted and punished for the things that he had done but he's still mostly maybe he'll go to hell for a thousand years ten thousand years but eventually he will go in sha allah to paradise good you shake define turban and when does the time we love i'm now in that wheel what does this have to do with a windows that we love a las a small Seaford reach the level of Khufu what does this have to do with another tech wheel is the actual interpretation of something it is mentioned in the Quran Hallie and aruna in la Villa llame atita whelan meaning that are they anticipating its actual interpretation how it becomes this can only be known on the day of judgment and also a la rochelle mentions in surat use of dedicated wheeler or I am in Kabul this is the interpretation of the event that took place and it was revealed afterwards which isn't that the night vision he saw of the moon and the Sun and the stars prostrating to him so it became this way and the third you have mosquitoes here like crazy mashallah listening to the lecture and the third meaning of that wheel is diverting and deviating the meaning from its actual meaning and this is is not permitted in the attributes of Allah so urgent so all kinds of tat wheel in the attributes and names of Allah is not permitted but some of it can be blasphemous when you start to in essence strip allah azzawajal from his beautiful attributes so if you say Allah is all-hearing but he doesn't hear and Allah is all-seeing but he does not see why because if we say that Allah agencies then he's like us so we say that he doesn't hear and see this is blasphemy anyone stripping a large l from one of his attribute is considered to be blasphemous and there are a lot of any other examples that one can go on but you'll find this you Anna described in the books of al-qaeda and I personally think that you should not do this you should not study sex and this is a lot of the Muslims are doing they're studying different sex what del mu ji said what the how r is shared with the jabria said what will jami and said what a shot i said ok what is your Creed none of the above ok yes but what is it one line I didn't sit down and try to contemplate upon it I know all the other sex but I don't know what is my sect this is wrong you have to follow what the prophet has a Sam his companions used to believe ok where is that will go to the Quran go to the sunnah and you have guidelines you confirm that these are the attributes of Allah so agile these are his beautiful names we do not make that wheel we do not make simulation to be we do not ask how does allah azzawajal get angry because this is tech eve and etc we accept it as it is Allah has two hands yes he has two runs how I don't know when I shouldn't ask ok how does it look like what does it do what all of these I cannot believe but Allah have a soul yes is it like our souls definitely not likewise if you have an answer an elephant there's an elephant has a there's an elephant have a leg yes does an ant have a leg yes is it similar definitely not it's only the name so you don't go to that level where you ask why how and when no knows best what about look looking at the women Islamic knowledge in TV or directly Iman is decreases as power smells awesome said first sight look of women and second sight look is of shaped on it's not a very clear question if it is some from a brother from sister it's not mentioned if a brother is asking this question definitely it decreases your email when you Masha Allah you have left all the bearded shakes and you went to this not bearded sister then you will get the realm from that sister Masha lon you're looking and you saying I want to increase my man i'm learning any Islam this is haram this is not permitted at all and listening to the sister again is also there is a lot of room of doubt for it and even if a sister is talking about FC or about hadith about hell about agenda she is still a sister her voice by itself is something that men would probably enjoy even he's talking about hell he still might enjoy the voice now if the other way around if a sister is asking is it permitted for us as sisters to look at for example dr. zakir naik on TV watch him and listen to him and look at him or are we supposed to lower our gaze if you find a negative effect if you're affected by his looks definitely you have to lower your case but women looking at men is not like men looking at women because men are more devilish and uglier so it is a different way altogether if the most handsome man enters into a group of women you will probably find one or two of the women affected by him by his looks and by his beauty and the net rest would ignore him and probably would say audhu billah but if a beautiful woman woman enters in a group of men yanny those who would not look or not be affected are very little unfortunately this is human nature and this is why man can marry for a woman can only marry one and she has no room in her heart except for one man but man has a lots of chambers unfortunately except those who are lawful and lawyer inshallah therefore yes this is what the scholars say if you are affected by looking at the man in the TV screen you have to lower your gaze if you're not affected he's like any man walking the streets is OK in Dawa I don't want this is watching wrestling matches and saying that we are not affected it's ok no this is haram you cannot go to that extreme I'm talking about things that you have to do you're not allowed to watch movies you're not allowed to watch you know soap operas or something and say I'm not affected this is something that does not fall under the category of necessity and Allah knows best the final question when we do some good deeds example Salah at correct time for a few number of days continuously we feel better in your heart but when we think that we are doing better than before even with so much of humility in the some time it happens we become worse than before why is this how to open this it is said that one good deed may cause you to enter hell and one bad deed may cause you to enter the highest levels of paradise how is that scholars sake one good deed you do you feel relaxed afterwards and you think that you have credit like us in Saudi Arabia for example in Jeddah I go to have ombres it's one hour drive I'm not saying this to break your heart but it's the blessing of a larger it's one hour drive we make ambra we come back and after that is mashallah all my sins are erased I don't have any sins masha'Allah bring me the remote control let me look and watch no this is there's a movie at nine o'clock i have to watch it and i can lie i can cheat i can abuse my wife i can skip tomorrow's work and bring a paper from the hospital that i was sick why because i have rubber much on my I have enough credit to last me for so long this ends up in me going to help and one bad deed when say once in then I commit may make me feel so miserable depressed and I say Allah will throw me in hell what should i do I have to go and repent I go and make home run I come back now how do I know that all I accepted this number I have to spray a nitrate I have to fast mondays and thursdays i have to do good deeds and whenever I remember it I say Allah will punish me I do good deeds more and more and more when I die I find that this sin elevated me to the highest level of paradise therefore when you do good deeds you should feel well but if it reaches the extent to the level of Rajab of pride of being proud of what you have done to the extent that it encourages you to do sin and makes you look down at people and maybe stay away from offering more and more good deeds then this is a disaster if not al hamd allah Iran the right track and the law knows less so with this inshallah we conclude today's program jessica muler halen catira for coming on our invitation and inshallah make du'a for us inshallah to do more programs like this to benefit uma and to please Allah subhanAllah subhanAllah humdinger should align and the stuff will go to"
