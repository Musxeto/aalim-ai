  "transcript": "so i'm asking this question for a brother so this brother is in a bit of a delay so he's gonna pick what subject he's gonna study in uni soon so he wants to study islam but the issue is that his family is not that well often his father has like a bit of mental illness like in the past few months he went like temporarily insane but now he's recovered alhamdulillah but he's not as active as before but he's still working to fight for his family because he's the only earnest so he was thinking that should he like sacrifice a bit of his like islamic study time and maybe do a four-year bachelor's degree along with studying islam online or should he just study islam because risk is in the hands of allah again this is an issue depending entirely on the individual it's not a one size that fits all very unfortunate i'm not discouraging people from seeking knowledge be careful but i'm telling you what's on the table many people many youngsters have it in them to come to study islam so they come to saudi to islamic university to jamaica or to go to cairo to the azhar or go to any other university islamic university here or there they do not have it in them so they study a couple of years in the arabic institute and they get bored they get homesick they drop their studies and go back home some of them may pursue two to three years maybe even graduate still they don't have it in them why because now they have a bachelor degree in islamic studies whether sharia or also etc when they go back home they find that their possibilities of getting a job a decent job that would open a house and enable them to get married the the chances are very limited why unfortunately worldwide they don't pay for muslim preachers so the best you can get is a job as tafi the quran instructor or an imam if you're qualified with a good voice and it doesn't pay that much so now they have feelings of regret because they did not have it in them and to those we say okay if you don't have it in you if you know yourself you don't have the patience and the tolerance and the ability to withstand hardship in life don't go this route instead do your four years bs or ba degree bachelor of science or bachelor not that bs bachelor of science or bachelor of arts and get a degree that enables you to work in a company or to earn afterwards alhamdulillah you can go and study islamic studies in a islamic university now you have a double major you can benefit from both afterwards as"
