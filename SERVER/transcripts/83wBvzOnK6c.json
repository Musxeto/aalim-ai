  "transcript": "so I have a non-muslim friend and he has been my best friend before I reverted to Islam so should I give him da and if if he doesn't accept what should I do first of all as a Muslim we must not take non-muslims as best friends meaning that we should not take them as confidants people that we hang out with and feel more comfortable to be with 24 hours 7 days a week and share with them everything this is totally prohibited in Islam however Islam does not prevent us or prohibit us from having acquaintances seeing them every now and then uh maybe sharing a meal talking to them um exchanging greetings from a distance but not not to be confidants and besties and vent to them and say to them everything that goes in my life no now calling him to Islam would be a win-win and this is your duty with everyone you know not necessarily your bestie so yes call him to Islam put some effort you never know if Allah would guide him to Islam through you and he becomes practicing everything he does will be accredited to you without any uh um work from your side and Allah Knows Best"
