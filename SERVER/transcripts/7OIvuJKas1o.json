  "transcript": "al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu wasallam or baba ki maruti matin lil I mean nabina muhammad in while I early he was happy well many daddy had year Western Division Nettie he Alejo medinia mob are assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh usually in strategic planning experts say that you have to first of all set your objectives because if you fail to set your objectives you will fail in planning each and every Muslim has an objective his sole objective is to avoid Hellfire and to be admitted to Jenna may Allah make me and you among those who enter Jannah now Jenna has been described in the Quran in two places in surah al anam in surah Yunus Allah described it as dar Salam the home of peace as they translate it but why was it called as such some say that it is darussalam because as salam is one of a las beautiful names and it doesn't mean peace when we attribute this to allah it means that allah azzawajal is exempted from any faults or defects or shortcomings allah is the most perfect so he is salam but this is a week opinion because it would then be permitted for us to call Jenna narula disease double by man or any of Allah's beautiful names and this is not the case other scholars say that it is called darussalam because the Angels constantly all the time come in and Geet the believers who were admitted to gender by saying as salaamu alaikum Salam o aleikum be masa Burton phenomena but da so they always hear this greeting of assalamu alaikum assalaam o Nanak when this is also not that authentic because in this dunya in this life we also exchanged salam the believers when they meet one another they say as-salam-o-alaikum and in reply they would hear what alehiwassallaam so it would not be something only specifically made for Jenna the third and most authentic opinion is that it is darussalam compared to this dunya because jenna Paradise has no shortcomings has no defect has no harm in it it is the final home and it is the perfection that allah azzawajal has created it is a las mercy as was described in the hadith when allah the almighty said you Jenna you are my mercy this jenna is the land of peace that each one of us long to be admitted to and to live this is a transitional period that we live in in Jenna it is the land of peace Allah described paradise to have eight gates and the Prophet told us allah√≠s alot was salaam dat the distance between the two doors of the gate is a distance that a traveler would need of forty years journey the Prophet said Alice awesome one day it would be filled one of the gates no the whole eight gates so many people will be admitted to paradise with the grace of allah azzawajal and all the gates of Jenna will not be closed they will be always open so you do not need a permission to exit and re-entry you don't need a visa by the way or what you have to be is a Muslim so you can come and go as you wish the angels come and go every time with the gifts from allah azzawajal you can go anywhere you wish and you don't need to lock the doors on yourself because no one will break in no one is going to come in and take something it's a place of security if you enter Jenna you will be shocked to see these great mansions and palaces they're so perfect made of bricks one would say what are these bricks a brick of gold and a brick of silver and in between the cement that binds them is musk you have mansions you have palaces you have chambers / chambers that extend as far as the eye can see there are tens there are furnitures there are drugs and carpets and pillows and cushions and sofas and things that we cannot imagine made of silk the Prophet Alice awesome was given once silk handkerchief and we know that men are not allowed to use or to wear things made of silk and the Companions touched it and they said masha'Allah it is so soft and the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam told them that by Allah the handkerchiefs that satnam arrived one of the great companions who died on the fifth year of hijra his handkerchiefs that he cleans himself with are much softer than this so how would you imagine your clothes to be how would you imagine your furniture to be these homes you have it's not a thing home you have homes to go to the arc angel jibreel peace be upon him came and gave the glad tiding to Khadijah the mother of the believers in he said o prophet of Allah greet her with the greeting of Islam and tell her that Allah is giving her the glad tidings of a house in paradise made of a pearl imagine living in a pearl how would that be and you do not need a GPS in Jenna it is installed by the manufacturer so you know exactly where and how to reach your home the Prophet says Aria salado salaam by Allah each and every one of you knows his home in Jenna more than he knows his home in this dunya illaha illallah every time Shaitaan comes to me and I have a big strapon he's knowledgeable he did a lot of years in college in either Masha Allah may Allah take him away every time I think of Jenna I'm lost ya allah if i enter gender how would i reach home what to do do I get a guiding book telling me this is a protocol you have to do if you don't worry about this if you set foot in Jannah allah azzawajal would guide you allah azzawajal would grant you everything that you've ever wished for Allah would reward you because of your patients in Jenna there are rivers and believe me coming from Arabia this is something we long for we long for the sealed water to drink let alone having rivers coming and flowing and gushing in springs and subhanAllah the main major for rivers a river of water so pure and beautiful a river of milk unchanged a river of wine that is so tasty and nice it's not bitter it's not bad and a river of honey that is pure and from these four rivers all the different rivers of Jenna come out of now imagine yourself sitting in Jenna in your palace you don't have any appointments you don't have any obligations you don't have to take the kids to school or to the hospital the wife is not nagging on the contrary the wife is singing wow she didn't sound like this man she has changed she sings beautiful songs with music share or with doof now with music this which was how I'm here it will become halal for you and you hear the water falls from these rivers so relaxing so refreshing not only that you hear the sounds of the angels beating you and above all of that allah azzawajal addresses you and speaks to you what more can there be as for the things they're adorned with the jewelry is it a Rolex watch what are you talking about the jewelry that believers where are so bright and beautiful and glamorous that the Sun if there were to be a son but there will not be a son in Jenna if there were to be a son the brightness of the jewelry would take the light away from it the beauty of the people in jenna is astonishing it blows your mind when you listen to what the prophet sallallahu alaihe wasalam has to say he tells us that every friday the men leave to somewhere they call a souk so they go to a place a big mall together there is no friday prayer there are no days and nights in Jannah but they long for the things that they used to enjoy in dunya Allah gives it to them perfect in Jenna so they go there and they meet and they chat they don't have anything to buy but they just go to meet one another and remember the old days and how Allah has rewarded them they remember their patients and all of a sudden allah azzawajal sends the northern wind that blows on them and on their families so it increases in their beauty and the men they become more handsome so they go back and retreat to their homes and the minute they see their wives they see subhanim bah you're more beautiful than we had left you and the women say by Allah you're more handsome than when you had left and this goes on every Friday till a thousand years a million years excellent years no this goes to eternity there is no stopping us now as they say it is forever and if you look at what they eat I cannot describe it because it goes beyond your imagination Allah tells us that the fruit has different types and sizes and variations and when you look at a tree that has fruit and you desire it it comes right to you I don't think Microsoft has reached that level of innovation to do this to you but in Jenna it is perfect it comes right to you and you eat one bite and it's different than the tenth bite and it's different than the 1,000 bite every single bite is different but it is more delicious than the previous one and it never ends there is meat in Jenna but what kind of animals would we get this meat from we know for example that the Prophet told us erase errata salam that we inshallah mitsis agenda we will eat from the liver of the whale we will eat from the Sheep because the sheep are among the animals of Jenna we will eat from strange type of birds that are so huge they have next as big as the camels but their meat is more tender than anything that you have ever thought of all of this would come to you without a price you don't have to ask after having the meal should i do the dishes nothing of that sort there are animals as the Prophet had told us Alice autosalon a man asked Oh prophet of Allah are there horses sea horses to the Arabs is like a sports car to us the Arabs I have a suburban or a jochen a big family car but I always want to have a small Ferrari or a small Porsche in paradise this companion is gasping okay can I have this sports car are there horses what what's the answer the Prophet says are they his salat was salaam you will have a horse made of red ruby now what kind of a horse is this and this horse it takes you wherever you want to go in general Wow look at the form of transportation and it's fun it's just to think of it it blows your mind away what about sleeping patterns shape I often stay awake until federer I professor and go to bed how would our sleeping pattern be in Jenna first of all there will not be day nor night in Jenna but there will shine light from underneath the throne of allah azzawajal to signify the beginning of the day and the end of the day but it's all light and there won't be any sleep in Jenna and one would say um come on Annie I wake up for every single day at least I can sleep like a week or two no there's no sleep because if you sleep you will not enjoy what's in Jenna and the Prophet told the sally salam that sleeping is the Brethren of death and there is no dying engine on the Hereafter there's no death neither in general and help but they are being punished while we shall I will have the time of our lives it's eternal happiness you will have the immortality that has no end to it okay now if we enter Jenna what will happen how would we look our prophet told us at a historical salam that we will be on the same form that Allah has created Adam and by the way Adam was 60 cubed hi so you do the math and creation has been decreasing since as the Prophet told us allah√≠s alot was salaam so on the day of judgment when Allah admits me in you to Jenna we will be really big and we will be 33 years of age and we would never get older not a single day in general youth is forever the clothes never worn out we never get sick we never get depressed we never get hungry we never get thirsty we never get tired the man of Jenna would be more jour de morte meaning that they have no kids so what I've been saving it will all go away shala in Jenna and then I'll be rewarded for that every single time they can hurry off your beard is long your bid is this can't you shape it can t put some gel on it can't you like put a hair dryer something do something l braided it ZZ Top anything okay I'm doing it for a large there was yell I'm following the Sunnah of the Prophet Isis and I'm in Jenna I'll be rewarded inshallah as long as you will and they will have no hair on the body so no need to do waxing and bodycare put the care menu care whatever care you have it's all alhamdulillah legit it's all from Allah the Almighty Isis a virgin and the funny thing is you will not find any old people in general hamdulillah they're all young a woman came to the prophet awesome she was like 70 80 years of agency said o prophet of Allah without any teeth ask Allah he admits me to gender this is no an old woman cannot enter Jenna and their women fled weeping and crying at the prophets come come come come alonzo gel would not admit you to general like this he would turn you back to being 33 years of age the age of youth eternal youth people in general different status in levels and the more higher you get closer to the throne of allah azzawajal the more light the more favors and blessings of Allah you get people are giving the blessing of praising Allah glorifying Allah as if they breathe they don't do it because they are obliged to do it they don't do it because if they don't they're be thrown into hell no they do it because it is like breathing to them in paradise there are no impurities the people they eat by crazier they feast and they party all day long they do everything they want to do a Jew came to the prophet adam said you claim that the people in general they eat and drink yes he said you okay those who drink and eat must go to the toilet said no there is no toilets in Jenna a stove for Allah what will we do ah allah azzawajal makes ever thing that you eat and drink to come out as sweat oh this means i have to shower shares I shower old egg once every couple of weeks and here's oh now you want me to shower even in Genoa don't worry your sweat would be the smell of musk so the more you sweat the more beautiful people can find this fragrance so make a long story short in order for you to reach the peace in general you have to first reach the peace in dunya so it's nice it's glamorous but you have to do that here even Tamia says in dunya there is a Jenna who does not enter it will not enter the gender of acura you have to acknowledge you have to submit you have to believe in allah azzawajal because the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that no one who is not muslim would enter jannah if you're not Muslim you're not intergender the people at the time of Noah what Muslims they believed him they'll enter agenda that people at the time of Abraham the people at the time of Moses of Jesus at his time there were Muslims they submitted their will to allah azzawajal after the message of the prophet alayhi salatu salam if you listen and hear carefully about islam and you know muhammad salallahu are you or send him our prophet and you don't believe you'll be deprived from entering Jenna this life is beautiful it's like a beautiful rose you smell it you touch it but its own withers away and dies what is with allah azzawajal never dies so are you selling it for cheap are you wasting your time in Jenna there is no malice there is no hatred or grudges it's all love and peace and if you are unable to attain this in this life you will not attain it on the day of Jenna the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam said all of my OMA will enter Jenna may Allah make me in you among them all of my ummah will enter gender except those who refuse and the companion said o prophet of Allah who would refuse he said who obeys me enter Jannah and whoever disobeys me has refused this means that how would someone who terrorizes people who blows up innocent people children women elderly in this life claim to want to attain the peace engine this is unacceptable no peace in dunya there's no peace in here after how is it that those who deal in Ussery in river and interest banks financial institutions etc they want peace what piece are you looking for Allah has waged war against those who deal in Reba Allah says in the Quran and if you do not do it this is refraining from river then take a notice of war from Allah and His Messenger those who are fighting a lot though do you think that they'll have peace in Jenna how are you with your parents those who are disrespectful and disobedient to their parents the Prophet said will not be admitted to Jenna how are you with your next of kin those who Sivir their next of kin will not be admitted to gender when was the last time you spoke to your uncle to your brother to your cousin to your aunt you have a problem how are you with your neighbors how are you with your wife your children the Prophet told us that he who is not in safety from his neighbor's harming him and abusing him he will not be admitted to Jenna the Prophet told us Alison a man with an ant weight of arrogance would not be admitted to Jenna how are we are you arrogant what are you you're below me I'm a Saudi you're not then i will enter hell from the biggest gates because of the arrogance I have we have to be humble to our brothers those who deal with sorcery black magic soothsayers priests and fortune tellers and they believe them they will not be admitted to Jenna and a lot of the Muslims unfortunately now enjoy entertainment of sorcerers and magicians they attend concerts they look and watch programmes weekly not knowing that this may deprive them from attaining the piece on the day of judgment in this life allahabad gel has forbidden us from things and he told us that if you do them you will be deprived from them in jena men cannot wear silk nor gold and if you do you'll be deprived from enjoying it in paradise so be careful men and women are not allowed to eat in silver and gold utensils you go to five-star hotels everything is in gold you see Wow fine I'll put this in my pocket no okay room service they don't give you gold and silver utensils they give you stainless steel so even that you cannot eat with spoons forks or knives made of gold or silver because you'll be deprived from doing that or having that on the day of judgment also intoxicants if you drink wine in this life you will not drink it in the paradise the profit that is awesome cursed 10 those who grow it those who make juice out of it those who sell it those who buy you those who carry eight those who serve those who drink it anything connected to in toxicants not necessarily wine it can be scorch it can be Jen can be bourbon it can be vodka it can be tequila the sky's the limit also drugs are compared to intoxicants in the part of it so you're talking about hash you're talking about marijuana myth in phenomena cracks heroin cocaine opium and the list goes on and on at the very conclusion before they drag me from my folk I cannot do Jenna justice and that is why the Prophet said are in salotto salam Allah the Almighty says I have prepared for my righteous slaves that which no eye has seen no ear has heard and it has never crossed the mind of man so whatever do you think of Jenna this is just a glimpse and what awaits you and what awaits me with the grace of allah azzawajal when we die is far far greater than what we think with this I conclude my talk sallallahu wasallam mubarak Arab de what a Saudi he may be in a Mohammad de zaak allah khair will have the first question from mike number one here from the brothers your name your profession and please make it short brief and on the topic Salaam alaikum I'm dr. hardy I'm a pediatrician in India I've come just to attend this conference rabinus a couple min in the country Samuel early I mean there is a Hadees that Allah Subhan o Allah will not talk with three types of persons the third type is those who cover their ankle bones some say it means those who have cockapoo and it is not the literary meaning of the Hadees there are few people who wear short trousers but it cover the ankle bone with socks there are others who were normal trousers and folded during salat Spain may have your opinion on this displeased ok i need another lecture can I have another half an hour I don't think so so in a nutshell ok I'm gonna give you the juice the fruit of all of this it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that Allah has placed two punishments for those who extend their garments below their ankles and I'm talking about males and not females of course I don't want sisters to come wearing throat address is saying above the ankle no do you have to cover the whole thing so the first punishment is the ankle bone and the heel this area is punishable in fire if you extend your garment depending on the extension that's it so your whole body is not in fire but this particular area will be punished in fire of course the Prophet is awesome told us that that this in hell is a man who has a stone of fire put into his sandals now he's not literally being punished but this is the only thing but because it's extremely hot his brain boils so this is a little bit similar to that the second punishment is something which is a sin that pride is accompanied with the Prophet said that is a lot worser am free alonzo gel would not talk to them would not look at them would not purify them and would punish them severely the first one and mooseville the one who drags his garment below the ankles and another hadith the prophet has I'm told us about that specific sin which is pride in addition to dragging the garment below the ankle so these are two different punishments and to someone who extends and prolongs His garment below the ankle to claim that I am NOT doing it out of arrogance he has to prove that because Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him stood once when he heard this hadith he was terrified and he said o prophet of allah i'm a skinny man i tried my level best to have this way strapper as tight as possible but whenever I walk it falls below the ankle so I immediately put it up so am I among those whom will be punished he said no you are not doing it out of pride so if you have someone like the Prophet erase a lot sir them to give you the certificate of pride free garment go ahead otherwise you should be like everyone else as for prayer okay I'm still full from nine to five I have to go to work I'm working in the corporate management and wearing a suit they will laugh at me when it comes to prayer I will not do anything I will pray with my trousers below my ankles know you can fold that then it would mean that you have like 15 minutes free time from punishment but then you will be the rest of the day in punishment on Allah knows best thank you thank you we'll take the next question from the sisters assalamualaikum shaikh sample it's my privilege to be here and meet you and i'm a big fan of your program thank you for the opportunity i am a born Hindu I'm revert to Islam two years back but I am facing issues with my parents and my family things that I have made the biggest mistake by reverting to islam and i believe the one and only God is Almighty Allah we came from him and will return to him and I want to convey this message to my parents and I'm struggling to speak to them because they are my parents and on this topic I want my beloved parents to enter Jannah and I said at a situation to my mom like in a don't worship the creations instead worship the Creator so I need your advice and to have the courage to go and speak to my parents too intense Jana thank you you're quite welcome handle eyes o allah may allah the almighty make you steadfast on islam and it's only few moments that is keeping you away from entering gender once you die on islam once you die while maintaining and observing your prayer five prayers a day nothing would hold you back from Geneva Allah now for your fear from advising and calling your parents this is from Japan any fear that you feel humans this is from Shaitan in the metallica misshapen you home folia this is Shaitaan who is making you intimidated from his servants from his allies so this is definitely from Shaitaan now how to motivate yourself and to get this encouragement to talk to them I'll give you an example you're a believer hamdillah you believe in Hell in heaven and you want them to be with you in heaven if you see your father or your mother holding a glass with venom and poison in it and you know the minute they take a sip they will go to their graves they will die instantly would you advise them or would you hit the glass and throw it away fearing that they may harm themselves definitely in dunya you would do whatever you can to save them now life and death is something that everyone is going to pass through so if I die today or if I die after 100 years the end result is that but hell and heaven are for eternity so would you want them to suffer in hell definitely not so you have to encourage yourself you have to as stated in the beginning of the talk make a strategic plan set your objectives because when you have a plan you don't give everything in 10 minutes maybe you have to say something today a week later something else a little bit more a month later but have a long-term plan have a short long-term plan have your objectives try to figure and think how they think so that you can counter-attack that but never ever give up hope every day that passes reduces your chances in saving them from Hellfire so may allah azzawajal guide them and all of your family to islam and make you steadfast on this team inshallah next question from the brothers Mike SR Mary come chef awesome it's a ramsey Webber I'm sales engineer you may remember me from Saudi life lecture knucklehead for their great speech if my son was so excited he wants to die now and go into Jenna but real quick I mean many times we see on the TV many kids from non-muslim countries dying as we saw last week in the news with the ferry disaster almost 200 kids dying as a coping mechanism that I use when I see such things I always think that these kids have been picked to go to heaven because they die before reaching puberty can you just elaborate on that may be really quick about this thought process which I go through and I imagine many other Muslims might use this as a coping mechanism also that these kids in non-muslim countries have pass away before puberty are in heaven Zac Allah had Ramsey it's an issue of dispute and this is the easiest way of getting out of trouble whenever someone asks me what's the rolling unless it's an issue of dispute hamdillah holla so I'm Saved by the Bell no actually it is an issue of dispute and in a nutshell we as Muslims cannot say that this individual is in Jenna or this individual is in hell not even XYZ of a kafir country or a leader I cannot say i do not have carte blanche to put people in general or in hell otherwise I would have been much richer than I am I wouldn't be here speaking to you but the fact is we can only say that Abu Bakr is in general medicine generous man is in general a tease engine abilities engine etc those whom the Prophet told us Alison we're hopeful and wishful that people who died after being righteous and bias that will be in gender but we cannot affirm that say yes definitely he's in general so from this general rule scholars different when it came to the children whether of the believers or the disbelievers the day believers the majority say that they're in general why because they follow their parents and by default they're Muslims they're admitted to Jinnah but there is a hadith of our HTML a be pleased with her and another evidences that restrict us again saying this we are hopeful and wishful also for the disbelieving children who did not reach age of puberty allah azzawajal did not hold them accountable yet so how can a lot punish them we do not say that Allah will punish them and yet we do not say that Allah would admit these specific individuals XYZ into Jenna however we can simply say all children are in general believers or disbelievers who did not reach the age of puberty they are in general ok what about Tom the son of John the son of Mark Luke etc I don't know about tom he died when he was four or five years of age but generally speaking all children are in general so you see the difference I don't specifically say Abdullah the son of my friend Farid died who was 6 years of age he's in general no I do not say this because it's not my right I say all children who died under the age of puberty in sha Allah our engine hoosick will take the next question and perhaps the final question for this session from the sisters um assalamualaikum what happens um to people between death and your mokey armor so I don't know ok if I understand the question I think that you're asking about between this life which is death after you die and their resurrection yeah what happens in between the phases are 31 is this dunya we live in each individual has this dunya his lifespan he enjoys and he suffers he enjoys things to be enjoyed food drinking etc and he suffers from calamities illnesses and the suffering and enjoyment is done on the body and partially on the soul once you die you move to the second phase which is called al barsha it's a transitional period between the two worlds and it's also temporary as this life in this phase is the enjoyment or the suffering mella keep suffering away from us is done totally on the soul but with a small connection to the body or what remains of it and those who are destined to Jenna those who are believers Allah would open a window for them overlooking Jenna and they would get from the fragrance it's you know when you're feeling hot when the weather is bad and you come to a building and the doors are opened and you get some of the breeze Wow I could pay money for that because the air conditioning is blowing on you it's the same thing in your grave Allah would open a window to paradise you see how beautiful it is you get some fragrances we know that it would be an easy ride for the believers in their graves with the grace of Allah as a virgin the third phase is when the trumpet is blown and then everyone is resurrected now it is a day of judgment either hell or heaven the enjoyment is one hundred percent full to the body and to the spirit and the calamity is as well one hundred percent full to the body and to the spirit may Allah make us among those who go to paradise and who would attain the peace in this life and in the Hereafter"
