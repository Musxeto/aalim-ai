  "title": "Is learning Aqeedah more important than Fiqh? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sheikh is teaching and learning more important than this is not a clear-cut question because is so vast and big is so vast and big and in both Sciences there are Essentials that are extremely important for your Islam and there are elements that are communal obligation it's not mandatory for you to learn so the parts that are part of your Iman and Islam that is a must in Akida you have to learn this you have to do to learn what are the six pillars of Iman to believe in Allah the day of judgment the Angels The Messengers the books or scriptures and in the Divine decree whether good or bad this is essential for the essence of your Iman to be a Muslim this is the minimal requirement what's beyond that is a communal obligation if you don't know it you're okay you're still a Muslim if I go to the jungles of Africa or to uh the mountains of Siberia or to uh uh the Amazons and I see Muslims they may not know the details of aqide that we know this doesn't impact their Islam how many gods do you have one is there life after death yes is there Heaven and Hell of course is there torment in the grave 100 is there do you believe in the straight path over Hell Fire yes they know all of this so they're Muslims now when we come to they have to know the essentials the five pillars of Islam but they may not need to know Hajj how is it performed the technicalities what is the pillar and what is mandatory and what is Sunnah but when it comes to prayer you have to know what are the five prayers how to perform mudu how to uh pray what nullifies and breaks their wudu what to do when you make a mistake memorizing one Surah of a fatah as a must so what to say in sujood these are Essentials so you can't say which is more and more important because these are Essentials for your Islam so I hope this makes sense in Alano's best"
