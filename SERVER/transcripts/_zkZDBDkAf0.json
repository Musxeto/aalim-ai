  "transcript": "if we look at the Quran we will find that Allah the almighty instructed us to seek Refuge from the outcast Satan and we only seek refuge in Allah the almighty as mentioned in the Quran and whenever you recite the Quran seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Satan or the outcast devil and Allah revealed two suras and he instructed us in them to seek refuge in him subhanahu wa ta'ala from the evil of everything that he had created and from the evil of the night and from the evil of the Sorcerers and those who envy and give the evil eye and also from the evil of the outcast devil and these are the last two chapters of the Quran and we all know that it is part of the to recite the last three chapters of the Quran in the day and night 12 times we recite it once after every prayer and we recite it three times after F and M prayers and we recite it also three times before we go to bed we read them or recite them in our po palms and then blue and blow into our palms and then wipe whatever we can of bed this we do every single day and night and also it is permissible to wipe over your body when you are making R to yourself so this is done only that is reciting these three raptures and blowing in your hands and wiping your body this is only done twice when you are going to bed and also when you are feeling sick or ill and you are making uh Rya to yourself unlike what a lot of the ignorant Muslims do when they wipe their bodies after every single prayer going against the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and what is the meaning of seeking refuge in Allah the almighty from the outcast well actually it is seeking his help and assistance from whatever you are afraid of and what from whatever has evil in it and our Prophet used to seek refuge in Allah a lot and he used to do that from a lot of things because it is part of worshiping Allah because if you seek Refuge from other than Allah in things that only Allah is capable of doing then this is Major shik and this is the shik or associating others with Allah that Allah does not forgive it is like when someone for example moves into a new house or builds a new house in Arabia actually in the Arab world they have this custom that people do without thinking you would find PE people when moving to a new house sheep at the doorsteps and putting the blood on the doorsteps or on the pillars of the house before it is completely built and they do this as a form of getting closer to the Jin so that they would protect them and not harm them while they're living in their houses and of course this is shik and it is associating others with Allah the almighty if you look at the Hadith you will find that the prophet Alat wasam used to seek Allah's Refuge from a lot of things and first thing that comes into mind after seeking Refuge Allah from the Shan is when the prophet Alam used to seek refuge in Allah from four things before he concludes uh his prayer so he used to say these four things that the prophet used to seek Allah's Refuge from that he seeks refuge in Allah from fire and from the torment in the grave and also from the tribulation from the fitna of life and death and the FNA of life is known which people are tempted by whether by being tempted by the opposite sex or by wealth or by power or by anything that does not please Allah in this life and in uh uh uh uh seeking refuge in Allah from the tribulation of death that is as the scholars say when the people are dying the Shan comes to them and he tries his last tricks to make them die on other belief than Islam so he either appears to them in the uh a picture of their parents telling him that is the people who's and the person who's dying telling him that we are your parents we know what's best we died before you and Christianity is your uh choice or Judaism or Buddhism or anything so that the person who's dying who's hanging by a thread thinks that this is the right thing and then he changes his religion and dies as a c may Allah have mercy on us all and also finally Prophet used to seek refuge in Allah from Al the false Christ or the Antichrist as they call him these are the four things that the prophet used to seek Allah's refuge in and there are so many things that the prophet used to seek Allah's Refuge uh uh from and I believe that inshallah this is uh sufficient for uh the introduction and maybe inshallah next time we meet meet we uh uh would elaborate a little bit on other things that the prophet used part of the S to learn them and to seek refuge in Allah as our Prophet wasam used to do that and Allah the almighty Knows Best"
