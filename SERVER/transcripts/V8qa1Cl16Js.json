  "title": "Is it Prohibited to talk in the Washroom? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible for a Muslim to talk in a toilet or bathroom if not why and what should a Muslim do if somebody calls him when he is in the toilet bathroom or bathroom is it permissible for him to answer it's an issue of dispute the vast majority of Scholars and schools of thought say that this is not recommended meaning it's Mak and some even go a bit further and say no it is prohibited and the most authentic opinion is that talking in a bathroom or in the toilet by itself is permissible there's nothing wrong in that and this becomes even more if there is a need for it for example if someone is in the toilet and there's some harm is going to take place if I do not speak so I give a warning to someone that the child is going to fall from the crib uh the the fire is going to spread from the kitchen do this there is a necessity for it however this is different if a person is actually in the toilet to answer the call of nature so if I'm in the toilet just brushing my teeth or washing my hands or having a shower there's nothing wrong in talking or answering people but if if I am actually answering the call of nature whether number one or number two and there isn't any reason for talking even if someone calls me or asks me about something that is not of uh uh of urgency or necessity in this case I must not answer them back because this is the doing of the Prophet Alam when one of the companions once gave him Salam and the prophet did not reply app to his Salam until he finished what he was doing also there's a Hadith that is graded as Hassan that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam stated that Allah abhor to men answering the call of Nature and talking to one another this is inappropriate and uh um it is prohibited as well"
