  "transcript": "sh uh what are the rights of a mother's sister we call it kala and a stepmother in Islam particularly when uh the mother is deceased and the kala is also a mother-in-law uh do they hold the same status and rights as mother as the mother if not what are the limitations of their rights no one holds the rights of your biological mother in Islam no matter how high or how influential they are in your lives yes your maternal aunt is as close as your mother but she doesn't have these rights ibar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father when a man came to him confessing of a huge major sin that he had committed he asked him if his mother was alive and the man said no she's deceased so IB Omar may Allah be pleased with him ask him do you have a maternal aunt or a Kala and the man said yes then IB Omar said be dutiful to her because she's the next one closer to your kala and in the Hadith the aunt is a mother in the same sense of respect but she doesn't have the rights of a mother of total obedience being dutiful and respectful Etc yes she has the rights of being respected as an elder as a blood relative as part of your kinship and if she's your mother-in-law she has a little bit over an edge because being being good and nice to her would make your husband happy and nice to you but she does not have the rights of your biological mother at all and this is a thin line that sisters must must walk on when they're married yes she's married to her maternal cousin and her auntie whom she used to love and respect once she becomes a mother-in-law unfortunately if they don't have knowledge if they don't fear Allah if they're old and grumpy and having this mentality of a mother-in-law is the master and the daughter-in-law is the servant and the slave as in the subcontinent is prevalent unfortunately you have to walk a very thin line because your husband has only one mother even if she's unfair and just even if she's unfair and unjust sometimes your husband is as ignorant imbecile as his mother mother is so you have it no other way but to try and live in a diplomatic and polite fashion otherwise divorce is the only other way out of this may Allah make things easy"
