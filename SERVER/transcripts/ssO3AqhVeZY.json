  "transcript": "your feet are erect well I can't do that here because it's my hand and you have toes generally speaking are facing the Qibla as well but you know that the foot itself you cannot place all your toes on the ground because usually you have the big thumb and then the toes go down in sequence so when you have your foot erect on the ground usually it's only the the big toe and the one next to it that touches the ground and the other three are flying most likely depending on the way your foot was designed or created"
