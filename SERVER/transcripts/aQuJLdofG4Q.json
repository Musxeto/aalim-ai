  "transcript": "a brother says my question is if I touch for example pig skin and then instead of washing my hand seven times I just do whistle instead is it okay or I must wash my hands seven times first of all the scholars of different schools of thought have different opinions and the usual thing to do is to go back to Quran and Sunnah in the Sunnah there is no mentioning of washing seven times except in one hadith so the Prophet said that it's a lot Salaam when a dog a canine when a dog licks into your utensils into your plate into your bowel and you see that you have to wash it seven times and once with soil so we wash it once with soil and then seven more times with water and this is the most strongest form of impurity in Islam because we have to wash it this much now the hadith clearly indicates if the dog licks in your utensils some scholars schools of thought said cascaded this and said okay if a dog licks your hand you have to wash your hands seven times one with soil if he licks your trousers you do the same but the hadith is clear why cascade it worse we don't have to do this we have to stop where the Prophet I said I'm stopped therefore if a dog licks my trousers I'm gonna wash the area or the spot that he licked once that's it what about pigs there's nothing mentioned about pigs neither licking nor touching their skin so again it the skin of a pig is not impure by itself like the hair and skin of a dog if I Pat a dog on the back I don't have to wash my hand it's only the moisture in his saliva and the nose that is neji's and the rest of the body is okay likewise with the pig and there are different opinions upon scholars but you need evidence to prove whatever you say and those who claim that it is neji's and you have to wash yourself or wash your hands once or seven times lack this evidence and Allah knows best"
