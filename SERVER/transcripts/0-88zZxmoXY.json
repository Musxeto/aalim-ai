  "title": "Revert not circumcised, his salah valid? Must he get circumcised 1st or pay off debt assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she I um read on your website about circumcision and I wanted to ask you um you mentioned on the IB Abbas is of the view that there's no Hajj or prayer for one that's not circumcised so if someone was lazy and never got circumcised in their reever um and say like now they got debts what takes priority and will they not will their prayer not be valid going forward so you this is not the authentic opinion the authentic opinion is a person who circumcised or a person let me rephrase that a person who's not circumcised he's a Muslim now whether there is urine left over or not this may hamper his prayer but if he cleanses himself correctly his prayer his Haj all of these are valid without any problem but he should prioritize it before paying off his debts"
