  "transcript": "happy from India says that there is a message it that he praising with a grave in the Qibla in front of the wall of the Masjid of the mob but there is a wall that is separating the grave from the Masjid if the grave itself is outside the fence of the Masjid then your prayer is is okay there there's nothing wrong in your prayer even if there are windows overlooking the grave because there is a separator and the grave itself is not considered to be in the message it's in a in the open or another building that is not related to the message but if it is considered to be in the same Masjid surrounded by the same fence or the same walls in this case we have to look about or at the situation having it in front of the Qibla where people can see it and it is within the Masjid this makes your prayer invalid and you should avoid this well"
