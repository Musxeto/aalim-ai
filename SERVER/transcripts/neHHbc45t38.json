  "transcript": "tawfiq says in our masjid after fajr and after isha the imam or a student of knowledge usually recite a number of hadith most places recite three or four hadiths from riyadh from the another book here or there just as a form of knowledge as a form of spreading the sunnah among the worshippers some of them go the extra line a mile which is highly recommended is to explain so he says verily these are judged by intentions and he explains what is the difference of the types of knee and regarding who you're worshiping or not or near regarding the type of action you're doing or not and he explains it to people they learn from it some people don't have the knowledge except to read a hadith that may benefit few of us who understand what is being read and related to their lives or maybe they would it would trigger something for them to go and ask scholars about the meaning of this hadith and benefit from it so he says is this a bidder because the prophet did not do it allah the answer is no this is not bid at all it is highly recommended because spreading the deen teaching the people is part of the sunnah the general sunnah you can't come and say okay you're answering questions on live tv this is a bidder the prophet never appeared on tv the prophet never had a weekly program like this at a fixed time after maghrib prayer you have to change it make it after fajr sometimes no there's nothing wrong in that none whatsoever"
