  "title": "If Husband did not stop Wife from making Sin will he be accountable",
  "transcript": "if a husband lets his wife wear tight clothes does he take the same sin as the wife that is a major sin or a higher level of sin and if a man allows his wife to interact with men with good intention as in 99% common uh does he take the same sin minor sin or higher level of sin or no sin at all definitely the man is held accountable at the day of judgment for his wife's mistakes and errors if he does not stop her Allah says oh you who believe prevent yourself save yourself secure yourself and those uh uh you're responsible for your families from Hellfire so it is definitely a sin upon the man but it is not equivalent to the sin of the woman because the woman is the actual doer of that sin his part is sinful because he did not stop her from uh doing that but she is the one who chose and she's the one who did so her sin is more"
