  "title": "She wants to marry a revert who didn't tell his family he reverted nor wants his family to meet hers",
  "transcript": "canada says a muslim sister wants to marry a rivert the only problem is that this rivert did not tell his parents about his conversion and he doesn't want them to meet the girl's family so what is your advice my advice is run this guy is at all not suitable for you first of all anyone who is not transparent who's not coming forward with his relationships this casts a lot of shade and doubts about his personality refusing to tell his parents what would he do in a year time maybe claim that he's not a muslim anymore and this sister is not a guinea pig to test on her whether it's going to work or not whether she's going to be successful in converting him truly to islam and making him practicing or not so definitely he's bad news and she should ditch him and not consider him at all you"
