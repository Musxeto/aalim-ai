  "transcript": "er fan says i've heard you saying that ya seen these are the names of surahs and it's not recommended to call our children with it i said these are not the names of the prophet so thinking that yaseen is a blessed name or paaha is a blessed name because it's the name of the prophet this is not authentic this is not true at all but if someone wants to call his child nur and we have suratu nur there's no problem in that if someone wants to call his child maryam and we have maryam we have al-imran there's no problem in that and likewise furqan has no problem inshallah in it"
