  "transcript": "um so say someone's a follower in theah and the the IM starts to say or the as soon as he starts to say should you um should you stop what you're saying or you or should you finish it or can you like add another like continue until he finishes and then stop meaning this is not something that is prescribed in the Sunnah the only thing that is prescribed is when the Imam starts reciting the fa or the Surah you should refrain and listen specifically for the faat so if the Imam says Allah and he's preoccupied with the or and I come like 10 15 seconds late by the time he finishes I say allahar and I want to say my Dua he starts reciting the fat I should stop I should not say my Dua and I must listen to his F he finishes I'd like to recite the fa then he starts his Sur I didn't finish my fa I have the option to continue and I have the option to interrupt my fat and skip it all together and listen to his recitation anything else no there's no problem he's in the position I'm saying he goes while he's saying I could say two or three times no problem I can say that likewise in likewise elsewhere as for the Tas if I'm in the salutation of the prophet and he says I can continue there's no problem in continuing for 10 15 20 seconds Etc after his Salam so I hope this answers your question"
