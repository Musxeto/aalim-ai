  "title": "Does IV or Injections break your fast? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so malika has a number of questions one of them for the person who's fasting can he take an IV serum or injection or first of all the injections that go into your body are one of two either they are not nurturing your body so a short of voltaren to reduce my fever no problem vaccinations no problem vitamin B's complex no problems insulin no problem the second type are things that give you power can substitute for food such as IVs with glucose or the serums they the the syrups they put I don't know what they call it medically and these things nullify your fasting immediately so if you are taking a medicine within the ivy syrup that they have this big bottle with glucose etc whatever they have in it this breaks your fasting other than that there is no problem in it insha'Allah"
