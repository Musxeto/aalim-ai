  "transcript": "I have a case with my wife where I was in on her two nights ago I I do not understand what you're saying Jam uh sorry my wife two nights ago I was doing Ria on her okay and uh she's been suffering from some abdominal pain for two months when I'm doing Rukia on her this pain moved from the stomach to the hands and she was feeling uncomfortable the question what would that be and what would be the best solution for this first of all I don't know I have no idea what your wife is suffering from is it gin possession is it black magic or is it her subconscious and her own mind playing games on her she's convincing her herself that She's suffering when she has nothing and this is like 90% of the cases with people that they're just illusional they think and then they imagine that there's something wrong and there's nothing wrong with them so my advice would be to recite the Rya as mentioned in my website and also on my YouTube channel on bottles of water and let her drink from these bottles of water like five to seven bottles a day throughout the whole day she drinks no water except from it and inshallah in five days to seven days you will find some improvement if there is Improvement then keep on doing this for another six months but if there is no improvement then definitely this is her subconscious playing games on her"
