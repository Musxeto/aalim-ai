  "transcript": "is using the same I hope she is asking an honest question unlike Bilal Mohammad Samir or whatever ignorant person is calling she says what's the difference between Salafi Nia and the extremists first of all there is no relationship Salafi Nia is the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam salafiyyah is the way of the Companions salafiyyah is the way of the four schools of thought it follows the teachings it understands the Quran and the Sunna with the same methodology that they used to apply in terms of art either in terms of jurisprudence in terms of every single thing now when you come and compare extremists to the salafiyyah you would find that there is no resemblance unless you yourself would be an innovator or a super Sufi or are avila shiri in this case anyone who doesn't follow or comply with your convictions would be considered to be extremists or Wahhabi or Salafi or whatever radicalization you would like to give them names and labels other than that when I say that I'm a Salafi you can compare whatever I say or do with the Quran and Sunnah and if it goes against it then blame me don't blame the Quran and Sunnah now the claim that is being propagated in CNN Fox BBC and all these kafir media channels that Saudi Arabia propagates and endorses fundament fundamentalist ideas and ideology and markets it abroad this is totally false and a blatant lie we call for Islam we call for or we call for the Sunnah and if you consider this to be radicalization or you consider to be a part of terrorism then you have an issue you have a problem you have an illness because we know that this is the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu some so should we listen to them how would you identify a person looking at me and saying oh sure you have a very thick and long beard this is extreme and you should trim it you should make it look better this is extreme and you're a fundamentalist how would you label such a person definitely you would say that this person is an ignorant imbecile he doesn't know Islam because when we go back to the sooner we find that the Prophet SM had a thick big beard and he ordered us to keep it so how do we evaluate how do we measure whether this act is an act of extremism and radicalism or it is part of the Sunnah you cannot just simply sit on your couch and say hmm I don't like this this is extreme or yeah this is moderate this is the way of doing it what are you referring to look the women and and men are all in harmony the dancing they're doing their salsa they're doing their dances in a nightclub is this yeah this is moderate Islam when a woman stands next to me in prayer and I'm praying behind a woman who's leading the prayer this is moderate Islam this is Islam we're talking about okay this is Co for you this is this belief so sister aleena I hope your question was innocent and truthful because if it is at hand Allah I think I have answered you and if it's not then the hounds of hell would never be able to understand the Quran or the sooner the Prophet described them to a solution and is so clear and obvious to anyone who can see"
