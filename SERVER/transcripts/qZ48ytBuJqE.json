  "transcript": "question here from brother Salem. Um so regarding the Friday prayer of course this is for his his wife now he says um what's uh the required sunnah rakat what's the suna prayers for the Friday now he says um I pray four sunnah for example then four f then two rakas suna that's what his wife prays and I don't know where this comes from so you may have explained this well I I believe if I understand his question he's asking about prayer for his wife on a Friday yes he's not asking for himself which he thinks that because it's a Friday so is it like any normal prayer for his wife she's praying at home and the answer is yes as long as she's not praying with the congregation in the masid then she prays for before the four for itself and then the sunnah afterwards like any other prayer if she prayed the uh if she went to pray the Friday prayer would that be null the or no if she goes to the masjid it's a different story what I understood from the question that she is praying home and he's asking now because it's Friday is it the same thing for women or is it different when they pray home the answer is it's the same but if his wife goes with him to the masid then it becomes like men in the sense that there isn't any sunnah before Friday she prays with the congregation following the imam of course not on her own because if she prays on her own it's not a Friday and after she concludes uh uh the prayer she may pray four ra in the masid two by two or if she goes home she prays only two this is the sunnah"
