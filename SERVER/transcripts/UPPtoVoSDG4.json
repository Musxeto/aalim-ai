  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim (24) Dua in the last tashahud, before making salam (4) - Assim al hekeem",
  "transcript": "foreign the dua and as you recall we've said so many but this is what the prophet used to say i saw something he used to alternate between these duas at the end of the salat before his salaam and this shows you and all of these hadiths are authentic either bukhari muslim or the other authentic books that the prophet used to make this dua before the salaam and this is the place of dua so what do i he used to say these three duas i'm gonna read to you are similar in a way in their meanings though they have different wordings and different situations so first of all allah i ask you o allah as you are the one so now this is describing allah azza and glorifying him subhanahu wa by mentioning his attributes you are the one the only of samad the one who begets not nor was he begotten and there is none like unto him all of this i'm attributing to allah azza i'm asking allah what do you want that you forgive me my sins for verily you are the oft forgiving most merciful that's it now imagine that the prophet allah once heard a man say this dua in his prayer before he concluded his prayer and the prophet listened to it and when the man finished the prophet said he has been forgiven he has been forgiven he has been forgiven yani allah revealed to him that i have forgiven this servant of mind for his dua what does that tell you learn it say it it includes to heat when you ask allah azza by his beautiful names which a lot of people don't know is one of allah's names that cannot be shared wahid usually comes in a sequence of so they there are there is a sequence but ahad no you can't say it's ahad one and only and then a summit one of allah's beautiful names which relate to him being the master where all of his servants and and slaves go to him with their affairs of summit the one that people ask and so forth so you acknowledge that he does not beget and is not begotten allah is the first without a beginning in the last without an end he has no associates he has no wife he has no offspring he has no parents subhanahu wata'ala he is and there is no one similar to him subhana ta'ala there's none like unto him after all of this i beg allah azza for forgiveness and you shall get your forgiveness if you say this dua the following dua is on the same lines the prophet uh said ali allah i ask you as unto you is all praise none has the right to be worshipped except you alone without any partner you are the benefactor o originator of the heavens and the earth o possessor of majesty and honor o everlasting living o self subsisting and supporter of all verily i ask you for paradise and i take refuge with you from the fire the as i bear witness that you are allah none has the right to be worshipped except you the one a summit who begets nor who begets not nor was he begotten and there is none like unto him all of these hadiths these two hadiths the prophet saw when he heard people saying them in their prayers he told his companions they have asked allah by his greatest name which when asked he would give so what do we understand from this we understand that allah has a greatest name and that the names of allah azzawajal vary in their importance and from this hadith we understand if there is greatest name so it's greater than others what is the greatest name scholars different some say it is allah al al-qayyum these three names and the majority of scholars say that it is allah this is the name the greatest name of allah azza of them all why because it is the name when you want to ask about all the other names of allah you say this is the name of allah so one says what is abraham you say it's the name of allah what is it's the name of allah so it is a point of reference to all other names but when someone says what is allah you wouldn't say it is ar-rahman. or it is al-aziz you cannot define allah by other names but the name allah is the greatest name of allah azza these were some of the duas that we are highly recommended to"
