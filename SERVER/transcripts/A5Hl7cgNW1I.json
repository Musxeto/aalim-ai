  "transcript": "sh I have a question um related to uh marriage especially for my little sister I will say uh some weeks ago I asked you about my father a little bit my relationship with him and maybe you remember it telling me if I don't really give him rights I might go to hell as well and so on and so forth alhamdulillah I'm trying to do my best on there so now my question is um I believe that he's still obviously the Wy of my little sister I think but now the problem is about having the last word on the the husband for example of my sister for example if I say that my father is not really uh practicing bi Muslim I would say so he can accept almost anybody he could accept somebody who's I don't know taking RBA or selling beers or something like that like just to say so uh is does he is he the one who should have the last word on who should marry for example my little sister the answer is yes as long as he's Muslim and he is accepted as a guardian what do you mean she if the well or the guardian of the girl is an indecent person someone who goes to brothers who doesn't mind his daughter to go and work as a prostitute or to mix with men or to serve his friends or to allow her to have boyfriend girlfriend relationship then this person is not adequate and not fit to be a Wally but if he is a normal Muslim and he's sinful yet he chooses to his best of ability who right to his daughter he has the final word now having said that if a person comes and proposes who deals with riba or smokes or is known to be someone who does not pray regularly in the Masjid and your sister is not a really righteous practicing hijabi woman she's as bad as he is and your father ways a pros and cons and thinks that they're a good match and he approves of it so be it but if she's a practicing girl hijabi fears Allah and he says yes I want you to marry him she has the veto no one can marry her against her will she can say nope put her foot down and say nope I'm not marrying this guy so it takes both of their permissions to make this happen and Allah Knows Best"
