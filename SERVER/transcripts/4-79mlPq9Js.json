  "transcript": "my question yesterday I think I wasn't clear about what I was asking about the M being side by side we're supposed to be closer to the IM when we playing jamama with the IM right so if the Masid is the men side the man is to my to my left and I came in the mid to join the jam the other women are standing to the right they're forming the RO from the right side but I'll be closer to the IM man if I stand on the left where do I stand in that regard so if you're asking about the position in the Raw not whether it's front or back right or or or left because we know that the men's rows are up front and the women's rows are at the back if you're asking me now about the position the Imam is in the middle and there are right to the row in the middle like 10 women and there are two women to the left of the middle of the row which position should you come of course to the left because number three in the left is better than number four to the right now saying that the Imam is in the middle because this is how masjids are they are built in this rectangular fashion the Imam is up front the men are behind him and the women are behind them so the Masjid the Imam is exactly in the middle if you come you get closer to the Imam whether from the right or from the left and as I said number three to the left of the Imam is better than number four or five to the right of the Imam"
