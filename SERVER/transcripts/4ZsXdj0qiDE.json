  "transcript": "eros says I took a heavy-haul now this happens with a lot of us not only you are us a lot of the Muslims eat and drink before the break of dawn as if they are going to a famines a struck area they eat so much they drink gallons of what what are you doing so I don't think I don't feel thirsty this would not help you that much and even if you just took a glass that would have sufficed and the same amount of thirst is going to be there but people are greedy they just want to eat and eat and eat and drink so now when they go to fetcher and they bow or prostrate they get all the food and drink coming out so he says that I feel that a morsel or so wants to come out to my mouth to my throat and I suppress it but what happens if I get some of it and the taste of it in my mouth does this void my fasting the answer is it does not void your fasting but be realistic and try a level best not to go into extreme by overeating"
