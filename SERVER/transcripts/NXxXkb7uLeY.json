  "title": "Prayer of a traveller - when to shorten? (Project at a camp side) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I have a question regarding shortening the Salah so I am a geologist and due to my work I travel two weeks to a camp that is maybe 400 kilometers from where I live and then I spent two weeks there and then I come back home for one week and then that's how my schedule is so I was wondering while I am at Camp do I shorten my Salah or do I not sure to myself the camp is fixed in one place or it moves from one place to the other uh it it would be fixed throughout my contract okay and you would have your own room that you settled in yes I have a room that I share with someone but I can I pray and so far from my last shred like week that I was working I was praying in my room yeah but I mean it is your fixed room room number 205 for example this is your fixed room so you go back home for a week or two you come you find your room your clothes your things uh no when I come back depending if someone that I switched my rotation with is in the room I might be in a different room in different roommates okay I will answer you inshallah the rule of thumb is that whenever a person leaves his hometown's border or city limits on a journey and 400 kilometers is a distance of a journey then this person is labeled and classified as a traveler anyone who calls home hi where's Daddy Oh Daddy is traveling well he went to this camp this city this Village this town whatever so you are classified as traveling you pack your bags and you say the Dua of traveling and you get bit your family farewell now the issue is if a person who is in such a situation reaches his destination which is 400 kilometers away and it's a camp in the middle of the desert or in the mountains in Canada I don't think you have deserts so what is the situation this guy is still a traveler he hasn't settled down he hasn't put his P.O box to be there and he is commuting until the project or the assignment is over so he is still labeled as a traveler and he may shorten his prayers and he may combine if there is a necessity for that when is it that shortening prayer ends for him the most authentic opinion is that he does not shorten once he settles what do you mean by he settles if I work in a in a city and every couple of weeks I go for the weekend to my wife and kids and my family in my hometown and then I travel for another two weeks or three and I have a house there and I'm settled there and I work there now this I wouldn't be considered to be traveling my hometown I have to pray full prayers and I cannot combine but when I go to this new location location B which is actually where I work and I may stay a lot of the month sometimes more than what I spend in my hometown in this case I'm also had settled in that b location in the second location which means that I can only shorten when I travel between these two cities or two locations once I reach my workplace then I have to pray normal why because now I'm settled I have my house I know the times of prayers I go to work I sleep I nap I do it's like my home I'm settled unlike someone who goes to a camp and the camp is in the desert and he doesn't have a fixed place and he moves from one room to the other depending on the need and he knows that this is a project that will soon end and then he will be relocated somewhere else that would be a traveler and Allah Knows Best"
