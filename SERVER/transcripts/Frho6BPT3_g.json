  "transcript": "as for the second question he says Ashura Asherah is it a day of mourning or is it a day of happiness it is neither I'm sure is neither we don't express any happiness we don't wear new clothes and give gifts away and we don't definitely wear black and mourn and hid ourselves and bleed ourselves to death all of this is both sides our innovation the only thing we do is we fast because the Prophet fasted a talents a lot and that is it no special prayers no gifts no cooking food and and the likes"
