  "transcript": "kareem says there are people who make acapella and beatbox songs which substitute music with sounds made by hands and the mouth and mixed together to make sort of a beat as long as the lyrics are decent and appropriate is it allowed to listen to these songs the scholars have disputed upon this the reason of the their dispute is that the Sharia came with the prohibition of musical instruments so any musical instrument is prohibited in Islam whether it's a guitar a violin a piano keyboard synthesizers drums flutes whatever all of these are prohibited with the exception of the doof which is like the trample tambourine or whatever they call it and it has no metal things on the sides this is only permissible in weddings it's permissible in Eid celebrations and when some dignitary arrives who has influence over Islam and the Muslims from a travel fitra comes back from a journey and this is very very limited other than that all types of musical instruments are prohibited now this is what the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam had stated the authentic hadith and also the four schools of thought the school of imam abu hanifa Imam Malik Imam Shafi an imam but they all agree that music is prohibited in Islam so the scholars who looked at this said this is Haram whatever you make with your own throat or by clapping this is permissible so the beatbox is permissible permissible capella is permissible other scholars looked further and said no as long as we have the same impact of musical instruments then it takes the same ruling so for example in the Quran wine is mentioned frequently so wine is intoxicating whether it is wine white or red whether it is whiskey whether it is beer whether it is bourbon gin tequila vodka whatever you call it as long as it intoxicates it's Haram now recently they came up with new things methamphetamine they have cocaine they have heroin they have opium they have marijuana they have hash they have you call it you name it they have it and these things also intoxicate but they're not something that you drink so some said no this is not wine wine is what we know from dates from barley from grapes this is what we know anything else is Holland which is not true so that scholar said that whatever leads and shares the same reason for Prohibition then it shares the same ruling and if you look at a cappella you can listen to this song the actual and dance to it and feel the groove of it and you can listen to the acapella and have the same feeling exactly so there is no doubt that this is also haram exactly like the actual song and music is haram and allah sol-gel knows best"
