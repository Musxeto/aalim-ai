  "title": "Why am I being rejected from Job offers, is it because of my sins? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is a frequently asked question so many Muslims so many brothers say that we apply for a job or jobs and every time we go for the interview it it goes well and for one reason or the other they reject us oh they never come back to us and this is bothering us because we've done everything that is required we are qualified for the job but this keeps on happening so what is it is it my sins is it due to an evil eye is it because the way I look the answer is I don't know see there isn't one answer that fits all what I know is that a lot Almighty is a provider not the interviewer not the CEO or the holder of a high position in the company or even the owner who provides for me is Allah as origin so keep on trusting Allah do what you have to do in to improve your presentation take care of the things you say because as an old director and human resources have done hundreds of interviews and I can tell that this person has potentials but the way he's presenting himself the way he's answering the questions are putting him in harm's way so you have to go through the process of interviews maybe you have a problem with the way you communicate your sins can be a factor so repenting and quitting as many as possible would be a good start and there's nothing wrong in doing Rupiah on yourself and drinking from that route clear water in the morning in the afternoon and before you go to bed extensively a lot of it and inshallah you will have a new job soon inshallah and then I'll send you the bill"
