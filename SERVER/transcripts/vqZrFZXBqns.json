  "transcript": "is it necessary for the bride to cover her face is the bride allowed to do makeup so this question is composed of two questions one a bride can she come out without covering her face I have to ask you a question is she coming out to none muharram men to watch her or this is only exclusive for other women if it is exclusive only for women and it is segregated and photos and videos are prohibited to be taken in this case there's no problem none whatsoever in a bride coming out to celebrate her wedding night in front of other women this is what all women do but if there would be none Muharram men such as the waiters such as the in-laws or like in so many Muslim countries unfortunately it is free mixing so the men and the women they're all in one Hall each one of them is wearing the best of attire and clothes the the men are wearing their three-piece suits or the TSK Ito's and the women are you know full fledged makeup in it this is totally haram whether it's a wedding or it's our Tippa or it's a gathering or its homecoming or it's a school reunion all of this is Haram in Islam because when you see such things in front of you if you claim that you don't have any desire for the opposite gender either you're gay or you have a problem with your hormones and the third option is you're a blatant liar so this is natural it's human nature that we are attracted to the opposite sex this is how Allah created us and this is why Allah governed the relationship between men and women he didn't say go to your temples or to your houses of worship or to your churches and never ever interact no you want to interact you can marry you can interact with your mom your sister your daughter your mother your aunt but to interact with nan Muharram it's putting fuel next to fire and hoping that nothing ignites and this is not possible so for a bride to come out in the presence of a segregated party only women and no one is taking photographs or videotaping this is totally permissible as for wearing the makeup the same question applies or the same answer applies not only for brides any woman who applies makeup must cover her face even if she does not believe that niqab is mandatory because applying makeup to all scholars of Islam is prohibited to be looked at by nan Mohammed so those who do not believe that the niqab is mandatory they say yes the face of the woman is not our she can come out but she must not adorn herself she must not put foundations or makeup or eyeliners or mascara or masala we call it in Arabic so Touche so this is not permissible so to go out wearing makeup is prohibited if nan Muharram men would see her whether she's a bride or not"
