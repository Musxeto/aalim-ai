  "transcript": "he says must we wash our face and hands after visiting the graveyard and the answer is no there is no recommendation for us to wash our hands or faces after visiting a graveyard because it's not a dirty place or a place of impurity so that we are instructed to do that yes there are some narrations that recommended that we perform Vudu if we were to carry a funeral to the graveyard carrying it and to perform Russell if we participate in washing the disease before shrouding and burying the corpse of a Muslim but these hadiths were abrogated and some say that it's a recommendation and not a command and some say that these are not authentic to begin with so either way there is no such thing as um asking people to wash their faces or their hands after visiting a graveyard or a cemetery"
