  "transcript": "Nullah from Canada says he's having a problem because once he listens to the Quran or watches a lecture he feels bored sleepy doesn't look forward to it but if he watches a movie or a video clip or something that is not related to religion he could spend hours without end so what what is the reason the reason is a fee it's like the scholars say if you want to know your position on the day of judgment to Allah look at a large place in your heart your priorities are definitely set wrong so this is why you find fun and this is human nature you find fun in watching things that are not related to Dean and the moment someone preaches you or you hear a lecture or you read the Quran you feel lazy and tired etc you have to fight this you have to set your priorities right by associating yourselves itself with practicing Muslims"
