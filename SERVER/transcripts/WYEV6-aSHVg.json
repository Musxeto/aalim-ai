  "transcript": "la habana bahama hamdulillah was salatu salam ala rasulillah hiwa ali was a big ego amaneci de ho de ho embargo assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh last time we met we did not have enough time to go through this great hadith of a beloved nom nom de las which is hadith number 195 the lab number of nos said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam was informed that I pray or that I said I will pray all night and fast all day as long as I live and the Prophet came to me re salatu salam and asked me did you say that and I said yes may Allah make my mother and father ransom for you so the prophet said allah√≠s alot wassalam that this is something that you will not be able to tolerate you cannot do this meaning he knows that my nature people will give up after a while so the Prophet is awesome told him don't do this sleep and pray fast and break your fast and then he directed him to the best of fasting and he said fast three days every month why because one good deed is multiplied by 10 so this is 30 days if you fast three days every month this means as if you facet a whole month and this is for the whole year as if you facet for the entire year I'm the lab number as a person who tastes and knows the beauty of worshipping Allah said I can do more than that it could have been easy for him to say okay Zach Allah here haleh's yet he's not doing it so that he would not be blamed he's doing it because he loves Allah he wants to do as much as possible to get closer to Allah and this is a difference between us and them we do forms of worship so that we are not punished not so that we are closer to allah we want to do the basics and that is why people come to me and say Jeff what's the ruling on so-and-so and I say haram they always say the same thing is it haram Alma crew knows it's haram haram haram or you know a little bit small Haram what is this are you choosing what you want from the grocery shop we are you buying fruits and vegetables I want big or small you are sitting ok assume it's not a sin you are doing something that is makrooh meaning that a lot dislikes it how dare you do something a lot of dislikes so our problem is that we are not interested in getting closer to Allah our problem is that we just want to be on the bottom and that's why a lot of the ignorant people say in Arabia I don't know if they say it here as well when we say or when they ask Allah to enter Jenna or if you tell them may Allah make you and I in Jenna he said I am satisfied if they put me next to the doorsteps need the shoes in general I don't want to be in paradise I just want to be at the lowest level of Jenna and this is wrong the prophecies as salaam if you ask Allah ask him for paradise for Alfredo's because it is the highest of Jenna and the middle of Jenna and don't ask for the middle or for the lowest part ask for that top likewise if a schoolboy is studying for his exams what is your target my son if he tells me my target is one hundred percent then I will tell you he will get 95 maybe 91 but definitely he will get a very good great and depends on his ability if someone tells me I'd like to get the passing grade I know that he will fail whoever wants the passing grade will fail because the more you shoot up then if it's a little bit down you're still up but if you shoot to the limit you will fail so likewise we always shoot for the passing grade which means we are in very dangerous grounds and the lab number tasted the beauty of worshiping Allah so he said profitable or three days a month sorry I can do more so the Prophet told him in this case fast one day and skip two days meaning you fast one third of the month ten days every month still saying that this is too little I can do more so the profit that is salatu salam told him fast one day and skip one day this is the fasting of profit that would my brother the Prophet the wood and it's the best of fasting still he wants to do more and the Prophet told him that there isn't any more there isn't any better than the fasting of the wood meaning if you do more your sinful also the prophet alayhi salatu salam told him that there isn't better than that and we have some narrations from the Companions that some of them used to fast the whole year like I'm the London zubair like other companions so how can we balance some scholars say we can't balance the Prophet saying erase salatu salam is fixed and this is what should be followed okay how do we justify the doings of the companions may allah be pleased with them well either they did not hear of this hadith and this is very possible we stated before a lot of the times that not all of the Companions knew about every single sooner not all of them to the extent that for example when rama rama pop went to a sham when he was the ha'la'tha they heard that there is a plague in one of the cities and so they stopped some of the companion said don't you fear Allah what are you afraid of are afraid of dying so why did you go out in the first place wasn't it to go for jihad and die in the cause of Allah so why are you afraid of the plague others said no we can't throw ourselves in harm's way and they didn't know what to do until I'm the lamentable mouth who was answering the call of nature somewhere far and then he came he said what are you disputing over and they told him that we don't know what to do then he said by Allah I'll tell you what to do I heard the prophet alayhi salatu salam say if you heard of a city where it has been implied there is plague in it do not enter it and if the plague comes into a city you are in it do not leave it what do we call this nowadays quarantine this is the quarantine that the prophet instructor lace or some don't go in and no one goes out you have to surround the city this is the quarantine that must be implemented so that the plague does not spread out and Omar may allah be pleased with him and all of those who were with him did not hear the hadith before and there are so many other similar situations now regarding the companions who used to fast the whole year scholar said that most probably they did not know about the hadith the second justification would be that they knew the hadith and they knew this incident but they felt that this was not for individuals but rather for the whole Ummah however individuals who were capable of fasting the whole year and were so strong to do this they were exempted from following this hadith nevertheless as for us we stick with the hadith of the Prophet le salatu salam and we say it is not permissible at all for anyone to exceed fasting more than half of the year so you have to fast one day and skip one day you cannot fast more than that otherwise you would be sinning and going against the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam now what do we learn from this hadith this hadith is extremely important for us because it teaches us how to worship allah azzawajal continuously uninterruptedly what do you mean I'll tell you what I mean the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that the most preferred deeds to Allah are those that are continuous even if they're little so allah azzawajal rewards you and he loves that you do something and maintain doing it even if it's little but if you do a lot for a short period of time and then fall week and leave this good deed then this is something that a lot so jeal does not approve off the Prophet said in the authentic hadith do not oblige yourselves except with the deeds you can do because a large the Virgil does not get fed up so this is an instruction that you only accept and undertake what you can sustain and maintain for a long period of time we have a short break so stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right assalamu alaikum and welcome back so sooner is to maintain a particular form of deed until the end of your life and go down but you can go more and the Prophet said Atticus alot was salaam two of the love number Blass that you should take it easy on yourself Abdullah have nom nom de las said at the end of his life when he got old imagine what he said I wish I took the Prophet salads a lot to a salam permission now until he was so old he used to fast one day and skip one day and now he says he regrets this why because his old and he said I wish I took the prophets permission and continue to do this now it is very hard for me but I will not leave it it is extremely hard but I have to maintain doing it and this is a lesson for us when you are young when you are practicing in your early age you feel the enthusiasm you feel the power the Prophet says in the authentic hadith that every single deed has a climax and the climax has a weak points so whoever his weak points or the down slope the downhill process is to my Sunnah then he has been guided but whoever his downslope or downhill process is to other than my Sunnah then he has gone astray what does this mean scholars say that this is an important hadith especially for us so that we maintain steadfast on Islam whenever you pick something whenever you start to do something you find that you have a lot of energy whether in Islam or in non-islamic activities example in Islam a person starts to practice he has strong e-man enthusiasm so he insists on praying for in the masjid the horus or mother benicia very good he insists on tree night prayer to three hours four hours a night before he did not play anything at all now all of a sudden mashallah his he-man is strong he insists on fastening one day and skipping one day he insists on finishing the Quran once every week and this is leading a lot of quran attending lectures doing this doing that and neglecting his work neglecting his studies neglecting taking care of his body and of his health now after six or eight months of this strong behavior which is good on the surface but on the long run it's bad what happens to him the Prophet says at the climax has a downhill process which means that you will start to lose interest a bit by bit bit by bit until you reach a very low level the Prophet says whoever is downhill to my son he's guided what does that mean means that if you instead of praying four hours night prayer you feel very tired of it after a while you start to say okay i will just spray chef air and water only then this is Sunnah no problem if he instead of fasting a day and skipping a day he said no I will just only fast Ramadan not play in any day of Ramadan and maybe I sure and maybe out of a maybe not necessarily and instead of attending all lectures and reading so much Quran he reads only one juzo so every month he finishes the Quran once this is the minimum this is his Sunnah the Prophet says he's guided the other one who is led astray is the one who does not pray night prayer at all palace he leaves even with her he does not pray for on time in the masjid he praised it after Sun Rise he does not fast all days of Ramadan he skips a day or two he makes sense so after the climax he went really downhill and he reached the bottom and this was led astray you have a climax watch out if you can maintain it do it if you cannot go a little bit down take something that suits you that you know you can be maintaining it for a long time and this hadith is extremely important because it talks about human nature I know brothers who were committed in the very beginning Marcia a lot about alcala strongly man muss Jade's lectures students of knowledge who were strong in their knowledge strong in their practice very proud of the religion after a while when the dunya is opened people are requesting them to be a little bit lenient be a little bit soft all of a sudden the beard was shrunk as if they watched it so many times it became up to the skin sure what is this said time changes and scholar so-and-so said this scholar so and so say this so it's permissible what do you want with scholar so-and-so and scholars and so what does the prophet seer Sam he's an onerous energy of dispute among scholars Subhan Allah after a while his club that was to the middle of his leg goes a little bit and a little bit to the ankle and then to the floor like as if he's a bright sometimes he walks and people carrying his top behind him what is this Sheikh say yeah I'm not doing it out of arrogance I'm doing it because it's permissible and so-and-so shares on sources are audible AA him in a analogy here are Muslim so you find that the climax they reach they could not maintained it and that is why the prophets most do I was young libel Peru sabbatical bernardini oh Allah who turns heart over who flips hearts over make my heart steadfast on your religion you have to do this every single day hundreds of times why because you and I have seen so many people go astray people who use to look as if they're committed since so many people with their beards with their Islamic look they've reached their climax and they went downhill and now they're about to hit rock bottom but you don't know because they look okay yet if you analyze what they say you'll figure out that they are on a very very dangerous curve they look practicing but their hearts have been corrupted and if allah azzawajal does not help them and send to them people who would sit with them and talk with them and realize this and advise them and surround them and bring them back to safety they will be soon doomed and you know a lot of this may illogical protector so this hadith is very important in showing us how to be steadfast and also it shows us how human nature is easily affected and that the best of guidance is the guidance of the prophet alayhi salatu salam never ever think that i can top that I can be better than that the Prophet Elisha salam three of his companions asked about the way he used to worship Allah and when his wife's told them he used to do this and that they said the Prophet Allah has forgiven all of his sins he's not like us he has carte blanche as for me I will never sleep at night I would pray all night the other I will never break my fast I will fast every day the third I will never marry women I will deprive myself from desire and lust did the Prophet approve of that I so Sam was very angry and he said by Allah I'm the most one among you who fears Allah and His knowledgeable of Allah yet I sleep and pray I fast and I eat and I marry women whoever chooses a path other than my Sunnah is not from me he is not a follower of mine therefore the best of guidance no matter what your mind tells you no matter what shake so and so and shake so and so the earlier mentioned tell you the best of guidance is the guidance of the prophet alayhi salatu salam by following his footsteps by the millimeter you will enter paradise that is why when remark may allah be pleased with him objected to the treaty of hood idea and he thought that it was unfair for the Muslims you know the treat of her labia what did it say it said that if any one of the idol worshippers accepted Islam and came to the Muslims the Muslims must return him back and if any of the Muslims committed the act of apostasy and went to them they can keep him so amber was outraged and he said o prophet of Allah aren't we on the right track aren't they following falsehood so why should we give in our religion why should we surrender and be weak the Prophet said Oh mark I am only the servant of Allah and I do as I am commanded and allah azzawajal would not let me down I'm worried not like this it's not he didn't like it he wanted an answer that fulfills his desire of attacking the disbelievers and not being unfairly treated so he went to Abu Bakr and he said the same to him what did the book is say he said remark the profit is salatu salam is the Messenger of Allah you must stick to his figure of speech footsteps but what Ibaka said you must hold on to the saddle of his camel if you hold on to the saddle of his camel that means wherever he goes you will go with him but this doesn't mean hold on to his saddle of chamomile follow his instruction and footsteps Romo said after that I realized how wrong I was so I freed so many slaves and I gave so much money in charity so that Allah who'd forgive what I had said there is no guidance better than the guidance of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet used to say this every single Friday and in every great occasion when the Muslims gather he would say that he already had you Muhammad in salalah halim the best of guidance is the guidance of the Prophet Aslam and every invented thing in Islam is an innovation and every innovation is in hell fire this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
