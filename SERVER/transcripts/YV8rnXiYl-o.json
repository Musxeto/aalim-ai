  "transcript": "question is that my question is that uh when I pray the first Salah after that can I must change my place if I pray the Salah first and then I sit and make AAR Subhan Allah aldah andar after Sal and then I pray the same place after in after the first prayer that will be and my question also the same for my any woman female she I will I will answer you inshallah Latif so latif's question is clear there is a Hadith or a number of hadiths such as the Hadith of mua may Allah be pleased with him and others where the Prophet orders those who prayed J Friday prayer not to connect it afterwards with the before speaking to someone else or changing and shifting their position and the Hadith also was mentioned in other F prayers not only Friday where the Prophet says is it hard for you to go a bit forward or backwards or to the right or to the left before you pray your sunah and this is an instruction from the prophet Alam to change your position so the most authentic opinion is that after concluding your F you must not pray your Sunnah unless you speak to someone by giving him Salam or checking the time or standing and Shifting the position a little bit to the forward or backwards or to the right or to the left and this is the most authentic opinion some Scholars said that if you concluded your F and engag that would be sufficient because this is considered to be separating the F from the Sunnah but this is not authentic and it doesn't require you to be a rocket scientists to shift a little bit or at least sayam to the one next to you in order to follow the instruction of the Prophet wasam should a woman who's praying in her home follow the same ruling that answer is yes after far prayer do not connect it with Sunnah unless you change your position the place you the spot you prayed on or you speak with someone but if you prayed the Sunnah and you want to pray another Sunnah or to follow the Sunnah with you don't have to change your position if you want to pray your Witter you don't have to change your position only after concluding the F do not pray the Sunnah on the same spot until you do one of these two things"
