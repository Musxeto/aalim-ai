  "transcript": "muham the prophet sallai wasam said in a Hadith that was narrated by Abu may Allah be pleased with him and it was reported in IM Muslim the prophet said Islam began as something strange and will revert to being strange as it began so is for those who are The Strangers now this is a Hadith but as a Muslim we cannot hear the Hadith of the Prophet especially if it has a prophecy like this without contemplating on it and learning from the lessons needed to be learned from it so the prophet Alat wasam is telling us that Islam began as something that is strange and this is a well-known fact but what a lot of the people do not know is that Islam is not the religion you and I Embrace and that is it Islam is the religion of Allah since the time of Adam peace be upon him so all the messengers of Allah whether it is ibraim or no mosa or or Isa all the messengers and prophets of Allah were Muslims in the sense that they submitted their will to Allah and they would not act except in accordance to what Allah ordered them to do this is Islam as simple as that there's no science behind it what is Islam is to submit your will to Allah to do what Allah tells you to do and this is a great cause and reason for people to estrange you to alienate you if you look at the time of n peace be upon him was he a stranger among his people definitely this is why he built the ark and this is why Allah flooded the whole of Earth drowning everyone who refused to submit his will who refused to become a Muslim if you look at ibraim peace be upon him the father of The Messengers and and and ibraim is a story of his own Allah described him in the Quran as [Music] an what is the meaning of um what is the meaning of um I know after and people are a little bit drowsy I am myself I had to take like three shots of coffee so that I could be able to wake up but I have to share with you some of the pain and Agony I'm I'm I'm sharing at the moment so what is the meaning of umah a Nation well actually in the Quran the word umah is used in four different meanings this is referring to nation and it also means religion so this means Dean or religion and it comes as the meaning of time as inah and he remembered after a while few years after he got off the prison he remembered that Yousef interprets dreams this is three and the fourth meaning is an Imam a leader and this is the meaning of he was an Imam so was he a stranger indeed he was to the extent you remember the the the story when he went and Sarah to Egypt what happened the Tyrant of Egypt at that time H not now the T the Tyrant of Egypt was known to confiscate any beautiful woman and Sarah was beautiful so ibraim said listen if he knew that I'm your husband he's going to slay me and take you and by Allah there is no Muslims on earth except you and I Subhan Allah was he a stranger or not he was indeed a stranger and if he fell to the pressure of those around him he would have simply said is it possible that all of these people are wrong and I'm the only one who's right but he was an um may Allah peace and blessing be upon him and this is why every single Salat we offer salutation to the prophet as we offered it to ibraim so we always mention them both M peace be upon him was sent to the Jews and he was also a stranger among them he was a stranger with pharaoh and his people who used to worship pharaoh and he had to fight with them and he was also a stranger among the Jews who went against his way he says right they say left he say worship Allah they worship a statue made of gold they worship a tree they worship anything but gold stubborn until today if you look at ISA peace be upon him he was a stranger as well to the extent that Allah ascended him to the heavens just to save him from the people from killing him or from harming him so the Islam began as something strange and so did Islam when the prophet Alat wasam was among his people before the message was given the prophet wasam among the idol worshippers before Islam was known to be S Ali wasallam he was known to be the truthful and honest trustworthy worthy while he lived a strange life to them he never participated in their parties he never ate from their slaughterings they offered to the idols he never fornicated or consumed intoxicant or did any foul uh uh words or actions as they had indulged in he only worshiped Allah Asel through his own way he didn't know Islam but but when the message was given to him his alienation increased and his people cursed him his people slandered him his people said every bad thing about him in the book so after he was truthful and honest and trustworthy he became a liar a poet a monk a sorcerer insane and he was not anything close to that sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam until he went to Medina and before going to Medina he sent his companions who were strangers as he was to ABIA twice not once and then they were permitted to go to Medina and they went to Medina and they were strangers in Medina though they were accompanied by Muslim Brothers but it's a strange Village it's a strange country until Islam got its force and momentum and became a power then this feeling of being a stranger started to demolish and not only that but the prophet still wasam felt stranger among the Muslims he used to say wall if you know what I know you would cry a lot and you will laugh so little he felt stranger and that's why when the angel of death wanted to take his soul he was so happy because now he will leave the alien lands the strange lands and move back to Allah where he would find Total tranquility and he will be where he wanted always to be that is in Paradise usually strangers are minority and the reason for that because anyone who practices Islam he has to be met with those who oppose what he's practicing and this is visible and we can see and relate to that so if you look at the types of the that we're talking about which is the feeling of being a stranger if you look at this you found that find that Muslims are all strangers among the different religions on Earth there is no hiding of that what they say that we have to blend we are uh all equal in humanity and we are all the same this is not the not true just because because you're a Muslim people tend to segregate you from all the rest whatever religion you are you blend in if you're a Muslim no you can't be with us you have to compromise your religion and this is because we only worship Allah and all other religions worship others with Allah there is no religion that worships Allah alone they associate others with Allah we only have and our religion is the only religion that makes part of it to have moral conduct to have to have Chastity to have all good things and Subhan Allah so many times we fail to represent our religion because we're always defensive why do you do this in Islam why do you do that in Islam why men have to uh wear uh grow beers why do women uh wear hijab why isn't it the other way around why don't men wear hijab and women grow bead I don't mind so they keep on attacking and we keep on defending we're being defensive though we have the best religion in the world if you knew how to portray and present your religion no one can stand in your way but we don't we're always on the defensive there is also a person who is a Believer he is a stranger among the different Muslim sects and Cults because he's a Believer the prophet told usat that my um will be divided into 73 Cults all of them are in Hell except one and the companion said who who is this one oh prophet of Allah the prophet said wh whomever is on my footsteps and the footsteps of my companions so this is the way of for salvation so the believer who's committed to Islam feels alienated among the different sects that differ with him in AA differ with him in ideology these don't believe in Sunnah they don't believe in Hadith this one makes Allah's attributes all in vain this one doesn't believe we have to pay zakat this one doesn't believe in the existence of prayer this one doesn't believe in the day of judgment and they say they're Muslims they believe in reincarnation they die and they are reincarnated in some other form and they say that they're Muslims all of this is not part of Islam even the the practicing believer among the saved sect which is he's a stranger why though their a is okay but because he's committed to the Sunnah he's practicing the Sunnah in every single detail according to what the prophet said I'm not bringing anything from my pocket whatever the prophet says we do do you have a problem with that theoretically no but practically yes because the prophet said do this and that and this goes against my whims and desires the prophet tells the woman do not travel if you believe in Allah on the day of judgment without a m this is authentic in women says ah yes I'm but I have to travel my husband can't come with me I have to do this I have to do that so he feels like a stranger among his own sect among his own people because they refuse to practice and this is how many of us feel in their own homes in their own houses when a youngster when a young man or a young girl start to practice Islam the father is a Muslim the mother is a Muslim the siblings are Muslim they're all from they pray they fast they offer but they are not abiding in by the Sunnah so they find this feeling of being strangers in their own homes in their own offices in their own soups in their own streets because the people are far away from practicing the Sunnah if you go to a scholar you would find this knowledgeable person feeling like a stranger among the masses of the Muslims because the masses of the Muslims all what they care about is to make money and to pursue their lusts and desires whether through eating or whether through sexual desires this is this is life to them they live like animals they don't think of the Hereafter they don't have objectives so the scholar is struggling with them he feels like a stranger he is trying his level best to communicate with them and to get them out of Darkness into the light and among the scholars also the scholars feel strangers among themselves because not all of them are active not all of them are forthcoming not all of them walk the talk and do what they preach so a scholar who teaches the Sunnah feels like a stranger among the other Scholars who are content with their paycheck who are content with the uh authorities being pleased with them and that is why Scholars say that are of three types the scholars are of three types one type is the of the authority of the regime so this type of whatever the king tells them say Simon says they say yes sir and they make masallah fatwa tailored made they can do whatever what do you want they as as our friends and and brothers from Egypt have this uh uh joke about hashish marijuana you know that they say if it's Haram we are burning it and if it's Halal we're smoking it so both ways alhamdulillah it's a it's a a made done deal so there is a fatwa for everything this is type one like diabetes H type two are the scholars of the umah they are the scholars who would give you fatwa in accordance to what you want so the majority here what do you want she can you make F not mandatory to pray in the Masjid who agrees M okay any fjer now they use loud speakers and loud speakers the sound penetrate the houses and the walls and it reaches uh distances that was not at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam then in this case no if the man makes aan without a loudspeaker and you hear it you have to attend but you cannot hear it therefore you don't have to pray pray home now don't take this as a fat I'm just giving you an example the brothers are saying masallah alhamdulillah no and this is shocking f is at 3:15 here huh or or 3:20 to me this is madness yesterday I could not sleep because I finished at at almost 11:30 12 there's only 3 hours when am I going to have s and and in Saudi alhamdulillah we have it until 4:15 or 420 so we have enough time inshallah anyhow this is number how how much two number three is the scholar of the mill so you have and and he's the scholar of the religion whether you like it or not he gives you the fatwa in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah and there are very few usually people call she I have this problem and that problem and this problem and mashallah you feel sorry for him so you tend to bend the rules not break them and after you hung up what did I do I gave him a fatwa that helps him and this is not Islam I should give him the fatwa in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah whether he likes it or not so this these are the categories of uh uh the scholars and among all Muslims you find the elite the scholars who call people to Islam and who tolerate their abuse who tolerate them when they harm them because this is the way of the prophets do you think that you will be able to give da masallah in the comfort of your home without being tested Allah says in the beginning ofah do people think that they will be left to say we have believed without being tested and tried by Allah we have tried those who were before them and we shall know those who are truthful and we shall know those who are telling the lies so you have to feel like a stranger and a a a person who is committed to Islam is a stranger among his wife and family he's a stranger among his own children he's a stranger among those most loved to him because they do not share what he feels about the Sunnah what he feels about Daw people now think mainly about the bonus at the end of the year they think about the annual increment they think about the grade will we get the grade or won't we can we increase our housing allowance from 3 months into 4 months this is what they think about how much their bank account is how many cars how many houses how many plots they had have bought so a person who's committed to Islam is in a valley and those close to him are in a different Valley so they don't feel the same attachment and they don't share the same sentiments look at a youngster who is committed to Islam he does not look at Haram when he sees a woman he lowers his gaze he doesn't watch TV he doesn't mix with his sisters in-law how do the family or how does the family treat him I know from my own family when I started practicing that was very long time ago alhamdulillah last century and this is how old I go this is what I always tell my wife when I tease her and I say to my grandchild and my do daughters and I tell them yeah look at your mother look at your grandmother she is so old she was born in the last century so I'm entitled to do something and my daughter says oh what a about you Dad when were you born and and and Subhan Allah we we haven't raised them well anyhow if you look at the way I was brought up I was the only one when I practiced Islam to have abided by the Sunnah and my mother my family boted me the Friday lunch do not come because your wife covers and and your sister-in-laws don't cover we all eat on one table so my mother told me do not come on Friday my brothers would not visit me because I have to segregate their wives from my wife she's wearing hijab but Subhan Allah it only lasted for one or two weeks after that I get a phone call from my mom she said kalas come we will segregate and Subhan Allah from that time W it is Allah's work my my mother became more religious than all of us fasting Mondays and Thursdays and fasting three white days giving charity took the television set and threw it out took the radio and threw it out nothing un Islamic no one back bites in her presence she's over 82 may Allah give her long life and a good ending on with shahada Subhan Allah three uh two of my brothers mallah their beards are longer than mine mashallah and and and one of them has memorized the Quran fully and they started practicing since that day my sister the only sister I have she memorized the Quran her children mallah memorized the Quran all of them Subhan Allah what kind of transformation is this now the feeling of being a stranger has diminished a little bit more because now we feel that we have a platform that we can talk likewise for a sister when she wears the hijab the first to scold her her father and mother why do you do this he's your brother-in-law he's your cousin it's okay to to sit with him he's the husband of your aunt there is nothing wrong why do you make problems and the sisters call and they complain and we and I tell them this is the same thing that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was met by so be steadfast you are on the right track and we see Subhan Allah how those who com are committed to the Sunnah how they are faced by a lot of tribulation in France Viv France what is in France the Democracy the culture the art if a woman covers her face she's fine €500 Subhan Allah okay can I come out with a bikini you sh no she can Subhan Allah why is that said yeah this is freedom of speech no no problem but Subhan Allah when a woman covers her face in modesty in Chastity no this is a no no so this is part of being feeling as a stranger the brothers who reverted to Islam I envy them all these sins that they had done are all scratched out and erased by saying muham it's a new page new page is 40 years of age he did so many heinous things it's all gone but what about mine no sorry you're a born Muslim you have to suffer ill so I have to repent and I have to do a lot of things but he takes it easy going when this man or woman revert to Islam the transformation is 180° everything that he used to love everything that he used to enjoy all the partying all the uh uh uh boozing and and and and fun and everything Haram that we used to do the minute I say I hate these things what has changed you are the same person now you're feeling like a stranger because you're committed to Islam and this is what makes us in a place of responsibility the majority maity of Muslims are not necessarily on the right track because it is not the majority that rules it is the Quran and the Sunnah and that is why Allah asael says in the Quran and if you obey most of those on Earth they will mislead you far away from Allah's path if you obey most so it is not the majority that rules and also Allah says and most of mankind will not believe even if you desire to it eagerly the majority will not believe so who should I follow should I be with the flock should I be with the crowd or should I abide by what Allah has given me the Quran and the Sunnah which is authentic and unchanged until I meet my maker subhanahu this is why Allah ordered us to select our partners not to go with the majority Allah says and keep yourself patiently with those who call on their lord morning and afternoon seeking his face and let not your eyes Overlook them this is how your feeling of being a stranger gets Le less and less when you choose Those whom you accompany because then you feel like you are with your brethren you feel like you are with those who uh May uplift your morale and get you closer to Allah that's why the scholars say accompany those who are purer than you and those who are more knowledgeable than you who do we choose as friends usually when you look at your contact list open your contact list and try to find out from your contact list how many get you closer to Allah how many will you find this one is in for work this one is for school this one is my was you have was here in qu big wow like us Mah welcome to the Gulf region we have big wow if I want to have a booking to an airline I have to have if I have to have one something to to be much quicker and faster in government relations I have to have was so all of my contacts are like this this man sells sheep so I can buy them for sacrifice in he sells them sheep huh this this guy has this this guy has that who among my contact list who gets me closer to Allah very few so then I have a problem now a stranger in Islam is divided into two types a stranger who is righteous and Pious on his own so he prays he fasts he abides by the Sunnah but he does not communicate this to others and when the punishment and Wrath of Allah falls upon a nation he will be included with them the second type is the best of all and this is the saved type and those are who are p and righteous but they also contribute to the community by enforcing and enjoying uh uh virtue and good and preventing evil and vice this is your responsibility as a Muslim when the wrath of Allah comes you will be saved Allah would not punish the people or the residents of a village while they're people are those who enforce the law of Allah z may Allah be pleased with her said that the prophet entered my house one day terrified and he said woe to the Arabs from an evil that is coming close to them from the dam of Y and Ma it's had been opened this much so zanab asked oh prophet of Allah can destruction befall upon us while there are good ones there are righteous people among us the prophet said yes this is possible when evil spreads and is overwhelming why because these righteous people are not seeing the word of truth they're not changing they're seeing evil in front of them and they pass by and say talk what you're doing is wrong why don't you come and pray with us you cannot chitchat with this woman you cannot drink in the daytime of Ramadan you nobody speaks the music is playing everywhere what can we do you can do a lot but you have to take the step forward so that Allah would not punish you for that and there is a form of that is shared by Muslims and non-muslims alike and this is when they leave their country so you have the of the Nations so any expat whether Muslim or non-muslim when he leaves this country he's a he's a stranger but this has nothing to do with the religion now having said that and I've taken so much of your time there are things that we have to be careful about when we speak about by now you should feel that you're a stranger does anyone feel that he's a stranger now raise your hands please okay and the rest are all residents huh quties you're all strangers what is this no seriously do you feel like strangers now or you no I don't know I don't relate to what the Sheikh is talking about if you don't relate you have a problem if you relate then you're on the right track inshallah now there are things that you have to be careful when it talk when we talk talk about first of all your should be looked at and analyzed through the Quran and Sunnah because the people of innovation they feel among the people of Sunnah right so if you have a cult that does not follow the Quran and Sunnah living among us how would he feel he would feel as a stranger so he should not come to the Hadith of abuur which we recited ISL says alhamdulillah thenba is for me what is tuba by the way Toba is a metaphor for Glad Tidings and those Scholars who say otherwise they say no it's not a metaphor it is a tree in Jenna where a rider needs 700 years to pass its shade so the prophet is telling you this huge tree is yours if you do what you are told to do so first of all look at the Quran and Sunnah if you feel like a stranger don't be happy let me check and cross examine am I on the Sunnah am I following the Quran if yes then you're in good hands and also if you look at those who are sinners if you have Sinners Among Us those who consume intoxicant coming here what some of us some of them might be with us but why is he staying here well he came here he thought that they were Distributing free booze and he came and sat but all of a sudden the sh said alhamdulillah he's embarrassed he's sitting how does he feel Among Us he feel that he's not in the right place he doesn't belong so he feels like a stranger so he hears this lecture on Str strangers he says H that's interesting I Feel Like a Stranger yeah but in the wrong sense you're not part of the strangers that will have ah what a shame can I leave go ahead so you have to cross-examine what you are doing with the Quran and Sunnah secondly be careful if you fit the characteristics and the features that we've mentioned about the strangers if you upon the Sunnah if you're abiding by the Quran if you're doing this Mah everything fits you there is a very important thing that you should be careful of and that is feeling boastful and arrogant this completely destroys you once you feel that you are on the right track Shan comes to you and says I am better than the Sheikh the she is not practicing that much look at him he has this I'm a real hardcore salafy I don't have this he's wearing and he today he took me with sunglasses sunglasses it's what is he doing he's not on the way of the Sala he then I start to feel above everyone else just because I'm a stranger and this is one trap of shatan that would take you straight to Hell Scholars say maybe a good deed would put you in hell and maybe a sin would lead you to Paradise when I do one of my friends say when I make and I finish I shave now alhamdulillah my record book is clean and white while coming and driving from mecah to jeda I listen to music in the car why are you doing this he said the record is clean I have credit so look what the good deeds do to you they make you boastful and arrogant when you shave your head after you look at everyone who has hair on his head well look at this poor person he didn't make Om look at me man skin head wooo and this is a big problem so your heart is the most important thing that you should always examine you should always feel humble you should always feel submissive to Allah the almighty because all of this is a gift from Himel and this is why you always have to ask Allah to stay steadfast even if you feel like a stranger you pray to Allah to make you steadfast as the prophet used to always say oh Turners of heart turn my heart to be steadfast make my my heart steadfast because Hearts flip in a second W I've seen huh students of knowledge friends personal friends of mine now they play the guitar watch movies and smoke wall I have a friend of mine who was a good student of knowledge and used to give hbas that people from all of jida used to attend his Masjid because of his strong knowledge and his Mah presence now Subhan Allah the beard is gone the thob is he still wears th but it's too long and he listens to music and he watches uh uh movies and he is like a common person and he smokes I took him once with me he came to my Friday uh Masjid and after Masjid I took him to the graveyard chitchatting you know he's a friend he went it was August barefooted to the Grave an open grave and sat there and and stood there for 20 minutes crying his head off I couldn't accompany him because I took my slippers and went like for 5 seconds my feet got burnt I I came back and he went and stood there for 20 minutes for the remorse in his heart but he's unable to come back so always pray to Allah don't be boastful of yourself thinking that I'm in J it's just a matter of time like few months few years but I know my house it's on the right uh to the person entering Jenna inallah the second block Subhan Allah don't be so confident wah you don't know what happens before the moment of your death everything can change and you have to be careful from being in seclusion when people are strangers when they feel like strangers usually they tend to stay away from people and whenever you're away from the majority and from the people then this is when Shan creeps into you the prophet saidat Allah or the prophet said that Shan is from the individual closer to him than when they're two and he's closer to the two than he is to the three so the more you are with the community the better it is for them and for you the prophet said the strong believer who mixes with the people is far better than the M who does not mix with the people and does not tolerate their abuse and their harm and finally and I conclude with this inshallah always even if you feel like a stranger always deal with positivity now having said that you feel like a stranger and you do feel like a stranger this does not mean that you concave on yourself and look at everything with a gloomy look be optimistic and do not be pessimistic always be positive and radiate positivity because this is the way of your Prophet wasam imagine in theah mother asked the prophet Alat have you seen any day more horrible to you than the day of 70 of your companions were killed M was killed your uncle Hamza was killed so 50 minutes left okay um so did you see any horrible day more than that he said yes when I went to T to give them DA they did not accept my call not only that they ordered their children and slaves to throw me with pebbles until my feet were were bleeding I was completely uh uh uh blacked out I walked until I woke up in which is about five hours walk he he was blacked out he could not see he just walked without seeing or thinking and then the angel of the mountains came to me with jiel jiel said this is the Angel of the mountains he has a message to you and the angels of the mountain said oh Muhammad Allah ordered me to obey you if you wish I will collapse these two big mountains and I will inate all of them and I will kill all of them in t in meca and everyone with the feelings of the Prophet Alat wasam at the time being abused being cursed being uh uh uh dealt with in a very harsh and and and inhumane way any one of us would say okay but not the prophet though he felt as a stranger he radiates positivity he said no don't do that because I am hopeful and Wishful that Allah will get from their offspring people who would worship Allah alone and none with him this is positivity when people say the Army is too big as in talut and jalut with the Army this this is too much we we have no power to fight them those who radiate positivity the strangers would say no how many times Allah asael gave Victory to the few over the so many so always be positive always be confident though you feel like a stranger be confident that Allah Asel would always be with you if you abide by the Quran and the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best [Music] how can an expert contribute to enjoying good and forbiding evil in a foreign where is the brother I don't I didn't see the microphone okay uh okay U an expert is like any other you're not a second degree uh human being you're a Muslim and Allah ordered a Muslim whenever he sees a vice to change it whoever sees a vice or something evil he should change it with his hand so what to do if you see something in the street you go clobbering and and beating the hell out of them no this is to Those whom you have authority over so a father can change with his hand if he sees something wrong with his son his son smokes he takes the packet from him with his hand and crushes it and throws it in the dust pin he sees his wife wanting to go out without hijab he prevents her no either dress properly or don't leave this is his authority he's in a company and he has subordinates he orders them to do things that are good whether he's local or exper this is his authority if you cannot the says then with your tongue meaning by rhetoric not to take your tongue away and bang bang unless you're a giraffe maybe it's too long but no usually it's rhetoric this is what is meant so you see one of the locals Kuwaiti Saudi who's not praying come with me to let's pray for may Allah increase Us in number he give us a reward with a smile maybe he would not answer you today tomorrow next week next next month he will but if you come and pass by and look at him we have a a word in Arabic it's called sh sh meaning you look from top to bottom and bottom to top with resentment and you walk nothing will change on the contrary he will hate you and hate all those who look like you if you're unable to change it by rhetoric then change it by your heart and this is when you fear that there will be harm on you so you come to someone whose eyes are red and he has a bottle of tequila in front of him half empty and he's drunk and he has a six uh bullet revolver and he's playing like this and he's Trier happy and you see come and pray with us and you know he's going to put a bullet between your eyes say no Habibi don't don't speak just enforce uh uh virtue and pre uh prevent evil with your heart don't say anything and just leave so these categories fit locals experts everyone but we have to be positive when we make obstacles and said no no no don't talk to them they will extradite you they will put you in jail where do you think you live in a jungle we have laws alhamdulillah here in this country in Saudi we have laws there are regulations no one can do this to you don't think that everybody is a royal family he can just do whatever they want to do to fear Allah be diplomatic be wise in how you treat and deal with people with a big smile and things will happen inshallah the way that you want there's a question in aric it says the person buys a piece of land with intention of the investment so how should the person pay the zakat either to pay the zakat with the the the whole amount of the of the land while selling it or every year okay yeah now do I answer in Arabic or English will he understand huh okay he understand English okay the answer is when you buy a plot or you buy shares in a company or you buy shares in a building that is built and then to be re uh uh resold again and again this is revolving investment meaning that this is something to be uh uh bought and uh sold therefore you have to evaluate it every single year and give 2.5% on the current price so if I bought a plot with the aim of selling it every single year after the day of purchasing it I have to see how much is it I bought it for 10,000 din now it is 5,000 din prices have gone down I give zakat on the 5,000 it went to 100,000 I give zakat to 100,000 and so on but if I bought it with a mixed intention and Allah only knows your intention because I know half of us will change the intention now alhamdulillah no zakat no Allah knows your intention don't play around huh if if you bought it and said it's a good plot it's on two streets and a big possibility that in 10 years time I'm going to build on it a house maybe for Me Maybe for my children and maybe I'm going to sell it well I don't know if this is the case then there is no zakat on it and Allah knows best there's a question can we take Knowledge from a person who have once said that if ibraim had been or question if Omar not IIM yeah this a wrong question he me he meant Omar yes okay has been asked an question they had not been able to answer that moreover who has publicly announced a famous preacher between the brackets famous for preaching for using fabricated narrations to be his hero and had a snap with him and posted on Facebook okay these are two well-known is different than each other and this is the problem we have either we only take from someone who has nothing wrong and this is not possible except to the prophet or we cross over every single and Scholar on Earth and this is also not wrong wisdom is to be looked and sought after wherever it is however it depends on the individual if someone has a high level of knowledge and is capable of cross-examining whatever I say on the Quran and the Sunnah and said Noam said this and this this is wrong I can tell because the Quran says this the Sunnah says that she bin says this says that in this case it's okay for you to listen to someone like me because you have the ability to segregate but if someone who is completely blank maybe he's an engineer maybe he's a doctor he's good in his profession but he has zero knowledge in Islamic knowledge in this case I was I would advise him not to listen to such a person fearing that he may say something wrong and he and you would embrace it as long as there are much or many mallah D students of knowledge Scholars who who are not in the shade not in the gray they're crystal clear you know that they're clean and they're knowledge is pure they have faults and mistakes everybody has faults and mistakes but when the amount of mistakes are so huge and many and they have deviated from the way of the Prophet Alam and made their own way an own style I would ask you not to now there are diis that people keep keep on slandering and say this di is not good this di is this this di is that he is camouflaging himself he is pretending to be salafi but he's DUI he's this he's Subhan Allah do you have any proof show me show me something that this said which is wrong and I'm able to be with you no no you don't he he always hides it so if he hides it how do you know Usama may Allah be pleased with him was fighting with a cafir who killed so many Muslims in the battlefield and as he was having this duel with him when the cafir was cornered he said we're in the battle huh we're fighting he just killed like 1020 Muslims so us killed him when he told the Prophet thisam The Prophet was angered he said you killed him after he said ill he said oh prophet of Allah he said said this to protect himself the prophet said did you open his heart okay this di who's pretending to be salafi to pretending to be Sunni did you open his heart if you are just giving false accusation like this W you have nothing to do with salaf you have nothing to do with proper Islam you're B biting this person and you will face him on the day of judgment and he will take as much as he wants from your good deeds but if there is something that is concrete and we we can pinpoint and say now this is wrong this is bad we give an advice don't do this apologize ask Allah for forgiveness but we do not cross him out just because of a mistake or two and Allah knows best one more question from the same person that what about taking Knowledge from a person who does not disclose his Mage ah we have to put him under the microscope and put him into acid and call CSI to investigate the crime scene what how what what is your manh this issue of manage is killing me yeah where is it in the Quran or in the Sunnah the manh where is it manh is something new what we know is and this is why B when asked about the man he said man and are the same now we have new trends said no yes he's he's good he knows he's ontain me good but this is not the manage what is the manage ah the manage if you don't follow my if you don't follow if you don't follow Tom Dick or Harry of my cult then you are an innovator Subhan Allah this is not manh I don't know what do you call this we call for Quran and Sunnah by the understanding of the salaf we have the righteous and knowledgeable Scholars of Islam Alani who we to take pure Knowledge from why should we follow anyone else and even these great Scholars are not infallible they make mistakes and they admit themselves that they make mistakes so we respect them and we love them but we follow only what coincides with the Quran and the Sunnah as for someone concealing his man you should revise yourself because if you keep on looking at people that H his manage is not so and so you know yesterday we spoke about Abu Rashid and Abu go back to the tape then definitely you are Abu all the people on Earth are wrong except me this is why the issue of manhaj should not be separate from is the man if his a is good he knows everything about our Dean Quran and Sunnah and everything is according to the book why is manhaj coming all of a sudden to segregate and differentiate and Allah knows best we are running off out of time so inah I'm just taking few question only or maybe one question according to the answer of the question says here is there wasil of prophet sallu Al wasallam when we pray because I have heard people say that it is sh to give the was now the issue of wasil is misinterpreted by a lot of the people now there is wasil that we seek for our Prophet Alat and he told us that it is a special place and a special privilege given to Allah only to one human being and this is the prophet so the prophet said whenever you hear the aan repeat behind him and offer salutation to me and ask Allah Asel for me give it to him what so it's a level now what the the the the questioner is asking about is probably if I understand it correctly not the he's asking about which is seeking intercession through the prophet so can we in our prayer say oh Allah through the prophet forgive me or through the prophet Alam uh uh pay off my debts or let me enter Jenna this is B not shik but if you address the prophet himself oh prophet of Allah ask Allah to do this for me this is shik therefore if you go to ask Allah by the by The Prestige by the position of the prophet of Allah this is B when you say oh Allah I ask you in accordance to the J of the Prophet or the level or the position or the high ranking of the Prophet that you do this and that for me this is B but if you ask the prophet directly or any peer or any dead person then this is totally sh and Allah Knows Best one last question inallah that what is the difference between sending Salam to prophet wasallam and sending Salah on Prophet this is but is to offer salutation and praise to the prophet therefore usually they translate by saying peace and blessing so they make a Salat to be blessing I personally translate it differently I say peace and praise be upon the prophet because this is the actual Salat when you say Allah now we know that Salat is prayer so does Allah pray on the prophet so many times I get questions that the first one who offered funeral prayer to the prophet was Allah and I said where are they bringing this nonsense from this is completely baseless Allah offers Salat funeral what is this crazy stuff okay what do you mean by Allah meaning oh Allah praise your servant and messenger Muhammad Alam and the Salat from Allah to his servants meaning that Allah uplifts and raises their status and he mentions them in in the angels that are in Allah's cord so this is the difference between Salam which is giving Salam and the Salat and Allah knows best actually I have I have three question and I feel bad that if we don't take them but in Wonder Quest that you answer super fast you have to go to the Ferrari IM um insh you have to be ferari IM for so one question here in what is the best way to okay one one thing here she if you can just uh advise us those who send the message send the email write Salam and then continue their email or something like that is it is it okay to say Salam only and start their conversation because it says Salam yeah you don't want me to elaborate yes it is it is permissible this is the most minimum way of saying Salam so the minimum usually Isam allum but if someone says Salam this is also acceptable but not recommended what is the best way to start da to non-muslim at at your workplace Christian for example this needs a lecture and you want me to make it short the best way of Da to Muslims and non-muslims is to be a Muslim W if we practice Islam according to the Quran and Sunnah we would have no problems with non-muslims we would have no problems with Muslims we would not have problems with our own families in the house but when I smile to my friend Muhammad and how are you and he loves me I love him and the minute I go to the house and enter the H my wife says hello my my husband how are you fine where's food and this is the way is this Islamic is this the way the Prophet used to to treat his wife then you have a problem if you want to give da walk to talk whatever the prophet does you have to do it yesterday I was with Muhammad and a brother came with us who did not speak Arabic and we were talking in a subject and the guy came into the the car and it was interesting he's an Arab and I'm an Arab but we had to stop because the brother does not know Arabic and the prophet said it is not permissible for two to speak in secrecy with the presence of a third except with his uh permission so once you do this a non-muslim would be shocked and astonished wow your religion says this and he would be impressed point one and on and on and on when he when he sees this he knows that your religion is the religion of Allah but when he sees you cheating lying backbiting uh swearing not attending on time and leaving before time then he would say this is a lousy religion please tell us about ruling on using MB or beads for long story short it is permissible but not recommended it was done by some of the companions but the prophet told us that making Vick on your fingers they will witness and testify on the day of judgment for you so this is best but if you make it to make uh uh to count your T there's no problem the problem is when our brothers from Arabia do it to show off so our things no this is not the a proper way of doing it and Allah knows best last question inshallah we all Muslims try to synchronize our day as per the Islamic rituals and practices at work home and daily activities it will help us if sheim can share how his 24 hours are occup and starting to the end of each day if I tell you I have to kill you um I don't think this would I'm a very normal person I used to work in companies as an executive I used to be a director of human resources and I used to be a manager of Public Relation uh Department of a company that has 18 countries and I was was overlooking that alhamdulillah and then I felt lazy so I left all the 9 to5 job and now I do little things you know teach in University give courses um audit companies every now and then yeah I get some much few money that lasts me for a few months and then I start to work again I am not very punctual but I try my level best to utilize my time in accordance to the balance and this is the most efficient and important in our lives if you manage to balance your life you're the happiest person on Earth by balancing is the Hadith of abdah and the of Sal gave his advice to Abu D may Allah be pleased with him and the prophet gave his advice to abdah they all shared the same advice your lord has rights over you your spouse has rights over you your body has rights over you your your guest has rights over you so give each one its due right if you manage your social life balanced with your marital life and family with your physical health with your worship and rituals you're the happiest person on Earth I try my level best to do this I um have to work out five times a week in the gym between an hour and a half and 2 hours um I stay in my H my home almost 22 hours a day I don't leave unless I have to go to pray yeah I'm like a woman sitting always in the but I'm always on my a small shaan I'm always on my iPad so I answer approximately 250 questions a day that comes to my website plus the phone calls plus the TV programs which is not a burden it's fun when I go to mumbay for a whole month in a fstar hotel recording with students and this is what I love to do it's fun when I come here to Kuwait it's it is fun meeting new people and mashallah enjoying my time staying away from my family then I go back to them I have to go back to them I have to live the whole vicious cycle again so if you manage this and you're able to connect to your kinship by phone by sending them emails by visiting them social life in the Masjid people come to you and ask you and stalk you for 2 three hours and you feel like Allah has blessed you with with something I don't have to work on an office I get people coming to me and asking me and I answer them and I enjoy answer answering them I enjoy sitting with them and this is a blessing of Allah so this is my routine it's very boring it's very dull people are differ from one person to the other now she Muhammad has a good mashallah routine in giving Daw to non-muslims I can't do that I'm not the type of going and sitting with someone for 5 hours trying to smile and no you have a question I'll I'll clarify it for you you have a doubt I'll fix it no you will not leave the room until I convince you but don't tell me take him and have uh some some busac and chba I don't have time for him I just want to go man do something every person is different than the other and this is Allah's creation look at your fingers they're not alike one small little finger without it you cannot even drink coffee without this so each and every one of you is important and tomorrow's lecture inshallah you can make a difference we will elaborate a little bit on that and Allah knows rest"
