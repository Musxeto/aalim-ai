  "transcript": "uh she I've been going early to the Masid to stand right behind the IM um however the family of the IM have been getting upset because they say the second IM should be sitting here and they put a Salam at there and I moved it away and I made Salah because I know there's space at the beginning of Salah for all of us to F but when they we stand in Salah they squeeze me purposely CU they like me making Salah in that position should I tell them that this is not the way of Muhammad Alam or should I just make Sal another first of all the mid is so huge you can pray anywhere however I've seen this myself there are certain brothers who come five or 10 minutes before the where the first row is fully booked the second row is booked or not that booked and they insist on wanting to pray exactly behind the Imam some of them even come to or three minutes before the of the J and the Masjid is fully packed and they keep on jumping the hurdles and Crossing people's shoulders and necks from one which is something that the prophet prohibited they don't care they keep on jumping and jumping rows from the very back till the behind the Imam and they insist on separating the people sitting there for two hours some of them for three hours they've been sitting there he insists on praying behind the Imam what I what do you want Oh I want the reward liar you don't want the reward you want people to say that you prayed in the first row if you wanted to reward you should have come three hours ago not now so there are people who are professional in squeezing themselves trying to show that the people that I came and prayed behind the Imam when they're late comers there's no praising for them I'm not saying yes that you're one of them but I'm just you know giving you a head up heads up now if you come and there is a place and you know that this is reserved for the deputy Imam just in case something happens to the Imam he has to uh deputize someone else to pray and you insist on praying there why doesn't make any sense you say it's a Sunnah I'd like to be in the first row next to the IM okay that's a Sunnah what about cleaning your heart and being being a brother to the other worshippers this is mandatory so when you insist on achieving a Sunnah on the account of something that's mandatory and you're causing friction and hatred and grudges and enmity in the Masjid there's something wrong up there you have to rectify and Allah Knows Best"
