  "transcript": "how does one pray or the eclipse prayer the eclipse prayer is an unique prayer that is formed of two like f but instead of having two R and four prostrations it has four R and four prostrations so each unit you bow you read the F and the Surah and you bow and then you rise from bowing and you recite the faat and the Surah again and then you bow and then you rise up and then you make your two sujud and then you start for the stand up for the second unit and do the same so it's a unique format for a prayer there's nothing similar to it at all in Islam and it is Sunnah to remind the people for the Imam to come after the prayer is over and to remind people about Allah and to uh uh throw the fear of Allah in their hearts and to advise them to give charity and Allah Knows Best"
