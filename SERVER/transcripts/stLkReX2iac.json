  "transcript": "um if my uncle comes over to my house and my mother and him they like free miix um I just and they in the living room and I sit upstairs um in my room but they're like all alone but I can still like hear them like their conversations so like what should I do in that situation now I'm assuming that this is your mother's house is it correct maram okay maybe you've lost Maria yeah it's my mom's house so it's your mom's house you have no control on who comes in and who does not therefore you have one of two choices either to go to your room and let them be to their seclusion to say and do whatever they want or to be with them them to break the seclusion and to minimize the sin and the Haram and I would highly recommend the latter because this would prevent your mom from falling into sin without knowing or with knowing uh and Allah Knows Best"
