  "title": "Can a teacher who teaches Quran beat or reprimand children? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from bangladesh he's asking a question about the ruling of madrasa which means school in arabic so they have this school that teaches the children how to memorize the quran and it is noticeable that many of the teachers beat the children as a form of reprimanding them when they don't memorize or do their homeworks and this usually leads to people fleeing the circles of memorizing the quran altogether and not being interested so he says is this permissible not okay we cannot answer such a question because every community has its laws and regulations every country has its laws and regulations for so for example if you do this in europe or in the west they would consider this to be child abuse and it's a felony it's a crime regardless of the reason this is why they don't have this notion of reprimanding children physically which is part of a religion in some aspects so the prophet him said himself as some said when the children are seven instruct them to pray and when their ten beat them so that they would pray meaning that three years of each and every day five times pray pray pray without reprimanding but after three years if the child continues not to pray then islam orders the parent the father to beat his child to reprimand him not to abuse him or to injure him or to inflict damage physically to him so this is part of a religion but if in these kafir countries you're not allowed to do this you have to refrain or migrate because they'll take your child and give it to a christian or an atheist family and you may never see your child back again this is too extreme that's why we have drug uh junkies addictions there children fleeing their homes when they're 15 or 16 girls running away and staying for a couple of weeks with whomever they have no control and when she comes back pregnant they have no control and hands off they can't do anything on the other side you have some muslim countries or non-muslim countries where the children are considered to be a doormat you can step on them you can clean your shoes on them you can throw them away no problem so they are abused and they are tortured and they are forced into labor when they are children and this is not part of islam so islam is the middle path it tells you you are entitled to reprimand your child or the children under your custody so if the teacher is someone of knowledge and someone who is a father himself and someone who does not beat the children to vent his oppressed emotions or anger or fits of rage rather he does what is considered to be nothing compared to what's happening and with the aim to bring the child back to quran circles so that he would learn and benefit himself and benefit the ummah there is a big difference so it depends on the culture on the community on the laws of the country and it depends on the teacher himself is it trustworthy or is he just a control freak who whenever the child looks left he slaps him no i would slap this teacher because he's not fit to teach i need someone to teach my child to be knowledgeable to be tolerant to be a fatherly figure and i trust him when whatever he does with my child this is why when i went to school in elementary school my father used to say to the teachers you take the meat and bring me back the bones meaning that i you do whatever you want i just want a man and all of our generation grew up to be men not afraid of the teachers but respecting them because we had the best of teachers who taught us how to be men though they used to beat us every now and then those who would make mistakes but nevertheless they had a good intention and we were good recipients to whatever good they had given us nowadays it's a different story and i hope this answers your question you"
