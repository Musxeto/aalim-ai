  "title": "Are 4 rakahs before Asr & 4 before isha emphatic sunnah prayers, are they authentic? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sheikh we know that there are four raka sunnah prayer before us i would like to know if there is any for akashin affair before isha as well okay as for the four raka this is not an emphatic sunnah this is not a highly recommended sunnah rather this is a non-emphatic meaning that the prophet did not allah observe them regularly so the emphatic sunnah are 12 raka's per the day and night two before fajr four before the two after the two after maghrib and two after asia these are twelves so the four raka before asar these are none emphatic meaning if you do them it's good for you if you don't there's no problem because they're not highly recommended but you can do them as for the four raka's before isha prayer this is something that is an issue of dispute there is no authentic hadith attributed to the prophet alaihissalatus to prove it so a lot of the scholars say that in this case we refrain we're not going to accept it we're not going to do it or perform it however there are narrations that some of the companions used to affirm it and do it and there are narrations stating that these are similar to a praying night prayer on the night of decree little but again these are not authentic and there are no authentic hadith to the prophet but because some of the companions there are narrations that state that they have done it so they said that okay this means that we can do it so it's an issue of dispute whether to do it or not to do it i am personally inclined not to do it because as long as there is no authentic hadith from the prophet himself as islam i don't see any reason to do it okay what about the companions may allah be pleased with them all of them are on the top of my head with their soul of their feet without any doubt but it's up to you if you feel like doing it i wouldn't say that you're doing an innovation because the companions had done it and if you decide to leave it i wouldn't say that you're wrong because the prophet did not do it nor there is an authentic hadith of him doing it uh"
