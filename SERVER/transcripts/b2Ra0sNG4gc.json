  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 23 (How did Prophet ﷺ‎ deal with Sinners? 1) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the prophet amali coleman a vir host we are continuing to look at how the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him interacted with the people around him today a group of people that were focused on it we should sympathize with sinners are to open this up for us explain expound on our subject visiting us from Saudi Arabia Shaykh awesome al Hakim assalamualaikum waalaikumsalam our hunt Allah thank you so much first question obviously define for us Islamic Lee who is a sinner how does that differ from these other terms we were talking about catheters and mushriks and munafiq wounds and when we talk about sinners who exactly we talk about some lateral - Rahim in hundred on salat wa salam o allah rasool allah he were early hero sabi woman am i by the categories that you've mentioned which is kafir mushrik or munafa when africa's a hypocrite yes who embeds disbelief and shows Islam mm-hmm so actually is not a real Muslim he is like a spy he is a double-faced agent who claims to be a Muslim but he's actually waiting and anticipating the right moment to stab you in the back and to to destroy Islam if he's capable of doing now shirk ko4 and the fact we have major and minor but this is not the time to go in detail the major takes a person out of the fold of Islam the minor is serious and grave offense but the person doing it remains to be a Muslim because it's minor it's not even fledged if I'm drinking alcohol and having girlfriends then but I'm still a Muslim this has nothing to do with ko4 or sheikh or hypocrisy in fact minor these are below the line of minor the things you're talking about our sins and it is the fate of every human being to be sinful because nobody's perfect right and the Prophet said Nadia salatu salam every son of adam is sinful hmm and the best of sinful are those who repent so sin is inevitable yet there are minor sins there are major sins and people vary and differ from one another according to their Eman so when a small sin is committed by someone who is already weakened his Eman someone who's not practicing is not like the same sin being committed by a scholar or an imam though it's the same offense yet the knowledge that this person possesses far exceeds the knowledge of that person so his sin is graver and more CD's I want to ask you about a specific example just to clarify let's say I'm a I'm a business person and you know I've got I've enjoyed great success and but I have this problem of cheating mm-hmm maybe it's with taxes to the government maybe it's cheating my customers and it happens once my thinking is okay maybe I got weak there was a vote I was a temptation and I fell prey to it but I correct but if I'm doing as a matter of habit year after year decade after decade is that a sin is that a mistake or is that something else it is a sin it remains to be a sin but the seriousness of it may vary a person who does it once and then repents and asks Allah for forgiveness it's wiped off okay but a person that runs in his bloodstream and he is compulsive liar or cheater or whatever then this guy when he faces Allah without repenting he is in deep trouble okay but he's still a sinful he see the non most that you've mentioned the mushrik the kafir and the hypocrite they will be in the lower place of hellfire and that is for eternity and this is why we go out of the our way to call people to Islam see I have a cousin who's a non Muslim I don't want him to go to hell for eternity he says I don't want your Deen I don't want your little religion I'm persistent I keep on calling him because I don't care if he has a good meal today or not if he has a good body or not what I care is for eternity if he dies as a non-muslim he'll be in hell for eternity a Muslim who is sinful yeah this guy is going to do time in hell if Allah wishes it nor wills it and maybe not but inevitably he will end up in paradise after he does his time and he spends Allah knows how long in Hellfire and this is not an easy thing right is it to to have or to to do so these are the differences between sinful and and and Zoey so when we say sinful what's the Arabic word for it this there is our thought iris art okay and there's Mosley Boone who's new Boone all right so our discussion about these to move the ribbon and mostly board mutiny Boone yes okay like you said you know all of us who are honest with ourselves know that we're not perfect and we make mistakes and if we allow it to it can be very humbling it can help us to better understand ourselves better understand human nature which means other human beings so this is something important for us to incorporate into our lives how to manage the sin making process in ourselves my question is about recommendations that that we see from the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him dealing with people who made mistakes who committed sins what was his advice to them guidance okay first of all the topic is long yeah but you can look at it from different angles mm-hmm one angle would be that there is ZERO tolerance when it comes to sins in the sense that the Prophet Allah so Sam would not turn his face or head and look the other way wherever there is a sin committed in front of him he has to forbid it and this is how the thing is with us you either forbid it or leave but sitting with someone who is smoking who is slandering others backbiting others who's watching Haram stuff in your presence mm-hmm while you're affected by Aydin this is not something that you should tolerate you either tell him a few this is Haram you have to stop or if he doesn't listen to you you leave his presence now look at an issue that took place between the co wives of the Prophet SM the mothers of the believers mhm issues of jealousy is the norm people are used to having jealousy between the co wives once the Prophet era saw Sam was with his beloved wife Aisha and Aisha she was mentioning Sophia the Jew who became Muslim and married the prophet of Salaam who was a beautiful woman so I I wanted to be little Sophia so that the Prophet SM would only recognize Aisha's beauty so she said o our prophet of Allah it is sufficient for you to know that Sophia is like this and she pointed with her hand as if she is short and Sophia was short hmm and beautiful things come in small packages the Prophet did not let it go you know any husband would say okay she is jealous the profit stopped her because this is a sin she's backbiting Sofia though she's truly short but this is backbiting if Sofia were to hear of it she would become upset what did the Prophet say Alison of Sir he explained to her the gravity of what she had just said he said to her you have uttered a word that if it were to be mixed with the water of the ocean it would have spoiled it hmm one single word mm-hmm and it wasn't a word she didn't even say short she just motioning with her hands yeah that's it yet the Prophet Allah saw some stopped her there and brought it to her attention that what she what she had done was not something to be accepted yeah okay that's a good that's a good example and earlier you also mentioned about being around people allowing ourselves to be in certain environments being in control of the quality of the environment around us whether it's we see the discussions around us by extension I would even add what we eat what if it's a friend someone I love it can be a delicate thing you know maybe initially they want to hide it whatever it is they maybe they've picked up a new bad habit so the question is what to do what to do when I'm in a relationship with someone a close friendship a brother cousin whatever and we meet up and then I see something happening he's changing he's moving with a different crowd now and he's starting to pick up these so the question is what how what to respond how to how to respond and I'm sure it depends on what it is that we're talking about correct and the extent to which he's gotten himself into it guidelines on that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam worked hard in concealing the sins of individuals all right he promoted this and he called for it to the extent that there are a number of incidents where the Prophet alakazam would give a general advice that Muslims understand from it that one of them is addressed by this but the Prophet does not give the name mm-hmm and why is that because Islam is not about exposing people mm-hmm tarnishing the reputation we all make sense we all fall a week and may do these things so the Prophet is highlighting alehsalaam the fact that this is sinful this is wrong and whoever had done this must not do it again or else example even a lot be he's a companion he was working for the prophet Isaiah the prophet used to send them to different villages and towns to collect the zakat I'm sorry Shaykh they're telling me it's time for a break okay can you continue this narration of the story in sha sha la after our break we'll continue our discussion assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with a profit we're continuing with check awesome and our discussion about sinners Sheikh I'm sorry to interrupt you we have been talking about the advice that the Prophet gives us peace be upon him when we're around people close to us that we know our sinning they've made a decision to sin and he's encouraging us peacefully to conceal to cover their mistakes and you were elaborating or sharing conveying a story about bribery yes see even in Libya was a man sent by the Prophet Isilon to collect the zakat from farms from cattle etc mm-hmm so the guy came once back to Medina and he said to the Prophet as salam this is your zakat and this portion was given to me as a gift now you have to understand that people give you a gift in order for you to be al bit lenient when you collected zakat so instead of getting a hundred percent you get ninety five percent instead of getting the best of crops or of cattle you take something that is medium or medium even rare hmm so the Prophet was angered by this a day saw at her son and he went up the pulpit and he said why is it when I sent people to collect there's a cat he didn't give any names hmm so and so people come back and say this is yours and this was given to me wouldn't it be better for them to sit in their mother's homes and look do people give them any gifts or not so the Prophet is telling this person indirectly and telling his Ummah directly that a bribe is what is given to you in accordance to your position mm-hmm okay if you did not assume this official position if you were just a normal person sitting in your parents house nobody would give you anything they didn't give you this money this pen this laptop this beautiful watch except because you are assuming a position of responsibility yes and you may you know have opportunity to help benefit yeah mm-hm and cut a few of the sides here and there for them and and give them some slack or whatever so here the Prophet did not expose him also when three of his companions went around his houses asking about his worship and the mothers of the believers told them they belittled the amount of worship that the Prophet used to offer as a sermon and they justified this because Allah has forgiven his previous and coming sins so one of them said I will never marry women the other said I will fast and never break my fast and the third one said I will pray all night long the Prophet again went to the pulpit addressed the people and said why do people say so and so and so and he didn't name them and he was angered by it he said I pray and sleep I marry women and I fast and I break my fast whoever chooses a soon other than mine whoever chooses away other than mine then it is rejected he's not from us and there are so many stories similar to this which highlights the fact that sinners are there but why expose them if I have a neighbor who brings a bottle of scotch every single night and drinks until he's wasted but no one knows about it mm-hmm would it be the right thing for me to go to the Masjid and say hey people my neighbor so-and-so drinks and does this and that this is totally prohibited and I'm sinful big time as long as the man has concealed his sin it's between him and Allah soldier I'll give him a word of advice or even two if he doesn't comply this is his problem I'm not going to get into it this is different from a purse who deals in scotch or or tequila or openly yeah or even not openly if he harms the community if he's a drug dealer nobody knows about him the the authorities would have arrested them if they had no known about it but he's doing it it's secret yet he's harming the society all right this case yes I have to expose him this because this guy is corrupting the community in harming the Muslims ah so you just given us a important demarcation a line here if someone's doing is committing a sin adopting a sinful lifestyle and it only impacts them correct and they hide it is different from if it's impacting other people or if he is exposing it publicly and he doesn't have any shame mm-hmm mm-hmm okay children I mean if he's doing it in his home in the privacy of his home there's only so much he can hide it from the kids you know the nature of kids they're gonna find out everything's going on in the house and where everything is they know it so there's only so much that he can hide if so much sin that he can hide at home from the kids and so now does that change it does it become one of those issues where I have to warn the public I mean what do I do in that case that's this is something domestic so it's between the father and his children as long as he's not abusing them as not as long as he's not harming them I'll give him an advice but if it's not affecting them no this is still within the walls of the home okay a little different a little different because it's inside his home all right so in terms of this subject of committing sins being sinful in the and whether to make them public or not what about those who have overcome sinful ways in the past problem with them talking about you know I used to used to be an assassin I used to kill people by the by the dozens but I've reformed my ways and you know now I'm a good Muslim talking about that is that is that Oh any problem with that the Prophet told us Ali is so awesome that all of my Ummah are forgiven meaning their sins will be forgiven except those who make it public if you expose what Allah has concealed then Allah will hold you accountable for it if you smoked a joint when you were young hmm and Allah Azza WA JAL guided you and you come and talk to people yeah yeah I did pot I smoke but I did not inhale like Clinton said so this you are exposing your sin there is no justification I see for even if we're trying to give an example yeah yeah and try to relate to people I'm human too there's only so much that we can this is not permissible because even if there might be some significance and benefit from it the harm is far greater the easiest thing to do is for them to come after 3-4 weeks and when you tell them don't do this today you've been in the same boat you've done that when you lead the prayer in a message people come say hey this guy said to my friend that he used to do this and this is right they will not it tarnishes a person's reputation and the benefits are probably not for certain and therefore the best thing is not to disclose the many clients you've killed as an assassin just keep it under wraps okay keep muscala skeletons in my closet so this brings up the issue again of the hypocrite early in introduction for the sinners we talked about the different types of sinners among those with the hypocrites my understanding growing up in the States and the church hypocrite had a slightly different connotation it meant someone who was pretending to be it didn't have this politically charged definition someone was pretending to be righteous and pious really there you know club hopping club hoppers is there a does this also exist in the Islamic understanding of hypocrite or is it principally about those who are infiltrating pretending to be Muslims for the purpose of destruction in Islam I judge you by your actions not but what but by what I do not see I don't know what you do in your home oh I see is that you're righteous you're Muslim you pray with me you're a Muslim so it is not my responsibility as a Muslim to dig deep into your soul and find your reality this is something only Allah Allah has the ability to do so yeah to answer a question no okay you I take you for your face value for what you are what is done without my knowledge this is something that only Allah would hold you accountable some even use this as a reason or justification for rejecting the call of Islam you know all those people just hypocrites they don't really do what they say they do and they're human beings after all and so on and so forth this is wrong because nobody's perfect now being weak in something that is Haram doesn't just define me to come in public and say listen I'm coming out of the closet like they say about gays mmm this is ridiculous you are tested with with something keep it hidden conceal it I have weakness to smoking I don't do it in the public so that I would not be rendered as a hypocrite I do it in private with remorse with fearing Allah and hoping that Allah would guide me one day to kick the habit but to go and claim that if you don't show people your sins and your weak points then you're a hypocrite this is definitely not yeah yeah okay got it got a very big difference from what I was raised with in the Protestant church that I mean after all is LOM is saying based on what you're telling me and understanding we're all human beings and where we make mistakes and the focus should be elsewhere correct and let Allah keep his job thank you so much that will conclude our episode for today we're out of time we would like to come back to continue in sha la with some other aspects of dealing with sinners if with your permission inshallah okay thank you again and that concludes our episode for today we hope to come back to continue with our discussion about sinners inshallah until then assalamu alaikum"
