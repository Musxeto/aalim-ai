  "title": "Mufti said sleeping in same room in different beds is haram even if it is mother & son Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "he says there is a mufti who says that sleeping in the same room in different beds is prohibited even if a mother and her son i don't comment on other people's fatwas there are thousands and millions of fat words and not necessarily all of what idahi says is authentic so why would we care oh the day says that there is a hadith it's any any person from the street if you call him he would understand that this is referring to nan mahram's i gave you the example of a man and his wife so if they both sleep on different beds in the same room he's a man and she and he and she's a woman but they're married is that haram a man sleeping with his mother in the same room different beds no one in his right mind would say that this is haram or this applies for the hadith so move on i am shocked and astonished by people insisting on a particular fatwa so-and-so said so and so what do you think who cares what i think go back to the quran the sunnah it's not what i think that determines it yes or no no it is the quran and the sunnah so don't depend on what i say others say sheikh you said in an ask zad episode so and so and so but sheikh so-and-so goes against what you say sumi what do you want me to do this is his opinion this is my opinion yes if i discover that my opinion is wrong i come and say that i was wrong so what i make mistakes i would not insist on making a mistake till i meet allah azza then i'll be punished for that but move on it's not what sheikh so and so said you're wrong so and so said this is deviant who cares go by the quran the sunnah not by what say what people say you have logic you have a brain so try to work it out every now and then"
