  "title": "Hadith: Wearing pants below ankles without pride or arrogance VS with pride assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and the other does this include what is what is supposed to be I don't understand the concept I will answer so brother is asking about two hadiths and and he thinks that there is a form of contradiction that he cannot understand so he would like a clarification well there is no contradiction with the grace of Allah one Hadith refers to someone who lowers His Garment below the ankles without any feeling of arrogance or pride and the other Hadith is regarding someone who does this with pride and arrogance and the punish punishment is different the punishment in someone who does it without any Pride or arrogance rather out of laziness is the prophet said whatever goes below the ankle is punished in Hellfire so the whole body is not in Hell rather only this two or three CM below the ankle would be tormented in hell and we know that the least of people being punished in Hellfire is a person and he's Abu Talib the uncle of the Prophet Alam is a person who a stone of fire is placed in his sandals from its heat his brain boils so you can imagine if this is the minimum punishment and torment what would happen to our friend who lowered His Garment below the ankles without any Pride the other Hadith States for punishment Allah doesn't speak to them Allah doesn't purify them Allah does does not look at them and they have severe torment and Punishment in Hellfire and who are those Al the one who lowers His Garment so the scholar said oh because of the difference of punishment this is regarding something extra than the other one which is pride and arrogance that's why in another Hadith while a man was dragging his garments in arrogance and pride Allah made him fall in the seventh Earth uh um to health fire or as the prophet said and I hope this clarifies the contradiction"
