  "transcript": "Romar says is it permissible to eat food which some Muslims distribute on their innovative events such as mullet Muharram or an how how knee or who Hani and Abner huddle Jelani birthday or anniversary or demise day or whatever et cetera the answer is as follows the events themselves are prohibited melded of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is a clear innovation that was originated in Egypt on the 4th year of hijra by the obd-ii no Fatima in who were a deviant sect wanting to celebrate the death of the Prophet as I am rather than his birthday the Muharram is celebrated by the Shia for the death of Al Hussein may Allah be pleased with him the harder age Iran it definitely is not an occasion to celebrate whether his birthday or his death and it's only done by the super Sufis now coming back celebrating is Haram what about the food if you're not with them if you're not sitting and celebrating with them and you get the food from them they send it to your home so I'm in my home they knocked the door they gave me a plate of biryani if it is vegetarian food no problem consume it it's hella you're not celebrating and it's a gift to you Halas no problem what about if it has meat in it well if it was slaughtered to other than allah azza wajal then the meat is Haram it's dead but 99% of these things are halal they're slaughtered Allah those who celebrate mullet they're not all mushrik they believe in Allah so gel but they have innovation they have been ah but if I know that they believe that the Prophet as system is however another that he's controlling the universe though he's dead and they believe that he's not dead and he's controlling the universe and he looks and is present in every household and everywhere and he can hear us call him and he can bring us benefit and prevent harm from coming our way and he knows the unseen whoever believes in this is out of the fold of Islam even if he had a longer beard than mine he has no relation to Islam because he committed the cardinal sin the most major sin in Islam which is shirk to believe as such in the Prophet s son and that he is created from Allah's light subhanAllah how is this all of this is nonsense you cannot accept the slaughtering of such people but if they are normal people with innovations and they are on the al-qaeda on the Tajin your acceptance is permissible you can eat from that likewise if people send you a piece of their cake they had used to celebrate their birthdays or anniversaries no problem in eating it as long as the ingredients are halal insha'Allah"
