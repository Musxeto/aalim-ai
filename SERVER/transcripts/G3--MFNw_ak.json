  "title": "Can I delay getting up from sujood to make dua while praying behind the imam? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so um if I'm doing Jama prayer on the last I usually make Dua for a long amount of time but if the IM already live his head should I call my Dua or can I just keep continue pray my my Dua you must you must cut your Dua and follow the IM it is not permissible to be late than the Imam and the IM the the follower has four types of following the Imam either he coincides with the Imam and follows the Imam meaning when the IM make rur he makes rur when the IM Rises up he rises up no delay number two he Co who he coincides and imitates the IM so as soon as the IM says he does with it he rises with him and this is wrong he should wait until he reaches the standing position he should wait until he puts his forehead on the ground before he bends his back the third is to be ahead of his Imam so as the Imam goes for Ru and says Allah and the guy is already in sujud before the Imam this nullifies his prayer if done intentionally and number four is to delay so the Imam Rises up from sujud allahar and the guy is still doing Dua just until the Imam is going to go for the second suud he raises up and follows them this is also not permissible"
