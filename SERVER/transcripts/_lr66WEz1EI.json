  "transcript": "sh um by circumstances I after work in the Friday prayer I attend a Masjid and later I realized that unfortunately on the wall they have written do not say a mean out loud and they they IM of the kba doesn't start the kba with customary introduction of the kba and he admits thatu Al wasallam is and and Etc so after realizing this should I just move out of the mid or should I just pray if you discovered that the Imam has committed an act of shik or kufur then you cannot continue to stay there you have to leave and look for another mid to pray with the writing that do not say a mean only ignorant imiles do this so fanatic hanafis may do this but they are a shame to the hanfi school of thought the beautiful huge great hanfi thought uh school of thought with its great Scholars such imbeciles are not attributed to this school so anyone who writes this is an ignorant imbecile as if he's saying that the Hadith where the Prophet himself used to say aan out loud and the second draw behind him not the first the second draw would hear that as if they're saying that the prophet is wrong and if they do dare say such a thing they're out of the fault of Islam without any doubt and if the Imam did not start the in the normal traditional way I don't know what you're referring to what he has to say as part of theba is praising Allah alhamdulillah and the and reciting one Ayah this is a bare minimum if he doesn't do this at all doesn't praise Allah doesn't offer salutation of the Prophet Alam this is to a lot of the scholars of the schools of thought invalidates his thirdly if he says that the prophet Sall wasallam is and he controls the universe and he oversees what's happening in this world this is kufur this is blasphemy so you can't pray behind such people and Allah Knows Best"
