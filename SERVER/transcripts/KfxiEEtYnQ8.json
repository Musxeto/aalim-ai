  "transcript": "Tony says is it true that music is the instruments of Satan and that is why it is prohibited for us well this was stated by some of the scholars not only that in the hadith when the Prophet I saw some was in Ash's house on a day of eat and he was lying on his side giving his face to the wall and there were two young girls slaves singing so it's a day of read and we know that on the day of Eid and on weddings we are permitted to use the Dove and to sing and to enjoy it's a day of celebration so Abu Bakr comes into his daughter's house may Allah be pleased with them and he sees the two girls singing so he says objecting to what he sees and as a mirror Shaitaan in the presence of the Prophet Isis Aram do I see the flutes and the pipes of Satan being played there's no music by the way they were just singing and probably with the doof so the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not say o abu bakr these are not though the pipes and the instruments of Shaitaan he did not say that to him which means he's approving what he had said but he said to him leave them Abu Bakr so that people would know we have room in our religion for entertainment so from this and others some scholars said yes musical instruments are the instruments of Shaitaan because it corrupts the heart unlike what most people believe but it does and those in the West and Muslims who are already have corrupt hearts won't be able to understand this because they've never tried living without music music is addictive music transforms you from one state of mind to the other go to any gym try to do the aerobic routine without any music and then do it with the music and you will feel you will find a lot of difference the energy that people get is from Shaitaan and this is why Allah says in SIA 64 chapter 16 speaking to Shaitaan west Ephesus menaced apart I mean whom basaltic provoked whoever you can from them with your voice imam Mujahid says in the tafseer his voice is music and singing you can see people listening to soft music love song romantic songs driving down the highway doing 510 miles per hour mellow very chilling having a good time and when they listen to pop music or hard rock heavy metal you seeing them doing 120 miles per hour what what is this it's transforming them it's controlling them so it is a tool of Shaitaan let those who say that it relaxes you yeah Beethoven Mozart Bach whatever it relaxes you it's good for you when you eat dinner on candle lights and the violin is playing Arab Muslims don't believe in that because the one who created us is the one who tell told us that this is Haram so should I believe you or believe Allah as Arjun believe the Prophet Allah is salatu salam try to watch any movie without its soundtrack and with the soundtrack you find people crying weeping emotionally involved because the music the theme itself that's why you have Oscars for the soundtrack it has a huge impact on people's personality and feelings so definitely it is something that is Haram"
