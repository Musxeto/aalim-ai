  "transcript": "Abdullah Abdullah says what are the virtues of reciting ayatul kursi will we be protected from all harm if we recite it while going out of the house this is a general misconception a lot of the Muslims think that it is part of the Sunnah it is part of the protection that when you go out of your home to recite idle courtesy and this is not true it is not authentic and hence it becomes a bida an innovation something that the Prophet did not Allison do nor ordered us to do and you come nowadays and do it this is an innovation so what is the what are the virtues of ayatul kursi we know from authentic hadith that the best ayah the greatest ayah in the whole Quran is a Tenkasi and we know the best surah in the whole of the Quran is chapter number 1 Surat al-fatiha so when it comes to a specific individual ayah a verse this is ayatul kursi when it comes to a surah this is a fatiha so what are the virtues of ayatul kursi the prophet alayhi salaatu sir told us that whoever observes reciting this ayah ayatul kursi after every farts a lot we have 5 faults per day and night so if you manage to recite it after every farts a lot this guarantees you to enter paradise all what prevents you from entering paradise is dying once you die insha Allah you guarantee to enter paradise so the Prophet used to do that and encouraged us to do it as well also it is part of the morning and evening at car which if you say it bifida after fire and after Maghrib you've hit two birds with one stone also reciting it before going to bed as per the hadith of Abu Huraira may Allah be pleased with him when a devil used to steal something from the Treasury of the Muslims and he caught him three times and in the third time he told him that if you recite this ayah you will have a protector from Allah Azza WA JAL to protect you from Devils and the Prophet approved that sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam so these are the virtues of ayatul kursi would it protect us from any harm there's nothing to state that in the Quran nor in the Sunnah but it is it has magnificent magnificent impact upon Devils upon sorcerers and upon a lot of illnesses that may a person acquire and it repels evil away from you so if you recite it when you are sick and you need healing it's one of the great sources of healing from evil eye from envy from jinn possession from black magic etc it's part of the rupiah that when you do it insha Allah Azza WA JAL Allah will protect you accordingly"
