  "transcript": "my question is since I was born until now and my question is um thank you very much has created us for a purpose and he created man and women to get married so that they can reproduce and they can have compassion Mercy love among them it is not something that fits everyone it's not one size that fits all Some Women Marry early at 15 or 16 years of age and live a very happy life Some Women Marry when they're 31 or 32 and have a happy life this is not something we plan for or we work for I have 13 daughters with the grace of Allah no boys and some of my daughters got married when they were 17. and some of my daughters got married when they were 31. imagine all these years waiting waiting waiting no matter she wants to get married but nobody's coming and when she got married at 31 Allah blessed her with a good man that made her forget the past years and she has a nice child and she's happy in her life so this is not something you put an alternating okay I go to university and I'm finished when I'm 23 then I work for three years and then I do this and then I get married no this is not how it works it is in Allah's hands you get a good proposal a real man who has good good job can provide for you a separate home and he's not a Mommy's boy Bismillah but I have two years to finish college quit college college is not what Allah created you for you want Jannah get married make your husband happy you get generation and this is why I say women are very lucky why the prophet says Allah if a woman prays her father Ramadan protects her Chastity and obeys her husband she will enter Jannah only these four things women oh we have to pray in the Masjid we have to provide for our wife and children we have to obey our parents we have to connect to our kinship we have to enjoin virtue and prohibit Vice we have to say this Haram we have to mix with people we have to drive we have to do and after all of that maybe interior maybe not and after all of that I come home tired and my wife says nagging what are you doing you're enjoying yourself you're out meeting people we're meeting the all these different things doing different things and I'm here stuck between four walls with the children I'm not doing anything I'm bored I'm this is when you need your what MMA or nine millimeters so women have an easy life in their own perspective it's not easy to obey a man who's just ordering you do this don't do this controlling you it's not easy to obey a man who maybe is below me in academic degree I have a PhD he has only a bachelor's degree I'm smarter than him and more intellectual than him but Islam tells me I have to obey him it's not easy but everyone has a test so to answer your question if you get a good proposal catch it because the demand is far less than the supply what does that mean how many men are here my very much how many women are out there more than much so some women comes and says to me I don't want my husband I'm not imitating women but this is my voice yeah I don't want my husband of course he does the party with your voice who will marry you no she says I don't want my husband I'd want to divorce him I want this I want that I say listen my daughter your husband is providing for you he is providing for your children he's giving you a house you don't have to work you don't have to suffer yes he has shortcomings he has anger issues he doesn't show you compassion and love it's it happens everywhere so nothing is perfect but remember if you ask for divorce and he gives you divorce today what will happen she says I will be happy I will be comfortable I said you will be comfortable for two months only the third month he will come in knocking on my door can you call my husband and tell him to reconcile I'm sorry I was childish I should not have asked for divorce I said I warned you she says yes I know Siri but please try so I called the husband said no but I learned it from the internet so I said that he wanted to reconcile with your wife he said Sheikh are you crazy says why at the moment I divorced her I married a woman 10 years younger much more beautiful much more religious and very rich she made me forget all these years of Agony and torture I would be crazy even to remember her so I went to the sister and said sorry he has a better wife move on get a better man she said nobody is proposing those who are proposing are like you an old man over 60. they don't need a wife they need a nurse so I say to her keep your husband the demand is far less than the supply so I hope this answers your question"
