  "transcript": "can animals hear the screams from the dead when they are being punished in the grave we know that individuals are either tormented in their graves or blessed by Allah as for the animals hearing the torment and the punishment I personally don't know of any evidence supporting it the only incident we know of is that when a sinful person or a disbeliever is placed in his grave and his soul is taken to the first heaven not being admitted and then thrown back to Earth he is met with an angel and he's questioned by the two angels and then he is beaten on his head with a hammer or a sledge like that if a mountain were to be struck by it it would turn into dust and he turns into a into dust then he's turned back again to his original form and he's struck by it again and he shouts a loud scream that everyone hears other than the humans in the Jinn which means including the animals they hear this and this is certain and an authentic Hadith what happens afterwards is he punished or while he's punished and tormented can they hear this we don't have any evidence to back it up and Allah Knows Best"
