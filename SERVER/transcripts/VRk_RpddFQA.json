  "transcript": "uh a girl who is a cfer told me that she didn't understand why we Muslim girls don't go out when there is alcohol boys and lots of other Haram things she said it with judge uh with judgment and meanness so I got angry with her and I told her if I go and speak to the Catholics the Pope says I have the ultimate truth and if I go to and speak to a rabbi in if I go to a Buddhist monk and he says we have the ultimate truth everybody says and claims that we have the ultimate truth they're all biased I agree but we Muslims have the acid test we have the proofs we have the Miracles we have the logic the data the the numbers everything you you can't even if you're blind you'll see that Islam is the only and uh uh the last and the prevailing and the religion that has everything backing it up nevertheless we Muslims look at others as they are weak and vulnerable they're ignorant and we need to teach them we need to be merciful to them and this is how our Prophet was with the entire Allah says we have not sent you oh Muhammad except as a mercy for all the worlds so if you're a dentist and someone comes to you complaining of pain in his teeth you ask him or her to open her mouth and the moment you insert the matter you did not touch anything she starts to shout and complain and cry would you punch her on the nose or would you say w I did not touch you come on it's it's not going to be painful you take it easy on her because she's sick your friend or ex-friend is like that I see no problem at all in sending her a text accepting her apology but keeping your distance if you feel that she's not there to learn or she's not confused and wants someone to teach her she's just there to cast doubt in your heads just send her a text of accepting her apology and keep her distance but if you feel that she's sincere and that you have the proper knowledge to speak to her and to tell her about the logic and to show her the timeline of women and girls who went with boys and did booze 20 30 years ago uh later how do they reflect on their previous relationships and their indecency and what they've done they she'll understand if you show her some text if you can go to uh Dr Zach's websites and see the text on the prohibition of alcohol in the Bible of adultery and fornication and the likes it's in the books it's in the Old and New Testament it's in religion all over the place she may understand but if it's up to you to decide"
