  "transcript": "Zhi Shan says is it permissible for a couple who were involved in fornication to get married while the girl is pregnant what should they do if they already got married and what's the ruling on the child that was born zishe and this is a common question that people ask unfortunately marriage must not be conducted unless both parties have repented from fornication and the uterus of the woman is clear from any pregnancy this is why when two couple who had involved in fornication want to get married we tell them go repent to allah azza wajal and make sure that the woman gets one monthly cycle to ensure that she's not pregnant after that if the repentance is there we can make the marriage otherwise the marriage would be invalid and all the scholars say that if a woman is pregnant whether from the man who fornicated wither and caused her to be pregnant with which is something we don't know because she might have done that with someone else or if she is pregnant such a marriage contract would be invalid now if we have a situation where a boyfriend/girlfriend had sex she got pregnant he went proposed and got married to her while she was pregnant and now they've come to us wanting to rectify the issue we tell them that the previous period since the marriage contract till date you were living in Xena because the marriage is invalid what to do Cher well you have to renew the contract after repenting and asking Allah for forgiveness so we did this ten years ago Cher and we've repented and now we're practicing Muslims and Allah may Allah forgives your sins go and renew the contract how go to her father and tell him to renew the contract again without exposing yourself just use any other excuse so he says okay I give you my daughter in marriage you say I accept and this is in the presence of two male witnesses Muslim male witnesses Hamas the marriage is done what about the children that were born especially the child that she was pregnant with this is an issue of dispute the majority of scholars say that this child is born out of wedlock and he should not be attributed to quote-unquote the biological father but there is an opinion which says that if this woman was not married when she conceived and she was known to only have had relations with that man and that man calls the child to be his in this case this is called a still harp and the boy or the girl are called after their biological father and allah azzawajal knows best"
