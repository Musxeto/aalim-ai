  "title": "If govt bans female circumcision, we do it secretly, are we sinful & is it mandatory assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the question is we believe that we Muslim that female circumcision is aah by country before not a problem to do it but now the new government they burn it if we the parents we did it in secret without KN of government are we sinful for that what is it that you're asking about female circumcision okay female circumcision is an issue of dispute among jurors and the most authentic opinion is that it is recommended it's not mandatory and due to the fact that it is recommended if the government prevents it and outlaws it then you have to and you're obliged to obey and refrain from doing it and alhamdulillah as I said it is not something that is mandatory and staying away from it would be following the law and there is no sin in that at all"
