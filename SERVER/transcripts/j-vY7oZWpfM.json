  "transcript": "if Mohammed some anomaly you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sunnah he gave he be screaming after no maroney's well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome to contemporary Islamic issues I'm your host Arkham Russia this is a brand new series on another TV in which we will take various Islamic topics and concepts and discuss them in 30 minute segments with a contemporary out view and look so I want to start off today's episode which is about moderation in Islam what is moderation what does this term mean and how does it apply to us today so let's start off by welcoming and introducing our wonderful guest che awesome look man al Hakim assalamualaikum waalaikumsalam Alonza cool ok for having me a chef it's wonderful to have you from Saudi Arabia and here recording with us on the TV and it's no this is a wonderful opportunity to this series with you in sha Allah so I'm gonna start off by asking you today's episode is about moderation can you just generally or briefly give us a idea of what moderation is in Islam see the terminology of moderation can be interpreted or translated into WA Satya the middle path and this is a universal trend you always find the right wing in the left wing which means that there is something in the middle and Allah Azza WA JAL has praised the Muslims by saying okay Dada Kajal na combe o matin was a fun Allah has made the followers of muhammad sallallaahu sanam our prophet to be a nation on the middle path and this means that there are extremes and the extremes are the edges of the rod if you would like to say something to the far right and something that the far left and the best of them is the thing that is in the middle so moderation in Islam is the middle path and something very beautiful I read on this ayah that you quoted for us was that allah subhanho wa taala in the ayah he says that he's made us you know in the middle so then we can judge others Shuhada and ask to be a witness for the rest of mankind and it's very interesting because the middle path it doesn't take science it doesn't if you if you're to be a witness for what mankind is doing and to bring justice to mankind you have to be oddly you have to be fair correct and it's it's a very beautiful that you caught it there now many times in the West especially in the Western you can find in many Muslim countries as well we have this concept of okay I'm a moderate Muslim right I want to be a moderate Muslim we don't need to take extremes Allah subhanAllah tells us to be moderate you find many car thieves and many scholars saying we should be moderate in our views but many times in the West we say okay well moderation is I don't wear out to pray five times a day why do I have to pass thirty days this is not moderation let's fast in moderation that's fast five days to the of the month let's pray how we want to pray what do we have to pray in a specific way this is not moderation what would you say to that see if you look at the question as a question mm-hmm it has two branches that can be or angles that you can answer it through are we talking with Muslims or are we talking with non-muslims if I watch CNN or Fox News and them talking about moderate Islam and and and and moderate Muslims I immediately on the spot tell you that this has nothing to do with this laughing they're talking about a virgin that is not related to Islam at all so is this my concern let's analyse moderation or to be moderate or to be tolerant or to be in the middle is relative it depends where are you looking at it from they say that we live in the Middle East how can it be Middle East except to those who think that they are in the right position so they call it the Far East the Middle East and they think that they are the center of the whole of this universe which tells you that their perspective is wrong if I were to judge using my own logic and intellect I would say to a woman from Saudi Arabia who was fully armed and covers her face to be extreme if I come to other Muslim countries where they do not cover the faces they would look at Saudis as extreme and they would think that uncovering is okay if you go to a little bit more moderate countries where women don't wear hijab at all they'd look at these women who wear the hijab but don't cover their faces to be extreme and if you go to the Muslims in the Western countries who don't have any boundaries in Islam they go clubbing partying mixing social drinkers you know it's a celebration let's have a glass of champagne I'm gonna not gonna be wasted with that so they think that all the other Muslims are extreme and they're the moderate so you cannot judge things without having the right parameters I cannot judge the lens of my iPad if I don't have a ruler that gives me the right reading so what is or what defines my readings what is the thing that I can judge with for the non-muslims we tell them it's a different issue when we talk to you because you're not going to understand our language so we have to talk in a language that you may understand but for the Muslims who ask this question we tell them I'll ask you a question do you think that the prophet sallallaahu said and was moderate I mean of course you cannot even blink and doubt definitely he was the moderate Muslim because he's our benchmark he's a role model in a sense that whatever he did is the right thing no doubts at all in this no if you acknowledge this and this is every Muslims conviction though sometimes we have veils that prevent us from admitting it so if you admit this fact because if you don't admit it you're not a Muslim anymore so the Prophet is the role model and he is the benchmark for moderation this is what we judge issues with so if I want to judge an issue of let's assume I'm a a sophisticated person I go to the restaurant i order a big t-bone steak well-done and when I start eating it and cutting it I'm using the fork with my left and the knife with my right and I eat with my left okay this is Haram the Prophet told us our assault Saddam that the Shaitaan each with his left and drinks with his left you look at me and said what do you know everybody's eating with his left what's wrong with why did Allah create two hands for us you imbecile Finola know you you're extremist you so yeah any a strict man you a fanatic you're not moderate okay you're a Muslim let's see what the Prophet said us nothing and then you tell me what do you think if we look at things through this spectrum to this this angle you have no problem with being moderate and just a recap so basically moderation depends on which lens you look at which a lens you're looking through so if you're looking through the lens of the West then of course this is going to be a different culture a different society different understanding of how to live your life so our moderation is taken from the ground incident or like you said from the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam so know what but if I may add sure of course you can see it's not only the lens of the West even among those Muslims we have extremists and this is why we have what I want to get into next okay then you go ahead yeah sure okay in Islam it is so clear and obvious the Prophet said I saw some talk to come Adam my Hodja tell me about I have left you on a clear and white sheet if you way if you if you make that the night it is obvious that the day's office is so clear no one doubts when the Sun is in the middle of the sky that it might midnight so the Prophet Isis and told us that he had given us he has taught us everything however when you get these extremists whether from the far right or from the far left Islam has the answer to them because they have understood the Quran and the Sunnah according to their desires and whims so it's not only the West that has misconceptions about Islam and moderation also those who claim to be Muslims and they are a minority and hamdullah bringing them back to the mainstream of Islam is quite easy because the Quran is in black and white it's an Arabic language and the hadith explains every single detail of it okay so now obviously you said in your question and your answer that there's two ways of looking at it one is for Muslims and one is obviously not for non-muslims now let's get a little bit into this concept for Muslims in Islam we have what you said Wasel tall the middle path and then you have two extremes which is one is extremism which is you know terrorism or any sort of extremism and and misinterpreting verses of the Quran and on the other side you have Muslims that can be also considered extreme because they're not part of the middle path which is they leave everything that's part of Islam that's part of the religion that's part of the fundamentals of faith we can say such as prayer this is sort of extremism as well so how can we figure out what is not extremism on both ends whether it be this harsh short of terrorism type of extremism or whether it be the exact opposite and which is you know let's be moderate let's leave everything we don't need to do how do we know how do we find that balance that that middle path how do we find it and hamdulillah the Prophet arezzo Sturm had taught us everything and he has set the foundations for having Islam last too the day of judgement there is no religion after Islam and there's no messenger after the prophet sallallaahu Selim Allah said 14 centuries ago a glioma a comment telecom Dina come to day I have completed your religion so the religion is complete no one can come and add things to it or subtract things from it those who are extremists they would probably take one or two evidences overlooking the rest of the evidence is because it does not serve it they do not serve their whims and desires so Islam is a full package that we have to take it as all and as a whole allah azza wajal says alladhina amanu or the whole office in me kafir that enter in Islam wholeheartedly in the whole thing as a package not being selective so we have extremists in the sense that we have people who go beyond what Allah has legislated and we have people on the other side of the coin who do not take the full thing and they say no it's sufficient to do some part of it and for example in the issues of a peda or the Creed you have how are each and you have mogea both of them are opposite side of the equation yet they share the same concept when it comes to the definition of Eman Eman they say that your belief is a whole unit either it's there or it's not there at all it cannot be divided into levels and and grades so how are you say you're a believer you make a one a single major sin you become a kafir a disbeliever the more jiya on the other hand say you're a believer it's the whole thing do whatever you want you're still a believer so no speaking yes so they say that a man cannot be increased or decreased the middle path are the people of Alison l-jamaa who say no a man increases with good deeds decreases with bad deeds and sins so this is the middle path where did these people or these folks got their idea from from the Quran where did the other side get their IDs from from the brine yet our Omar may Allah be pleased with him said that when you argue with the peoples of whims and desires do not argue with them strictly with the Quran because Quran has many angles to look at from look argue with them debate with them with the Sunnah listen is clear-cut and straight forward so the way to answer these people on the extreme side is to answer them with the Quran and discern as well because as we know the Sunnah clarifies the Quran for us and tells us exactly what allah subhanaw taala means in the quran sheikh i want to actually get into people exaggerating in their acts of worship but before we do that we're gonna go for any short breaks on stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on hooda TV now before we went for that short break we were speaking about moderation and the shake give us a wonderful definition and gave us different outlooks on moderation now we said that when we come back from this short break we will speak about balance and speak about exaggerating yourself in acts of worship so sure if I want to ask you now we said before the break you spoke about the different people also taking their proofs from the Quran and you know bits and pieces and following their desires and interpreting them in ways that they want to rather than using the Sunnah to define what the Quran is telling us there's also people who take certain acts of worship which are good prayers see fasting and many other acts of worship and exaggerate in these acts of worship so for example a person might take prayer and say well I'm gonna start praying you know either 10 times a day or I'm gonna fast all year long so sometimes their intentions you can say are good in a in a in a way but they're overburdening themselves it's not it's not what's prescribed for us in a way so what would you say to that again burying yourself and burning yourself to the ground with good deeds is dependent on the Sharia on the Quran and Sunnah so if the Prophet tells us to make vicar and he gives us a hundred times of thicker this is a lot to some if the Prophet s asaram recited every federal prayer over Friday with shorter and shorter insan' which monster about five pages a lot of the Muslims of war are we are this is too extreme if the amount does it now this is the Sunnah of the Prophet s assembly this is the benchmark so no it's not extreme youth you are too lazy so in order for us to comment on it we have to go back to the swing up it's human nature that you want to excel and when people look at Jenna and Paradise and what allah azza wajal has prepared for them and they compare it with their short life span 70 years 60 years seldomly you'll find people going or past that so when you compare apples to apples say there's no comparison so I'm gonna work real hard to strive for the hereafter but sometimes this is the biggest gate for Satan to enter from and this is why the prophetess I'm always reiterated on taking the middle path for example we know in hatch in pilgrimage we stone the three jama'at some people call them the the great devil the middle devil Linda yeah yeah this is all baseless there's no devil in there sometimes you find some of them brothers holding like a big rock and throwing it and in and cursing the Shaitaan he made me divorce my wife he made me curse my father what are you doing some of them even go there with his shoes hitting it now this is all nonsense and chatot is laughing his head off the Prophet in that beautiful ritual said stone with seven stones and he instructed one of his companions to collect the stones for him and he said choose something like this which is lesser than what do you call it a pebble that is lesser in size than bigger than size than a lentil is it yeah and smaller than B's so it something is really small and it's it's you just throw it normally you don't harm people so the Prophet is telling them don't go to extreme and select something that is big even in hatch when you're traveling from one area to the other he says a second Attica Sakina you have to be in a state of tranquility don't think that righteousness is by speeding and by overtaking people all of this is to tell us that Islam is a religion of a moderation he went once into a house and a sew-in and he saw a rope dangling from the ceiling so said what is this so they told him this is for one of your wives whenever she prayed night prayer and felt tired was unable to stand she would force herself and hang with the rope so that she consent said subhanAllah do not burden yourself like this and take from the deeds what you can tolerate and bear not only that this incident was reported twice once with Abu Darda and said magnifier seem a little pleased with them and once with the humble humble I have a nominal ask and the Prophet himself and in both cases I would order and I belong I'm from the lass both were so extreme in the forms of worship to the extent that they fasted every single day and they prayed night prayer every single night so they did not have any desire to their spouses which reached the Prophet as Aram in the incident an incident of Abdullah Nam and reached Salman a Pharisee who was a brother of Abu Darda by the Prophet Isis and made them brothers so they both said the same thing the Prophet said I saw sir and Salman said it and the Prophet approved what Simon said the advice was your Lord has rights over you your spouse has rights over you your guest has rights over you and your body your health has rights over you so give each one its do right this is the balance this is the moderation so don't go to extreme thinking that I can be the best athlete for example but this would compromise my religious duties my social obligations and it would compromise my financial status unless I'm a soccer player then I would hit it real good I could be the best businessman make a lot of money but I would compromise the other rights I can be the greatest monk and scholar of Islam spending 24/7 my time in a Masjid but I wouldn't see my children or family and I wouldn't have any quality time I wouldn't be able to earn money and then I start begging people and I would not take good care of my health high cholesterol levels blood pressure diabetes etc the whole nine yards so Islam gave us the equation of being balanced being moderate and the happiest man on earth in my opinion is the one who strikes his balance yeah and just from the hadith that you quoted about giving each individual their rights from there we can take so many benefits I mean you know you have people always wondering well I don't have time to pray because I have to you know give time to my wife or I have to give time to my work but each thing that allah subhanho wa taala wants us to give it its full and do rights and another really interesting thing is that many times we say that Islam is not just worship but it's a way of life and this is commonly quoted and you know this is one beautiful way of expressing it that allah subhanho wa taala has is right you give him his rights which is worshiping him but that's not the only way you worship is Islamic worship is not through ritualistic things only I mean when you give your wife her rights when you give your neighbor their rights when you give your kids their right this is worshiping allah subhana wa ta'ala and this is conducting your way of life that's why Islam is the way of life it's not just an act of worship another thing I wanted to find out was how can we achieve this moderation and why wouldn't I be trapped in the same situation as these people that are selecting and choosing if I open the Quran and I don't understand it how can I find this moderation I want to look for this moderation that the Prophet SAW someone spoke for who do I look for who who do I listen to I mean there's people quoting ayahs here there's people quoting ayahs here there's people quoting ayahs here how do I know which one is the moderate one okay before I go into this you said a sentence at the beginning but you rectified it which is good you said Islam is not only worship it is a way of life yes and this is wrong because Allah says wa ma khalaqtu l-jinna insularly algún i have not created the humans and the jinn except to worship me so the sole purpose of our creation is to worship Allah sirs and however our understanding of worship is wrong because as you've rectified it you said that people think that worshipping Allah is only in prayers and fasting and that's it no worshiping Allah so job is in every single thing you do it's in your politics in your finance it's in your arts it's in your social life is your way of life it is a way of life but it is under the umbrella of worship so even if I drink a cup of coffee if my intention is to get stronger and to wake up so I can pray night prayer then this drinking of cup of coffee becomes less worship if I'm having intimacy with my wife this is a form of worship because if I do it with other than my wife I'll be sinful for that and I'll go to hell so illogical is even rewarding us on permissible things things that we desire depending on the mindset we are in now how would we reach this moderation or what are the means of doing it this requires like couple of episodes to know how to select the scholar to follow it is totally correct the observation you made and that is nowadays I open the internet and it's an endless ocean share he's a Grand Mufti now he's not a Shaykh now he's yes yes he's very we went past this level and this is a problem it's a blessing and it's a menace at the same time it's a blessing for those who can utilize this technology into serving Islam I in so many places and times I need to find a certain piece of information or an evidence for an issue I can find it in a jiffy because it happened early now I know I've studied it I have knowledge those who do not know will be confused and then this is again a smaller gate for Shaitaan to enter from because then he comes to individuals and say Oh Angela there are 15 different opinions so pick and choose let's do what they call cherry-picking moderation is reached only through knowledge and this is why Allah Allah isolated the fear of Allah in those who are knowledgeable in Nemea sha la manera body he a dilemma that verily only the scholars fear Allah truly so the real scholars their knowledge gives them fear of Allah gives them righteousness gives them piety but if you don't have knowledge then the sky is the limit to go astray and this is why I leave now be tarted may allah be pleased with him he said there are two groups that have gone astray in me those who are extremists in my love referring to the Shia and those who are extremist in my hatred referring to Huaraz who eventually killed him assassinated him so these two things shall show you that without knowledge you who are in the middle of New York City without a Google Maps you'll be lost you it's a jungle out there you need knowledge you need your GPS to guide you to paradise and your GPS in common contemporary language is the Quran and the Sunnah these are the guides these are the light that guide you to moderation and it's very interesting how everything in Islam is connected I mean you've you've mentioned that knowledge is what gives you that moderation and there's a hadith of the prophet service alone where he says it's you know compulsory for everybody to seek knowledge and obviously the scholars have said that this hadith means you know enough knowledge for what they need so if this person is a businessman you should know how to conduct his business Islamically he needs to pray everything that he needs to know he has to learn and it's compulsory for him to do so yes used to go to the market with a stick and he was the Caliph he's a he's a ruler and anyone who does not have knowledge in transactions he would kick him out of the souk he said do not corrupt our souk because you don't know about rebar you don't know about Volm you don't know about the rock and you come and sell and buy without knowledge all the transactions would be Haram and and you know this too reaches moderation we need to seek knowledge we need to educate ourselves about how the Prophet SAW centum conducted moderation and how he established moderation and and the only way we can do it is we need to leave our own views sometimes we're stuck in this view like if I'm from the West I have this view of okay this is moderation because I'm looking through that lens that you mentioned you know each place has its own lens correct so just like the West thinks the Far East is Japan and China I mean Japan and China they don't call themselves the Far East that's not far east to them so we need to you know detach this sort of understanding that we already have in trying to look at the Quran and Sunnah from the view of the Prophet SAW sort of how did his companions view view it how did the early self view the Quran and Sunnah and how they use this moderation I'm just gonna give you a minute to give us a conclusion or wrap it up in Chawla and then we're gonna come to the end of this episode again to reach the level of moderation and to know whether you moderate or not you have to display all of your life your actions from the Koran listen them three of the prophets companions solos allah may allah be pleased with them went to the houses of the prophets asking his wives about the forms of worship that the prophet offer allah salla syrup and when they told him they said no this is too little the prophet has been forgiven all of his sins I'm personally going to pray all night without sleeping the other one said personally I will fast the whole year without breaking my fast the third one said I will not get close to women no intimacy all of this as forms of worship to allah azzawajal the Prophet was outraged when he heard this and he said that I saw Salam I pray and I sleep I fast and I break my fast and I marry women whoever seeks other than my swooner other than my way he's not from me what a wonderful way to conclude the photograph with that beautiful hadith of the Prophet says enough so I should cause I want to thank you for joining me for this episode it was wonderful having this conversation with you once again thank you very much exactly dear viewers I hope you guys benefited from this wonderful episode and I hope you guys join us for many more episodes of contemporary Islamic issues and until then may Allah subhana WA Ta'ala bless us all assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh if Mohamed Salah momily you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony game you hear me screaming after no more honest well
