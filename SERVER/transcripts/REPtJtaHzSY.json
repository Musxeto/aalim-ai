  "transcript": "there is a friend of mine that says when uh we are sick or uh we have evil high or uh Envy so we go to a specific sh and uh going to that specific sh Allah will only cure Us by going to that specific sh so I said to him that that is committing a am I right or or not and he says and replying to me so people go to doctors why they do go to doctors when they sick it's like that so he says that that's and Allah give him Baraka So reading Quran to you um by that Allah will cure you so what's the ruling of that sh this is not permissible it is not kufur rather it is shik to believe that only going to a specific sheh to recite Quran or anything else only going to him would cure you this is shik there's no doubt in that whether it's a major shik or minor sh depending on the intention of the individual no one in his right mind would say that going to the doctors we go to the doctors not believing that they have the ability to cure our ill illnesses rather they may direct us to a medication or procedure that Allah would put shifa and recovery and healing in it not that this doctor does that it's a scientific thing that we go to have as a means as a way while connecting our hearts 100% to Allah isolating the recovery and the healing process in and individual doctor and no one else could heal you or cure your illness other than him this is shik may Allah protect us"
