  "transcript": "oh welcome to our program lessons in today insha allah we're going to start a new chapter of our book almaram and this chapter has the title of the nullification of wudu and as you know anything you do has pillars and prerequisites for it to be correct and authentic yet at the same time they are there are things that if you do them it nullifies it and worships are of the same sort for example fasting every one of us fasts and there are prerequisites for your fasting to be correct there are pillars such as intention such as not consuming food or drink or of the sort the things that you all know but at the same time there are things that nullifies your fasting if you do them intentionally if you eat or drink intentionally during the day time of ramadan then this nullifies your fast pilgrimage also shares the same thing pillars and nullifications islam itself shares the same thing to be a muslim you have to do certain things such as to testify you have to believe that there is only one god that is worthy of being worshipped and he has no part partner and you have to testify that muhammad sallallahu alaihi is his servant and messenger you have to follow him you have to believe in what he says in order for you to be a muslim and you have to pray now there are things that nullifies your islam you could testify you could believe but you could also at the same time do things that nullifies your islam completely and you do not become or you are not considered to be a muslim for example if a person testifies praise fasts performs pilgrimage but at the same time he believes that a dead person in his grave has the power to grant him children has the power to grant him wealth has the power to prevent harm from happening to him and that is why whenever he is in a problem or trouble he would say o mawlana or so and so o you pious person he's calling a dead person and he thinks that and believes that he can help him then this person is not a muslim by believing by doing this act he has nullified his islam and he has to purify his belief and religion in believing that only allah brings good and prevents harm likewise if a person does not pray though he is a believer he says he claims but he does not pray at all not one single prayer the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said he who does not pray is not a muslim the only barrier the only difference between us and the non-believers is prayer so whoever abandons it is not considered to be a muslim now this is generally speaking going back to our topic the nullification of voodoo evolution is what we do before performing prayer and we wash the limbs as we've described previously now there is a state that is not physical it is a meant it is something that is not a you cannot touch it it is something that is considered to be a description that falls on one of us after doing certain things now we have something that we call purity can you explain what is the meaning of purity in arabic means purity in cleanliness purity has two versions of it major purity and minor purity now if you reverse this you have what we call hadith hadith in arabic translates to an event something that took place and it's a form of a ritual whether it's sexual major sexual ritual which is sexual impurity and this happens when someone has an intercourse or a woman has her menstruation then she is clean she takes at the time of menstruation she has al hadith or after giving birth while she's bleeding this is she's still in the fast this is hadith akbar and we have something that is called hadith which is a minor form of hadith and this takes place if someone nullifies his wudu so it's one of the two either you are in the state of purity which means that you have performed wudu and now you are pure to perform salah you can pray or you are in the form of minor impurity not sexual major no minor impurity and this is caused by one of the things that nullifies your evolution okay now if i perform dudu i'm called to be taher i am known to be pure i have the purity in me because i have just performed evolution what happens if i pass wind shame on you well regardless what happened if if i do this now people will say you are not pure to pray which means that i have committed al-hadath the minor thing that is a description okay has anything changed in me can we recognize people with this form of impurity whether it's major or minor if i see someone walking in the streets would i say um he looks like he has the minor impurity no this one looks as if he's he's okay he just performed the blue you cannot tell so it's not something that is physical it is something that is described on you it's a description by giving you this introduction now you know it is not something physical which means that the things that nullifies your wudu are a handful of things we will mention them in sha allah and if it occurs it means that you cannot pray you have to perform evolution again we will go inshaallah a step by step to mention the things that scholars have agreed upon that they nullify and the things that they have different opinions regarding this topic and subject the first hadith narrated anas may allah be pleased with him the companions of allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam in his lifetime used to wait for a night prayer so much so that their heads were lowered down by dosing they would then pray without performing ablution now the first thing that nullifies wudu in accordance to the companions and the scholars is sleeping and in this hadith anas tells us uh if you remember noor unless yes and do you remember his mother's name you forgot yeah forget it and this is you know a footnote do you know who's his uh who's um second husband this husband of hers was a non-muslim and when he came and found out that her husband died and she was widowed he wanted to marry her so he proposed and she was a muslim and she told him that you're a non-muslim and i'm a muslim woman and you are a great man but you're not muslim i can't marry a non-muslim so my dowry would be my mahar would be that you convert to islam and i'm yours in marriage of course so the guy went home gave a matter of thought and converted to islam and became one of the best companions of the prophet sallallahu alaihi his name is his voice was known to be in battles very high and great and he was always close to the prophet salaam and there are so many stories about him and um in the seerah but this is not our topic again anas is explaining he's telling us how the people at the time of the prophet used to wait for prayer now what prayer are they talking about french fajr prayer is that correct you shall pray isha prayer is the right answer now all prayers whether it's fajr or maghrib the best time to perform them is at the very beginning after the adhan with the exception of depending on the season whether it's winter or summer because sometimes it is sunnah to delay it a little bit so it's not that hot for people but for fajr and the sunnah is to pray pray it immediately just after the adhan give or take few minutes 5 10 15 max with the exception of the sunnah is to delay asia until the first third of the night or until the half until it's midnight of course we mean midnight not 12 o'clock a lot of people think that midnight is 12 o'clock islamic midnight is recognized is calculated by calculating the time from sunset to the break of dawn this is the night and then you break it so if the sun sets at seven o'clock and the dawn breaks at five o'clock then we have ten hours of night half of them is five hours at the five to the seven it becomes 12 o'clock this is midnight but if you have sunset at six and you have dawn at four for example then you have 11 hours that's five hours and a half adding to six this is 11 30. this is midnight and it varies depending on the length of the night and it's a short period now uh uh at the time of the prophet people used to praise prayer and used to value it they used to go to the mosque after the event which is approximately eight nine o'clock depending and they used to wait for two to three hours waiting for the prophet allah islam to come out and perform prayer now try to compare this with our lives now if you enter any mosque you would find people waiting not even praying sunnah and sitting down they would come calculating that this is the time for akama they would stand next to and maybe they do this and maybe they do that just trying to bring his attention that okay it's a comma time and maybe some would shout in the mosque it's a comma time come on come on let's pray and this is not the doing of the prophet this is definitely not the doing of the companions may allah be pleased with them they used to wait they said quran make dhikr make supplication make anything that would draw them closer to allah azzawajal they would wait three hours in the masjid to the extent that some of them would you know feel a bit dozy you know his head would fall a little bit but he would not fall asleep to the extent that he does not know what's going on he would just doze a little bit so the companions say that or anna says that this was the nature of the companions and how they reacted at the time of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam i believe that we have to break a short break and we will continue inshaallah after this break so stay tuned for his mercy for his messengership for the revelation to be revealed this is not for the human beings to make that decision if a person would turn to allah sincerely truthfully asking for forgiveness allah promised to forgive we have as muslims a duty and that is to recite the book of allah to ponder over the verses the words of allah and to act according to the quran the mercy of allah encompasses everything but it who would this mercy will be for and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam was sent to all mankind so the ummah or the people of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam all mankind since the time of the prophet saw until the day of judgment why waste our life without getting to know every verse in the quran what allah wants from us lessons in brother fatih can you remind us with the hadith again please narrated in us may allah be pleased with him the companions of allah's messengers in his life in his lifetime used to wait for the aisha night prayer so much so that their heads were lowered down by dosing they would then pray without performing abolution okay now remember that the companions started the day like really early and not like how we start them they start their days at approximately three o'clock a.m four o'clock a.m and they go on until it's night time so by the time they perform isha they're really beat they just want to hit the sack they want to sleep so anus is saying that they're waiting for the prayer and their head falls out of drowsiness they're sleepy yet the prophet sallam when he came out he never told any of them go and perform which means that if a person falls in a a a very light drowsiness similar to this one and he is sitting firmly on the ground no it's it's a different story when you're on the ground sitting is different when you're lying down because if you're sitting down it's most likely that you will not release any gases you will not pass wind because you're firmly sitting on the floor though you're a little bit drowsy and you may fall asleep but your sleep is not so deep in the sense that if someone tells you hey you immediately recognize what he's saying to you you pay attention if he tries to put his hand in your pocket you are aware of that so scholars say that similar forms of sleep is not considered to be a nullification of voodoo nullification of wudo is the deep sleep the the sleep that you do not know what happens to you where your hand may be what may come out of you without your feeling it then this they consider to be a cause a major cause of a nullification of wudo and that is why it is the sunnah and it is obligatory for anyone of us that falls asleep and i mean sleep that when he wakes up he has to perform evolution uh brother uh fadi i have a question i once read a hadith that the prophet salallahu went into a stage of deep sleep and the companions or the narrator heard his he is like him snoring and then he stood up and performed prayer without evolution is this correct now this hadith was narrated by isha his wife and she said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi went to sleep until he snored he blowed air and snoring this means his deep sleep and he woke up and went to prayer without performing woodle so she said prophet salallahu sallam you slept until i heard you snoring and then you went for prayer without performing wudu what is this so can we do the same you are our idol we we follow what you do so the prophet said allah my eyes i ish asleep but my heart doesn't this is a special thing for the prophet which means that though he is physically asleep his heart is still awake which means that he knows what happens if he anything has had happened to him and he the prophet haslam has the ark angel gabriel jibril alaihissalam peace be upon him with him to tell him that if anything wrong took place or happened so this is something of the prophet allah this is a special thing for the prophet as it's special for him to do certain things for example it is forbidden for us to continue fasting it's forbidden for us to to fast two or three days continuously without breaking them the prophet on the other hand used to fast 10 days 15 days without breaking it and they used to say you deny us the companions you say you deny us from doing this and you do it how's that you tell us do not continue fasting without breaking it but you do it why is that he said i'm i'm different than you i stay at my lord's side allah feeds me and nourishes me where skin so i'm not like you i don't need food in that sense because allah azza provides me with the power that i need so there are things that the prophet saws is unique in them and we do not share the same verdict with him so this uh of course is the case with risha prayer with the drowsiness that may occur and this occurs a lot in friday prayer those who go early for friday prayer like 10 o'clock nine o'clock does anybody go at nine o'clock the sunnah is to go at the very early morning like after fajr five you stay six hours in the mosque you're crazy no i'm not crazy this is the sunnah if you want the reward you have to work hard for it now you're gonna go to the mosque to the masjid on friday morning for staying there for three or four hours what will you do will you think about the latest songs rap music movies and chatting and surfing the net or you're gonna think of the hereafter how to be a good muslim how to benefit people how to be kind to others how to recite the quran to make supplication to feel humble and to feel the submissiveness uh before allah it adds value to you but a lot of people go early like 10 o'clock 11 o'clock and after half an hour shaytan comes satan comes to them and starts whispering in their ears and you're sleepy you're feeling drowsy you're bored and start yawning and doing this and that now this is from shaytan and what i however it happens to you as long as you're sitting firmly and your head nods a bit and you wake up and your wudu is okay but it is recommended that you go and perform a fresh evolution a fresh buddha so that you are a little awake and and you're fresh to hear the speech and the khutbah the following hadith narrated fatima bin abu hubais came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and said o messenger of allah i am a woman whose blood keeps flowing even after the menstruation period i am never purified should i therefore stop praying he the prophet said no for that is only aven and is not menstruation so when the menstruation comes abstain from prayers and when it ends wash the blood from yourself and then pray now menstruation is something that allah made it as natural to females so and that is why the prophet saw when he entered once to aisha and he found her crying so what's wrong she said i have this bleeding so this is something that allah has written on all females so this is natural it's normal for all females for all women when they reach the age of puberty to have this monthly period so it's not nothing to be uh ashamed or afraid of it's something that is natural allah has put it and wrote it on all females so fatima was a companion that had this continuous bleeding it didn't stop usually the menstruation is between six to seven days a month a lunar month that is and fatima came and she was puzzled now she knows that when menstruation is there she should not pray at all and it's forbidden for a woman in her monthly period to pray it's forbidden it's not unaccepted but she keeps on seeing this blood so what she do what is she supposed to do so the prophet told her that and we will come to this inshallah on a later chapter of menstruation but the prophet told her i saw some that this is not one month menstruation it is a vein that is bleeding so you try to recognize your menstruation which is six to seven days you can tell by the smell you can tell by the color you can tell by the back pains and that accompanies women know this and he told her that if the ministration comes stop praying but if it doesn't so if it's only this normal bleeding of the vein then you should wash and then you should perform wudu perform ablution and from this hadith we understand that whatever comes out of the private parts again whatever comes out of the your private part nullifies automatically whether it's it's it's a a urine uh difficulty your menstruation uh scholars sometimes give the example of stones even if a stone comes out it nullifies your wudu and from this hadith we know that you have to perform wudu when anything comes out of the private parts whether it's blood whether it's durian whether it's uh medhi whether it's wadi and we will come to explain this inshallah on a later stage so to wrap things up whatever comes of the private parts nullifies and you have to perform wudu again and this hadith tells us how interested the companions are in knowing their knowledge and knowing islam she went out she's a female to this prophet of allah and of course she felt shy asking these questions but sometimes you have to break this shyness so uh in order to get knowledge and she asked the prophet alessa because she wanted to know the verdict on the most important thing in her life which is prayer and we should also follow suit to learn our religion i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time wash you"
