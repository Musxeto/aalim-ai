  "transcript": "that when we stand up from suud to the standing position and I think he's referring to the first and third ofat there is a small pause where you sit after the second suud and then you stand up so when standing up should we depend on our hands with an open hand or should we make a fist as if we are preparing dough it's an issue of dispute among Scholars it depends on those who authenticated the Hadith albani because long ago he authenticated the of preparing the D with the fists he does this and those who follow him follow suit those who follow other Scholars who said no the Hadith is not such asak Abu Z Etc they would follow the open hand those who say that originally the knees should be the last thing to leave the earth when standing up so they say you do not depend on the ground all together so it's alhamdulillah yeah it's a variety of choices can choose I personally uh uh select the uh the using the fist when standing up"
