  "transcript": "can someone keep out of wedlock child named Gabriel or Mariam I know someone who give this name to that child a child that is born out of wedlock the name has no impact so because a child was born out of wedlock oh we can't call the child Muhammad or we can't call the child Abdullah there's nothing wrong in that the crime was invaded in conceiving the child in the first place but after the child is born oh can we Circle the child can we feed the child can we clean the child it's a normal human being of course you can do all of these things like any other child he has no fault in the crime of his mother so calling a baby boy jibril is permissible because it is permissible to call baby boys by the names of angels and calling a baby girl Mariam is definitely permissible without any problem in that and Allah knows best this"
