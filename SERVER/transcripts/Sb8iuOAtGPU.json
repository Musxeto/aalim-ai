  "transcript": "tattoo see if my question is if a Layman wants to gain mandatory knowledge but he delays in starting it and after starting he doesn't gain knowledge consistently due to procrastination laziness or any other problem and in the meantime he does something sinful or something which takes a person out of Islam due to ignorance so is he sinful for this or out of Islam there is a big difference between is he sinful or out of the fault of Islam it doesn't make any sense your question is illogical now this is the biggest problem among Muslims nowadays and this is the Thin Line a very fine thread that separates them from giving take fear to people and this is why we get nicest and Al-Qaeda and extremists who just simply find it easy to oh he's out of the fold of Islam he said so and so he's out of the fold of Islam that's very easy it's very common because they don't have knowledge see one of the characteristics or the signs of not having knowledge knowledge when you say is this sinful or kufur why would it be this ambiguous to you now a person who does not seek mandatory knowledge we know that there is mandatory knowledge with your Islam cannot be complete without and there is auxiliary uh complementary something extra so when it comes to for example Hajj are you going to perform Hajj this year he says no it's not mandatory to know now do you pray five times a day he said yes you have to know this is mandatory knowledge do you know the six pillars of Iman no this is mandatory knowledge you have to acknowledge them do you know the questions you'll be asking your grave this is mandatory knowledge you have to know them so such knowledge if you are delaying it out of laziness and you don't learn it are you sinful of course are you out of the fault of Islam of course not until you nullify your Islam but you don't have the knowledge your Islam is intact you know Allah you don't commit anything that nullifies your Islam you're sinful for not knowing what's mandatory upon you I don't know when to make sujudice prostration of forgetfulness before Salam after Salam what are the things to to perform it for okay go and learn my videos on YouTube are very clear and it's free go ahead and learn it watch it it's going to take you a couple of minutes nah I'd rather watch uh uh wrestling or watch a cricket match okay then you're sinful because when you make a mistake and you don't know what to do here you are sinful but does it take you order to follow the Islam of course not"
