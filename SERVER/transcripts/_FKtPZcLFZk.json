  "transcript": "so whoever forsakes those doubtful unclear things okay doubtful or unclear thing i would rather translate it as ambiguous or no sorry not ambiguous dubious dubious matters this is better than uh doubtful or unclear dubious matters lest he may commit a sin will definitely avoid what is clearly uh prohibited and whoever indulges in these unclear dubious matters bravely is likely to commit what is clearly prohibited what does this refer to it refers to when going to transactions when going to buying and selling there are things that are crystal clear halal what's your ruling on buying water halal thank you what's the ruling on buying wine haram thank you what's the ruling on xyz hmm i have to analyze is it halal is it haram as long as there is doubt in it leave it as long as you're doubtful about it okay it might not be haram true but what's the other end of the equation it might be haram so there is a probability the hadith tells you that there is a sanctuary this sanctuary belongs to the king and the king has all of his livestock in it there's a big fence and a big warning sign if your animal of your livestock enters this sanctuary it will be the end of it it will belong to the king you cannot call it back so now you say uh there is five meters okay i can bring my livestock and the herd they can graze around it not going to are you approaching danger zone the prophet says it's the same thing with dubious matters you say this is not haram bring me the dalil it's not everything 1 plus 1 equals two there are other indications uh indicators there are other signs that makes it haram said no no i want something that comes and says smoking pot smoking marijuana is haram do you have this i said no not in the text i don't have something that says drinking whiskey or vodka or tequila or jin is haram i have general definitions of it he said no no no i will not this is not dubious this is almost haram or clear haram but you the prophet is trying to align you with the sharia with the quran and sunnah something that is dubious stay away from it or you're inevitably going to foreign haram and there are many examples uh of this okay since our allah's that is private pasture and whoever pastures his sheep near it is likely to get it get in it at any moment this is the pastor which is the sanctuary that the king has and this is well known to be his property don't approach it likewise don't approach anything that may make you fall into clear haram because you're close to it only in what was related in what we studied don't ask me what's the ruling on fasting the 29th of shaban this is not related only in what we've studied do you have any questions or we should move on yes sir you said it was um does that also include the stomach disease i heard one of them was if you die no stomach disease is mentioned in the hadith so this is mentioned in the hadith and anyone who dies with an illness in his intestines is considered to be among the martyrs but is the plague it's something to do with the respiratory but the plague is a specific pandemic that the prophet was mentioning a person the owner is someone who owns it the second one is in the person i might be the owner i might be the owner of this book number two says yes but there are conditions authorized in my author i am the owner am i authorized what do you mean am i saying or insane no i'm insane but this book is mine said you cannot you're not authorized to deal am i an adult or a child am i sound indecision or i'm safe am i a slave or a free man this is number two it's characteristics of the owner authorized to deal i am the owner number four no the one who's really doing the say the selling may not be the owner so one of the conditions number four is to be the owner with the four conditions of authorized okay if i'm not the owner someone whom i authorize someone who has authority so i'm the guardian over five orphans their children but i'm their guardian i have the authority to sell and to buy in their interest but someone from the streets says i will sell this building what do you relate to them nothing do you have any authority no sir you're not authorized question that you mentioned that the product should be available and can be touched or seen if it is not available so manufacture something according to my description and demand so i say to you i need 100 000 paper cups so okay you have to describe it the material has to be this the diameter has to be this from the bottom of the top the color has to be this i give you an order and you say okay this costs will cost you so much my profit is so much all i'll give you a lump sum this is permissible this is this now what we're talking about when it we said that it has to be possible any ability to deliver it is when you sell something that is not possible to deliver so if i say to you okay i will sell you the brooklyn bridge i'm going to deliver it to you or i say to you i'll sell you a space shuttle and i don't have the means of manufacturing or or i sell you something on the moon i'll give you four by four kilometers on the moon and it's your name and we will make it inshallah a great place to migrate to so wow and i give you and they were doing this in america by the way and they were selling it to pieces of land and you go authenticate the deeds and this is un-islamic yes sir um you said that whatever you're selling has to have a value correct let's say there are things which have perceived value for example in divide they're selling number plates so and for exorbitant prices no this is not allowed this is something that has no benefit this is extravagance this is selling something that has no value which is a license plate a one and you said you you sell it for 5 million 6 million dirhams maybe 10 million dirhams what's the benefit of it showing off extravagance and wasting money this is totally this is prohibited to sell it like you say in the sea fish so nowadays someone asked this question selling water from the natural resources because he is not owner but it's a natural resource he's making the bottling and he's selling the water so does this permission does he do any work is there any cost on him is he putting any effort into it of course he's collecting it he's refining it he's bottling it he's storing it he's marking it this is different from someone who sees a well in the open and he puts a fence and he prevents people from drinking no people are in common use of water of fire and of grazing this is allah's property and it's for free but if i have my own property and there's a well inside it and people want to take water from it by force no this is mine you get you see the difference there's no problem in in selling water inshallah shall we yes sir did you mention about the uh buying or selling anything after salah after azan and correct before the end of salah okay because there is some scholars they refer is it the first one or the second that's why i said the one that is preceded by the salaam of the imam when the imam says the the more than given this is first or second there is a second this is how we identify which adhan that's why i said it so that there would be no ambiguity it's the adhan that is preceded by the salaam of the imam the first one which is an hour earlier no you can buy and sell no problem sorry connected to the same question so for example just before going to we order something to be delivered and we pay at the time of the year maybe he got late so we go to the machine and the delivery happens after that so the transaction happens while the while uh within this you know transaction happens earlier yeah but it's only a call it happened earlier whether he delivers it after the adhan is made you're in the masjid so your your your sister your someone who's not uh obliged to pray in the message would do the transaction he's haram in doing it but most likely his hindu someone a delivery which he's not praying on time so there's no problem that conducting the transaction i sell i buy after that is haram you did it before the delivery is included but you're not there to receive it you're in the masjid so there's no liability on you inshallah a kid died i quoted 200k but it costed me only 20k so the 80k or the profit margin that i was going to uh what was still 50k but i earned more more how [Applause] this is something to be dissected now i have approached you because you're a constructing uh constructing construction agent so i want you to do a task for me this task includes buying raw material includes hiring labor and the execution of the work this is a package deal usually the people know that most people don't make a very big margin on the raw material on the paints on the cement on the gibson border they usually make marginal uh profit but they make a lot of profit on the labor and on the execution of the work if i'm okay with that and there's no ambiguity in the contract and you sign it if you make 50 profit or 100 profit there is no margin of it there's no cheating in it yes i get 5 percent is mine inshallah next time bismillah chapter number 3 explanation of doubtful things so now after the the imam bukhari mentioned the hadith of permissible and prohibited among them or between his dubious things he wanted to give an example of what is dubious things that you should avoid number 986 took a firm promise from his brother to take the son of the slave girl of zama into his custody as he was his that is son in the year of the conflict conquest of makkah sad bin abi took him and said that he was his brother's son and his brother took a promise from him to that effect okay let's just wait here because now we're confused we don't know what's happening who do you think he's the brother of says one of the top 10 heaven bound so utwa is no more living he died he said and gave an advice to his brother sad o sad when i die this child is my son which child the child of a concubine of a woman slave she's a woman slave she's a concubine who does she belong to she belongs to zama happens to be the father of the mother of the believers the second wife of the prophet her name is sauda maybe most of you would never heard of her yeah this is the second wife after khadijah died the prophet married two one elderly woman his age saudi benzema and one young woman who did not reach age of puberty but the marriage was not consummated and she was mother so what happened was that this utbe happened to have fornicated with that concubine and she got pregnant so he told his brother after i died by the way this is my child so take him and give him my name the child grew up after a few years and at the time of the conquest of makkah when was the conquest of makkah in hijri in the on the eighth year two men came with a boy and the first one sat who's carrying the advice and the recommendation of his brother the other one is ibn zama the brother of sauda who says now this boy is my brother because his father is my father and his mother is a concubine who sleeps on my father's bed so what's the logical thing sad said no no no no he's my brother's son because my brother told me that he fornicated with that woman so they came to the prophet saying got up and said he is my brother and the son of my father's slave girl and was born on my father's bed then they both went to the prophet salallahu he is the son of my brother and he has taken a promise from me that i will take him said he is my brother and the son of my father slave girl and was born on my father's bed allah's messenger salallahu sallam said the boy is for you o evil okay this is not the the actual translation totally the translation is in four words the child belongs to the bed and the fornicator receives only the rock this is the actual literal translation what does it mean it means that regardless of what you claim does the woman have a husband or a master meaning does she have a bed then whatever she brings or gives birth to belongs to the bed who's the owner of the bed well she's not married and she's a free woman this is out of wedlock khalas but no she's married who's her husband xyz the child belongs to xyz but xyz is impotent he cannot have children he's over 90 years old he's paralyzed for six years who's the father of the child xyz yeah this is the islamic ruling now we go to xyz do you challenge said no i'm happy i'm good bring six of them they're all my children khalas is happy with that we judge by what we see we have rules so the child was born to a husband the husband is the father unless the father denies it no it's not mine if he wants he goes to stage two escalates by lyan is to curse he's not mine he's not mine he's not mine he's not mine by all may allah's uh anger be upon me if he's mine and okay then we have to go to the woman she says wallahi uh he's his he's his he's his he's his and the fifth time wallahi is his and may allah's wrath be upon me if i'm lying what to do this is the islamic sharia law okay we have dna it doesn't work sure dna it proves every no no no no this is islam habibi dna is circumstantial evidence might you be used to support but not to indict or incriminate it's how many people in america were thrown in jail for 30 years because of dna and after 30 years said oops we made a mistake you made me lose 30 who knows the dna analysis and to to take the dna only a handful of people on earth so it's something dependent on your judgment not everybody can see this this is why and this is not our topic by the way so this the translation is wrong the prophet said the newborn belongs to the owner of the bed and the fornicator receives only the rock meaning he has no value nothing he doesn't have anything to get hold to and to show to people nothing rock okay no we didn't finish and he said to the prophet sallam told his wife to screen herself from that boy as he noticed a similarity between the boy and so the boy did not see her till he died nah this is dubious the ruling is clear the boy belongs to whom to zama his father so abd who's claiming that this is my father's child you take him he's yours the fornicator outback his brother sad said you have no right in this boy he doesn't belong to you but when the prophet saw that there is a resemblance between the child and utwa there is a resemblance in in physical features now this became what dubious matters ruling we have to rule it like the sharia i said the boy is yours but because of the resemblance the prophet ordered his wife alaihi sauda who happens to share the same name with that boy they have the same father but because of the dubious issue because of his resemblance to rudby said you have to wear the hijab you have to cover and she did not see him till she died he was what her brother he would inherit her if she dies this is the legal aspects but because there is a dubious issue the prophet said refrain now you know what dubious means sharia wise same father same identity card same siblings same relatives but due to this ambiguity and confusion she was ordered to wear the hijab from him chapter number four whoever does not consider dark suggestions by one's own self or similar things as dubious matters okay so who does not consider dark suggestions i don't know if this is one of batman's movies or what is dark suggestions i've been i've been doing counseling sessions for ages this is the first time i hear this description dark suggestions by whom no it's called whispers whispers of shaytan so this is bab who does who who does not consider whispers of shaytan as part of uh dubious matters why because we have to close the door of ocd wallahi if i tell you the amount of counseling session i do for people over ocd you'll be amazed you think that muslims are getting crazy ocd is prevailing and this is only attributed to lack of knowledge the oh the moment you have knowledge no ocd but when you don't have knowledge it builds up in kufur and whispers about allah about the quran about the prophet and it started from little things in purity oh i'm dripping urine oh my wado is not correct i repeat my wudu i take half an hour to do hustle and then it escalates little by little i have i made a lot of money out of this alhamdulillah allah protect this of people saying i want counseling session and i give them 20 sessions of what i divorced my wife but i'm not sure have i divorced my wife or not this is all what we revolve around sure i was thinking of divorce but i said to my wife i was thinking a song let's roll together so i thought to myself okay this is divorce because i was thinking of divorce i said were you having a fight no but because i was thinking let's roll together and i as if i'm telling my wife i'm going with another woman who am i marrying you which means that i will divorce you so is this ambiguous divorce i'm afraid even shaytan this is crazy i can't i cannot force you to do this this is from you and the guy comes back and back and back all what you need to do is have knowledge if you know that divorce doesn't take place unless you intend it unless you say it specifically not ambiguously ambiguously and that you don't have ocd and after that alhamdulillah he how did he resolve this issue by recording i said i'm repeating the same words over and over again please record this session he recorded it every time he wants to have one he listens to it yeah this is logical no need it ended so ocd is problematic but how to solve it through knowledge now listen to this hadith some people said oh allah's messenger meat is brought to us by some people and we are not sure whether the name of allah has been mentioned on it or not at the time of slaughtering that allah said to them mention the name of allah and egypt now this is problematic to most of the muslims what is the dalin what what do you mean by the daily no you have to prove to me that it is halal so what bring you video recording of it's being slaughtered it's halal the hadith is not so open that people go to russia who are atheists or communists or go to india who are hindus and just say bismillah and eat no you have to know the background the background is the hadith the full hadith o prophet of allah we have people recently accepted islam and this is very important it's not chinese if i go to china and they serve me meat and i say bismillahi eat it no this is not haral why because we as muslims can only eat the slaughtering of i made this statement once in twitter and they banned me for four months they say you promote slaughtering the jews and the christians the question was crystal clear what's the ruling on eating in america from mcdonald's and i said the slaughtering of the jews and crisis is halal which means that even if you are as good in english as i am you make mistakes when you speak to people not knowing their background any muslim would have understood it right the question is clear the answer is anticipated they think that i'm read the question don't be stupid read the questions it's about eating the meats no you said slaughtering you have to delete it i said no i'm not going to delete it for four months they suspended my account i appealed i sent to them quotations from the quran they sent back to me you have to delete it at the end of the day delete it so every time i speak about this i always bring this issue so that it remains in the back of our minds we are under the microscope we're muslims whenever you speak everything is being scrutinized never say something that may incriminate you or be misunderstood always be clear so the slaughtering by a jew christian or a muslim uh a butcher of an animal makes the animal halal for me any other denominations is haram a buddhist a hindu a atheist someone who doesn't believe in the existence of allah if they slaughter and say bismillah it's still haram because only these three men we are allowed to eat from their slaughtering so the hadith says these people just recently accepted islam they're not knowledgeable about the rulings we don't know when they slaughtered that they say bismillah or not this is the ambiguity in it so the prophet said do not consider this to be dubious what are the clear instructions are they muslims yes in this case whatever they slaughter when you get it you say bismillah and this would make it halal this raises and uplifts the hardship why the butchers here in kuwait do you buy meat from them the the biggest is americana we rely entirely on americana this is a kuwaiti establishment until and as far as i know do you know the butcher who slaughtered it do you know whether they pray or not do you know what they said bismillah or in the name of whatever so how do you eat it now people with ocd are starting to make their calculations oh okay i have to remove the meat in the refrigerator i have to do this the prophet is making life easy so don't go beyond the ease of islam and make things difficult now if you want to protect yourself and say i'm not going to eat of something that this is up to you the problem doesn't stop here the problem is when you do this five six months you start to look down at people oh from mcdonald's or burger king as far as we know how does he know it's halal how do you know that it's haram it's a muslim country it doesn't serve alcohol and the default is all the meat is was invited by a jew woman and he answered the invitation with his companions she put a lot of poison in the shoulder the prophet went and ate oh prophet of allah wait wait wait she's jew and the income of the jew as mentioned in the quran is from riba and from haram you should ask her did you buy it from halal means or haram no he didn't ask okay prophet of allah she's a jew you don't know if this is fallen from a mountain or was killed by suffocation or slaughtered you should ask no she's from the people of the book allah mentioned in chapter 6 that their slaughtering is halal for us their meat that they slaughter is halal for us so we can eat so the prophet acted accordingly he did not ask so do you know more than the prophet no so why make life difficult now if you don't feel good about it don't eat when you go to canada america don't eat i personally would go and check they sell pork or not they don't sell pork bismillah i eat i have no problem in that you feel better good for you but don't look down at people and start saying oh this is harald this is haram on your own thing because a prophet indicated clearly in the hadith you say bismillah and eat chapter number five the one who does not care from where he earns his money that is whether through legal or illegal ways narrated the prophet salallahu said a time will come upon the people when one will not care how one gains one's money legally or individually of course we change it legally into from permissible ways or from prohibited ways are we in such an era big time and the biggest problem is among the muslims why because they always play tricks and allow shaytan to play tricks by misinterpreting thing he's a brother with long beard i'm a brother with long beard and we find out that we have problems disputes what caused all of these problems and disputes misinterpretation i i say that i can take this money from our partnership because i'm entitled to it i did this i did that and he says i'm entitled to travel first class though oh i said from the money of the and everyone starts to make misinterpretation allah misinterpretation and conflict happens i was involved in a lot of this conflict solving between brothers and you will be shocked imams of masjid doing things that are clearly haram but they are convincing themselves that it is totally halal and they go to bed every night sleep like a baby but when you come to them and open their eyes and show them where the haram is they realize it without knowledge without being objective and sincere to allah you will always think that i have the right to steal from my company why we have people who are bearded or pray in the first row they steal from the company they embezzle them the wealth of the company why they didn't give me overtime for six years they told me in the contract that will give me this and that and they didn't so i'm entitled to do this do that he gives justifications for himself so the prophet is warning us allah beware not to be the opponent the prosecutor the judge and the executioner at the same time will you ever be at wrong because i have everything in my hands when we see disputes between a man and his wife usually the the man is the oppressor he's the one who's oppressing because he has the power of divorce he has the power of not giving her money or not letting her travel so he's the judge he's the opponent he's a prosecutor and he's the executioner at the same time and this does not exempt you from accountability on the day of judgment where you will stand in front of allah so from now on analyze every single penny that enters your wealth because you will be asked like we said yesterday you will you will be asked about every penny where you earned it from not only that and where you had spent it in as well this is chapter number six paid off talk [Music] he replied if it is from hand to hand there is no harm in it otherwise it is not permissible of course otherwise is not the correct translation the arabic word is can mean women but they're not asking about exchanging women it's not an orgy they're asking about transactions money so nissa means to delay in time of payment another word of it is nasia so now in order to explain this we have to explain what riba is so bear in mind maybe this is the last hadith because we have to a little bit give you a vivid explanation about what reba is riba is in arabic increase so whatever increases called irbu this is linguistically but the definition in sharia the legislative definition is the increase over certain items and what are these items listen carefully the prophet named alaihis six items what are these items gold in exchange of gold silver in exchange of silver draw the line here because these two categories have a special ruling of them then he went to say dates through dates no not grain wheat sorry wheat by wheat barley by barley which is shair and salt buy salt these are six categories the prophet said hand in hand being immediate and if these categories differ you can sell as whatever you want or however you wish so we have two categories gold and silver that are classified alone and we are and we have four items that are classified in their own category which are dates wheat barley and salt the types of riba are two riba allah says in the quran in chapter 9 what is nasi in this ayah in surat the idol worshipers knew that since the beginning of time allah made four months sacred months what are they uh correct i need someone to specifically say to raise your hand say i'm sure and if not i'll give you 100 kd these are the four sacred months the arabs knew that we should not initiate fighting we should not invade one another in all their idol worshipers sometimes they got squeezed at times tell you what let's call it another name it's not muharram haram is the following month let's go and raid so they delay months from their actual timing of the calendar so that they would change the ruling of allah and allah considered that to be increase in kufr until the prophet islam was sent to them and the whole year revolved to be exactly as was hundreds of years ago like allah has stated so what is riba and nasia is when i give you a loan 100 kd and you say i promise you to return it after one month after one month i come and i say give me my 100 kd or i'll give you two more months for 110. so the increase in the kd which is the same item was done in exchange of what of time delay this is called nasia there is something else called riba al fagle and fable is when you favor something over something so there is an increase and this happens for example if i have dates good quality dates and you have bad quality dates so you come to me and say shahasim this is 10 kg of bad dates in exchange of 2 kg of good dates of yours i said ok bismillah hand to hand halal haram and these are the six sorry categories that the prophet said that rebel fadal applies in it so gold by gold whether raw material material or uh made it has to be equal 100 grams 100 grams 22 carrots 22 carrots now you can exchange otherwise 101 is not permissible okay but the 101 is given because the 100 grams are new gold or has a new stamped in it so the one gram extra because of haram and this is found a lot in women she has a bracelet she goes to the jeweler's shop how much is this he weighs it he says 10 kd she says that design how much is it he says this is 15 uh 15 kd she says okay here is 5 kd bring me the new haram you're exchanging two gold items that are not equal then this haram what to do we will get to know this i don't want to confuse you because i just want to understand what ribeye is okay sheikh then excuse me but why did you classify these six items into two categories ah the scholars say that time evolves and progresses and transactions differ so why the prophet selected alisson these six items all of the scholars of all schools agree that these are divided into two categories one gold and silver and they said what is the what is the reasoning between putting gold and silver separate they said one they have many i will not go into details because you will sleep and you didn't have dinner yet so sleeping for dinner is not good i will confuse you i'll give you what sheikh hasan bin tamiya and our scholars have stated they said that gold and silver have what is known as ephemera they are something of value that people use as a price any water of the world you would like this ipad how many grams of gold 20 i would like take it willingly i have no problem because universally it's accepted to be a value something of a price to pay and get whatever you want to do in albayr so gold and silver we have no problem scholars said that anything that falls under this category would be considered the same ruling which as we know today is currency bank notes in the beginning bank notes were backed by gold or silver if you go to fort knots they have a reserve of gold in america and they used to write that whoever has this document will be paid in the amount of gold here in saudi arabia we until 30 years ago on the banknote it said to be given to whomever carries this document the amount equivalent in silver so in the beginning this is what they where did the bank note word come from some say that this originated in italy where the bank bank bank tour whatever they call is the bench the desk and people who had money they used to go to merchants for safe keeping so the merchants usually jews when you know what happened to the merchant of venice you don't so they come to them with a bunch of gold the merchant writes for safekeeping this is uh the amount of so-and-so the value of so-and-so in gold and everybody considered them to be the banks because they had this banquet or whatever and this was done by the prophet by the way in mecca they trusted him with their wealth so he used to they used to give it to him this is why he kept and left ali may allah be pleased with him so that after he migrated ali would return these money to their people after few years the money that i have with this merchant i'm too lazy to go and collect it the gold and buy things so i go to one of the brothers look at this document the bank note that guarantees that the merchant has this gold for me and i started to circulate it and he used to buy meat with it and the butcher would buy so they started circulating and the merchant became barclays bank became uh chase manhattan bank became and this is how few years later which is a few years earlier countries thought of this is lucrative people are considering dollar to have value yeah let's print five billion dollars okay what does what about the backing of it in gold who cares so now this is a different ball game altogether we will not go into it so gold silver and banknotes they all share the issue of feminia that has a value in a price which means that i cannot exchange one another unless it is hand by hand gold by gold it has to be hand by hand it has to be identical 100 grams 100 grams so what's the use of it no use why would i give you 100 grams and take 100 grams if it's the same thing identical in keratin and weight so the prophet said this to prevent it now exchanging others gold to silver can it be same weight of course not 10 grams of gold equals 1.5 kilograms of silver maybe so there is no similarity it's permissible to exchange with a condition that it is simultaneous give and take what and this is called an arabic surf exchange it's like money exchange it has to be hand to hand simultaneous so if i go to you and i say i have this 100 grams of gold i'd like it in dollars he said okay inshallah come after two hours halal no it has to be simultaneous you go and exchange kuwaiti dinars to euros i'm traveling to europe tomorrow he says okay come in the afternoon i come in the afternoon but i will not give you the money now because the transaction can't be done except simultaneously a lot of people say okay here is five thousand uh uh i'll come in the afternoon collect it haram this is part one category that is value on price part two scholars started saying hmm why the prophet specifically alice mentioned dates wheat barley and salt so scholars gave so many interpretations and ideas some said dates because they're sweet so anything that is sweet falls under it barley and wheat is something that is baked and stored you can store barley and and wheat for ages it will not rot salt is for anything that is used as spices so curry and other things it's all under scholars looked into it and said okay the reason is two things it's consumed and it's weighed either by size liters or by weight which is in kilograms or pounds and others added a third condition which is it has the ability to be stored so corn wheat barley raisins raisins are all considered to be riba items but when we come to watermelons can we have watermelon riba meaning i give you two watermelons you give me one big one no problem because it doesn't fall under the description oranges apples bananas lattice vegetables is all kosher i cannot store it most of these items are not weighed they're sold by items etc this means that iron with iron is okay so i have one ton of good iron and you have three tons of scrap and i deal in scrap i'll take this bismillah no problem whether it's simultaneous on the spot or here is one pure good quality iron ton of iron i'll take your scrap a week later no problem because it does not fall under these two categories did i bore you to death or i managed to make it clear inshallah okay so i think we have six minutes um for questions yes sir uh yesterday a brother was saying that he plans to return a loan and because it was over an extended period of time exchange of exchange rates or something is that does that fall under the first title let's ask you what do you think yes yes alhamdulillah no it depends has to be conditional meaning i give you a loan and this is a third category of the uh of the ribba which i did not go into because there is a number of issues which is loans and included in it the first scenario i i mentioned the deposit the huge deposit for the house this is not a uh arriba photo or this is i'm giving you a loan and i'm getting benefit of the loan a specific service or a specific favor the brother is asking about someone who borrowed money from a an individual and when returning the money he added something on top of it this was done by the prophet he used to do this when he borrowed things from people whenever it's time for payback he used to sell his tell his companions give him better so if he bought it to if he borrowed a two-year camel you say give him a four-year camel which is more valuable in price and he used to say the best of people in returning the loans are the best of people who give this is conditionally related to a condition when i give you the loan 1000 kd you said to me uh okay give me 1000 kd and inshallah when i'll return it i'll i inshallah be you know this winking and i understood khalas what you meant and i have no problem with that no this is haram but if you do it out of your own good will gesture well gave me a thousand kd i'll give it to him with a montblanc pen or a a another gift or a box of candy there is nothing wrong on the contrary it's appreciative because this is an incentive for me next time the brother comes and says i'm in need of alone yes because i've learned my lesson that doing good gives you good but i'm not anticipating because if i say yeah i'll give you a thousand kd but you know the brother he gave me this and this and this no this is insinuating as if i am telling you what to do no this is haram and this is between you and allah sir says that whatever is known by default among the people is as if it's conditional so now if we know that if i give you a thousand you will return 100 a thousand and 100 extra no this is conditional this is haram but it's not known and i'm not waiting and not anticipating i'm not insinuating you're not hinting and you give it yes sir you said now word is not bad the banknotes are not backed by gold or silver this is why i've mentioned in the early stages of defining the two categories of gold and silver and whatever takes their role in the sense of being of value and price now this 10 kd do you guys acknowledge that it has a value with it i can buy one two three four five so everybody acknowledges it does it have a value that i can go to the central bank and ask for gold no but i can buy gold worth of it so this falls under riba category i cannot give you 10 kd requesting you to pay back 11kd okay and quickly just a final answer bitcoin is too much i miss a long topic so let's say there is a currency exchange it has to be hand in hand and at the same time correct uh but let's say the currencies are different from let's say dinner two rupees which is logical because nobody would change rupees to rupees so at that time but the exchange happens on a delayed on a delay example now somebody gives me kds whereas i have to give the rupees back home but when i actually give it the bank takes time to deliver or to transfer from my bank to the other brand and so on so there is a certain delay that happens but the intention is there the agreement is there but it's a delay in the actual because i thought you would explain it to me anyhow the question is very important this concept if i recall it correctly is called in as saftey what does saftaja mean it means that transferring the money through someone who has assets over there like uh it's not money laundry it's illegal so you come to me and say awesome this is a thousand kd i'd like to transfer it into rupees and deliver it in chennai to my my father said okay i'll take xyz commission is this permissible or not the answer is no it's not permissible because there is no simultaneous uh handling how would it become permissible if i say to you okay come to me sunday morning at 10 o'clock which is 12 30 p.m in chennai and let your father go to this address where my agent is there with the cash money i will be selling you the 10 000 how was it a thousand or whatever a thousand kd into this much rupees and it will be delivered on the same time through phone call he comes at 10 o'clock salaam alaikum alaikum agent my agent so-and-so you've got the money yes i have xyz uh is his father there yes his father there so i give him the money and i say okay now give the rupees to the father he gives the rupees to the father this is a done deal this is called safterja the simultaneous transaction has been done okay what about the banks the banks is different first of all the bank has a different status than individuals because they are a financial institution and the guarantee of your money being delivered on time and as we've agreed upon is guaranteed not only that when you go to the bank and you give them 1000 kd on the spot they will say to you okay we will transfer trans form this transform it into rupees and it's xyz then we will transfer it on your behalf so the transaction of selling rupees and dinar has been made now they take seven kd for the wire transfer this is different from the selling of the exchanging the exchange has happened on the spot and now i've authorized them to transfer the money to that uh um but again they're not individuals so we would have the fear of their a financial institution back but backed by the government and this is why we cannot do transfers without this means and the scholars said that this is an exception of the general rule i hope this makes sense no if different character this is not a ribber this is not uh same because it has to be yeah yeah logically i will not do it and this is what the prophet wanted as a son you want to and and this is why okay a woman who had that bracelet how do what what does she do she goes and says how much is this he says how much did you say 10 10 kd so i said okay give me the money so the guy buys it from her she cashes the money the transaction is over or not simultaneous everything is is kosher now she has the right to walk out and buy it from somewhere else or now i begin a second transaction how much is this 15kd bring it please he brings it she gives him additional five to the ten she has in her hand this is a total new transaction there's no problem in that the exchange in one two and one is totally haram yes it's not enough that to put it on uh no this is she has to catch it now now the system what may be ambiguous to people is buying through atm is atm simultaneous yes yes the moment you give the atm and they swipe the card it's immediately in their bank account is simultaneous is credit card visa or mastercard simultaneous no this has a grace period this has a waiting p totally haram so atm you can do because this is cash in cash immediately there might be a confusion it's stolen they will not cash their money except after a certain period of time even with the credit note when you buy it through visa they will not give you immediately your amount it has a system and then there is a grace period for you 40 days so you didn't actually pay yes sir regarding the same gold transaction so sometimes we get requests from elsewhere saying that can you purchase this call for us is he authorizing you or is he buying it from you not buying now let's say this person sends the money on what account are you making profit out of it no no on behalf of this is authorizing you so we've we spoke about this issue now when he sent you the money and he asked you to buy it this gold 100 grams of gold on his behalf when you come and buy it from me are you giving me an exchange simultaneously yes of course this is hala then you send it after one year to him or after five months or one day no problem you're you are a representative of that person even if that person doesn't give the money i buy it by the way you buy it for your brother my brother calls me in kuwait they sell very good nice jewelry please buy this for me okay i buy it for a minute collect it from there i'm authorized i'm not making money or a business and profit out of it yes sir in our country there is like different agents they have empty lands and they start selling the files just the files for money and then they allocate the files as per the amount of land or as per the amount of money you have paid for it so can we sell the land before even it's allocated no you just have the files no you cannot sell something that you do not possess and that is not identifiable so the file that you get may be it's on a riverside which is more lucrative and it may be it's in the middle of the desert but you don't know because there are files and the government allocates these files and then decides after collecting money which plot where whether who receives it from sometimes 100 buy these files or only 10 will get allocated lands not all 10 so this is not permissible for you to sell because you do not possess something and you're selling like fish in the water i'm buying it from you i don't know allah maybe i'm this or maybe i'm that likewise when he buys from the government also he doesn't know what he's buying so this is not permissible generally speaking the first transaction is over she's it's up to her she can go out to somewhere else she can save herself trouble by buying it in the same place but the most important thing is she got the cash in her hand if she goes out the man would not say sister fear allah you have to no you said alhamdulillah he made he's making profit both ways so he's not going to hold you accountable or you can do whatever you wish i hope last question process so if we have a loan that we have taken okay it is how do we get out of it pay it quickly you cannot do anything people who've indulged in mortgage or student loans or bank loans do you think that if you go to the bank and said this and i've become practicing this is haram fear allah says they'll put you in jail so you have no other alternative but to pay it as soon as possible borrow from halal people and give it to them and get rid of it as soon as as you can see"
