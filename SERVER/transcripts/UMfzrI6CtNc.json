  "transcript": "my question is would it be Haram for me to address the disbelievers with honorific titles such as Syrian man regardless of whether or not I'm in the workplace and just with the intention of being polite and civil thank you there is no problem none whatsoever in showing respect to the disbelievers with something that is normal and does not give them superiority or an edge saying sir to a disbeliever or ma'am to a non-muslim is totally permissible there's nothing wrong in that in the Hadith the prophet Allah uh um addressed one of the dignitary of the disbelievers the idol worshipers by his nickname and he said have you finished and he did not call him uh by his name directly rather he's nicknamed by Abel Walid which is a sign of respect there's no problem in respecting people by addressing them you don't go to the president of a country who's a disbeliever and say hey Tom John dick or Harry no you say sir your uh um well I don't know what they call them but there is no problem addressing um the queen or the King by saying your majesty addressing the judge by your law the Lord or whatever they call them these are signs or titles given to them that does not show Supremacy or uh uh superiority uh to a person in Islam it is not permissible to call a disbeliever or a a hypocrite a said and the prophet said I saw him that there's a Prohibition that to call him a said the master because this indicates that if he's your master then you have angered your lord and Allah Knows Best"
