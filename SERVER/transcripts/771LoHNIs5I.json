  "title": "Zakat on a Loan - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "man which says do we have to pay the cat on loans that we lent to someone and is there any zakat on the debts that we all people so this question if I understand it is comprised of two different questions the first one the money that I've lent to others do I have to pay the cat for it the second question is the money that I've borrowed from others do I have to pay the cat for it for the first question the money that I have lent to others is one of two either the person who borrowed it is capable of returning it when I demand it from him or he is totally broke poor or he is refusing to admit it so one of the two if I gave 10,000 euros to a friend who asked me for a loan and when it is a year after or when for example - up is above the threshold and my whole my lunar year begins on the first of Shaban so when the first of Shaban comes and the man did not return my 10,000 euros i have to call him and I say listen I need my money back do you have it and he says yes of course I'll give it to you immediately in this case I have to give the cat if he did not return it or ask for an extension or I was shy to ask him I have to give the cat every single year but if I call him every single year before the first of Shaban and I say listen the 10000 euros and the guy says well aww hey I don't have I apologize but I'll try to give it to you in the next six month in the next year or he simply says I'm not going to give it back to you do you have any proof sue me what can you do in these two cases there is known as a cat on it because the money is not in my possession in the first case in the first scenario the money is in my possession as if it's in a bank because all what I need is to request it back and I'll get it in this case I have to pay the cat for the second scenario there is no zakat even after 10 or 15 years until you get the money once you receive the money just to be safe just give 2.5 percent for the entire a period janna for one year only because it was as if it was not there to begin with"
