  "transcript": "her second question consumes second question was changing the surname after marriage and the answer is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam cursed those who change their father's name or they attribute themselves to a lineage other than their lineages so this is something that is a major sin whether there is a dispute among some schools of thought which I don't really know about because as a Muslim I have the Quran and the Sunna and the various fat was around always coat this hadith and if you look at those living in the West or adopting Western cultures and ways of living you'll be shocked when you see that they are calling for women empowerment and for the liberty of women while their culture and their traditions mandate that once she gets married she loses her father's name her family's name and she's called after her husband what more of slavery would you want in Islam even if she married the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam she still keeps her own name sure aisha is known as aisha the daughter of abu bakr Hafsah is the daughter of umar and nothing in her name indicates that she's married to the prophet of allah sallallahu 1 who are you sinner maybe the title would help when we call her mother of the believers other than that this is totally prohibited and a major sin"
