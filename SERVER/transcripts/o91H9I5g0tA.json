  "transcript": "so in my school um I I have a female teacher and I didn't give her um the hand because I told her I'm sorry I can't because of my religion and she does doesn't got it um like she doesn't feel good about it yeah and she told me that I discriminate woman because I don't do it but I told her I do it because I respect the woman and I and I do when I greet my mother I kiss her hand I kiss her feet I do I love my I love woman I love my mother and I feel very lonely and alone when this happens uh like like when when they get it wrong I feel like alone okay so what's the question uh what like do you have advice what to do when they advice is very easy yes the advice is very easy there is nothing that you will do that will be they be happy with you they will never be pleased with you the Jews and the Christians until you follow their religion so no matter what you do no matter how much you compromise they will be fine with it so with all due respect if you guys don't respect my religion the hell with you I could care less what happens so they claim that this is discrimination what not to shake hands no it's not discrimination in my country tell her in my religion you don't have to tell her this but see the mindset in my country and my religion men shake hands with men they embrace them and they kiss each other on the cheek you want me not to discriminate well this is inappropriate in Spain kissing on the cheek with the opposite gender is normal is it accepted in your religion or in your culture no no no just only shaking hands and so there are barriers there are boundaries there are Customs that you respect why don't you respect mine and at the end of the day I could care less how you feel what counts to me as a Muslim is I follow what my Lord and my God tells me to do and I don't care about what any person else thinks so remain steadfast and imagine how did the prophet wasallam how the prophet wasallam felt when he called the idol worshippers and they abused him and accused him of being a sorcerer an insane person a magician an a poet a um a priest and the likes and a liar he felt also the same way you feel but this did not deter him or stop him rather it empowered him and it gave him strength because he's doing the right thing may Allah make us all steadfast on Islam"
