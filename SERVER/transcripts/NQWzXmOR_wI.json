  "transcript": "perfect with no pleasure or other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam he is away of what salat wa salam o allah rasool allah he a Leo Savio and wala I'm a bad welcome brothers and sisters again to a new episode yet a continuation on the issue of marriage and what does a sister look for in a husband we promised them to be dealing with the quality of Tolerance be intolerant but what exactly does that mean perhaps if you can elaborate on that she loud hum dil of sorts of salam ala rasulillah who are you so happy today with the hope i do tolerance is a quality needed in all humans and the more tolerant you are the happier person you are but in a husband it is extremely needed more than anyone else and because he is the captain of the ship and he is the physician he's a dentist sees a doctor he is the one in control if he is unable to manage if he's unable to in a sort incubate all day of these problems and deal with them then you have a problem and that is why whenever someone proposes to a family they should ask not his parents because definitely the mother say oh he's a sweetheart though he's a serial killer but he's a sweetheart in her eyes you should ask those who work around him you should ask the neighbors and that is why I person this is what I do when people propose to my girls I used to go to the Masjid next to did their house ask the imam do you know the person Severus Marshall he prays in the first row I asked him husband said yes he comes five times a day he reads the Quran he memorized the Quran okay this guy's religious commitment is okay in the surface I go to his work and I ask his friends I look at his hobbies if he is involved in that WA I ask those around him and the first question I ask or two questions you how is easy stingy or generous no he usually buys the sandwiches but okay this guy is okay on the spending part okay how is he is he impulsive does he break into rage attacks or he said well no masha'Allah he never fought we never seen him fight with others or quarrel or raises voice is always you know easygoing this is a perfect person for my daughter I give him a green how about people approaching the marriage or or seeking to get married but they're approaching it as if they are hiring somebody is there something wrong with that approach can you love her in sense that oh this boy is coming to marry your daughter and you say let me see your CV let me see your resume let me see what are your qualifications let me see your references here are the questions how will you treat this answer is that a right approach I'm asking I I worked in a chart for a long time so money I come from a human resources executive background and I tell you it is a profession how you price your CV so don't be deceived by what and the person you're interviewing may say or claim because you have lots of con man and a con man and lake are able to con you they can able to convince you so this doesn't give you the full picture it gives you a portion of it but you have to do your homework and investigate and his qualifications he see these the courses he took this is good but it doesn't add value to the marriage it adds value to his credentials to his work to his career but not to his marriage I believe what about I were telling that the man should be tolerant the way that the man that you described all you go he doesn't get angry soft is all of these things could we say maybe that some a man like that might be not man enough to sometimes put his foot now do we always want the man to always back down yeah something he reminded a woman wants to see ball that's what I'm saying like he wants to see both if you're always that passive okay northing ahead yes as you like do it I'll tell you true story one sister she hit her husband with the bars don't leave she'd be a man I want to hear one day to say no hmm yes yes yes this is a fact this is the nature of woman she wants to see that and you know what inside huh now I can count in you inside huh okay let me finish so this is this is very important very important being tolerant is something and man that's why you in the cell of the forefather they used to say a husband at home behaves like a child okay because this is here why behaved like a child means what means he offer looks means he is easy he plays I said normal the law and who used to crawl when his afford and the children jumping and him and when one of his governor's came he saw dad said what does this amirul mumineen said normal picked it quickly is it go tell me tell me about you how's the atmosphere in your house when you enter said me oh yes yes the moment I stepped in anyone happened who was talking or will keep quiet anyone standing would sit down anyone was leaning will sit he said really he said yes said you are not a governor anymore if you have no mercy towards your own children how can you have mercy towards the subjects because he learnt this from the Prophet Allah seller and another story mentioned in the book I mentioned I should attend this air by imam me say one of the Sahaba came to complain to Sena Rama about his wife the Sahaba the moment he reach armours house he heard the voice of C Homer's wife screaming at Roman shouting camera normal Deshea t run away and yet his wife is shouting at him oh you know it sometimes it makes you feel good when you feel people they have the same problem we're in the same boat so he said alhamdulillah I'm not alone so he decided to go back by then sit NORML open the door brother come what's the problem no no come come come come he said I came to complain up my wife I found the same thing that you have the same problem see see God said now am I said they said listen brother she looks after me how it looks after my children cooks for me okay washes my clothes stitches my clothes and he started listing her daily chores if she flares okay from time to time I have to take this is life life is give and take and this is happening also in the house of the problem imagine the Prophet SAW said when he got angry with his wives and you see you would not see my face for one month and he stayed in the message and you all know the story and the rumors weren't around that he divorced his wife and I he said I was counting the days on my finger twenty-nine days the top seller came back I sure what did I should at the door said the month is not over you said one month right that it is the plaster I said I said the month can be 29 days and can be 30 days okay subhanAllah imagine that it had this happens to you and you told your wife you would not see me for one month and after 29 days you came back and expecting her to hug you and she is telling you the same thing what would be your reaction the issue is exactly here that the tolerance that is needed is due to the fact that women have different moods and if the man also was moody then the marriage would not continue so many times and there are problems with the man and woman and the woman is so agitated divorce me divorce me and for a whole day and a half or two days she's demanding divorced and at the end of the day the brother says Haris you divorce and then she breaks into tears you too forced me sister you've been asking for divorce with the past 48 hours but you had the guts to divorce me and she starts to cry and weeping he has to have the tolerance and saying yes I will do this I would do that but be always in control because if he's impulsive if whenever she says a bad remark he gives her a ton of remark in return marriage would not be on the right track I think another problem that brothers often we touched upon this before but I just bring it from another angle is that brothers often treat their merit marriage like they treat their business so you know it's like a management so if you're a manager you deal with management you come home you want to manage the house you want to manage your wife and this is the thing is that women don't respond to things in the same way you know often and this is a major problem that that actually men and women both have this problem that you know sometimes you think when your wife's offloading a lot of problems on you she's saying oh this happened and that this happened and this and the man is sitting there thinking okay because the man he puts his thinking cam off and he's saying okay now let's how do we manage this and you know I'm gonna find some solutions for this problem and she doesn't want any solutions she just wants you to sit there and listen to her offloading her and just go home that's right yeah okay I see and so you're saying yeah that's right but the man thinks no I have to put my solution cap on and I have to manage this whole situation and I remember I stood my sister-in-law actually said to my brother-in-law listen you know he started offering said shut up I just want to tell you my problem again I think that sort of tolerance and that sort of empathy there just being able to sort of relate a little bit to your wife and what she's been going through in the day is very very important as well we're gonna have to go for a break and so it seems that we have men have a lot of qualities to gain in order to fit description of the righteous and pious and the husband with a good character so shall I will elaborate further after the break stay tuned a way of life away nice Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah vaca - welcome back so tolerance be intolerant covered hamdulillah does the husband have to be strong does he have to be trustworthy or I mean this is irrelevant to the criteria well this is mentioned in the Quran as we mentioned in the beginning that a large Dajjal said in the Quran verily the best of men to hire is the strong and the trustworthy this is been said by one of the two women who were trying to water their flock and Moses peace be upon him came and gave them a helping hand and left so they went back to their father who was old and they told him why don't you hire this strong man who is trustworthy because he's not you know sending his gaze and looking at us and checking us out the guy was walking in front of us he did not even address us directly he lowered his gaze so we believe that these are qualities needed in a man's strength and to be honest and trustworthy of course we've gone through honestly and trustworthy but what is meant by stress I have a have a nice explanation for this and I bring this up in our congregation plus pannacotta says that these are those qualities that will call you I mean and I look at people brothers in their jobs when they get a job firstly they need Cola right the strength to be able to get the job done so when a person gets hired for a job they have the qualifications that's the first thing and that you're looking for does he have the qualifications to get the job but then on the opposite side even though they have the qualifications are they actually gonna follow through and do it and that's amana because a lot of people when they get their job they know what work needs to be done but they just sit at work and procrastinate and check their email all day long and they get a paycheck and they didn't do any there's no amana and the person needs a boat and so brothers need to understand that that you have you need to have the strength be able to do what you need to do and at the same time they a mana to fulfill your rights in the context of that's for it seems that we're hiring someone but in the context of the why how does the wife how does she benefit from him being strong and being having a man how does that outreach a strength she I want to say even though we're talking about business and we're almost like approaching this as if we're wellies talking on behalf of the woman if this guy doesn't have a mana at work and he doesn't if her Phil is right he's gonna lose his job and he's not gonna pattern is gonna continue at the home so even though we're saying it might sound like a business context we're taking emotions out of it and we're saying we want you that be married to somebody who has the strength and has the amana and he can continue this in a surety but now let's been on the sisters and her point of view how does that fit in how does she identify this is we're talking about what to look for as she found out that this person is strong are we talking about physical strength are we talking about spiritual strength are we talking about what mental strength and then a trustworthy and in what sense that he's not gonna cheat on her that he's going to you know keep up with his promises he's not gonna get a second wife because some sisters think that the idea of getting a second wife is betrayal and therefore he is not trustworthy and so we have a lot of misconceptions that are present amongst the people maybe we can deal with them one by one well the strength essentially is a general terminology and the Prophet says our son as me Louie Chiron and allahi wa have been Aminah by if the strong believer is more preferred to allah azza wajal than the weak believer wolf equal in height and both have insha'Allah enough goodness in them so the first thing that comes into mind is the strength of religion so if I have married someone who is the six-four and and has lots of muscles but his religious commitment is weak then this is not what it is men he has to be first of all strong in his religious commitment he has to be physically fit so again if a sister marries someone who is physically unfit he's unable to work he's unable to gain money he's unable to fulfill her natural desires he's an impotent so this is he's not strong he has to be also strong in being able to take the right decisions so if she marries someone who's physically strong who is rich but he's unable to direct the family to the right path and he always makes the wrong decisions he doesn't consult he doesn't do his very best to find the best thing for his family then definitely she is not qualified to lead in your HR experience how do you how do you find people like that like like the way you're saying that they're able to fulfill what their because see the thing is brothers that maybe they're looking to get married and they're very young and the way that we're talking you're talking about a mature person who's gone through many hardships in life and and has finally figured out this is what they need to do but sometimes they at that stage in their life they don't have these qualities come there are qualities that there are decisions in their lives that give us an idea a glimpse of what the future might hold for them is that an ounce a had what are those see I could tell from an HR perspective I could tell if someone has changed six or seven jobs for the in the past year that this guy is not being able to make half for himself so this guy is impulsive he keeps on changing and there has to be a problem with him among the qualities is that when you interview him youngsters have to make mistakes to learn but if the pattern of making mistakes is prolonged then there is a weaknesses a deficiency that has to be addressed so when a sister looks at a person who it has been steady in his studies for the past 18 20 years mashallah is he did all of his schools in the university in high grades his time is managed then this guy is definitely stronger than someone who skipped school then works then goes back to school then skip school it keeps on going like this what are some signs about consistency in their deen and strengthen their Dean there's so many like I know we're saying oh if he doesn't pray Federer in the message then don't get married I know a lot of brothers won't get married if that's the kid and maybe that criteria uh-hum doula it's a great standard but what are some more practical things for we accept the minimum if he plays the five players he doesn't miss his friends because we have also to be practical many of the sisters are desperate they want to get married okay so that is the the best to get but if masha'Allah he is trying his best and he doesn't miss his prayers and and so you know he can improve he doesn't do harm he doesn't do harm blonde okay so we have to be I mean here tolerance okay okay but since you mentioned that the the ayah okay with you there this is very beautiful ayah okay and the the story and how the girl find out how did she find out that he was a strong okay because here in this context it is the physical strength because he is referring to because the commentator they said we see first of all the what they called I think they call this gallantry in Asia Hama gallantry yeah gallantry in English here that we found those two sisters I mean tending their flock of sheep away from the men okay sisters away from the man they are not mixing with the men so he approached them because the reason he approached them that there must be a reason why they are out because normally it is the man who does these things not the woman so he said Maha tokuma what's wrong with you well yeah so they said they explain to him that we don't have I mean men we our father is old and and we cannot water our flock of sheep tell the men leave so he looked and he saw another well covered they said he took the lid the cover with one hand moosari Salah that's why for Wakasa who to Allah so he just hit him and the man fell dead and he what house did the the bucket and gave water etcetera and he went and sat in the shade and they went early the father said what's this year so early today and they told him the stories that go and call him Fatima listen sisters Tim she Allah Ya Allah so one of them came walking in a state of higher modesty pash furnace shyness not if you looking at him that my father is inviting you now hear how he that how she found about is Amana it's just worthiness Musa said don't walk on front of me walk behind me and don't talk to me you want me to go to the right throw a people they'll go to the right to the left throw petal till they reach immediately the girl said the abacus that year oh my father hire him this is the best he's strong he can look after us we can protect us and he's trustworthy and the father was smart Rehema hala he realized that the girl is hinting what from marriage between getting remarried sir immediately he realized that he wants to get married so he got him married to fun so the story is so beautifu this reminds me actually on the topic of Amana and I know like where father's here one thing that I have in my mind that if a man ever comes to propose to my daughter and then I find out that he was talking to my daughter without my permission I would automatically say he doesn't have a match and I would reject him just on that and I think that a lot of sisters need to be told about this that if a brother is coming and talking and I know the situation is is hard in a different situation but inshallah Todd if you have a good wali that you want a brother that you're gonna get married to your boy a man that has a man and he's not gonna bypass the Welli like other qualities which the sisters should look for he has to be cooperative with the wife special in terms of teaching and learning I guess this should trigger the discussion on in the next episode about the in-law and the relationship between husband wife and the parents of both in and what should one look for in that sense so Sock'em Locklear for tuning in and we will catch you in the next episode bathed in light allah wa salam alaikum wa rahmatullah america we"
