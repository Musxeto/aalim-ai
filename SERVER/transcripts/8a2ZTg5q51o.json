  "transcript": "fabian he says i have a lot of uh friends who are from india and pakistan who are strict hanafi's and they have lots of wrong things in their prayer so when i talk to them they are agitated they don't accept my advice so how should i speak to them you cannot speak with such people whether they're hanafi shafi maliki hambali every school of thought has such uh ignorant imbeciles who only see like a horse on a track race what's in front of them and don't see the full picture so are you muslim said yes i'm a hanafi are you muslim yes i'm a hambury no no i'm asking are you muslim or no yeah i'm humbly i'm a muslim okay but just say muslim because if you say i'm a muslim humbly if i call you to the quran and the sunnah would you comply or say i will follow the hambali madhhab why would you follow the hamburi madhhab and not follow the quran the sunnah simply because they're ignorant they don't understand what the quran is what the sunnah is if their peers or their scholars tell them something that is totally against islam they would do it even if the quran says don't do it they would do it so such people you can lead a horse to water but you can't force the the horse to drink the horse has to do it himself so such people it is best just to be on good relationship terms with them and not speak about religion because they will become your enemy and they will label you as a wahhabi as a fundamentalist as this as that just because you are telling them allah says in the quran and our prophet salallahu they don't accept this so if you find people who are willing to talk and to learn and to adhere to the truth yes go ahead and give them that one you"
