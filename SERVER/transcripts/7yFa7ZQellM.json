  "transcript": "gentleman over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad and anatomy the ryu no ham modeun mala ali he was happy he ajma'in embody dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this fifty third episode of the islamic shock we talked about breastfeeding suckling and all that is almost connected to it as this is part of the chapters that deal with divorce with marriage and the things that make a person or a child prohibited to get married to or from then the jurors usually talk about a very important issue which is custody and a child's custody is taking care of a child when it cannot look after itself and bring the child up looking after it physically mentally protecting it against anything that could be harmful to it and so forth so custody in Arabic is Habana and it is derived from the word haben which is a when you take your lap as a creative for a child or when you embrace a child this is problem so when you take a child you protect a child from anything that can be harmful and of course custody is referred to usually when divorce takes place because while the parents are married by default they both give custody to their children because they're still married but once they are divorced then this is where the dispute takes place so what is the ruling custody is mandatory it's obligatory when the parents are married because they both have to take care of their children this is the obligation in Islam no one could say no it's not my obligation I'm not going to take care of it they both have to take care of the children and usually it is the financial obligation of the father and it's the ain't it internal obligation of the mother within the house yet the scholars put a lot of emphasis on the father side because he is the one who's supposed to up bring his children and this is called edible how to bring him up to be respect respectful beautiful not using vulgar words treating people with kindness this is usually looked after by the father so nowadays they stay home mom is the best person to do this yet due to the nature of the mother which is based on mercy and being kind and soft this tend to be a little bit difficult and the strictness and the discipline of the father must show in order for the child to learn and to adopt what is being forced upon him rather than being requested as as in the case of the mom fight so this is understood when they are married but what about when they are not married anymore in this case we have two options either the child is accepting different guardians or sort of custodians to take care of them in this case it's a cumulative obligation as long as it is in within the five or ten people circle one of them taking the responsibility is sufficient so that the others would not be sinful for that but if the child only accepts one to be his custodian and rejects the others totally in this case it becomes an obligation upon that person because if that person says no this is my right to take the custody or to let go I'm letting go if this is the case then the child would be harmed if not maybe killed because the child is of accepting accept that particular individual so it becomes an obligation upon that individual usually the mother is the one if the divorce takes place who assumes the position of the custodian and we will come to mentioning this because this is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam when a woman divorced or was divorced by her husband her husband wanted to take the child away from her so she complained to the prophet alayhi salatu salam who in turn said you have the right to the child ahead of him unless you get married so this hadith is crystal clear that the one in charge of the custody or in the one deserving the custody of the child is the mother unless she gets married now this hadith is the main source for a lot of the schools of thought over the issue of custody and believe me it is not an easy thing to decide it's not all black and white because there are a number of factors that are involved among them would be whether the person that is the mother is qualified to be a custodian or to take the custody of her child or not so the hadith basically talks about an ideal situation where the mother is a practicing woman she takes care of her kid and this is the norm but there are exceptions and due to the exceptions it is the responsibility of the Muslim judge to look into the case and decide and in a nutshell all scholars of Islam say that it is the benefit of the child that comes so after all of deliberation and looking into the father's guardianship and the mother's mercy and kindness and where the child would find itself what counts is the benefit the true Islamic Bella of the child and we will come to discuss this because to be a custodian of a child it's not only to give them money so maybe the father is a multi-millionaire and the mother is a poor woman and people think with their own judgment that is limited that a rich father is definitely better for the welfare of the child than a poor mother and this is not true because taking custody means that the custodian has to look after the child feeding nourishment internal and external cleanliness and these are all materialistic things but he has to also take care of or she has to take care of when and how he sleeps plays the affection he gets and all other requirements which means that it it's not only money that counts as they say money can't buy you love but when a child is growing and is in need of love this is extremely essential to be provided for the child now from that hadith as well scholars understood that always a female is given a priority over a male and this is what the majority of school scholars say and this is debatable so they say if we have a mother and a father who should we give it to by default a mother hadith is clear what about if we have a father and a grandmother the mother of the mother the majority of schools of thought say give it to the grandmother Jefferson Tamia may Allah have mercy on sauces no we give it to the closest who's closer to the boy definitely the father so he has more concern than care over his own child rather than the mother of his mother and this is again a disputed issue and this is where the Muslim judge comes in handy because this is what judges are appointed for to solve problems to solve conflicts otherwise why would we have Islamic Courts and Muslim judges and so many times people come to me complaining of this and that which had happened between them and the siblings or even them and their parents and I would tell them go to the Muslim court and file a case and they're shocked to see sure how can we file a case against our mother well if your mother made an unfair judgment so your father died all of you shouldn't hurt she as a mother or as a wife of the deceased must get 1/8 of his wealth instead she is preventing all of her children from selling the house the different properties the companies she's she has blocked the bank account of the deceased and the children saying that she's not giving us a penny and our father left millions what to do share the only thing possible is to go to court sue your mum oh this is disrespectful chair this is being undutiful not a lot this is your right in Islam you're being respectful and beautiful you've been obedient to your mom but this doesn't mean that she has the right to steal you or to deprive you from your rights in Islam this is what a Muslim judge is appointed to do therefore whenever there's a conflict between us regarding the custody of the child and we're unable to solve it peacefully and diplomatically which most cases are they divorced the couple were forced to separate one another due to the mistake of one of them so the husband who divorced or who was requested for fuller has bad feelings about his wife ex-wife and the woman feels betrayed he divorced me after all these years after all what I have done too for him so they don't have good feelings the sense and in a way towards one another and this is why Allah mentioned in the Quran the beautiful verse of through the verses of divorce when Allah spoke about divorce and the rulings he said while I attend self Allah by nakum do not ever forget the good times that were between you two and definitely every marriage had its good times had its ups and had its downs so a true just Muslim must always remember the good times and act upon them rather than seeing only the bad times and behave accordingly so when people go to the judge with this dispute they are asking the judge to give them a verdict where both sides would feel comfortable and accept that insha'Allah this is the ruling of the Muslim judge which indicates that this is with the grace of Allah the ruling of allah azzawajal rather than keep building up hatred and enmity towards one another so through the court and there is no harm done now who would not accept the call of the court those who have hypocrisy in their hearts because this is the ruling of the Quran and the Sunna if they reject it or dislike it then they have to we check their Islam once again we move on to the conditions and that are applicable to the custodian so anyone can be a custodian anyone can take custody of a child as is known there are conditions and these conditions most of them are logical and some of them are based on other evidences but we cannot go into details we have to understand that most of the issues covering the custody are HD hacked this came from scholars who could not find a lot of evidences backing these things up so they came up with their own opinion according to their knowledge according to their previous readings and research about different issues in this regard bearing in mind the benefit of the child so the first condition is that the custodian must be a Muslim now people must understand that Muslims have the priorities sent my priority is Islam I do not care what Human Rights say what the laws of a country say what counts to me as a Muslim is what Islam says and I have to maneuver within and I have to weigh the pros and cons so that I would not put myself in trouble I would not jeopardize my safety or the safety of my child this is why whenever someone says what's the ruling on a Muslim marrying a Christian woman we often get this question either due to the fact that this brother is living in a Catholic country and he's unable to get a Muslim born Muslim so he sees this Christian woman who doesn't have a guardian who doesn't have any problem going out with him dating him and definitely marrying him is a plus and she has does not have the same requirements of a wedding of a dowry of this and that like the cultural Muslim women do so she in a in a in a in another expression if we can say that she's cheap not literally but she doesn't cost much to get married to or because she is different than the Muslim women he's used to so he doesn't like Burnett's he likes blondes for example so he rushes to marry her we say hey this is not appropriate he says why is it Haram didn't Allah mentioned in chapter 5 verse 5 that we can marry women of the book of the people of the book Jews and Christians so why are you saying aji I'm not saying it's Haram I'm saying it's inappropriate because we have thousands of cases where after a couple of years of enjoying marriage after she gives birth to one two three or more kids something happens and she decides to call it a quit call it if you wish mid-age crisis call it that she's fed up she found a better solution she doesn't like your guts anymore she doesn't like anything she just wants a divorce so she takes the divorce and by law in her Catholic country she takes the children's custody and most likely half of what you possess cars houses businesses she takes half of it this is the kafir man-made law then you come knocking on our doors and weeping and saying what can I do my three girls are whither I can't see them and she's taking them to church every Sunday sure what can I do my eldest daughter is getting married tomorrow to a Christian man and I have no say I cannot do anything well as he I hate to say it but we warned you and you didn't listen so this is a big problem and we're not again saying that this is Haram that marriage to a Christian woman is haram and all of Allah this is permissible in the Quran but you should only attempt to do it when there is a real need for it or you feel that this woman is really close to Islam or you are desperate either this or falling into zina there are many reasons that would justify but just for the sake of marrying someone while there are numbers of Muslims around you at least you take care of a kid then you have to look into it so the first condition is that the custodian has to be a Muslim which means that the hadith where the Prophet said that I thought was Salaam you have the right to the child ahead of him unless you get married this is when the woman the wife is a Muslim if she's a non Muslim Christian or a Jew she cannot have the custody of the gustaf a kafir cannot take the custody of a Muslim child because this device is taking care and providing the best upbringing to the child a kafir cannot do this because the kafir would up bring your child to be a kafir like him or at least not to force him to make any decision you are becoming Muslim you've all become an atheist whether you want to become anything up to you and what kind of upbringing and taking care of a child would that be definitely not acceptable secondly this custodian has to be a sane adult so a child whose parents had died cannot be given to his brother who's 14 years of age he's not an adult he needs someone to take care of him let alone him taking care of his kid brother and he has to be sane so I can't give the custody of a child to his autistic third grade brother or sister if the mother is mentally ill and she cannot take care of herself or harms herself due to a mental illness I cannot trust the child to stay with his mother because she's not sane thirdly there has to be integrity honesty in chastity so if a man divorces his wife the wife goes and claims the right of custody the judge looks into it is she a chaste honest woman with integrity the husband comes with ample proof and evidences that she is a woman that is not chaste she has great deals of immoralities in her she goes to nightclubs she has boyfriends coming over some of them staying the night and the guy has evidences privatized investigations confessions of her relatives and the judge can see that from the way she's dressed she is coming to court with a miniskirt flashing her flesh how can he give the custody of a five year old girl to such a woman definitely this is out of the question and this is not something that can be black and white so some courts consider a man shaving his beard to be fist a an obvious apparent sin which according to the parameters of the scholars is something that deprives a has a father from custody of his kids because he's shaven he doesn't pray in the masjid he has a television television set and he watches movies and listens to music all of these are sins so the majority of schools of thought say that this cannot be a good and suitable guardian to his son some scholar said that whoa whoa whoa now you guys are dealing way overboard among them is dignify it no km says it is right to say that integrity and honesty cannot be a condition for someone to take the custody of a child despite the fact that the scholars of Hanbury and Cheri schools of thought as well as other school scholars consider it so so this is an issue of dispute to make it a condition he says you know by him it's very difficult to justify how can we justify such a thing had it been so if we would make integrity and honesty a condition hadn't been so most children would be lost and the community would face immense difficulties why because not everybody is perfect so yes maybe the father is well shaven clean-shaven and doesn't pray in the masjid but he cares for his son way more than any other person he protects his son he feeds his son he gives a son loved and tried to make him the best person so his sins is something that is between him and Allah his transgression is something that is between him and Allah as long as it does not impact the cha the boys or the girls safe upbringing the fourth condition is [Music] physical and financial ability to look after the child if the Guardian is blind how will he take care of the child if the garden is handicapped and cannot move without a wheelchair for example how would he take care of the child if he is poor and doesn't have a house and keeps on being kicked out from one premises to the other and he cannot barely feed himself let alone feed the child so this does not fulfill the conditions of being a custodian we respect people with special needs but a deaf person or someone who is unable to communicate would not give the best upbringing to the child and hence cannot be a suitable custodian to it fifthly the custodian must be a person of good common sense so yes he's loving he's caring but if he is not sensible whatever money he has he can spend it in a minute and his wanders the wealth of the childhood he's supposed to be custodian of so such a person would not be a suitable guardian or a custodian for the child now all of these conditions apply for both men and women but there is a condition for the mother where the Prophet said that Islam you are entitled to take care of him unless you get married the humbly school of thought said that this hadith is as it is but the most authentic opinion is that even if the woman gets married she can still keep the child providing that she's married to someone related to the child ah so now we understand the hadith in a different way if the mother of the child married someone who's a total stranger to the child in this case the hadith applies we take the child and give it to the father of the boy but if she married someone who's related to the child so for example a man divorces his wife and she marries his brother so now she's married to the uncle of the child there's no problem in that because he will take care of the child as long as he gives his approval and has no problem in his nephew being brought up in his house there is no problem in keeping it again in sha allah there is also another condition that scholars had put and again these conditions are not all based on the quran listener but they are understood from the Quran slept because allah azzawajal kept this issue within the parameters of the scholars to look into within their ability to come up with rules and regulations so one of the conditions is that the custodian has to be a man especially when it's a girl so if a girl's father dies her cousin cannot take responsibility and says I am her custodian because he's not Mohammed he can do that just until she reaches the age of 7 and after that that's it she has to go to somewhere else either a Maha male an uncle a brother a grandfather or to a female a female cousin would do because the same gender we have no problem but to have a man taking care of a girl who's not mahom to him this is totally prohibited in Islam okay there are a number of rulings applicable to custody among them is that the mother's relatives always have stronger claim to it than the father's relatives and we said that this is what the majority of schools of thought say yet this is not the most authentic the most authentic is which even taenia says that the closest to the child is more worthy of it so a father and a mother by default the hadith says the custody is for the mother a father and a grandmother the man is not there anymore or she's not qualified so the judge is choices are the father and the mother's mother the grandmother the majority of scholars say the mother of the mother takes it but even Tamiya says no there is no evidence from the Quran or Sunnah saying this so we give it to the father because the father is closer in the absence of the mother so all what you see here such as the child's mother but when there is a factor that prevents her taking custody such as failing to meet its conditions then the child's custody transferred to her mother that is the grandmother then her grandmother then the child's father's mother then the child's full sisters so they're insisting on giving it to females all the way from the mother's side if not then from the father's side etc but this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic is the closest of them so if we have a maternal aunt and a paternal uncle definitely the maternal aunt a full sister or half a sister the full sister gets it because she's closer she's assisted from the father and the mother and likewise if a brother a full brother from the father and the mother and half a sister only from the father's side definitely she goes well the child goes to the full brother and not to the sister who's half sister and this is the most authentic opinion so it is the father's responsibility for payment of the child's custody so okay the mother took her child the divorce took place they fought over custody the mother of a child was awarded with the custody it's not it no the father of the child is responsible for his clothings for his feeding for getting him a place to live in with his mother and siblings if he has siblings so he's responsible for payment financial payment for his children and unfortunately I get thousands of complaints of children stating that after my father divorced my mom he left us for like 20 years never contacted us never sent us a penny never cared about us and these type of fathers would be held accountable on the day of judgment if Allah willed that they should suffer in this life then this is a mercy from Allah that Allah is making their torment and punishment here in this dunya but if they are living a good life an easy life everything is being facilitated for them then let it be known that in their graves after the death and all the day of judgment they will suffer immensely for this grave and serious sin that they neglected the children in such a fashion so how long should the custody be what's the duration of it well scholars say that when the child no longer needs the assistance and the care of his guardian this is when the custody is over so if a child is self-sufficient he's grown up he's become an adult then there's no need need for custody anymore and some scholars say that this is when a boy reaches 7 years of age and a girl reaches 9 years of age and they have different evidences backing this up some make it a little bit more some make it a little bit less and the other views are when the child reaches a level of understanding and ability to choose he's given the right to choose so the judge brings his father and mother and addresses the child who will you choose from them and whoever he chooses he's awarded custody and if the child changes his mind three months later then he is awarded custody to the other spouse or the other parent because what determines the custody now is the choice of the child and he can change as many times as he wishes this is where he finds his heart and tranquility so that the judge immediately Awards the custody to the one that the child had chosen and this was backed by a hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam told a child once this is your father and this is your mother take either one's hands and the child took his mother's hand now this issue of giving the choice to the child is an issue of judgment by the judge because at the end of the day what we want is the benefit of the child so if the mom and dad are both righteous practicing Muslims would care for their child immensely whatever the child chooses we give the custody to that parent that the child chose but if the child chose and explained to the judge he says I'd like to go with my father because my mother always nags me and tells me to study and to offer my prayer and to sleep early while my father lets me play with the kids down the hood and he never tells me to pray and he makes me eat sweets and whatever I want immediately the judge would say well you are given to your mother because she knows what's good for you and definitely your father does not know what is good for you so what counts is and Muslera the benefit of the child this is what counts most and this is what the judge would usually take care of and be sure that it is sought after and implemented for the benefit of the boy or the girl so we will stop here in Shama and we will move to the questions and in the questions we have question number 30 Pharrell says what if the husband is not taking care of his wife financially and she has to work well allah azza wajal stated in the Quran Allah Jalla WA ala an-nisa bmobile allahu baba havana barton will be my answer who minimal men are guardians over women for two reasons one due to the fact that Allah preferred and favored men over women beautiful de la ba ba ba ba ba ba and due to their financial expenditure this is why if a husband is unable to fulfill his wife's financial duties he is unable to provide her with a house he is unable to provide her with a daily allowance to eat and drink and go to the doctors etc whether he is stingy by nature or because he is unable in this case the wife has the right for separation and she's not obliged to obey Him and she can also refrain from giving him intimacy at night due to the fact that he is unable to fulfill his duties as a husband this is not a charity it is something you have to do in exchange for I what I have to do for you in return so if a husband is not taking care of his wife financially she has all the right to divorce him not to ask for her rather to divorce him because the judge would immediately award her divorce due to this inability of the husband to provide for her now she says that she has to work no she does not have to work it is his job to provide for her and if he does not what's the point in staying in a marriage when she has to work might as well work and ditch him why stay with him if he's not man enough to provide for you so working in general for a woman is okay as long as the conditions are fulfilled so she can work in a segregated environment she can work in halal jobs she can work when there is no danger for her to keep safety and security yeah this is okay but to say that wallahi my husband is not providing for me so I have to work in a mixed office where I sit with strange men for 8 to 10 hours every day I see them more than I see my husband definitely you cannot put fire next to fuel and pray to God that pray to Allah that it does not catch up fire this is impossible so you have to make a decision maybe you have to involve your parent to speak to him and force him if needed to provide for you and your children even through court some men take this for granted and they say why would I pay a penny from my earnings when my wife works and she has a good job and she can't pay the rent she can pay the schools of the children and she can buy her food etc yeah that's fun yeah this is like going to the fun fairs and having someone giving you money to play this is not manhood this is not how a Muslim behave with his wife Mohammed Park says what about a man who does not give his wife her rights and does not accept to divorce or to accept holer which answered this I think maybe later before and said that if a man does not divorce and his wife is unable to stay with him she gives him her dowry back seeking divorce and he still refuses this is not a real man a woman who does not want to live with you anymore be a real man and set her free why would you keep her in bondage enslaved when she doesn't want to live with you anymore have some dignity and try your level best to talk her out of it but if she's adamant and insisting let's enjoy if you don't you're sinful at the side of Allah for whatever she does and she has a hamdulillah the right to go to court show her case and the court would summon her so-called husband and the court would either ask him to divorce her to accept her if he decides not to then the court would do facade resolvement and breaking of the marriage overruling any decision he has and she would and that the court would force him to separate and she could go and marry someone else if she wants lyric says shake what is the ruling praying in a message that has innovation in it like doing the f car in congregation raising the hand at the end of the supplication sending salutation upon the Prophet Alice of Sam after the Adam should we pray there and then leave after we give Salam or should we say that car in ourselves like the Sunnah says and stay because of the reward that is staying in place until we finish the dhikr first of all this message it is a message of innovation meaning that the people there are full of innovation and what is the ruling on praying in a message of innovation the innovation can nullify Islam such as the innovation of grave worshipping or stating that the Prophet a son is not a human being but rather he was created from the light of Allah which is his attribute or claiming that the Prophet knows the unseen alehissalaam and that is e is has a nozzle and that he controls the universe as he can control the palm of his hand and that he rose the world's and attend gatherings which has molded in it etc all of this nonsense can take a person out of the fold of Islam so you cannot pray in such Sebastien and your prayer is invalid behind such any man who has such blasphemous beliefs there are not founded neither in the Quran and the Sunnah never ever practiced by the Companions or the tabulator cemetery simply a clear innovation but a tech fee innovation that takes him out of the folder Islam other innovations do not take you out of the fold of Islam such as believing in the Mawlid doing congregational dora saying ask our that were innovated giving thinner and not upon the professor salam in the message a reciting salutation before the I then or after that then publicly and loudly all of these are innovations but a person is still a Muslim simple but Muslim so yes in the first you cannot pray in that Masjid in the second you can pray in atmosphere now your question is should I remain seated after the end of the congregation while they're doing their public innovation such as congregational vicar Andorra or should I leave no that's a you must live staying would then gives them quantity gives them amount credibility and people would look at you home I saw a big gathering because you're there but if everyone following the Sunnah immediately leaves the the prayer hall or the Masjid and as his car on the way out they would know that oh there are people following the Sunnah who are not approving of this innovation and their numbers would be less and less every single day so this is what you should do in Allah knows best lyric says I have a question that is not maybe very essential to know but just to gain some knowledge we know that those who are given the book from the right are the people of paradise and those who are given their books on the left are the people of hell what about but is there any fatwa for those who will go to hell until they are free from sins and then will enter jannah those people from which side the book will be given may Allah bless you Allah knows best this is in Allah's knowledge we know about the people of Jannah we know about the people of Hell the right and the left those are who are in between most likely if eventually they will go to Jannah they will be given their books in the right but we don't have a clear indication a clear line to separate between this and that so we say Allah knows best safer to say that rather than to speak without knowledge Allah hanim Fatima says who is the double-faced one the Prophet as a son said the worst of all mankind is the double-faced one who comes to some people with one face and to the others with another face the hadith is crystal clear Fatimah you can understand this from the explanation of the Prophet a son a man with a double-faced who goes to the righteous people and pretends to be righteous and practicing and making dhikr and interested in what they do as a fee has nothing to do with anything else when he goes to the sinners to the innovators he mocks the righteous people and practicing people's as well yesterday I've been with these people they act so funny they speak so funny and they are like a bunch of hypocrites man I love their life you guys live and this life of theirs is is horrendous they shouldn't and they need to get a life so he is a man with two faces pretending to be this and pretending to be that Amiata says can someone call allah with the 99 names every day i have acid this before i think well like in this platform or somewhere somewhere else i'm not sure but you cannot call allah with his names as thicker so i cannot say a hundred times Allah Allah Allah Allah this is disrespecting Allah's names you can repeat you can call Allah with these names if you have something to say to him and I've said this I think here now I remember if someone says you're awesome awesome and I said yes maybe he keeps on saying awesome awesome I would say that this guy is crazy or he's disrespecting me but if he says awesome give me a book there's no problem but here's the book when you call Allah you have to ask him you have to beg him so you call use the 99 names of Allah which was which with which is relevant to the name so if you say for example the most powerful you don't ask Allah for forgiveness you don't say all most powerful forgive me and when you want Allah Azza WA JAL to destroy Israel for example you don't say all most merciful most forgiving destroy Israel this isn't appropriate this means you don't know the meanings of Allah's beautiful names and attributes so when you want forgiveness city r-rahim and how many have mercy on me Yaga for allah fear allah have forgiveness so you call allah with the suitable name and you ask allah with what you want rather than just repeat the name without any benefit of that and allah knows best madara says my cousin lives abroad for the past 10 years his wife is living with her in-laws with a boy but her husband doesn't communicate with her or his family is the marriage valid that's it yes if the man is married to his wife even if he does not speak to her for 50 years she's still his wife if she if he dies she wouldn't had it and she has to spend the four months and ten days Rinda but why would such a woman stay married to such a person this is dependent on a number of factors maybe she doesn't have any place to live if she were to be divorced so living with her in-laws is the easiest of the two evils maybe she has hope in him coming back one day you never know so these marriages are dependent on the circumstances and reasons why such no communication takes place and they are still married without any doubt until he divorces her or she files for her last question in Greece says in the West people with good credit can buy a car with zero interest the dealership usually finances the car is this transaction permissible especially if one has enough saved up to pay it off immediately in case of death now if you did not say especially and the statement that followed I would have said yeah no problem but when you say this especially if one has enough saved up to pay it immediately in case of death made me feel that this is Arriba based contract so if you are in the West it's a non-muslim country most likely I go to the dealer's job and GM Motors and they have this beautiful Escalade fully packed meant beautiful so I say how much and they say this is like 60 or 70 thousand dollars to go that's a lot of money I can't pay that this is no problem you have good credit we trust you we checked on you and you've never defaulted on a loan so we will sell it to you for five years where you will pay monthly X amount of money zero interest so I decide to do drool Wow okay I'm on for it no wait wait wait before you go share its interest free zero interest why are you stopping me hold your horses five years no interest what happens if you go past these five years so if it's a six year if you default it on a payment or two I don't know I didn't ask well this is the time for you to ask you have to go and ask them if they say it to you it's interest-free for five years after that we will take interest because you did not fulfill the conditions and did not abide by the given period of time in this case it's Haram its riba based so even if you have enough money saved to pay it immediately then pay it immediately why by installments this doesn't make any sense so no if there is a candy in stipulating that if you default or if you delay payments for a month or two or more that they will charge you a negligible amount of interest this is totally haram and prohibited and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best this is all the time we have for
