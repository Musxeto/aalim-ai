  "transcript": "he is asking about the etiquette of uh visiting the rauda and there isn't such an etiquette raul is just a part of the masjid it was highlighted by the prophet saw he said that between my house and my member my pulpit is a garden of jannah meaning of because of the people who sit there and anticipate for prayer and make viki and recite the quran and attend sessions of knowledge but the area itself has no significance in my knowledge that is more than others so any praying two raka's to the right of it is less in reward than praying two raka's in it no there is nothing to my knowledge about this"
