  "transcript": "the next question is that is bringing people back to life in fortnight video game Haram well I hate these video games are not realistic so killing them and bringing them to life usually has nothing to do with reality because you see people flying so we will ask his flying halal because we know that only birds fly and this man with the power he obtained after killing 10 monsters start had it had the ability to defy gravity so all of this these things are nonsense are fictional and it has nothing to do with actual beliefs or rituals of other religions to bring people to life it is simply considering that character as a robot that has energy so once the energy is gone the juice is right we have to energize him so if we energize him by giving him few tokens here or there or coins or whatever then he becomes alive again it seems it's it's a silly game but it has nothing to do with silk by saying oh look look your son is giving life to the dead excuse me I don't who killed him in the first place so I wouldn't go to that level of saying that it is Haram however I believe that all video games are a waste of time I personally do not endorse it I do not do it at all well Hamed with the grace of allah azzawajal and i don't see it any fit for people to play such games maybe if you want to play tennis you want to play FIFA I think they call it maybe a is if it's like 5-10 minutes half an hour a day not distracting you from salat or from your obligations yeah maybe that would be except but to involve in pub G or fortnight or other thing that deals with stealing cars I don't know Auto to something other these games have bad influence over the person without him knowing it when you occupy your day two to three hours with violence so the minute someone comes to you you grab a big knife and you switch it into an ak-47 you switch it to an m16 or to an Uzi or to a grenade or to a rocket launcher or what is this yeah we're talking in boom he could you kill the person this with time develops to be aggressiveness we see this with children with the siblings but it also can be translated to aggressiveness when a boy or a man goes out on the streets and he has a fight someone picks a fight with him while driving a car or at school and all what he can think of is to harm if not to eliminate my opponent because this is what I was brainwashed to do this is what I'm trained to do in martial art classes what do they do how do they become good fighters by repeatedly doing a drill so you block a new attack you do this 500 times a day it becomes instinct while you're walking someone throws a punch without even reflect without knowing it's a reflex if even if your mom did this to you said what are you doing Oh without even noticing you do this to your mother why because you're trained to do this it becomes part of you likewise these games are so dangerous that it would drive to be violent without intending it analyzers on those list"
