  "transcript": "uh Shan says that can a Muslim use luxury products if he can afford it if a person can afford it to buy two sport cars live in a big Bungalow wear branded clothes and watches have a good luxury uh luxuries uh and or luxurious lifestyle can he live uh like that because in the Quran it is stated not to be extravagant so thus it means not to use lues uh and luxurious products if not then why sir in all wealthy Arab countries people use big cars live in big houses use luxurious products including Saudi Arabia if it is not permissible then why Arabs live such a life I often get similar questions and the question itself there's no problem in it the problem is when you associate the Arabs the gulf countries Saudi Arabia as if people are so envious they have so much hatred in their heart to what the Arabs are doing now having said that we have to be balanced I'm not defending the Arabs I'm not defending the gulf countries we have black sheep everywhere so this happens everywhere in the world whether it's in the states or in Europe or in uh uh uh Africa or in Asia it happens everywhere we always have black sheep second of all we do not take a country or a region or individuals as representatives of Islam so don't be delusional we never say that Saudi Arabia is the representative of Islam or the Gulf countries are the representatives of of Islam Islam is judged through the Quran and Sunnah individuals are judged through the Quran and Sunnah countries are judged through the Quran and the Sunnah and the more they are closer to the Quran and the Sunnah the more they are compliant with Allah's law thirdly when we look at the question buying two sports cars living in big mansions or as sated Bungalows and wearing branded clothes Allah Asel state in the Quran that who is it that made what Allah has made Halal made it haram who is it who comes and says that this is Haram what Allah made so when I go to the Quran and Sunnah do I see that Allah forbids me from wearing branded clothes no does Allah forbid me from living in a big house a big mansion no on the contrary the prophet said four things are among the things that bring happiness to an individual what are they the prophet mentioned a big house and a good wife and a good ride so even this is part of the things that Allah brings Joy to the individual ual so no one can say it's Haram now what the brother is saying that Allah forbade extravagance forbade wasting money uh uh unlawfully and Scholars say that we have to look into this instruction and it depends from one person to the other so we have highly paid people very rich businessmen uh Traders uh Executives and we have middle style people and we have poor people so for those who are in the highest level if someone's income is let's say 100 or 150,000 R and I know people that have such an income so if they're getting paid approximately uh Â£2,000 Sterling a month if he buys a Mercedes e65 for example AMG or if he buys something that is decent but it's very expensive is there anything bad or wrong in it no his income allows him now is he buying it to show off is he buying it to humilate others and he feel arrogance in in him if he says I'm practicing I have this long beard I pray in the Masid I never do Haram I I do all my uh obligations in Islam I said this is permissible if he lives if he has 100 million R and he lives in a 5 million real Villa with a swimming pool with a tennis court what's wrong in that this is Hal as long as he needs it so if you buy a mansion that has 100 rooms and it's only you and the old lady and couple of kids now this is Haram this is extravagant but if you buy something that suits you and uh uh uh OCC that is fit to host those who come to you without an extravagant then this is halal insh"
