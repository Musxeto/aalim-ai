  "transcript": "she says the hanafi scholars in my country make life difficult so they say that women should not pray like men first of all we advise such scholars and students of knowledge to lower their gaze and not to look at women how do you know that they're not praying properly but you're looking at them so lower your gaze and don't look at them secondly the prophet alaihistalatus had his female companions praying in the masjid with him and the other male companions yet they were at the back of the masjid as far as possible yet there were no barriers between men and women like we do have today this meant that men coming late could easily see women offering prayer standing in prayer never ever the prophet alice islam had instructed women to pull their legs together when standing up and not to stand normally like men or like normal people he never told them to cave in themselves when doing roku or sujud or to sit in a particular way into shahood rather he said pray and this is for men and women as you've seen me pray therefore to come and claim well the prophet islam did not teach the women how to pray properly and to conceal themselves but this doesn't mean that we shouldn't do this that is a bit outrageous a muslim should not have the audacity to come and say and claim that i know more than the prophet or the companions i'll teach women how to pray which the prophet salam fell short from doing are you accusing the prophet of not knowing or are you accusing the prophet alaihis with holding information and not delivering to the muslims either one is blasphemous so i know that they have good intention good intention is not always recommended or approved the son of abdullah and i believe his name was bilal once heard his father narrating hadith and his father said the prophet said alaihis was do not prevent women from attending the prayers in the masjid bilal out of jealousy being a hot-blooded muslim said we will prevent them from attending the masjid because he he had seen the abuse that some women made when they went to the masjid wearing flirtiest clothes and putting perfumes and defying the other instructions of the prophet saws so he said this out of what he thought of as a goodwill gesture to protect women folk to protect the society not realizing that he's objecting and defying the instruction of the prophet and this there's no justification for that no matter how good intention you had abdullah he heard this objection and defiance from his son to the instruction of the prophet not to prevent them he cursed him and said bad things to him the narrator of the hadith said i've never heard abdullah umar may allah be pleased with him ever speak such words and he kept on yelling at his son i'm telling you the prophet says something you say no we will do against it go and leave for wallahi i will never speak to you again and allah stood at his words and never spoke to his son despite the numerous times of him coming to seek forgiveness and apologize until abdullah died and he would not speak to his son so when we come to these scholars and what they have come up with with their good intention we may say okay may allah reward you but this is inapplicable in islam we follow the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations and what you're bringing it does not fall under any of those and allah knows best"
