  "transcript": "Muhammad from the Philippines he doesn't say the atkar after the prayer when he has to leave the Masjid for an errant or to do something because on the way home there are lots of trash junk and impurities okay this has no impact at all on the contrary instead of not doing anything and not saying anything while walking this najasa or walking through this dirt you have to remember Allah azzawajal and this elevates your status so there's no problem at all saying that car even if you're going through a junkyard"
