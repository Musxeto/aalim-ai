  "transcript": "uh Sheikh I have a question uh so basically I wanted to ask you about the concept of like the Detachment from the world uh and maybe if you could like give us an example like if you practice it like how do you practice it practically now so because what kind what kind of concept I did not get you uh it's called in Arabic I think it's called zohud or in English it's called Detachment from the world worldly Affairs right so the sulcus okay okay exactly with a D in the end it's a D in the end z i h u d z u h u d okay okay I will I will answer you inshallah so basically speaking is to detach yourself from worldly matters that do not get you close to Allah azzawajal now what are is different because Vora is not to do something for the fear of falling into sin so um this is Haram I don't know might as well leave it this is what I is this is halal but I'm not gonna consume it because it's not gonna get me closer to Allah it would delay my journey to Allah azzawajal so basically speaking a person who is in the state of zurud would most likely not be indulged in buying fantasy cars big mansions investing a lot of money because he feels that this derails his journey to Allah azzawajal not that poverty is good for him not that he doesn't enjoy these things but he feels that it may delay his progress towards being a righteous God-fearing individual so this concept has to be governed by a number of factors for example knowing what Allah made halal and what Allah made Haram knowing what me we may think that it is good to stay away from while in reality this is shaytan trying to make life difficult for us so if you look at the prophet's way of life he was the master of all azuhad he was the best in zahood Allah gave him the choice between being a prophet and a king or a messenger and a servant and he shows the latter jibril came and said if you wish I can turn this Mecca into gold just for you so you'll be the richest man ever to walk the earth when you have all of this gold for you and he declined he could have lived like a king he could have lived like a wealthy billionaire but he chose to live like a servant of Allah azzawajal where food would not be cooked in his nine homes fire would not be lit except once every two months and if he wanted otherwise he could have had this happen to this is Zod now each one of us know what is best for him and what is closer to Allah when he fixes his heart accordingly and synchronizes it accordingly six of the ten haven't bound of the companions where millionaires and some of them were billionaires but this did not negatively impact their um journey to Allah so we have to know how to balance and Allah Knows Best"
