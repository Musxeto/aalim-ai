  "title": "Can I get reward of praying taraweeh with imam if I pray only 6 or 8 rakah & leave? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "prayers to get for you or do i have to pray the whole juanita in the mighty or if i pray like six sakura or a trash or sandra he gets rewards praying taraweeh was mentioned in a hadith where the prophet alaihis allah said whoever prays ramadan meaning night prayer in ramadan which starts from isha ends at fajr whoever prays night prayer in ramadan anticipating the reward from allah azzawajal believing in it allah will forgive all of his sins so this is the norm that you spend the whole night or most of the night offering prayer to hadjud tarawi night prayer whatever you want to call it this is too difficult for us to do so the prophet alaihis gave us a discount and he said whoever prays with the imam meaning taraweeh prayer from the beginning till he concludes it with with her this regardless whether it's half an hour or an hour long this would be equivalent at the side of allah as if that individual prayed the whole night meaning from asia till fajr and this is a great reward for such an easy action of half an hour or an hour is it mandatory no it's not so if i prayed six raka's and left you will be rewarded for six sakai's for these 10 minutes that's it am i sinful no you're not sinful but there's something wrong with your head because if someone comes to you a multi-billionaire and says listen i can give you a million dollars and i can give you ten dollars what would you choose whoever chooses ten dollars would we say that he's sane he's smart he's a genius or the opposite definitely the opposite so allah is giving you this huge reward of praying the whole night just by putting yourself in the message with the imam until he prays he's with her and you can go home and you refuse this is up to you and you are the winner or the loser"
