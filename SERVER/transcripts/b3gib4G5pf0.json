  "title": "Used to crash weddings during times of ignorance, how can we expiate for our sin? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um in times of ignorance we used to crash weddings meaning attend weddings being uninvited so nobody prevented us because they thought that we either belong to the groom or to the bride's family so they allowed us in so should we expiate should we pay the answer is such sins are negligible indicate in the sense of if you were to ask the hosts they would say it's okay come eat there's no problem in in that because they are generous so i believe that repenting to allah asking him for forgiveness and making dua for those who fed you would be allowed and sufficient be nilahi as you"
