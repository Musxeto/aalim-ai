  "transcript": "yes it's nice to to meet you my question it's about throwing stones like like is it to slow okay what about them because we we know of a Hadi where the Prophet prohibited flowing stones apart from from the apart from when it's needed like in hting and and okay so what what's your question my question is about slowing stones at like when you are chasing animals CU it's very common like when you are when you are when you are like when you are chasing like a card or a you can SL the you can that no problem okay I got your question the prophet sallallahu Alam prohibited and this is taking a small Stone putting it on your thumb and doing this with it especially at others and he said that this is a harmful thing that has no value but it may pop some someone's eyes or break someone's tooth so this is prohibited but if there's a legitimate reason such as a dog is approaching and you throw the dog with a stone that's the legitimate reason if you are a shepherd and you would like to uh uh steer your shepher your sheep to a a direction and you throw stones at their side or at them so that they would go to the right or to the left there's no problem in that"
