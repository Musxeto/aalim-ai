  "transcript": "bismillah r-rahman r-rahim al-hamdu lillah wa salat wa salam ala rasoolillah Ali he was so happy he woman today beholder assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have hadith of even Omar may Allah be pleased with him with us today which we will begin with from the telecom regarding how the Qibla was changed so hadith number 68 who would give us the order to read it the brother there put it as the people were praying the dawn prayer Suba at UBA a man came to them and said it has been revealed to the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam during the night and he has been directed to turn towards the Kaaba so they turned towards it their faces were towards sham oh they turned around towards Kaaba in slim this hadith is referring to an incident before when the prophet isin was in Mecca he used to face al-masjid al-aqsa in Jerusalem because this is how he was instructed by Allah however he used to put the Kaaba between him and Jerusalem so you'd be facing both and they had no problem they used to offer prayer like this when they traveled to Medina and found that the Jews also pray to Jerusalem and they started saying that look the Muslims are mimicking us there imitating us they don't have their own religion they are following us the Prophet as son did not like this because his heart was always towards al kaba which is the foundation that was set by Ibrahim his grandfather peace be upon them all so he used to go out and he used to look at the heavens waiting for a revelation from allah azza wajal as allah described that to us in the quran but Liuba logic of asama that we can see you're turning your face here and there and we shall give you a tip that you will be satisfied with so finally allah azza wajal revealed to him that you have to face the Qibla and that was before fajr prayer one of the companions who heard this verse went to cuba and we know that kuba is one of the important messages in islam masjid baba we know that praying to records in it is equivalent to Ramallah and that is why most of the people who visit Medina when they're going out or will be coming in they pray to volunteer our hearts to attain and to get this great reward so the man went there and as you know Makkah is to the south of Medina while a sham and Palestine and Jerusalem is to the north so a man passed by and he saw the people offering Fechter prayer headed to the north so immediately he told them while they were praying it was revealed to the prophet alayhi salatu salam that the qibla has been changed and now it is to makkah immediately the Imam who was in the front and they're all facing north they switched to the other side is 180 degrees and facing the car by the Imam now he's here he's in the back and the worshippers are in the front they continued or completed their prayer and that was the last prayer to be prayed to the direction of Jerusalem now a lot of the people said this is changing their religion they don't know this they don't know that as Muslims we believe that abrogation is part of a religion the Jews don't believe in abrogation at all so they reject all kinds of obligation to us we could care less as Muslims we know that allah azzawajal the Wheelz rulings and verdicts according to the people's level of thinking and then he obligates it subhanahu wa'ta'ala because now it's they are prepared and they are ready for taking the final command also from this hadith we learn that if a one person if one person reports something to us we have to accept it we don't need to have two or five or ten to report the hadith to us to accept and this is known in the most volatile hadith and also in a solid work as Hubble Wahid the narration of one a lot of the schools of thought considered hubba-wha hate to be not of strength to initiate something or to prohibit something they say you cannot make a ruling in Islam by one individual by Hubble wide you need a lot of people so that you can add something or say that this is prohibited or this is part of the deem and this is wrong hadith no mark Ebner hoppip for example in a man armed alumina yet this hadith was only reported by Omer so it's considered to be Hubbard a hat or hadith a hat yet it is widely accepted by the Muslims and likewise these Muslims who were praying these companions were praying in Cuba they accepted the information of one they did not request a second or a third to confirm enough for them to learn to know that the Prophet was revealed to that table has changed and it immediately they done what needed to be doing also we learned from this hadith that if you did not know if you do not have the knowledge Allah would not hold you accountable where did we learn this these companions initiated and started their prayer to Jerusalem and in the middle of the prayer they were told that the crib law was changed they did not start another prayer they continued the same prayer therein and that is why if you have a guest in your house and he started to pray the in this direction and your table is in that direction you simply turn him to the appropriate direction and he doesn't have to make the prayer all over again because this is what his knowledge and he thought that the direction was in this direction and the following hadith hadith number 69 who will read this for us yes nanus emissary rahim allah we went to receive and has been Malik rose yellow and who when he returned from sham I met him at a place called Ain a tunnel I saw him offering prayer riding a donkey with his face to this direction that is to the left of the table I said to him I have seen you offering the prayer in a direction other than of the Qibla he replied if I had not seen a Las messenger so low ELISA l'm doing it I would not have done it hari this hadith is in compliance with the previous hadith of the Prophet RA salatu salam travelling and offering voluntary prayer while travelling to the other than the direction of the Qibla and this is what Anna Sybil Malik did and he reported that the prophet alayhi al-salam also did this so we learn that when you're traveling and you are praying voluntary prayers not mandatory that you do not have to face the Qibla and you may compromise when it comes to bowing and also when it comes to prostration because this is the Sunnah of the Prophet as Salam to give us the permission to do so now if someone is praying in his house is it a must for him to pray standing up voluntary prayers or can he pray sitting down yes microphone for him to stand up voluntary prayers yeah well yes in volunteer praise is compulsory for him to stand up this is not correct the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam the prayer of a person sitting down meaning in voluntary prayers is half of the prayer of a person standing up so this means that if I would like tonight to offer thirteen records sitting down is this permissible completely it is permissible but I will get the reward half of those of those who pray standing up when it comes to mandatory prayers the answer would be no it is a pillar that you pray standing up otherwise your prayer would be rendered as invalid we move on to a new chapter and this chapter is regarding the Imam and regarding the straightening up of the rose hadith number 17 yes Prabha narrated Anessa blue malik the prophets allah sallam said straighten your rows as the straightening of rows is essential for the perfection that is completeness of the Salah now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is not talking to the individuals he is addressing the masses in the sense that if you praying on your own you don't have a road to straighten but if you're praying with the congregation you have to show discipline you have to show unity and you have to show that you are complying with the Prophet Sunnah by straightening up the rope and if you refuse to do this then this would affect your prayer negatively we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back and hamdulillah have salat wa salam ala rasoolillah and welcome back straighten up the rose is essential for our prayers because the Prophet Aristotle said I'm told us that this is what the angels of Allah do he once came up out and he said why don't you stand in rows like the angels do so they said how do the angels tank a prophet of Allah and he said they complete the first rows and they straighten the rows and narrow the gaps so this is the way of the angels and by doing this by imitating the angels in what they do we get to follow the Sunnah and at the same time we get the reward from Allah Azza WA JAL edit number 71 anyone yes brother narrated a new man evening Bashir the prophets ll Salim said straighten your rows or Allah will alter your faces or create dissension amongst you who carry Muslims narration the messenger of allah salla allah sallam used to straighten our rows as if he were straightening arrows until he saw that we had learnt it from him one day when he came out stood up for prayer and was about to say Allahu Akbar when he saw one man whose chest was bulging out from the room so he said servants of Allah you must straighten your rows or Allah will alter disfigure your faces or create dissension amongst you Muslim this hadith again speaks about straightening the rows and the Prophet puts arrays callosum great emphasis on it why because it's a sign of unity you know a lot of the non-muslims are astonished they are shocked and some of them even may accept Islam when they see the Muslims in their prayer once a man was asked do you think if we have four hundred thousand people can we make them stand up in a queue or in a line how much would it take us and the man being a general in the army said oh this is an issue of discipline probably you take us like four to five hours if we're talking about soldiers and etc and when it was displayed to him the Akama in harem people are walking praying reading Quran doing this going around the Kaaba in less than 30 seconds when the hama is given and the Imam says Easter ooh Eric said you loo look at it what happens complete order everything is in place and the man was shocked and astonished this is not human yes it is not human it's divine it's from Allah oxygen therefore we pay a lot of attention and put up and put a great deal of emphasis on straightening the rows and tightening the gaps as the Prophet said that is also because the punishment is severe the punishment would be that allah azza wajal would create dissension among us and this is obvious in a lot of messages a lot of the arrogant people won't like people to come close to them and you end up in the prayer straighten up your rows and you say Allah Akbar and you find that the man next to you is going to the right and the one next to you going to the left so you spread your legs and you spread them a little bit more and they run away and you're chasing them throughout the prayer and then you end up stretching like doing karate Zoar take one dose what is this I'm trying to narrow the gaps and these guys are running away as if I have some illnesses or disease and they run away from you and you end up with having so many gaps between the people why what does this result in in hatred in dissension I looked down at him and he looks down at me we never give Salam to each other why because we don't have the love of the Brotherhood in our hearts I wouldn't feel embarrassed or I wouldn't feel annoyed if used your shoulder - my shoulder and your foot - my foot on the contrary I would feel comfortable but a lot of the Muslims don't do this unfortunately a lot of the Muslims even instead of standing normally they stand like this with their feet and even if you stand normally some of them they have this illness this disease with the small toe they start digging with their nails in your flesh and you keep a little bit away and they still doing this like I don't know what are they doing what are they looking for and all of this is not part of the Sunnah and after the Salah he shouts at you every time I try to get closer to you you go far away from me okay you're not getting closer to me you're injuring me look at me I'm bleeding and not only that the soul of the prayer is gone we're supposed to have kosher you're not having kosher you're only concentrating on sticking your foot to my foot not only that I have seen people will lie instead of putting their foot like this they put his foot on my foot now I am irritated so I take my foot and I put it on his and we start doing this and the prayer is gone we are not praying we're playing so this kind of attitude has to be changed this sanshin the Prophet is threatening us a little Absalom we will not have the love for each other we all have hatred we will have this arrogance in us straightening the row is extremely important in our religion otherwise allah azza wajal would cause us to fight among ourselves as we can see this nowadays so do you have any questions related to the topic this is more about the traveler who's travelling and a why he's travelling he enters the Masjid when the Imam is praying with the Jamaat so with regards to shortening the prayer do the same rule apply or what are the combinations that can you know that's a good question and even a basket may Allah be pleased with him was asked a similar question he was asked why does a traveler when praying behind a resident completes the prayer and when a resident prays behind traveler he does not shorten so what is the determining factor even Abbas said this is the Sunnah my brother so all scholars agree that when a traveler prays behind a residing person he must complete his prayer even if he prays only one raka with the Imam for example Lahore prayer I missed three Rockets on the fourth I joined the Imam while travelling so I finished what raka with him the Imam offers Salam I complete three Rakas though I'm traveller I'm supposed to pray 2 rakaats scholars say that he has to complete so this is the Sunnah this is how it was by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as bloodbath said Pam Adama my question is also regarding travelling as we had discussed in the previous session that we have to stand for the prayer I am is a pillar but we know that when we travel when we men travel we can do that some of the Muslims unfortunately they feel shy about it praying in front of the masses but regarding women is it also for them that they stand in public and they prostrate and they do ruku or rather if there is a corner plate place for them they can sit and finish the prayer over there so what should be done with women are like men they have to pray standing up there is no exemption in the Quran and the Sunnah it's only in our minds so if they are fully veiled and fully protected when they pray there is nothing in them that calls people to look so they have to pray standing up if they are able to do so Salam aleikum Salam very pray the whole is trained in the cab lies so but most of the people they join the little finger with the other person little finger but however if we go to follow the correct way that is running ankle with ankle the row it is tilted so what should be done in this case if you're asking about the tilt found in the Masjid the Prophet said Ras salatu salam that this is permissible in the hadith vinyl mesh really well Mallory dribbler what's between the East and the West is tabla south a scribbler so imagine the Prophet is saying South is pitler if you go this far it's okay the deviation but if you're asking about the ankles to the ankles this is Sunnah if the one next to you to your right and left is knowledgeable in knows this soon and is comfortable and doing it do it if he's not stay away from him but you have to narrow the gaps by at least the shoulders some people are irritated with the feet but the shoulders is the most important thing yes brother assalamualaikum shaikh long I usually travel by train in sleeper class we are on my seat I constraint and there is no place where I can pray standing can you explain how to offer for Salah the same answer as usual if you are unable to stop the train and you're not able to stray standing up pray sitting down Allah says in the Quran but the full llaha must apart and fear Allah to the best of your ability I can't no you have to stand I can't you have to stand allah awj it doesn't tell you to do something you cannot so pray sitting down and inshallah Allah will accept this as well yes sir slowly I've got two questions one is the earning the women of women in the state of julu and this is immediately followed by a menstruation cycle so hold the she prefers it if I'll take only one question as the brother is asking if a woman is in the case of sexual impurity and she immediately gets her menses so is she obliged to perform what soon and the answer is yes she is obliged to perform whistle because the hawser is for the janaba though she is not going to pray but she's going to recite the Quran she's going to make dhikr and she has to be in the set of purity from janaba but with her menses King cannot offer prayer or fast yet she must perform what's all for that reason last question when in a plane or a bus if you are able to stand as well as to face the Qibla but you are not able to maintain the qiblah the direction so is this a level yes it's sufficient in the case of plane or a train that you face the Qibla in the beginning and then the train Falls to other direction or the plane goes to another direction this does not affect your prayer continue a prayer because you started it well and you're standing and you're fulfilling all the conditions and a large Dajjal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
