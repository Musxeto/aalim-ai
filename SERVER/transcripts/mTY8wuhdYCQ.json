  "title": "How to repent & repay for being late to work? Is money earned during such time haram assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh she my question today is uh about repentance for example I want to know uh if a person goes late to work for example we know that it's uh we cannot the money that you eat that you have not been paid for is obviously sinful for you so if the person let's say like goes late to work and how to repent from that for example like do we have to go to the person who is paying us tell them this and that apologize every time it happens and then repent to Allah or what is the correct way to repent from this first of all this is too generic some companies have a policy of 15 minutes forgiveness so if you have to punch in your card at 9 and you come at 9:15 they're okay with that anything more than that they will hold you accountable some companies don't so if you come late and this happens on regular basis of course you're sinful and the money you're taking is Haram for these minutes or hours that you're late if you can compensate your company or your employer by working after working hours or working on weekends or coming other days early to fulfill your task and do it if you have unfinished business then that's inshallah fine it would be good but if you actually don't work more than four hours or five hours a day and the 3 hours are free still this does not entitle you to come late or leave early so you have to either speak with your employer about about it and to fix it or to pay the money that you've taken unlawfully for these hours that you did not show for and give it back to the company and Allah Knows Best"
