  "transcript": "is it a major sin or shirk or to read comics or books that include time travel magic communicating with the debt or coming back to life even though these stories have nothing to do with reality or any religious beliefs and there is absolutely zero fear of getting doubts as these stories are childish childish and nobody believes these are real first of all we have to look at things through the lens of islam in order to know whether this is permissible or not because nowadays people measurements of things is at fault the measuring stick is wrong so people weigh things according to the customs the traditions logic everybody's doing it and this does not work with islamic rulings because islam is a defined religion that has boundaries that has sets of rules and regulations which makes everything easy to be judged according to the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors so in order to look at the issue of comic books novels stories books we have to look through it in accordance with the quran scholars differed a vast majority of them said that this is totally prohibited because these are a set of lies and fabrications and a muslim does not lie islam does not endorse lying or cheating or making up things so a chunk of the scholars said that this is haram some other scholars said well we have to look into it if morally it is a good story that has a good benefit to the reader and it does not include anything haram so the whole structure of the story has a good ending builds up courage honesty truthfulness in the reader's head and evil loses it doesn't beautify evil it doesn't include anything haram some scholars say that this is permissible because allah mentioned examples to us in the quran and he set an example of so and so doing so and so which is not a reality rather it's an example to us to learn from and stories that people know that are not true and they are fiction as long as nothing haram is included this is a part of teaching people with good moral conduct islamic beliefs and entertaining them at the same time now having said these two different views i'm inclined to the other one and this is opinion may allah have mercy on his soul providing there is nothing haram what do you mean by there is nothing haram anything of the unseen is totally prohibited so mentioning angels hellfire mentioning jinn reviving the dead giving them life changing the form of an animal to a human being or an animal to another animal all of these things are blatant lies and only allah can do this so even if it's in the novel or sorry this is totally haram to write or to read when you talk about time travel this is nonsense because there isn't any such thing and just to make up the id and to have the ripple effect from going to the past and changing events which would mean to change the future which is the present and blah blah blah all of this is not possible and cannot happen and it's claiming to change people's fates according to what is going on this is totally prohibited magic having magical powers to do things magic is haram in islam which leads to harry potter's novels and stories and movies to be all impermissible for muslims to watch and the list goes on so at the end of the day we are limited with very little amount of novels and stories that we can read and write yes this is true and we don't have to bend the rules we have to follow them and these rules are not mine or yours these are divine rules from allah muslims don't cheat don't lie don't fabricate and don't talk about the world of the unseen and allah azzawajal knows best"
