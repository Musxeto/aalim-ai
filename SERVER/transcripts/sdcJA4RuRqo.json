  "transcript": "um so I I'm a bit confused about this I think I've asked this before though uh so if someone does have like gold uh pure gold which is let's say 90 grams and they should pay exactly on it um but it's in a form of jewelry so it's like if they go and ask the price of it to know how much they should pay from the car the person who buys and sells gold they will say higher price because the Jeweler itself looks good or maybe uh is like a Brandy from some brand or maybe has some other stones on it how can one know like um the exact price of only the gold we've explained this before fidan and said that zakat is mandatory upon the gold the mineral itself the metal and silver precious stones diamonds any other thing these are not included so how do I know you take it to the jeweler's shop and they with their experience can wait so if they weigh a hefty heavy necklace they would say that oh this weighs like 150 grams but through that experience they know that 120 grams of it is made of stones and only 30 grams is gold so they tell you there is no zakat in it even if the value of the necklace is fifty thousand dollars it doesn't matter what counts is the amount of gold in it so the jeweler's shop has this ability to uh distinguish that drain"
