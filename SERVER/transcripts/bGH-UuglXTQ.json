  "title": "When is the best time to sleep? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ahmed from the philippines says what is the best time to sleep now this is not very uh clear-cut question because times differ people differ and their preferences definitely differ what was the preference of the prophet ali it goes without questioning that the prophet alison hated sleeping before isha so between maghrib and isha this is not a time to sleep and hated speaking and meeting others after risha so this means that the best time to sleep is after praying asia unfortunately nowadays cultures and communities don't follow this except in maybe villages in rural areas but in cities the the average time of going to bed is like maybe 11 or 12 o'clock at night midnight some people go even further so as long as you are capable of functioning and observing your salat of fajr and night prayer and tahajjud and waking up for lahore and the rest of the prayers then you are okay to do whatever you wish and allah knows best"
