  "transcript": "Alvie says is congregational before if bar bida or permissible now beta is an innovation and in order to understand whether this is an innovation or not we have to go back in time and check the biography of the Prophet erase salat wa salam the books of hadith to see whether the Prophet al-islam has fasted Ramadan or not the answer is yes whether he recommended that we make duaa before if par when he said that the supplication of a person in whose fasting is accepted did he say such a thing there is yes so we come to the third question did the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam ever gathered his companions and made congregational dua for iftar because he told us to make duaa and he fasted Ramadan so was it ever reported the answer is no hence this becomes a bid ah because the Prophet did not do it al Islam when the need for doing it was there and this is one of the ways to recognize Buddha with an Allah knows best"
