  "transcript": "when Allah created Mercy he made that into 100 Parts he placed one part only on Earth and he kept 99 Parts with him for the day of judgment the prophet said with this part on Earth is what makes a beast what makes an animal lifts its foot so that it would not step on its or on its child and also in another Hadith the prophet so a woman who was looking for her child and she was like a crazy woman running right and left unaware where her child was and when she saw her child she jumped and rushed to him and she embraced the child and gave it her breast so that it would uh uh suckle it and you could see all the love signs and all the content on her face so the prophet looked at his companions and told them do you think that that this woman would ever throw her child in Hell Fire or in in in any fire that is would she uh uh kill her son by throwing him in Fire and they said definitely not prophet of Allah then the Prophet saidat by Allah Allah is more merciful with us than this woman with her child and allahum are we Allah to introduce a system where we call people and W wake them up for f prayer I I see no reason why not introducing such a system because this system is one of the means of collaborating and cooperating on doing righteous Deeds so it is like calling someone by phone and waking waking him up for feder of course this would not substitute the role of the aan yet it is one of the means of uh cooperating and inshallah this is uh one of the good deeds and Allah most bless you"
