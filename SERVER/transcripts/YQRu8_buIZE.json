  "transcript": "now his second question was about praying in front of the Imam is this permissible or not it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that whenever that there is a need as in the case where the message is fully packed and there is no way you can pray at the sides or behind it in this case there is no problem for the worshipers who stand in front of the Imam and pray in front of him"
