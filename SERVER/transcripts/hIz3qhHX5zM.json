  "transcript": "so I want to task um since a few weeks I've been having problems with like um uh with doing many things and then I think it's good for or not so before um I performed Voodoo and I came out of the bathroom and um I put my um I put my skirt down so my feet are not seen because when I walk past the window and see me and if I'm if a person is ashamed um for example a person is ashamed from wearing hijab is this kuffer no it's not cover if someone is embarrassed or ashamed of wearing the hijab he's not rejecting it but simply it's a sign of weakness of a man now having said that a lot of the kuffer thoughts that we get are from shaytan you are a Muslim by default how long you've been Muslim since birth how old are you I'm 22. and why would you get these thoughts of kuffer because I started practicing five months ago ah before that no I was normal this is shaytan the more you get closer to Allah the more he increases his whispering to you to get you out of the fold of Islam or to make you despair of Allah's Mercy or at least to give make you give up so all what you need to do is to think about what you're doing is it related to Sharia and you'll find that it is not this is what we do in counseling sessions we speak one to one we open your eyes we show you the way we show you the tricks of shaytan and with the grace of Allah azzawajal 95 never come back it's only one session learn your religion and shaytan will not have any way towards you and he you will manage to block all of this it's like installing an antivirus on your sis on your laptop or on your device you can't get viruses because you have a very very powerful uh um firewall with the grace of Allah"
