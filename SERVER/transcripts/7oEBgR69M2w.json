  "transcript": "the second question she asked and then subhanAllah one of the brothers from London I'm I think Jose in his last name he just emailed me yesterday a question actually that it seems like I did not answer it properly regarding leading the Salah at home as a family and you have children meals and females and you have also your wife and your daughters who could be older than the age of puberty so lining up I think the brother his name is our fan Hussain I remember he emailed me yesterday and he provided the evidence so I tell you brother our fan I'm wrong and you know what I will have Sheikh awesome answer this question right here because it seemed like I made a mistake answering this question so can you guide us on how to line up a family where there are kids meals and females and also females or older than the age of puberty Sheikh Hassan if you feel kindly can please Allah - to my knowledge hadith an asymptomatic radhi'allahu and when he said that we invited the prophet alayhi salatu salam once to pray in our homes and there was me anis and an orphan and an old lady whether she's the grandmother or was it whether she's um so lame and he said that we washed a sort of a mapped how she made of hay and it was black because it was worn and he used to sit on so they washed it and cleanse cleaned it and then they set it for the Prophet to pray on it her son so the Prophet stood up stood as the Imam and Anna's and orphan which means use a child he they both stood behind him so children do not have a line of their own and this is the last thing that was ordered in the Sunnah of the Prophet and the woman stood behind so this is what the majority of scholars say that the imam leads behind him would be the men boys and and mae√≠n grown-ups even children men would stand in the same line with the the children children who sent with them provide their mail and the third row would be reserved for females women whether reached the age of puberty or not so just to clarify the children regardless of their age they stand on the same line had that Alima me Ani no tents between that's the mistake I I mean I I said one inch I'm sorry yeah that much of a distance no no no okay no they're exactly identical to me okay"
