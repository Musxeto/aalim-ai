  "transcript": "no the best thing is when you wash a deceased you put your hand well actually I'm going to come from his right side because I'm going to rub him with my left cleaning him with with the left usually both ways it's up to you when I wash the disease I put my hand over his face nose and mouth so that when I pour pour the uh pour the water it doesn't go inside so this is one of the procedures different procedures is is there anything from the Sunnah covering it no so it that if you learn it in a certain way and you see it practice in a different way don't say this is not right I know that the brother who is going to come after inshah and uh wash in practically in front of us there are many things that I would disagree with I will only disagree with the things that I believe is contradictory to the Sunnah or that are not logical but mainly speaking all what he's saying is is applicable because it is not governed by the Hadith you can look at the camera it's okay I'm used to that so it doesn't matter to me anyhow uh nine the Sunnah not only the Sunnah it is mandatory that men are washed by men and women are washed by women except an exception and we will come to mention this later on do you want me to spoil it well you spoil it for me what is the except exception the what the spouse yes very good so a man can wash a woman if she is her his wife and a woman can wash a man if he is her husband except in one condition what condition is that divorced then he's not her husband anymore how or when would it be forbidden for a woman to wash a man who was his her husband no when she's not in Purity no this is a very tricky question but it is hypothetical we mentioned it yesterday something like it if a woman is pregnant and the man dies at 10 a.m. she gives birth at 10:05 can she wash the man because she is out of the which means that he's not her husband anymore kalas 5 minutes ago he was her husband the minute she gave birth kalas she can marry which means that she's not related to him anymore now this is extremely hard and difficult for a loving wife now if she doesn't love her husband alhamdulillah yeah I'm free I don't have to wash him I don't have to even to look at his face I'm leaving why because she's not her his wife anymore but if a woman loves her husband so much he Subhan Allah the decree of Allah that he dies in five minutes after his death she gives birth to a baby boy his son and at night time before the funeral and and and the preparation she wants to wash the body they say no you can't okay can I kiss my husband he's not your husband anymore this is extremely difficult but this is the law this is Allah's law and she has to accept this and yeah I think it happens once in every like 10 million or 50 million it's it's very rare that it happens but once it happens it's good that you know the uh ruling so this is one exception that a wife washes her husband or a husband washes his uh wife the second exception I think brothers are cheating by now reading the notes unable to find it because it's complicated exceptions sisters brothers exception okay no there it's not okay there is an exception we mentioned it earlier if he is below 7 years old who is the deceased what do you mean by seven years old a child so if there is a girl who is six or five years old can a man wash that child yes because below seven the child does not have and if he's a boy of 6 years old can women not related to him wash him yes they can why because Scholars say that below seven years of age a child is not desired by the opposite sex whether it's a boy or it's a girl they have no desires for such a child but in these late Days of our era it's different than long ago now with the Twisted minds of the people because of the media because of the exposure because because of of of the homosexuality found everywhere one cannot be sure so it is best that the girls the young girls are washed by women and the young boys are washed by men now can a child can a child be washed by the parent yes so if I have a son four or five years old and he dies I I can wash it and if it's a girl I can wash it as well and likewise for the mother if it's a boy or it's a girl the uh mother can do the job as well now we have the Hadith which is long I'm not going to read it uh you have the notes about Zab may Allah be pleased with her and how the prophet instructed the of when they were washing and preparing his daughter after she died he told them wash her three five or seven times or even more if you see that is needed onne so says this is how smart was because I could wash the deceased five times and still not pure the sixth time nothing comes out so can I stop here no the prophet said with so I have to add another seventh one likewise when you are defecating or urinating purifying yourself with water is called in Arabic and purifying yourself with substances other than water such as tissue paper or cloth or rocks Stones it's called isar so we're going to come to the word of EST when we wash the disease and us as Muslims we do this witer so even if you wash yourself four times and you're purified you have to add a fifth just to be Witter and this is the instruction of the Prophet to the companions as inah Muslim for example the Jews objected to Salman Al fari and they said your Prophet taught you everything even excuse my French how to take a  yeah even he taught you how to defecate to answer the cause of nature they're ridiculing our religion they're making fun out of it thinking that Salman is going to be like us we can say no no no he did not do this and we every time we're defensive someone comes to you why do you grow the Beards is this logical you grow the beard and you take the armpit ha leave this and take take that then why do you do this why why do women cover because they're beautiful why don't men cover as well there are beautiful men and they ridicule your religion and every time they speak about your religion what are you doing you're being defensive no no no it's like not not like this we do this we do that why do you have stoning in your religion isn't this barbaric isn't it barbaric to Stone an adulterer to death he put a bullet in his head why why don't you be merciful why do you kill him initially he's only following his desires do you kill someone if he's hungry and he eats do you so why do you kill someone if he commits adultery this is natural every time they throw these at you you're defensive no no it's not like this uh maybe it's a different issue according to Scholars turn the tables over them I have it here some alhamdulillah Allah has blessed us with KU serving us imagine this the prophet says in Allah grants Victory to this religion through the disbeliever and through the Sinners how is that Allah made them make these inventions my laptop yesterday got broken the battery died I don't know what's in the electricity of the UAE something wrong maybe it's too expensive oh in Saudi it's cheap I don't know so there's something wrong it broke up what would I do I don't have reservation for today I would have left so alhamdulillah we have Steve Jobs who perished and died he made this for me Apple I have my my my lectures here Allah is making things easy for us for you to defend your religion all what you have to do is research every time I go abroad I have this on my conscience what happens if someone stands up and say your religion is barbaric you Stone people to death what would I say yes if you don't believe in the Quran he says it's not in the Quran isn't it oops sorry if it's not in the Sunnah is it authentic Sunnah I have no knowledge the guy is bugging me why what what should I do M it's B bigger and bigger that's good so what should I do you have to research your religion so what did I did I went to she Google and said she can you please tell me about stoning he said my son I will teach you we have more than seven sins in the the Old Testament and the New Testament in the Bible were you Stone what is it she he said you Stone If a woman who's virgin fornicated with a man a virgin she's not married in Islam alhamdulillah we're much easier we flog her but she's still alive no no you have to okay what else he said if you curse the king or a priest you'll be stoned to death W this would have this the Arabic The the Arabian spring would be Autumn and and summer they will all be stoned okay alhamdulillah we don't have this in religion if you are disobedient and disrespectful to your father and mother the elders would take you to the outskirts of the village and they will Stone you to death this is my sh you are you are giving me beautiful Jewels add so much to me and I cut and paste and I have it in my word document and ever someone asks me I tell them this is your Bible who's extreme now who's barbaric likewise killing execution no capital punishment is Haram I have like nine or 10 from the Bible in exec uh executing people so don't be defensive don't be rude but yeah stand up for your religion and say that this is my religion compare it with any religion you wish it will prevail it will come on top with the grace of Allah not because the Sheikh says or the DI says because I'm convinced if there was any other religion that was better I would follow it but there isn't I looked into all the religions there are nothing this is the complete religion this is the perfect religion this is the only religion in the world that the original book is still preserved in the original language you may not know Arabic I know Arabic so if I read the Quran this is what the language I'm using it's not it is not like if we read Romeo and Juliet in the original form that Shakespeare wrote it in thy thou the what is this speak English no Arabic is Arabic everybody understands this therefore I don't know yes uh Salman Alise when he was asked by the Jey they're making fun out of it he said yes the prophet Alat taught us not to face or give our backs to the when urinating or defecating and he told us not to use our right hand when we clean ourselves and he told us to clean ourselves with three or five washes or wipes and to make it Witter very easy and not to use dun of donkeys or and not to use bones because the dunk as we know is the food of the animals of the gin and the bones are the food of the Jin themselves in the Hadith you know this of course jins are our friends so do not be defensive we have to learn from this that we cut everything on Witter the Hadith the prophet said Allah is one and he loves wi and you the people of Quran the prophet says perform witer also the prophet when he used to speak he used to repeat it three times and when he used to eat he used to eat in three morsels so or five so one date three dates five dates but he'll always do it in even uh in odd or witer numbers so 10 the Sunnah is to be or to wash the deceased using a piece of cloth which means that it is not permissible for you to wash the deceased using your own flesh why touching may affect you and a lot of the Muslims in well not a lot the ignorant Muslims in Arabia when they come to meet someone who's not Maham to them because of the Mah amount of religion in them they would do this how are you my cousin so they shake hands with the women but from a barrier as if it's not this is not permissible I didn't touch her touching her is Haram is it haram touching a woman who not M for you Gravely Haram or 5050 huh a lot of the Muslims when they come to me she is this Haram anything I said yes it's Haram the prophet say so and so and so they say is it haram Haram or Haram and this is a deficiency in the way you treat Allah in the way you think do not look the scholars say do not look at the size of the sin look at the magnitude of the one you're sinning because if you look at the size you will always see something that is bigger than it so why do you smoke he says smoking is better or drinking wine hm logical why do you drink wine he says drinking wine is better or smoking hash pot why do you smoke pot said is it better or taking cocaine and heroin makes sense why do you do heroin said is heroin better or committing homosexuality why are you homosexual he said is it better or being Christian why are you it's not a excuse me you why are you Christian he said at least I believe in one God out of three is this better or not believing in God at all as an atheist so no matter where you go if you're sinful Shan comes to you say there are a lot of people worse than I am so alhamdulillah and this is always happening to us in terms of religion but in terms of it never happens to us when you say why are you sad you have a car and someone else doesn't have a car he said no no no I have a car but my car is 2010 his car is 2011 and when you go to the man with a 2011 why are you sad he said my my neighbor has a boat in the marina and when you go to the man with the boat he says my friend has an airplane he travels and you go to the even the the billionaires why are you sad you have a a big uh uh airplane he said yeah but my other friend has a 747 fully equipped with a swimming pool inside when you go to that man he said yeah but Sir Richard uh what's his name he has a a shuttle going to outer space I can't afford this and if you go to that he says well my friend is an astronaut he went to the Moon it will never end in religion the prophet tells us always look to those on top of you why because if you pray seven ra night prayer look at those who pray 11 if you pray for 1 hour look at those who pray for 3 hours so you're always climbing up in dun always look at those below you if you have a Bic bcle say alhamdulillah I have wheels others walk and if you don't have a bicycle you only walk say alhamdulillah I have my legs others have crushes crunches crushes crunches with an N is it crutches with a with a c alhamdulillah this is part one of the benefits of being healthy you don't know about these cutes okay and if you have cutes say alhamdulillah you're being able to move people are paral paryz and even if you're paralyzed one of the righteous people passed by a person with no hands and no legs just a body and a head and when he passed by him he heard him say so the man stopped and said with all due respect what are you praising Allah for what what worse can it be he said are you crazy Allah granted me a grateful heart and a thankful tongue what greater blessing could there be W with all our legs and our muscles and our health if you don't have a thankful heart and a grateful tongue well you have nothing if you're unable to thank this great blessing of Allah anyhow let's go on so do not touch the body you have to use a barrier or a cloth nowadays the etiquette is different than before so if I'm to wash a body nowadays I I have to prepare a few things what do I have to prepare first of all I have to prepare something to cover my body so probably I would bring a plastic uh cover so that when I wash the body nothing comes to my clothes I have to bring also a a a a face mask or a a mouth mask so that it prevents me from having any kind of resentment when I'm washing if I smell something bad no I do this I have to bring gloves now one would say this is what are you doing the prophet did not have this he said this is not governed by or by Sunnah because the prophet did not instruct us and they did not have this at the time of the Prophet because this can also be if classified like this how do you pray Friday prayer and give through the microphone this is B this is not means of getting closer to Allah this is not this is like riding a car this is like wearing a different type of clothes and using it these are not related to forms of worship So when you say it has to be related to De and these are means of making things happen and they do not relate to if I'm preparing the for for making Gul I would bring scissors one and if I have money and I have time and I'm a professional I'll bring three a big one not a big one for the trees but a big one because if the limbs are stiffened and I cannot take the clothes off properly sometimes it's difficult to take the shirts off I cannot so the easiest thing for me to do is to cut through and take it if I can take it them off this is best because I'm not wasting the money we can utilize the clothes in something else a lot of the people think that these clothes should be burnt should be given to S no wash them and wear them how can I wear my father's shirt what's wrong in it can you wear your father's watch yeah it's expensive it's a Rolex what about his shirtt no no we have to burn it it depends on where you're coming from so a middle scissor for if clipping his fingernails uh if needed to uh cut the shrouds and make prepare it a small scissor for his mustache if needed to trim his mustache of course a woman does not need that usually so I would bring probably great amount of cotton so that I would put them in the private parts for example uh to use it to perfume the body the the the places of prostration I would probably use sort of different uh stripes or straps straps so that I would tie him with so they have to cut it uh maybe maybe if there are Burns or wounds that are continuing to bleed or uh uh to have some sort of discharge I need plasters as well so all of these I would prepare instead of putting the dead body in front what you do ah send someone to the market let him get this he comes after half an hour yeah we forgot to bring this bring that no you have to prepare everything so you make it as fast and quick as possible because it is part of the religion to hasten the preparation of the funeral uh what else now number 11 we must cover the decease when we wash him to cover what cover the what kind of do we cover the in the Salah for the man it's from the navl to the knees how do we cover it and why should we cover it well this is very easy to explain the prophet when he died who washed him the Companions and they did not know what what to do should we take off all of his clothes like we usually do with our deceased people and they heard something someone speaking from out of uh um the corner of the room they were in and they all sort of were unconscious and conscious in the middle but this was an instruction no leave the clothes on the prophet Alam and wash him from over the clothes now the yes but this is from all over the clothes yes his his his clothes were on him they did not take off his clothes do we do this with our diseased no we said yesterday that the first thing or among the first thing to do is to take off his clothes so that his body temperature would not go down go up when it goes up when it's warm this causes the body to quickly change and by the way I didn't mention it yesterday because it's not part of the Sunnah but it is being practiced in schools of thought what is they say that the minute the disease die you should put something heavy on his stomach so the disease is there you bring a two or any half half or one kilogram of piece of iron or or a block or or um tiles and you put it on his stomach why they say because when a person dies his stomach expands because of the gases because of the food inside so you don't want this to show on him it makes it look a little bit awkward but Scholars like and others say nowadays with air conditioning you don't need this alhamdulillah and if you put something of half a kilogram it would not affect maybe if you put something like 5 kilogram would have an impact but then you don't want to end up having his uh uh uh stomach going inside or harming him so nowadays in towns and cities this doesn't uh uh this is not required because we have the body coolers or it's not a cooler you put in the house we have the freezers H where you you preserve the bodies in hospitals and they only take them just before washing so usually the body is preserved and this is not uh needed so for men what do we do we cover the body from the naval till the knee and the rest is all uh uh undressed it's all nude nothing for the woman my maab which is H maab states that the is from the naval till the knee as well but the most authentic opinion is what albani has chosen and that is this is not uh correct because it has no authentic and strong evidence that backs it up if we say to the men your to each other is from the naval to the knee this means if we go to swimming pools it's okay to wear something covering this area right now if I go to the women and say your is from the naval to the knee you can imagine the amount of chaos that would take place women going and this is what's happening with the Muslims now when they go to weddings my daughters my Wives come back and they are so shocked by the scenes they see the Muslims are wear the women wearing things that expose their chest their back their shoulders mini skirts seethrough so tight all of this is UN Islamic and these are the women that the prophet sawat in Hell two types of women I have not seen and there are types of women in Hell one of them is those who wear clothes while being naked how can you wear something and still be naked Scholars say either because it's too tight so so when they're wearing tight clothes and they're not wearing anything it's exposing their body parts their curves and their beauty or by wearing something that is see-through maybe it's loose but it is see-through you can see what's underneath of it so this is completely forbidden among women by Nature women want to look beautiful Allah described this in the Quran that they grow up to ad themselves and others with their jewelry and their beauty but it is our responsibility to advise our wives sisters and daughters Allah says in the Quran protect yourselves and your families from Hell Fire so it is your responsibility to look into the Wardrobe of your uh wife and daughter and ask them not to wear something that is revealing so how do we wash a woman you cover her from her arms to the knees this is what is supposed to be done"
