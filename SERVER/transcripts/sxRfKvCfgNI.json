  "transcript": "I never him mm-hmm al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa I'm Dee Wallace orihime nabina muhammad in water a.d he was happy here Jermaine I'm about to dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato and welcome to this forty third episode of the Islamic faith today we will speak insha'Allah about different chapters in brief which usually you would find in the Islamic clip when they talk about transactions there for partnership is a well known section of jurisprudence partnership means to go with one or more partners into a joint venture where the money is shared by all parties or some of them and work is shared by those who don't contribute financially depending on the type of partnership or known in Arabic as sharika angelica means partnership a firm or a company and this is what usually comes to a person's mind when he hears the word sharika it's a company it is having joint rights or actions so we go into this investment we share the profit according to what we agree upon and the loss is there the on the type of the Shaniqua of the partnership or the campaign allah azzawajal says in the quran thus do many partners wrong one another except for those who believe and do righteous deeds so allah azzawajal is telling us that partnership is permissible but warning us at the same time that so many partners may be tempted by this world by wealth by gains and profits that they may transgress against their partners and I've personally seen hundreds of similar cases coming to me with siblings with in-laws with even couple a man and his wife going into partnership and then one of them stabs the other in the back while thinking that what he's doing is totally legit and correct and this is how Japan works and this partnership is a legitimate contract which all people meet since the beginning of time in order to progress to make money what I can do by myself is usually limited but when I'm joining forces with others this gives what we're doing more momentum and the bigger the company is the bigger the capital is this is all what is mentioned in the book about partnership however if you investigate a little bit more maybe if we finish this book and we go to something more advanced we will be able to elaborate a little bit but a company is divided into a number of types many many types the most well-known is what is known as mobile Arabic and you may hear this terminology a lot in the Islamic banks and Islamic transactions Mobile Abba meaning that in a nutshell without going to details to start a joint venture or an alliance or a partnership where the financing is from one and the labor and the actual administration and work is from the other so someone comes and says share I have a wonderful idea I am an expert in selling emeralds and rubies and in Tanzania it is very cheap to mine for these precious stones and I know the country well and I have done business there for twenty years now I have a potential project that will generate maybe this or that so I need a million dollars so I said I have the million dollars I trust you but what would this partnership be like he said you give me the million dollars I'll be the CEO I'll run and buy mines and extract these precious stones treat them and sell them and whatever profit we get I'll give you 70% from the profit not from the capital and 30% I will take as my share this is negotiable i am i with the $1,000,000 may say no i suggest that it is 8020 he may say no i'm the one of the expertise i I go for 50 50 whatever we agree upon it's a done deal this is called Madhava now if things go well and the company makes profit so it is according to what we have agreed upon and so it's 70/30 but if the business went south and there was a loss and the loss was genuine there is no transgression from the CEO there is no negligence business this what happens you either win or lose in this case the loss is accumulated on the capital so my million dollars are gone while the work and effort that the CEO had invested is also gone he is not obliged to pay anything this is known as Madonna there is another company called sherry Catarina and in this both partners or all of them they contribute with money from all sides and they contribute in the management as well there is a company called gujo which mean faces and this means that to get into partnership but they don't have money so they go and borrow or buy things on credit due to their own reputation visit new to that own faces meaning that the people have value for their names so they give them willingly on credit and they sell and with the profit they make they share among themselves this is sherry Coutu wooju and there is sherry Coutu up Dan which also they don't have any capital to invest but they have their bodies and labour work so they're plumbers they are freemasons builders they are whatever so they agreed to form this company they go and work whatever they do they share between them and there's the difference of opinion among scholars whether this is legitimate or not so in short this is summarizing the chapter that deals with a Shalaka or Sheraton which is partnership and if you go to the books the detailed books of trip you'll find many many pages talking about so many different issues with evidences from the Quran and from the Sun and from the different schools of thought about this issue the following section talks about higher and in Arabic this is called La Jolla and basically speaking and a Jarrah is similar to trading or selling and buying if you remember selling is exchanging a an item or a product with its benefits in exchange for something that is a price of it so it can be my watch in exchange for a phone this is selling and buying it can be money in exchange for a car but this is full exchange meaning that I have the price fully in my hand to do whatever I want because now it's mine and you have the product that I had sold you fully yours to do with it whatever you want without any interference from my side and a Joran or hiring is a bit different because I am selling you not the product itself not the item itself rather the benefits found in that product to use it for a specific amount of time in exchange for a fixed amount of price and this is known as a Java and it is made of two types each hiring of Real Estate's a car a book the bicycle a house so you're taking the benefits of something that is stationary that is something specific a subject and there is a different type of hiring which is the services of an individual so these are two different types of hiring I can hire a horse so this is a hundred dollars I'll take your horse for three weeks I'll ride it I'll go hunting with it and then I'll bring you the horse back in one piece undamaged I can hire or rent or lease or let an apartment a villa a cabin a bungalow whatever for a price for a fixed amount or number of days weeks months or years this is called selling the benefits of a thing the second type of hiring is when I hire someone to tailor a throw a garment for me or to fix my car engine or to paint my house so I'm hiring an individual a human being to provide a service for me and this type of hiring is either private or mutual and there is a difference in the books of in terms of liability in terms of productivity so if I hire a private for example tailor to work only on my clothes and he makes and designs and produces clothes only for me and I'm paying him to exclusively work for me he's different when I go to a tailor's shop who serves a hundred other customers and would work for me part of this time not all of this time and this is not the time to speak about different issues pertaining this but a Java is something that is essential in our lives we can't live without hiring people to do things for us we can't live without renting stuff because not all of us has the financial capacity to go and buy things so many times we need to rent lease use for a while and go someone like me who has for example minimal amount of mileage per year I don't go out I don't travel I don't even go and buy things from the market I have drivers I have cars they do all the dirty work so they say so what's the point in having a big SUV for me to take my kids once a year to Mecca or to Medina so that it would take them all in one car and then have the car parked in from my door the remaining of the 360 days or less that's not logical so it's better for me money-wise to sell it get the money utilize it somewhere else and whatever I want to go to my car to Medina I rent a car for two days three days pay something that is negligible compared to the maintenance cost we need to rent this is the norm since the time of humanity began everybody needs this and Allah mentioned in the Quran the issue of hiring others Allah says if after that they suckle your infants pay them for it this ayah is a sort of palak allah azzawajal is talking about the couple when they divorce and the infant is still suckling from his mother if the mother says okay I'll keep the child it's the husband's duty to pay he's divorced his ex-wife money in exchange for her feeding his infant okay but he is her infant as well sure yes true the mother is not obliged to suckle her child and this is a well-established fact the majority of women would do that willingly due to their mother mother mother Lee love to their children but if they refuse even while still married she's married to her husband but she says I'm not gonna spoil how I look for this infant it's the husband's duty to go and hire a woman to suckle his child and to pay for it so this hiring is mentioned in the Quran Allah says also said one of the two women Oh father hire him for the best person that you could hire is one who is strong and worthy of trust this woman was one of the two sisters whom musa peace be upon him found them with their hurt away from the well as they were women and they were vulnerable and weak and they can't go with the other shepherds poor men and strong and they don't want to mix with them and they complained that their father is old and fragile so Musa went and with his strength managed to provide water for their hurts so one of them went back to her father and said Oh father we are in need of a helping hand and this stranger did this and that and by Allah he did not look at us he did not do any suspicion suspicious thing rather he is so polite and religious so I suggest that you hire him because we do need a helping hand and he's trustworthy and he is strong so we know the story that this righteous man the father of the two women proposed to musa peace be upon him to give him one of his wives one of his daughters as a why in exchange for working for him for eight years and if moosa completes ten years that would be fine and a gift from him and moosa agreed so he was hired the payment was getting married he got his wife and the duration was eight months extendable to ten years that is not month eight years extendable to ten years if moosa wanted to be generous and subhanAllah how musa fled Egypt after killing the Coptic frightened scared for his life traveled the distances until he reached McGeehan and after ten years he was married he was safe and he became the messenger and prophet of allah azza wajal so never look at how dark the tunnel is because eventually there is a light at the end of the tunnel and always have your heart related connected to a lot only as a virgin and the prophet elisha sam and abu bakr also when they migrated to Mecca to Medina they didn't have any means of navigation so they hired a guide who was among the Arab experts of routes and ways to take them stealthily and secretly to Medina without the people of Mecca knowing about it the authentic hadith we all know the Prophet said alehissalaam Apple JIRA agile ugly Jeff rapport give the man you hire to execute work for you his wages his fee before his sweats dries and this is something that a lot of the construction companies don't abide by a lot of the business owners don't fear allah azzawajal especially when you are in a country that does not hold great respect for workers so you find that the business owner may hire you and have you do jobs and works for him only to pay you 40 percent withholding 60% for a year or two or more blackmailing you postponing and delaying payment for no good reason this is a threat from the profit a less awesome an obligation that you must give the one you had hired his fee before his sweat even drives and the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that allah azza wajal said in warning to the people i shall be the adversary of three types if allah as the origin is your opponent and who will stand in front of you you bound to lose no question about that so who are these three among them the allah azzawajal says in the hadith Qudsi and a man who has hired a workman has exact it his due meaning he fulfilled his work in full from him and has not given him his wage and this is really scary when you deal with people and you think that you have the leverage over them we agreed that you're gonna pay me a thousand for the work but now after I finished the work you got what you wanted from me you say no thousand is too much let's make it seven hundred and you refuse to give me anything more and I have the weakest link because of already finished work so I need anything but we agreed on a thousand and in a system give me a seven hundred I take it while being stabbed in the back and feeling betrayed and making dua to Allah a soldier to avenge me and to take my right fully from you either through getting you sick visiting hospitals as a punishment for what you had done or your loved one your child your mother your wife anything that comes as a calamity as a punishment so that I would feel that I have been avenged it's a problem when we become the judge the prosecutors the executioner's while we are the opponent at the same time definitely this is a losing case for the other person so are there any conditions of hiring yeah and most of these conditions are similar to the conditions of trading selling and buying so the first condition is that those hiring and those being hired they have to have the standard conditions of being Muslims well in here you can hire from someone who's not a Muslim of being rational sane adult and free so I cannot go and hire the services of a slave from a slave I have to hire his services from his master I can't hire from a child or someone who's not rational in taking or making decisions etc secondly we must agree on the benefits and it has to be recognized so I hire someone and I tell him I'd like you to paint my house so he says how much or how big is your house and I said yeah it's average he says okay I'll take your house for X amount of money so okay agreed and when the guy comes and sees the house she's whoa this is too big this is not a house this is a mansion this is not permissible hiring he has to come and see and measure and know exactly how much it's gonna cost regarding of paint of labor working time etc and also if he saw the house and says okay this is fine I'll do the job and we don't agree on a price and he does the job afterwards he says I need ten thousand as no this work only requires two thousand there's a dispute so both ends of the bargain must be clarified and must be recognized beyond doubt or dispute from the very beginning so that either I accept or reject thirdly which is the same topic the Rimmer ation must be known so I have to tell him how much it is number for the benefit should be lawful so I hire someone to build me a temple no this is not permissible hiring I lease or rent my hole for a mixed gathering with dancing and music in it this is not permissible hiring this is not allowed in Islam because this is Haram so it has to be something that is lawful no harm involved and a lot of the questions come to me from brothers and sisters who say that we have an apartment building and the showrooms at the ground floor are in a good position good place so an interest-based bank approached us to hire the whole entire floor and banks pay a lot so can we rent and lease this showroom cylinder says no the bank deals with RIBA and by facilitating to them this sin you're a partner so this is definitely not permissible and so on number five the benefits should be possible to realize so when I hire someone he has to be able to execute what I am hiring for I can't bring a blind man and ask him to watch over as a security guard a mall or a shop or a house he's buying I can't ask someone who's deaf to communicate with a call center for example to be a call center operator he cannot hear so how can he speak to callers and so on so it has to be within his capacity he can do what I instruct him to do likewise if I hire or rent an object that would not fulfill what I want from it so I someone brings me his umbrella because it's raining but the umbrella itself is full of holes some totally soaked this is not a correct thing to rent or to hire number six the benefit should be owned by the one offering it so again the one who is hiring should be the one who owns it I see a beautiful apartment and there's a man outside so I say Marshall a beautiful apartment how much you said XYZ that said beautiful I'd like to hire it okay Dundee and he's not the owner he's not the agent he's not authorized to do that this is not permissible and this does not take place because this condition must be fulfilled and finally the period of hiring should be known if I want someone then this depends on a number of factors but generally speaking I can't rent a tub an apartment without stating how long so it has to be mentioned that this apartment is leased for a year or two but I can't have it open an indefinitely so this is almost what is mentioned in the hiring section and I think we will stop here and the condition dealing with borrowing and we will go to the questions and we have eleven of them inshallah the first question is from Fatima Fatima says why was the example of charity used in this hadith rocktober it near honored may Allah be pleased with him said the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the one who recites the Quran aloud is like the one who gives charity publicly and the one who recites the Quran quietly is like the one who gives charity secretly if you ponder upon this example it is clear that reciting the Quran publicly is not like reciting the Quran in C when it is in secret the reward is greater the sincerity is visible and it's best to ensure that this is only for Allah and not for anyone else however when you recite the Quran publicly you may be sincere you may have an impact on others however you have to know and acknowledge that when you give something free or let me rephrase that when you give something in secret it's much better for your heart then when you give it publicly and this is why Allah mentioned in surah al-baqarah in tobidasu dr. tiffanie mahi were in tofu ha who are took to hand for Cara how ironic if you expose your charity providing that you're doing it sincerely for the sake of Allah if you expose your charity this is good but if you disclose it and give it to the poor that is better for you and Allah will forgive your sins what's the difference the difference is I've done it publicly so that people would see me and follow suit yet when I do it privately my heart is not looking for praise or expecting compliments so the common denominator between giving charity publicly or reciting publicly is the issue of sincerity and hiding the deeds so that only it is something between you and allah azzawajal and this is why the charity in secret extinguishes the anger and wrath of allah that is why praying at night while the people are asleep is much better than praying publicly when everybody is watching you and you can go on and on with this lyric says is it permissible to be said after Tosha hood it was narrated from Jabbar that the prophetess of Sam used to say in his prayer after that the Shahada the best word is the word of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Mohammed I don't know what you're talking about lyric the Prophet Isis have never said this after prayer or during his prayer so I think that you've misread the translation or the original Arabic book the Arabic text this hadith is referring to what is known as hot metal Hodja which the Prophet is awesome used to give when addressing large masses so he would used to say in hamdulillah he might want to say you want a softer will I'm sure and push them say yeah a Lenina my love all the little bit further Hadi Allah and until he goes in a stop at hadith he khatallah were higher and had had you Muhammad in so Allah Allah washable oomori when the fatwa Akula method in beta to the end of the hadith so this is what he used to say after to jihad wash Shadwell ilaha illa-llah - arugula whatcha doin I will do hula solo and then reads the three ayats of Allah Mehran and aza etc not that he used to recite this in the salat so please check your sources again about rahim says can you please give us brief description of salat we'll eat because of the current situation most like many families will pray at home just like Allah hyelin first of all we said that it's an issue of dispute whether praying salat will aid at home is permissible or not the vast majority of schools of thought the school of malik chattering ammidon humble and many others say that this is permissible but the school of thought of imam abu hanifa and this is the opinion of cyclist an involute a mia and the opinion of sheikh muhammad inshallah even as a mean may Allah have mercy on their soul they all say that this is not permissible because it concrete prayer is a congregational prayer made at a specific location so even praying it in the message of the Prophet as a Salam is not recommended if not valid at all because though we know that prayer in the message of the Prophet SAW is 1000 times better and more than anywhere else other than the message of Kaaba however the Prophet had never prayed a prayer in his mercy he would always go to the open closet to the masala which means that this is where Salah to el8 must be performed therefore praying it alone or making it up if you missed it this does not fulfill the condition and hence I'm inclined to the opinion of Imam Abu Hanifa it Betania anybody as a meaning Allah mercy on them nevertheless if someone wants to pray at home it is like any normal to raka the only exception is the tech beef so in the beginning you say Allah Akbar hundred of them have little a logical analytical use of humor him and you count seven Allah Allah walk until you finish seven so the first one was severe at the Quran and then after that you follow with seven and then you recite the fatiha you recite the bismillah beacon Allah you make rock or sand a lot of and ham industry dude Allah hawk but sitting between the two centers dude secondly Allah Akbar and then he stand up Allah Akbar and now I'm standing I said the lava but to raise my head from C to D then I do takbir five times Allahu Akbar Allah Akbar five times and then I said the fatiha sword of Russia and the rest is well known to you all Haslem says if a woman is commencing a farmer in her home can she give a comma before Sunnah to robotic or have to be given before Fajr prayers it goes without I don't know what's wrong - it's not working it goes without saying has leaned that Yama is to call the people to the followed prayer there is no comma none whatsoever before the erotic prayers the voluntary prayers but it seems that you are mixing up between Iran and you come as an is called to announce the beginning of the time of Prayer so the Sun sets I call that Allah what remarkable a long walk along walk four times this is the event I cannot pray relative prayers or voluntary prayers before they are done because the time is not do so after that I can pray the voluntary prayers such as for before Lord and to before fetcher for example for women there is no van and this is a consensus of scholars they don't give a damn the armor is when I want to stand for Fajr prayer so the people are sitting so I say Allah a shadow and Lyla in the masha'Allah so everybody stands up they stand in line ready to commence their for prayer so this is not to be done except when you want to pray for prayer you don't do that for any voluntary prayer do women have the right to say the answer is yes if there are no men Muharram around them no problem for them to do a comma is it mandated answer is no this is not mandatory it is highly recommended so I hope this answers your question another question from has lean can someone recall verbally the Arabic hadith texts memorized while bathing note only recalling the text which does not include Allah's name or Prophet Mohammed Omar Selim's name either such as don't become angry light of Allah or in a vignette verily deeds are by intention no problem whatever goes in your mind whether you bathing or doing whatever you want is in your mind you don't recite the Koran you don't praise Allah you try and level best to block these thoughts while you're doing something indecent but even if it comes and jumps on you there's no problem cause it's in your mind and you're not speaking it out my boo my Google Adam my question is can I take gap between prayers like praying YCJA then working for a while then pray the Sunnah the Torah kinds of reach a later any reference would be very helpful as long as you pray the sunnah prayer within the timeframe of the salat itself it doesn't matter so the Prophet told us are a salatu salam the best prayer is to be offered in a person's home other than the fault so as long as I am home I should pray all types of sunnah prayers only the fault I should perform it in the Masjid and the prophets Edison do not make your homes similar to graveyards offer prayers in your home so by saying this we understand that if I pray for in the Masjid I have to walk all the way back home enter and pray 2 rakaats of sunnah there and this is a long gap so there is no problem ok in leaving a gap between the Sunnah and the fault prayer as long as you pray it on time you shouldn't delay the center floor until after Adonis coat you shouldn't delay the sunnah of motherland after sunset until the time of Asia is due this is too late and you can't offer it then and Allah knows best Bansi Ahmed says is this transaction the miserable if an agriculture agrochemical seller gives out some fertilizers to farmers who promised to pay back upon harvest there's no problem in that I don't have money as a farmer but I need to cultivate my land so I go to a shop that serves for fertilizers and I buy a quantity from him on the condition that I pay him back after five months or six months there's nothing wrong in that at all and this is legitimate selling and buying now is he obliged to sell me in the same price of cash no the fertilizers that you requested ten tons cost a thousand dollars but if you want to pay me after five months in this case I will charge you $1,200 it shouldn't be no problem as long as we agree upon which price and sign a contract and agree to that this is permissible what's not permissible is to give the two options and he buys without deciding so I say listen if it's cash it's a thousand dollars and if it's in installments you have to pay twelve hundred dollars over the duration of five months the farmer says I accept put the goods in my trunk in my truck and I do and he leaves this is Haram this is invalid because I don't know if he's going to pay cash or to pay in installments he didn't decide he took the merchandise and left he might bring the cash after half an hour but I've already set my calculations and accounts to receiving $1,200 a set so it has to be fixed there is no problem in that insha'Allah fiddler says what is the difference between kuffara and Vidya I don't know any difference of between two Farah and Vidya except that some scholars say that car Farah is something that is major and figure is something that is minor so there is Kafala for of the hard disk a father for killing disc a father for intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan there is the father for breaking your oath so this is something big huge Vidya is an expiation so if you do something that you're not supposed to do during the hell on such as cutting your hair there's a video if an elderly is unable to fast so he feeds one poor person that's Vidya but mainly speaking I don't see a big difference in this and a large version knows best Fatima Farooq says can we give the cattle cutter now and not before as the number of needy people have increased due to the knockdown this is an issue of dispute among schools of thought some say that you can give the cattle cutter from the very beginning of the month of Ramadan some say you can give it on the 15th of Ramadan and the most authentic opinion as in accordance to what of the London Armour the companion of the prophet sallallaahu cinnamon may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said that the cutoff Twitter can be given on the night of read or a day or two before 8:00 so you can give it on the 28th of Ramadan on the 29th of Ramadan there is no problem in that but you have to give it out before the 8th prayers time now with the current situation there are so many people who are in need so can we give them now which is the 21st of ramadan the answer is the most authentic answer is its no not only that other people ask a better question and they say due to the lockdown we are afraid that we will be fully locked down at the end of ramadan which means that we won't be able to give the cattle fodder to the people we know so is it possible is it permissible for us to try and deliver the zakat to them at the moment and the answer is no even omar said that the zakat can only be given a day or two before eat ok then share what can we do if at the moment we are unable to guarantee that on the night of Reid we will be capable of delivering the zakat to them we are in lockdown we can't commute go from one place to the other we can't commute so what's the solution well the solution is easier Abdullah you can call the poor person Salam aleikum Abdullah ustah I'm happy I have zakat of rice like maybe 50 kilograms of rice for you to be delivered the night of 8:00 but due to the lockdown I'm unable to deliver it so do you authorize me to keep it for you so after the lockdown I can come and give it to you he would say yes sure no problem cause it's a done deal keep it until there's no lockdown and you can deliver it with the grace of Allah Maria says can we give the cat to a cancer hospital where the treatment of poor is totally free this is a sensitive issue there's a cat of a man yours the cat over your wealth must be given to the poor in the form of cash and the poor or needy take the money they take the money and they do with it whatever suits them best so you may think that no my second money I'd like to devote it to cancer patient but the cancer patient may think that no I'm in need the money I want to pay my electricity bills or otherwise they'll cut off the power I need to pay my debts I need to pay for the food of my family so we should not be controlling the poor and deciding where they utilize the zakat money first of all second of all though this hospital is a Charity Hospital and totally free we don't know where the might of the cat is going to be utilized if it's totally free then most likely this the cat would be utilized in running the hospital itself giving salaries to the doctors to the to the nurses paying for the electricity bills for the utilities for buying new equipment medication so it would not fall under the category of the cat that is given to a poor person in his hand and hence I believe that this is not permissible you have the cat money go to a cancer patient who is in need to buy medication or to get treatment and he doesn't have the financial ability to afford that and you can give him your zakat and finally bra Majeed says how many takbeer is allowed when praying aid we've gone through that and we covered that and we said it's an issue of dispute some schools of thought say in the beginning according to the hadith you give seven tech beers including tech Viera to Iran so you see Allah a kebab the first meal and then you say six tech beers afterwards other scholars such as an amendment bail away in his bookshop Hashanah and others say no they did not mention seven tech beers in the first second and five thought beers in the second raka except because this this is the extra so that Kabira Tehran can't be counted in because this is by default part of the Salah so the seventh would be after the technically from as the five in the second record would be after the takbir of raising from record from sujood so when I'm rising up from the second sister to the second record I say Allah Akbar then I do five separate tech bees and not four so I hope this answers your question with this we come to the conclusion of today's class until we meet next Monday I leave you fear Manila what Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
