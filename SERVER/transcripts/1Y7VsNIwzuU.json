  "transcript": "so I hope this question isn't like um bad or something but I wanted to ask if I could for example go to like this SPID MOS with my friend for the sake of like learning something I don't know about Islam or just hanging out um because I don't know it's like better than being outside yeah no of course of course when you go to a Masjid that teaches B and we know that b is below shik and above major sins and it's dangerous it corrupts your religion it corrupts your conviction it corrupts your association with Islam because they are teaching you something that is not related to Islam this is uncalled for and it not is not permissible so you say I have a choice between going to a Masjid that teaches b or going out and not doing anything no go out and do not do anything rather than corrupt your Islam and your knowledge about this beautiful religion and Allah Asel Knows Best"
