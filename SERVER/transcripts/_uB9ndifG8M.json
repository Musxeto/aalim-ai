  "transcript": "[Music] if the Devils are chained then how come sins are still being committed around us what is this issue about Devils being changed there are a number of hadiths all authentic where the Prophet says I assume that when Ramadan is due the gates of hell are closed the gates of paradise are opened and the Devils are chained and there are a number of narrations one the Devils are changed the Masters of devils or jinn are changed so if this is true why do we still have sins in Ramadan scholars say that this hadith indicates that the jinn the devil's Satan cannot get through as they used to outside of Ramadan and this is obvious the amount of sins during the month of Ramadan is far less than before or after Ramadan and anyone can observe this you can see it so one meaning is that it is less the other meaning or the other interpretation would be that the hadith is clearly stating the Masters of gin so their leaders their tribe leaders of jinn are chained but the little ones the soldiers the privates they are on the loose a third explanation would be that they are chained yet the with in us is the one that drives us to make sense and the sins we make are either directed and instructed by Shaitaan by Satan by the jinn by the Devils or our own evil selves and we have our own evil which is not chained in Ramadan or elsewhere nevertheless we believe in the hadith and we believe that the jinns are chained they're restrained from doing what they used to do before Ramadan yet there is some impact whether by the small genes who are Unchained whether by our own evil selves and the hadith definitely indicates that a laws mercy forgiveness and a large support for us an encouragement to pray to read the Quran to make duaa to give in charity all of these good deeds would reduce their effect on us you [Applause]"
