  "title": "I have lost track, lagging behind doing good deeds. Is Allah angry with me? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "GEMA I think I'm pronouncing the name right is complaining of losing track and lagging behind he or she says that now I'm lazy to do any of the good things that I used to do I have decreased in a lot of good deeds in a short time span and I find it hard to do them now is this a sign that Allah is angry with me first of all whenever a person finds the strength and momentum to do good deeds this is a clear sign that Allah loves him because allah azza wajal gives this world give health wealth and material materialistic things to those whom he loves and to those whom he hates so you look at the disbelievers and you find them having health wealth and everything they want but Allah does not give belief does not give a man does not give content except to those whom he loves therefore if you look and analyze your life and find that you are lagging behind and that your Eman is being reduced drastically this means that there is something wrong in your life and this is what's causing this it's cause and effect climbing up a mountain is quite difficult and it requires a lot of fitness and strength coming down anyone can do it climbing is difficult going down is so fast and easy you wouldn't even notice it there for reaching the peak is difficult maintaining it is next to impossible unless allah azzawajal gives you the strength and that fear to maintain this so I advise you gamma to look into your lifestyle whatever was introduced that may help or cause in reducing your level of Eman your night prayer your vicar or weird of the Koran that you used to maintain reciting every single night the fasting Mondays and Thursdays staying away from sins sometimes the reason for this is that there are certain sins that we used to be strict in not doing now we've started to compromise we started to think that time change is it's okay every now and then to do this or to do that and this has a drastic impact on your Eman so you need to look into this thoroughly"
