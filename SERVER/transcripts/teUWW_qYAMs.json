  "transcript": "aasif from Saudi Arabia says that is there any specific attire or uniform that a woman has to wear when going for Hajj or Umrah meaning Haram we know that men are not allowed to wear the turbines the shirts the pants the piranhas or the shoots so what about women women can wear whatever they were usually there are by their coats their whatever they were use usually with the exception of two things and that is wearing the niqab and wearing the gloves the Prophet said alysus am a woman in the state of alarm does not wear the niqab and a lot of women unfortunately understood this in the wrong context so they said okay the Prophet said no do not wear the niqab we will reveal our faces and this is not what the Prophet said that is so hot with cinnamon when he said do not wear shirts for men he didn't say come bare chested for example and don't worry wear anything and flex your muscles no he told us to wear the upper Rida and when women are told not to wear the niqab then the up is a face cover that has an opening of the eyes so the opening of the eyes are considered to be like the shirts that you put your hands in the sleeves so yes you don't wear this but there's nothing wrong in covering the face without the holes in that cover so what is prohibited is the so-called ninja mask or the zuru mask but to cover the face with a layer or two or three depending on your ability to see and how to prevent people from looking at you this is totally legitimate and this is what all the Companions of the Prophet Isis some female companions that is used to do as in the hadith of asma bint ABI bakr may allah be pleased with her and with her father that we performed hajj with the prophet elisha and we used to unveil our faces and whenever the riders came close to us we used to cover our faces so this is a clear indication that the covering of the face is mandatory and it is legal but not using the niqab likewise she can conceal her hands with her address with her Abhaya but she must not wear the gloves she wears socks shoes underwear garments whatever she wants to wear there's no problem in that Allah so Jung"
