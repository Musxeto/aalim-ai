  "transcript": "the joins even when there's a very very small amount of rain so I know that this isn't correct but what should I do and so should I pray Isa with them and is it obligatory for me to go to a different mid for Isa if the Masid combines between and without a legitimate reason and unfortunately some of the imams are so lenient and soft that they go against the Sunnah so they said oh no no the prophet Sall wasallam uh did this IB Abbas did this and ordered us to do this because the prophet did it blah blah blah the scholars put a condition when it's heavy rain when there is mud then there's hardship but if it's not that heavy then you're not allowed to combine so for you as an individual you estimate if you see that this is not a legitimate reason then pray with them and leave and if there's a Masjid nearby in the vicinity you go and pray there and if there is no Masjid then you pray in your home and Allah Knows Best"
