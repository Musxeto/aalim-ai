  "transcript": "first question is it not permissible for the Muslims to help non-muslims in or attend with non-muslims according to the consensus of the scholars isn't accepting their gift food and gifts fall in that category I think that maybe the question is missing the word celebration or festivals um yeah okay now it's there um the consensus of Scholars that it is not permissible to attend or to assist the non-muslims in their festivals in their eids or in celebrating it in regards to accepting food gifts from them or any other gifts on that occasion it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it is permissible because there isn't any evidence preventing it on the contrary for example the fire worshippers known as al- ma they used to celebrate a day and they used to call that day and nud and strangely the same event is being being celebrated by the Persians and the Kurds until today they call it an and it was reported that Al may Allah be pleased with him was given a cake some dessert some sweets on that day and he ate from it and he liked it and he said where is this from and they said that this is something that we make on this date of naus in celebration of that Pagan day or whatever so uh uh he accepted it and he said whenever you make something like this send it over why because this is permissible being given a gift is permissible whether it is on Christmas on Halloween on uh Easter as long as they're giving you gift the Sunnah is to accept gifts unless it is made of or it has some of its component uh meat because anything that is slaughtered on occasions or other than to the sake of Allah this we cannot consume or accept and Allah knows"
