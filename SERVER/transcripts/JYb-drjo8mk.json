  "transcript": "[Music] so to continue with our topic among the rights of our loved ones the deceased when they die is that we are kind to their friends the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam whenever he used to slaughter a sheep he used to send parts of it to his wife friends Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her she died but he used to send parts of it to her friends and he used to say this woman was a friend of Khadijah give her this this woman was a friend of Khadijah give her that so if we have a deceased relative we also should honor their friends out of honoring our deceased loved one Omar may Allah be pleased with him once he was on his mule when he met a nomad a bedwin from the so he stood up and talked to him for a while and after finishing talking with him he gave him his turban and his mule as a gift and walked away so IB Omar's companion said to him may Allah have mercy on you if you give him you know few coins he would have been more than happy why did you give him all of this your own turban your own mule he said his father was a friend of mine father Omar so I wanted to honor my late father because the prophet said wasam in an authentic Hadith the best way of being dutiful to your deceased parents is to be kind to their loved ones so you as well if you have a deceased father a deceased mother and you you know that they used to be friends with people you be kind to them you contact them you call them if you financially are capable you give them gifts this is part of being dutiful to your parents after their death and this is the exact Hadith of the Prophet Alam a man came to him and said oh prophet of Allah my parents are dead is there anything left for me to do in order to be dutiful to them he said yes you make Dua for them you ask Allah for forgiveness for them you execute whatever they said before their death you I want you to do this I want you to do that you execute that and you honor their friends and to connect to your kinship that you don't have any kinship other than from their side so these are the five things that the prophet commanded usat to do among the rights of our deceased is whenever we pass by a graveyard to give Salam so the Sunnah when you enter a graveyard you read the Salam by saying oh peace be upon you oh House of the Believers you are first and we are following we ask Allah Asel uh uh for a for wellbeing being for you and for us this is the Sunnah and visiting the graveyards is aah and what is the use of visiting graveyards number one to give Salam number two to make Dua for the deceased number three to remember that this is where you're going to be soon the deceased can we mourn him can we mourn the deceased some say no some say no why why can't we mourn the deceased it is a Sunnah to mourn the deceased what is the meaning of mourning the deceased is to feel sad to avoid doing things that Express happiness such as attending a wedding or wearing perfume for women this is part of mour and this is permissible only for three days except for a widow a woman who's widowed she is obliged to mourn her husband for four months and 10 days if she's not pregnant if she's pregnant her mourning would be until she delivers so if she's one month pregnant and her husband dies she Mourns him until she delivers eight months she's in mourning but us normal human beings if someone dear to us dies today and we're invited to a wedding we can skip this is part of Halal morning for three days to be sad but after three days we have to resume normal activities and part of the rights of our loved ones of our deceased people is that we avoid [Music] Haram what types of Haram are there what is Haram when a person dies wailing what is Wailing to have a high pitch of crying also complaining he's my husband he's my this he was my supporter he was my rock he's the only one who provided for me also slapping the face tearing the clothes pulling the hair in my case you don't have any but any expression of disapproval is considered to be objecting to Allah's decree and this is Haram and a major sin the prophet said those who slap their faces or tear their clothes or call with the calling of the ignorance they are not from us so this is a major sin among the practices that many Muslims do when a person dies they feed the mourners for three days so so my father dies I open my house I cook food anyone who's coming I give them food drinks and feasting them this is not permissible this is Haram the opposite is what it's supposed to be you bring food to the people who were struck by such a Calamity and a disaster not the other way around and also among the Innovations found is to dedicate a particular period some countries they have what is known as the 40 days so after 40 days of the death of their deceased they throw a feast they make food after one year the anniversary of his death they make food I don't know why they're making food yeah it's part of the diet or I don't know but all of this is innovation and part of whaling the companions used to consider gathering on the food because of the disease as part of wailing and it is not permissible I've concluded my material and my uh subject for today but the organizer said you paid money so I have to make it worthwhile now in terms of inheritance it is I have few points not not many then we will have the questions and answers inshallah session starting immediately afterwards I do counseling and a lot of the problems found is because of the trust the father dies all the siblings appoint one brother to be their uh representative and the brother eats everything he has a power of attorney he sells property and takes the money he goes to the bank account and takes the money so unfortunately the nature of people is revealed at the wrong time and it's a very Hefty price to pay to reveal my brother's identity I don't want to lose my brother so don't put yourself in such a position trust your brother but don't give him authority to deal freely unquestioned about everything number two so many problems happen just because one of the family members is stubborn and as stubborn as a mule we have the family property Our Father left us a house now we're six I want my money I want my share they're not selling why we want to preserve our father's property is this Fair yes or no it's my money Allah gave me this money and you say no we don't want to give we don't want to sell we want to preserve the heritage of the family this is totally Haram can I take them to court yes so what is the best way one of two either all of you five buy my share give me the money estimate how much the property is is is worth X what's my share y okay you guys chiping and give me my share Salam alaykum I leave or we sell the property there is no third solution sometimes they use pressure so they say no our mother is living in the house she's your mother how do you want us to sell the house a the house has 10 rooms and she's living in the house is unfair we sell the house from our shares we buy her a small apartment sufficient for her no she wants to live in the house no she has no right to block us from our right just because she wants to live in that house I need my money so Allah is the one who divided this wealth no one can stand in his way we have business what should we do we look in the interest of the family if we want to continue the business the revenue should be distributed according to the inheritance the percentages if one of us wants to bail out we buy his share exactly like the the first uh incident and this is Justice and fairness now some people want to distribute their inheritance where they're alive to avoid any um conflict is this halal yes and some so no it's an issue of dispute among Scholars alhamdulillah yeah we can choose whatever we want it is not inheritance if you're alive how can you distribute it and this is why Scholars say you can divide your wealth but when you divide it while alive it has to be a true division not on paper because if a person says after I die I give this property to my son and this property to my daughter once he dies tear it apart and throw it in the dust bin why this is a will this is not a gift what about if I say I give my son a 100,000 but I did not transfer it to his bank account it's not a gift once I die it's cancelled a gift must be possessed if I promise to give you something and I don't give it to you it's not binding it's cancelled so if I want to distribute my wealth in my life I have to bring it I go to my children and I give them in their hands or in their bank accounts in their name and I transfer it do I have to give my wife no this is not inheritance so if I have a million dollars I can distribute it among my children and leave my wife out of it would I be doing Haram no I'm not doing it intentionally to harm her she's still living with me we still have a property or we uh yeah I'm still alive now should I giving such a division be fair between the boys and the girls in the gift or no I have to give two shares to the boy one share to the girl as if it is inheritance H equal some say up to you no how can it be up to me I'm my life how can it be up to me it's a gift but okay now we open another subject I have five children can I give a gift to the eldest because he got first place in uni yes yes wrong now everybody's minds are going to turn ha I like it when I do this I'm so devilish evil the prophet in the was approach by albash may Allah be pleased with him al- Bashir is a companion he has a son his name is very wellknown companion his Hadith very well known one of the pillars of Hadith so Al Bashir gave his son a gift some say it was a slave some say it was a property's mother said oh no no no no I'm not accepting this gift to my son go and make the prophet Alam witness it so that no one would speak in the future so Al Bashir went to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah I gave my son an this gift his mother said you must testify and witness it so the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam asked him very simple question do you have other children Al Bashir said yes the prophet said question number two have you given them all equal gift B she said no the prophet said then make someone else testify I do not testify onul on Injustice in another Hadith and this is very important addition he said would you like them all to be equal in obedience and dutifulness he said yes the prophet said then be equal in giving them gifts now this is problematic because every one of us us give differently to their children and they cannot swallow the fact that this is Haram but I have to make a clarification there is a difference between a gift and what is needed as providing provision so a gift is when I come inid and I go to all of my children even to a one month old and the 20 years old one month old and 20 years old big difference in we give we give a gift so I give each one 1,000 R even the one month old this is a gift I have to be equal I come from travel I buy I once went to India to Dr Zak and did some uh uh programs for his TV channel and he said you have to buy them gifts so I went to buy them garments traditional garments from India I had to buy each and everyone exactly the same money not a rupe more it has to be the same to be equal this is gifts now when it comes to the eldest goes to UNI and I have to give them money for the car for the fuel for the lunch and the youngest goes to kindergarten and I have to give them pocket money I give this one 100 and this one I give five this is not a gift one of them requires a surgery cost me 15,000 I pay the others don't come say hey Fe give us he said no no problem go have a surgery I'll give you this is not a gift you see the difference so it's the same thing when you have two wives one has five kids she lives in a villa the one doesn't have any kids she lives in an apartment of two bedrooms the one you give pocket money for groceries 5,000 the other one you give 500 because these are not gifts but if you're traveling and coming back buying perfume bottles it has to be exactly to the real and if there is a difference I used to do this by the way it's CA so many headaches I used to buy 300 real perfume bottle and 310 different type so i' put 10 real and Stitch it to the bottle and I give it to them so this is the difference between gifts and provision and providing coming back to inheritance now now I sold my property I liquidated my stocks I want to give my children I have two boys and two girls should I give four shares to the boys and two shares to the girls or should I give two to according to B and the scholars of sa Arabia you have to give four two like inheritance according to IM BWI and other Scholars of Islam they said no this is a gift and the Hadith of the Prophet alai is Crystal Clear do you want them all to be equal in being obedient and beautiful the man said yes said you have to be equal in gifts so the same thing goes for the girls it's a gift do you want her to be equal to the boy in being beautiful yes then give them gifts the same and this is what I am inclined to boys and girls when you are alive you're giving a gift they're all have to be equal no difference the difference only when you die because Allah stated in inheritance distribution that you have two shares for the boy one share for the girl so I hope this clarifies things and recard relates your thinking when it comes to favoring one boy because he's good at school and the other is not this would cause Injustice you buy an mbx uh bicycle to the boy because he got good grades and the other boy you buy him nothing what will happen the same what happened with yousef's siblings they will throw him in the well because you were not fair be fair in your gifts now we come to uh one of the famous issues that usually happens in families when Distributing the wealth a lot of the men are inair are unfair and display a lot of Injustice especially in Arabia women cannot inherit the property is only for the family my name women will get married to someone else from another tribe from another country and he will not have a share in my house in my property in my land so a lot happens of Injustice with women and this is Haram you cannot play around with inheritance of property just because you don't want other tribes other families to share your property when you die it's not your property anymore it belongs to the family how to distribute it is mentioned inaha the Ayah is very simple and the science of Al or is one of the first to be lost the first science to be lost among the umah is this science because rarely you will find people working in it and it needs practice rarely you'll find people asking you questions and and it's very mathematical very simple so if a person dies leaves only children no parents no spouse he leaves only children this is very easy the children inherit everything the division is two shares for the male and one share for the female end of story very simple he left a boy and a girl 2/3 for the boy one3 for the girl alhamdulillah okay what if he has a spouse ah if he has a spouse then the spouse gets one of two either she gets a quarter if he doesn't have any children children or she gets 1/8 if she has if the the disease has children not from her from anyone else so a man dies leaving a wife and a boy and a girl the wife gets how much 1 18 and the rest is divided by three shares two for the boy boy one for the girlas end of story so when we come to the issue of no he the deceased had Parents oh no problem so he had parents and he had a wife and he had a boy and had a girl no problem the wife gets 1/8 the father and the mother get one sixth one sixth and the rest is distributed between three shares two for the boy one for the girl this is an easygoing way what about if he did not have a boy he had only one girl okay no problem the Quran says if someone dies leaving one girl she gets half whoa the girl gets half yes okay if he did not have a one girl he had one boy the boy gets everything everything if he did not have a father a mother and a spouse but if he had a father and a mother and a spouse we give them their percentage one six one 16 1/8 and the rest goes to the Sun so in inheritance there are two ways of inheriting either by F or by how you translate this how do you translate this F is a percentage and we have six percentages half and half of it third and half of it fourth fourth and half of it these are the six percentages half who inherits with the half the daughter and no no not the wife the other one the husband when the wife dies leaving no children the husband gets half if she has had children and she died the husband gets quarter so half is inherited by these two either one daughter or a husband who whose wife did not have any children half of it is what a quarter who inherits by a quarter huh the wife when when the husband does not have any children and the husband when the wife has children if she did not have children he would have half then we have this these are two huh half and half of it then we go to the number three which is one3 who gets one3 the parents the mother when the deceased has no children and one sibling only one brother or one sister he gets she gets oneir if he has more than one siblings automatically she gets one sixth which is half of the third the father gets oneir if he has no children and the rest but this is his F who gets one sixth the parents the mother if he has more than one sibling and the father if he has children because the father gets like the mother only one sixth anyone anything else one six P command sixth yeah these these are the two okay now the fifth percentage is what no 1/4 one quarter and half of it so one quarter who gets one quarter the wife if the deceased husband does not have any children and the husband if the deceased wife had children who else nothing half of it is 1/8 who gets 1/8 the wife if no not she he if the husband the deceased husband had children then she gets only 1/8 noteworthy do you know what is the co-wife called in Arabic the co-wife if a man has two wives what is the second wife called in Arabic it's called what does d means from harm why is she called D because if a man has two wives each one of them gets half of 1/8 so both share 1/8 but if she was alone she would get 1/8 for herself she has a she's harming her even after his death so she's sharing 1/8 if they were four they would share 1/8 so imagine the percentage this is why it's called in Arabic because in his life and after his death she does this to him these are the six percentages allocated in the Quran okay what did we say one we think I think we missed one huh half and quarter ah yeah yeah we we mixed it half and quarter 2/3 and a third there are 2/3 I did not mention a quarter I mentioned it twice yeah this is wrong half and a quarter 2/3 and A3 and quarter and an eighth 2/3 are given to whom no no son huh if there left more than two or more daughters if a deceased dies and he has one daughter she gets what half if he dies and he has two daughters or more they get two3 of what he has left two3 they participate they uh uh take this much this is called f now others of the Earth have what is known as or they inherit the remaining and who are these the sons the daughters the Father the siblings if he has no children and no father the uncles anyone who's related to him by name so the wife and the husband they inherit by percentage by F the mother inherits by F either 1 six or 1/3 the daughters if there are no Sons they inherit by F half or 2/3 but if there is a son no they their percentage is gone they go by and so on so in a nutshell this science is very nice and beautiful and easy little bit complicated but once you get the hang of it it becomes very easy for you to understand and Allah knows best if you have any questions you can go ahead and ask inshallah during the Q&A [Music] session"
