  "title": "What if a woman has strong, bad body odour, can she wear perfume & go out? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is um I know as women we're not supposed to use perfume when we go out uh what about if a woman has a very strong offensive body order um can he use something to cover that so basically the had of the Prophet states that any woman who wears perfume and passes by n men who could smell this fragrance from her she is an adulteress she is a Zan so this Hadith prohibits a woman from wearing perfume when there is a chance for nonaham men to find her scent such as in the case when she goes with a driver or with an unah relative in the car or she passes by men at the mall and they find this scent if a woman has an offensive odor as was mentioned in the uh question this is usually gone by taking a shower self hygiene would take take this odor away and there is nothing wrong in applying deodorants because deodorants cannot be smelled as when you put and apply perfumes and wear perfumes so deodorants would restrain and and and prevent such odor from appearing but usually such an odor comes only from using the same clothes repeatedly or when a person does not take a shower uh regularly and Allah Knows Best"
