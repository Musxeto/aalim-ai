  "transcript": "so shake my question is that what is understood by the one eyes I see one eye tattoo on the body of many people I see this one eye in many places many say it is a sign symbol so Sheikh I want to know what is meant like this okay I'm I don't know um people of conspiracy have many theories my own theory is this is referring to Popeye this is why they call him Popeye I don't know others say no this is the jail and others say this is part of the Freemason ideology and this is why they have this one single this is all yeah the big baloney and I think that matters to us as Muslims you can put one eye in maybe tomorrow I'll put three hours what's the problem so it's not the number of eyes that count so don't make an issue of something that is Trivial or superstitious or part of the global and Universal form of intimidation for those who do not have knowledge shrug your shoulders and move on"
