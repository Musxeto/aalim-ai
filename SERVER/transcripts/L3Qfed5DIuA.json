  "transcript": "sam uh sheikh can you throw some light on doing business with banks and financial institutions okay and the consequence of dealing in it doing business with banks and financial institutions is halal as long as the business is halal so if i have i understand the question here i know what you're getting don't worry if i have a brother in the uk and i want to send him money i will not go to any tom dick or harry i have to go to the bank and i give him a thousand pounds worth with 70 dirhams transaction fee and that is it this is halal if i want to deposit my money because there isn't any islamic bank and i put it in this bank and they don't give me interest it is halal if i want to pay my telephone bills electricity bills through the bank this is halal so doing business with the bank and financial institution is halal however if the transaction itself is haram then it's haram so if i'm dealing with the bank either taking riba i.e interest or giving riba having a loan from the bank and putting interest on the loan not buying anything from it just money for money this is one of the major mubikat the major sins that takes uh that take the individual to hell the prophet told us it is one of the major sins allah told us in the quran that whoever deals in riba will have war waged against him from allah and his messenger sallallahu alayhirusalam so it's a huge threat but you have to look at the transaction in order to give the answer how about uh doing some service not exactly dealing with bank suppose banks have some requirements for their own office it's not like depositing money or something so this is different now you're not dealing with the bank as investing or transaction you want to provide this financial institution or conventional bank which is riba based with services such as maintenance electrical work plumbing renting this is your question yeah or i'm a software engineer and i work for a company that develops software and they assign me to develop a software for that conventional bank what's the ruling it's haram allah said in chapter 5 in the very beginning on virtue and fearing allah azzawajal and do not cooperate on haram vice and sins and transgression so anyone who helps someone in haram will take the same burden of him so this is totally prohibited"
