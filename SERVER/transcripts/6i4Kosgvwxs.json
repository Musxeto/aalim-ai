  "title": "Angels make dua for us if we remain in our place of prayer Does this include voluntary prayers Assim",
  "transcript": "I have a question I know that the Angels keep doing stuff upon us as long as we stay in the spot with that we pray that is all this also applied to voluntary prayers does this apply to voluntary prayers it seems it seems that it does because the prophet Allah says one of you is still in prayer as long as he remains in his position so he did not I saw his son specify whether it is a fart or voluntary as long as you've concluded your prayer whether it's fought or voluntary then the Angels still pray for you and upon you and Allah Knows Best"
