  "transcript": "Ranade says if we put on a fake tattoo not a permanent one that can be removed in a week on a part that does not need to be washed in wood for instance the leg is it permissible first of all the word tattoo raises a lot of question marks because tattooing is a major sin in Islam the Prophet is awesome as in the hadith or below masud may allah be pleased with him had cursed the tattoo artists and the women who have the tattoos done on them than allahu la Shema one must Oshima and this is an authentic hadith now if what you're putting in applying is called tattoo metaphorically but it is not it does not fulfil the conditions of tattooing and it does not fall under the category of it because a one-week tattoo is permissible this is like applying henna or was as they call me handy so applying henna is not problematic because it takes a week couple of weeks three weeks and it fades away so Rihanna's question has two parts one the ruling on applying a one-week henna or a tattoo - if it's longer but it is not in the organs of woudl these prints that you put on your body are either not allowing water to reach underneath because they form a layer or water can reach the skin without a problem because they are not a layer but rather a color so if I get something that is drawn on my arm which is waterproof and I can feel that this part of the skin is skin and when I put it on this print or tattoo cotton coat it feels that like there's a plastic layer on my arm this does not allow water to reach your skin and hence you cannot apply this because your Woodill would not be valid your whistle would not be valid now if I apply it in my shoulder for example this is not part of the organs of woudl so I can perform water without in a problem but if I were to have a major ritual impurity and I would need a whistle in this case this would prevent my hustle from being complete and valid and hence applying it is not permissible henna on the other hand is something that you put for an hour or two until the color is fixed and then you wash it off and all what remains is a color like when I have a pen and I just write a line there's no layer on the skin it's just the color and this does not prevent water from reaching the skin and the wood is valid having said that I've noticed nowadays among the Muslims men and women unfortunately that they're applying tattoos but they apply it for a year or two years today in Foggia prayer I saw a brother praying in the Masjid with a big tattoo of a sailor's anchor on his leg and it was exposed the brothers our from the navel to the knees were covered but his leg was not and everybody in the message was looking at that this is not permissible if you had done a tattoo when you were ignorant or when you were a kafir and now you've accepted Islam you must hide it we don't force you to remove it but you cannot expose it and boast about it like this this defies your repentance of it it shows that you're not remorseful also a lot of the youngsters girls they have tattoos on their hands and they say that this is only for six months for a year this is Haram this is the one that she was cursed for she says but this is not in the third layer of the skin where they put the ink after they make it bleed etc it's the same concept first layer third layer it doesn't make a difference not only that a lot of the women asked about micro bleeding and they say that this is something they do for the eyebrows this is tattooing because they slash the skin until it bleeds and they clean it and they opened small places in the skins layer where they inject ink so they draw a nicely formed eyebrow with this ink and it shows with the remaining hairs of the eyebrows that it looks real and it looks fancy in it's fixed for six months for a year maybe two years this process is cursed by allah azza wajal because the is totally tattooing you"
