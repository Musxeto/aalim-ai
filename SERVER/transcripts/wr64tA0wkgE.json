  "transcript": "Alum so the IM of mos leads prayer in a way that for example during first Raa in the second sud when he discharges his forehead from the ground he doesn't say t he says T while he starts to stand up for the second Raa the same applies for the ru and other parts as well which means he delays to say t so if I let him finishes T and only then I go to Ru orud or raise up it becomes more late so should I take movement with the IM simultaneously or must I wait till finishing his the Sunnah is that the follower does not start to move until the Imam has reached his destination for example the companions say after rising from saying we're standing and the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam is standing the moment the prophet goes for suud none of us bends his back we still standing straight until the forehead of the Prophet touches the ground regardless whether he said allahar and he's still going and then touches the ground this is when they start to bend their backs and go for sujud what the imams are doing is in this process they sayb this is right is to be said between the movement not in the beginning nor at the end so they're saying it at the right time however because some imams may move slower than others some are agile and athletic some are old and crippled and so they go very slow therefore the jurors the fukah say you don't start to move until you see him reaching his end destination and if you're unable because you're in the row don't move until he finishes the rbar he finishes the r then you start to move and Allah Knows Best"
