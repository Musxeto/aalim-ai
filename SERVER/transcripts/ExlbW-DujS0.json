  "transcript": "there isn't a specific period for shortening prayers when you're outside your city some Scholars say that if you intend to stay more than 4 days you have to complete your prayers and this is mad's uh fatwa and other Scholars but be pleased with him and before him Islam have mercy in his soul and also Alani they say it's indefinite as long as you are considered to be traveler and you did not settle down then you may shorten as much as you want and I give you an example if I'm going to stay one week in uh London and then go another couple of weeks in Birmingham and then go to uh Adra for 10 days I'll be shortening my prayers throughout the journey but if I get a scholarship or I get appointed for a job in Los Angeles for example and I go and I know that I'm going to stay there for a whole year so I go the first couple of weeks or three weeks I probably be staying at at a hotel or a motel and then I rent an apartment and then I furnish it and after 3 or 4 weeks I'm settled down I go to my college I go to my work and I come back in the afternoon and I'm settled when I am settled and I feel feel that I am settled in this city then I must complete my prayers and Allah Knows Best"
