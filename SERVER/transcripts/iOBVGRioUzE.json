  "transcript": "how do i get closer to my family when they are so occupied with social media with their devices someone is on the phone someone is on the ipad well this is a big problem and by the way we are all suffering from it i'm suffering from it in my home and my kids are suffering from it because i'm always on the laptop or the ipad of whatever devices i'm working on answering questions or preparing for this or preparing or researching something it's always there however there has to be time that we spend together so we spend time on meals we spend time after meals so if we have dinner together i would feel okay to give like half an hour of my day or maybe a little bit more and sit with the kids with a wife talk and give them advice remind them of this or that not to tell them do this or do that like simon says no this is a quality time so we discuss things that would hopefully benefit them yeah this happens but unfortunately when there is no control and there is this tendency that everyone is happy with what he's doing i'm happy spending 18 hours on my devices doing different things counseling answering questions researching doing uh um preparing for lectures etc it's all good work but i have a responsibility towards my kids you tell me which one you do would you prefer i said closing my door and working on my stuff but this is not what pleases allah the balance is very important so i have to go to the gym i have to answer my questions i have to see my kids i have to buy groceries i have to connect to my next of kin i have to go to the masjid and deliver my dawah work there i have to do my lectures etc i have to balance my time in order to be the happiest man on earth and this is not a choice this is a must you have to do this in order to have the balance in your life so you my friend musemil should learn how to have the key for each one of your family members because each one has a different key now if you have in mind only to preach and teach and say what's halal what's haram as the moral police nobody is going to listen to you but you need to know how to make them love you so if a couple of your brothers or siblings love football then assign two or three days in the week that you all go and play football and have quality time if your parents love you to do things for them you do that for them so that they love you as an obedient son if your sisters would like to speak to you about different things and share with you things speak with them don't be the moral police but have it at the back of your mind how to diplomatically and wisely insert things that would benefit them in their in the hereafter and also in this dunya and bit by bit things would develop you cannot come with a magic magical pill and say now everything is going to be great everything's going to be good we would like to become a family no devices you can't do that there has to be a a a lot to be done before you reach this level and allah azzawajal makes it easy for all of us you"
