  "transcript": "sidi from germany he says that there are people who when you talk to them about haram things in the sunnah they reject it and they say no as long as it's not mentioned in the quran we do not uh believe in it this is very dangerous and such people risk being an apostate depending on the degree of the rejection if they say we don't believe in the sunnah totally and anything that is not in the quran we do not believe in it these are kafir disbelievers because they disbelieve in the quran so many imbeciles wallahi so many ignorant people that you feel so ashamed while speaking to them feel so sorry for them and they're so proud of themselves yes we don't believe it's kept in the quran the quran is the word of allah allah revealed it to muhammad ali preserved it we believe nothing in except in it uh excuse me have you ever read the quran no no sorry i don't i don't know arabic masha'allah and you're coming to discuss something of the principles of islam simply of out of your whims and desires don't you know that in the quran allah says obey allah and obey the prophet how to obey the prophet how to obey allah because the quran was revealed to him excuse me it's the same thing obeying the quran the prophet islam is by believing in the sunnah so if you do not believe in the sunnah and you say no music is not mentioned in the quran wearing gold for men is not mentioned in the quran doing this doing that is not combining marrying a woman with her maternal or paternal aunt is not mentioned in the quran i can do that and he keeps on saying rubbish so what do you do with such people such people are apostates because they've exited the fall of islam this is different to someone who says that the hadith related to music in my opinion and according to my research is not authentic i believe in the sun i believe 100 in the sun and abide by it but there is a specific hadith here and there only a handful maybe one or two that i don't accept this is dangerous if it's coming from someone who does not have knowledge if he's a knowledgeable person a student of knowledge a scholar yeah we accept that because he's got the tools to make such a verdict but if he is someone who's ignorant doesn't know the sharia doesn't know the quran doesn't know arabic and he comes and gives fatwas and yes halal and this is haram and he doesn't know how to speak even the language of the quran definitely this is something that is dangerous but due to the fact that he did not reject the sunnah entirely rather only one or two due to maybe legitimate reasons maybe not then he's not a kafir for that you"
