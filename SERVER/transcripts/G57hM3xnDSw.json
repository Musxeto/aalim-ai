  "transcript": "[Music] our nose drops and eyedrops permissible for usages during fasting the Prophet said Ali his salat was set up in the hadith of la Pieta a Beno Sabra may Allah be pleased with him he instructed him how to perform woudl and he told him to exaggerate in rinsing his mouth and nose but he said Allah his salat wa sallam exaggerating rinsing your nose and mouth unless you are fasting from this hadith scholars say that if a person is fasting he must not exaggerate in sniffing the water up his nostrils why because the passage from the nostrils goes directly to the stomach so you may drink water and you may sniff it and it would lead to the same passage to your stomach and this is why scholars say that if you put nose drops and you find the taste in your throat this breaks your fasting but if you put eye drops ear drops if you swim this has no impact on your fasting even if you find the taste of ear drops or eyedrops in your throat because this is not a normal passage to the stomach but the nose is so using nasal drops if you find the taste in your throat or you lead it leads you to swallow some of it this nullifies your fasting [Music] [Applause] you"
