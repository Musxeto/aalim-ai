  "transcript": "put from australia he says chapter 9 verse 5 is it about killing those who had a treaty that was time bound the answer is yes there was a treaty between the prophet and the disbelievers after the conquest of mecca and the prophet fairly gave them four months to roam around and do whatever they want and think it over if they find that islam is the best for them they accept islam if not they should leave the whole arabian peninsula and go elsewhere because if they were to be found after four months they will be killed so that was specifically to those people because other places in the quran it tells us that we should not have fights and and and jihad with those who do not fight us or um oppress us or try to kick us out of our lands rather we should treat them kindly and nicely uh scott"
