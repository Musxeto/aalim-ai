  "title": "No barriers in masjid Men don't lower their gaze & women come with make-up on #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um my question is uh regarding uh how some of the mids they have a barrierless uh setting there's no barrier between uh men's a section and women's section and they use evidence that this is how it was during the time of the Prophet s alai wasam um so however these things as we know uh that men we are lacking uh very much when it comes to lowering the G and also women uh do not uh do a proper covering many actually in fact wear makeup the as well um so my question is is this VAR setting really uh feasible or appable this time days um your line was not very clear but I think if I understood your question correctly it was talking about the partition between the men and the women's area in the Masjid and as we know at the time of the Prophet alham they prayed in the same Hall in the same Masjid and they did not have any partition to separate or segregate them from one another the prophet simply said the best row of women is the the furthest the last and the best row of men is the first to keep them as far as possible and the worst row of women is the first and the worst raw of men is the last to keep them as again as far far from each other as possible nowadays people are divided some say no we have to confine women to a room or at least put a uh a partition to segregate them so that men would not look at them and the women usually complain and say we can't see the men when they're praying and sometimes the microphones get disconnected and we lose track o of uh following the Imam and each have their own evidences me personally I'm fine with both and to claim that women come inappropriately dressed and men don't lower the Gaze that wouldn't change the ruling of Islam because I could go even more extreme by saying oh if this is the case then we shall ban women from coming to the Masjid as it's in many places in India for example they don't have any prayer room for uh or prayer section for women they totally ban them from coming to the Masjid and this is Haram this is not part of Islam at all so we cannot justify crossing the line and changing the rules of Islam because of some mistakes or sins that people do we tell men to lower their gaze and not to stand up and leave until it is proper for women to take cover and to uh leave before the men as was the Sunnah we tell women to fear Allah and to wear modest clothes and not to wear makeup and not to reveal their uh and so that they would not gain sins and nullify their own prayers why are you in the Masjid in the first place you're there to gain reward from Allah but by coming in this fashion you're gaining sins so they have to be careful and Allah Knows Best"
