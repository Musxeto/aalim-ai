  "transcript": "[Music] sh alhamdulillah we have sh aim here today uh first we very we apologize second time because of the unexpected crowd so we have to prepare in future uh secondly uh we will start the program straight away about 10 minutes behind um I'll be reading the questions share will answer so that he doesn't continue you know talking nonstop so before they bring me the chair I shall start we don't have to worry thank H supposed to to no no okay the first one is a very simple on how do we achieve how do we advise a parent who's heavily involved in doing but distant in his relationship with his family as you see the age has it stole on my voice so I won't be singing anything today I'll just try to make it as clear as possible but alhamdulillah um what is meant BYU it has two meanings number one of course is exit in Arabic but in Islamic terminology means either to Rebel against the Muslim ruler like the this is the same words stemmed from or it refers to what is known with the when they go for 3 days one week 40 days in their da process so which one is the question are asking about I would presume the second because the questioner said that the father is neglecting his family so first of all is a group found in the Muslim world and they have their roots from the subcontinent with the diand sect and um yeah you know what's related to them the scholars had spoken about this SE and group I know personally a great deal of their members they're the most kindest people on Earth they're the most generous people on Earth they're the most Down to Earth but with all this it doesn't say whether this is good or bad what says whether this is good or bad is the Quran and the Sunnah and definitely they are involved in many and many things that are not according to the Quran and to the Sunnah and they have a lot of fabricated processes in their da so I always advise people not to associate with them in their not to reject them or to spit in their faces or you're innovators we have going to step on your neck no they're very kind if they come to your home accept them give them food give them drink and give them DA they are focused on a number of things that are Innovations but they are focused on many other things that are good they invite people to Salat they invite people to Sunnah growing the beard except for women uh and uh shortening your th going to the Masid encouraging this uh uh social life which is good but they have a lot of Innovations they depend on weak hadiths uh they depend only on these things you cannot speak about any other things no politics no Jihad everything that is oh no no it divides the Muslims we can't speak about this so what do we speak about prayer in and reading or this is their constition tion but they have good things they have a lot of bad things so now what is the advice to this Father Allah has told you in the protect yourself and your family this is your priority in life but unfortunately it's an Escape if I do I don't have to worry about my kids I don't have to worry about my wife I hope she's not watching this I love you with all my heart so I don't have to worry I just go for one week or for 40 days I enjoy life I enjoy sitting in the Masid doing doing storytelling I was in South Africa and the car ran out of fuel and we were in a a tribe that eats men I heard this from one of the I was attending life I heard this person nobody told me and the guy is is coming from South Africa is saying and we were stuck in the jungle what are you doing in the jungle give me a break here what do you think I come from Bollywood and the guy said and we were in a in a tribe that eats men uh um man eaters how do you know beware man eaters lion Crossing what is this and the guy said we did not what to do we did ran out of gas and it was almost Sunset and we started doing Dua and all of a sudden the car starts mallah this solves the fuel crisis very good and we reach our destination so who wants to go with us for one week or for 4 40 days next trip everybody was I will go I will go you're paying for the gas I'm willing to do it your Dy is is accepted so it's a a way of running away from your Dem domastic problems your children your wife your relatives but this would not help you in your grave or on the day of judgment you have to take care of your own children if you do that yes you can do whatever you wish after that go to the gym go to uh da go for whatever but focus on upbringing your children because the prophet said all of you are Shepherds and every Shepherd is going to be questioned about whom Allah made him responsible for so this is what you're going to be questioned not the umah Allah is not going to question me about my um Allah is going to question me about whom I left in my home how I did with them um did I believe enough money did I give them da did I uh teach them my level best to become good Muslims and try to fix whatever was not appropriate or not maybe you use this okay hello hello hello hello yeah okay we'll finish that yeah finish that one so we'll do the second question at the back can you hear him see can you explain the do and don't of Photography and can we keep profal pictures in social media and what is the ruling on it can you explain the dos and don'ts of Photography and can we keep our our pictures on social media you know you know this is frequently asked questions maybe I would make a test and you guys answer instead of me because everybody knows the answer but I will give you the answer answer in a nutshell inshallah photography is an issue of dispute among Scholars why because the prophet said in the most severely tormented people on the day of judgment are those who fit the description of the Arabs know is the one who makes a portrait and also nowadays with the introduction and invention of uh uh cameras the person who clicks the picture is called mus so people Scholars get H 1+ 1 equal 2 then the prophet meant the people that also click pictures others calls it whoa whoa whoa cameras were not invented said yes but the prophet used the terminology but it was not on his time but he he used it okay by your definition gold is Haram for men now we have black gold which is oil so can I use the same analogy I can't use oil for men of course not this is not what is meant and also the Arabic what is the meaning of in Arabic now means an atom you know an atom protons neutrons electrons this is in Arabic so people translate this no one will enter Jenna if he has an atom weight of arrogance but the prophet did not have atoms or quantum physics at the time what is the meaning of oh in Arabic means an ant you know ants Ant Man now they know understand okay so this is an ant this is what was meant in the Hadith in one interpretation so we cannot use the Arabic words today to refer to the Arabic words meant at the time of the Prophet so what does it mean at the time of the Prophet anyone who did depicts who takes pictures who draws and this is no difference of opinion Among Us anyone who draws a portrait I will take your picture Mah look okay this is Mickey Mouse not me but it's nice this is Haram because you are imitating the creation of Allah photography is not now if I get a check and I sign it of course I don't have a checkbook I'm a m Saudi but let's assume and I sign a check and someone zeroes takes a a a copy of my check and he brings me the Xerox copy and he said is this your signature what do I say yes yes but it's not the thing I signed the sign the original is here but this is my signature likewise if I click your picture is this the creation of Allah people saying no who's this you if I look in a mirror is this the creation of Allah yes if I look in a pond of water it's a reflection of me I didn't do anything I didn't put any spices or salt and and the likes this is a creation of Allah so it is not imitate it is not trying to mimic Allah's work it is Allah's work unless you photoshop I had one of my employees in my when I used to work in companies and he brought me the photo of me because we had to have IDs and I look at the photo oh man this is handsome I have no pimp pimples in my face and my white hair is all black and he he removed all the wrinkles and what did you do Photoshop sh said Mah you are among the most tormented on the day of judgment this is Haram this is mimicking and editing this is Haram so this I I hope of course it's an issue of dispute till the date safe rather than sorry don't but I personally believe it's okay for men and children sisters tough luck sisters are obliged to wear the hijab if she clicks her photos and puts it on social media or exchanges it on Instagram it's a private sh only women do you believe this nonsense do you believe that when you share your picture with your your sisters that her brother look look look my friend that's the one who came with us last week from from the University and the guy says H everything is hacked everything is penetrated so nothing is safe sisters are not allowed to take pictures not and you believe this or not I do not have pictures with my own daughters I don't have a single picture with my wife of 40 years alhamdulillah life without parole this is life prison and no parole you're there for forever alhamdulillah so I don't have pictures with them and my daughters complain B no this is a conviction a belief so I hope this answers your question thank you very much we'll move on sh please be reminded you have so many questions you just have one hour left I can say yes no if you wish you choose I listen I come here invited and I travel business class and I stay in five stars hotel and I enjoy my life and no wife to KN and and and this is my so I have no problem you dictate what I say you say sh you have 10 seconds to answer I can do this yes or no and he said no sh well we come here to learn and to have fun and to enjoy it and so I up to you okay we move on our female is allowed to travel to another country on her own for furthering her tery tery studies no I told you okay okay this is the request of the moderator the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a male Maham companion whose fatwa was this the prophet so a man stood oh prophet of Allah prophet of Allah my name was drum in an expedition for Jihad and my wife left for Hajj so I'm in a dilemma the prophet said go and accompany your wife leave Jihad now the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam did not say is your wife beautiful or ugly he did not ask is she young or old he did not ask is she alone or with the trusted companions other women he said go now the questioner can I elaborate sure right the questioner is asking about a woman traveling to pursue her studies this is one of two either she's traveling alone har or her father is accompanying her to take her to City peris for example I like peris because peris is very beautiful I've been there I'm thinking of settling there it's very calm compared to K too much traffic too much people everybody wants to fight with you in everybody's Everybody's Fine anyhow so if I'm accompanying my daughter to Peis and leaving my daughter to study it's safe she lives in a female only uh uh campus and she's abiding by the hijab there are people to take care of her groceries and it's safe and whenever she wants to come back to kale I go and pick her up and bring her no problem but to send your daughter to London a cafer country to pursue what business administration you have 25 universities in K alone that teaches business administration better than UK no no no but from the UK it's different you know and we Malaysians we don't need visas M no this is not permissible this cafer country it's Haram free mixing and it's dangerous and everybody is waiting to take a piece of the cake this is your flesh and blood so I hope this answers your question alhamdulillah we move on next are we allowed to attend a wedding of a non-muslim relative at a church it is not permissible at all to participate in any activities related to other religions whether it's a wedding it's a funeral it's baptizing anything that relates to other religions we Muslims cannot participate because Allah says well we do not attend false Hood we do not attend anything that is or idle talk let alone their own practices what are you doing it's a wedding in the name of the Father the Holy Ghost and the son I announce you man and wife and he does the crossing and you're saying mallah wrong place you are in the wrong place go to the Masid this is not the place to say it no it is totally okay she she's my sister I'm a revert she's my sister and she's Christian and I have to attend her wedding no Sheikh my father died he was a Catholic and I'm a revert and I have to participate in the No No participation in any religious activities now the uh reception afterwards no problem meaning they had the marriage conducted and now they have a small party in the house no problem in attending it because there is no Christian rituals associated with it providing there is no alcohol there is no free mixing likewise with the reception after the burial they go and they they eat M or they receive MERS to come and you just go and give you respect and and show and and leave there's no problem in that inshallah and Allah knows best thank you very much next one is straight forward are the supplications and prayers in Al from the of prophet what is who who collected it I don't know this is too generic see when you tell ask me about something that's too generic no if you mean mean related to the something that is from the old books collections Etc there has there are things that are authentic there are things that are weak and and fabricated I cannot elaborate you have to tell me that book of for example said okay in generally 98% is authentic I have no problem with that but when you come to give me a generic name that I cannot elaborate any know and and and judge no this is not fair hopefully we Le something please in future when you ask a question on this one be specific just from which book from which b or who wrote it so that be a fair answer from but in this case it's true can can anybody from our brothers orever so but that's the answer you move on next one sh this is interesting I saw a video of yours recently sh where you mentioned that if we break both we have to do one of the three things I want to ask in case of feeding 10 poor people do I have to give them cooked food or is it okay to give money that is enough for a desert meal okay Allah says on on uh the experation of breaking an oath it is either to free a slave or feed 10 people or clothe them and whoever is unable to do this financially he may fast 3 days so when Allah says free a slave or feed them so he specifically said feed not to give money so you have to feed 10 poor Muslims one meal and this meal is either cooked so there is no specification some Biryani with meat or with some chicken or uh some nasor with some rang and and dingding and I don't know you guys know your your food better than me if you want to give raw food you give the equivalent of 1.25 kg of rice so individual so half he takes it and he cooks whatever now can I give three kgs to uh uh the same person so five members of the family I give it no you have to feed 10 individuals you can't feed five twice or one 10 times there have to be 10 individuals per oath regardless old old young male female it doesn't matter they have to be Muslims and they have to be having these can I give them money no you can't sh I trust them because they will take the money and pay the bills of the mobile no Allah says feed them so it has to be food that you give to them you can authorize an organization that you trust if they know and you give them money and you say to them feed and they you know that they going to feed so that's that's permissible and Allah knows best thank you very much you on if a woman works as a teacher in a school teaching kids of Ages before they hit in a garden and there are male teachers for higher classes it is permissible for her to work there by maintaining complete restrictions with the m teachers or is it per do we take public transportations yes or no do we go to restaurants and eat do we go to grocery shops and we buy where there are Slots of men this is something that yeah it's it's not even found in Utopia that women are alone and men are alone that would be heaven but yeah again I hope my wife is not I'm putting myself in a lot of trouble I did this year so there is no yeah Escape of this you have to live like this so if your workplace especially in places that are freely mixed like Malaysia and so many Muslim countries unfortunately and the woman is 100% abiding by the hijab so men cannot say oh yeah yeah I work with your wife she how does she look uh I don't know she but I work with your wife do you speak with her so no M she doesn't speak but I work with your wife what do you want me to do I give you a Nobel Prize so it doesn't matter because she's totally segregated she's preserving herself she's not premixing she's not socializing there's no problem in that at all she's working with youngsters children who did not reach the age of puberty there's no problem in that at all alhamdulillah okay this one you have to pay attention it's very important what is the best approach when you are angry with your wife for a mistake that you think you think she did and she's not apolog apologizing to you we ignore her and wait until she apologize or is it there is there a better approach put your tail between your legs and [Music] run you need food on the table you need your clothes to be ironed you need your children to be attended you need her you cannot just say oh I'm the man and these type of questions are so generic what type of mistake she did to you she you didn't put enough salt in the food and she didn't not apologize you should be smacked in the face although it's Haram but I maybe I'll stack you on the shoulder huh y don't angry there are differences between mistakes well I I saw her riding in a car with a strange man so oh this mistake is not a mistake this is a Make It or Break It deal and no she she um said something inappropriate to me and she said no you're not a man like so and so so you have to measure the mistake and your reaction should be appropriate and impr proportion as I always say there's a mosquito in the room if I use a cannon I will kill the mosquito but everyone else in the room so this is not smart to kill a mosquito with a cannon so you have to know what is the mistake number one you have to react according to the size of the mistake number two you have to look at your own mistakes and compare Apple to Apple so if I look in the mirror and I say whoops I have this and this and this so many mistakes how would I like her to react oh it's different she I'm the Man Subhan Allah what what makes it difference you a spouse so as you have rights she has rights as you have responsibilities she has responsibilities and at the end of the day is this marriage a long-term investment or a short-term investment what do you mean are you intending to have this marriage for another 40 years without parole or no it's just for five years she and then alhamd I'm going to change her and take something better new model with the sunroof and maybe Zenon lights and you know no no this is not a car this is a of your children so you have to understand that life doesn't go by uh mistake number one mistake number two you did this you did that no it doesn't go like this you have to reciprocate I have mistakes she has mistakes she's not holding me accountable for my mistakes I will not hold her accountable for hers I will always look the other way and I live happily with this W sometimes I think let me think how many mistakes does my wife have if I thought for 5 minutes maybe I'll think of divorcing her I never think of my wife's mistakes and if someone asks me about her mistakes she doesn't have any she does have plenty come to think of it but alhamdulillah Allah granted me the content that whenever I see something I hate I look in the mirror Subhan Allah can't she live with this person no no no no I'm happy with her she has no mistakes so always be fair be just tomorrow you have you have children you'll have daughters your sister has a husband how would you like her him to treat her it's the same it's a debt you borrow you're going to pay back and Allah yeah make things easy me next one will the evil doers among Muslims who never committed shik spend eternity in Hell or will they eventually pass away and enter J every Muslim will enter J eventually full stop so he said okay he's an evil doer is he a Muslim yes what do you mean by Muslim that he does not commit kufur or shik yes he is committing a lot of sins he will spend time 1 million year maybe 5 million years in hell he will be roasted like crazy his skin is going to be changing he's going to drink uh uh boiling water and oil that burns his intestines 10 10 million years only but then he will enter Jen alhamdulillah so people say oh alhamdulillah ald take take a m and just put your finger and count to 10 what do you mean this is scary just to think that the least person to be tormented in Hellfire is Abu Talib and what is his punishment a stone of fire placed in his sandals from its heat his brain boils from that Stone of Fire if Allah were to punish you for smoking that would be your least punishment the Stone of Fire what about if Allah is going to punish me for drinking Haram or doing drugs or free mixing or having illicit Haram relationship or watching porn or skipping fer prayer or uh cheating people from their wealth or lying or backbiting if Allah were to take you to account for all of this you're going to suffer big time and this is in hell I'm not talking about the grave the grave is Transitional period so why are we doing what we're doing why are we reading the Quran praying prayer on time staying away from Haram giving s and we cry when we pray at night in oh Allah save my skin because we're afraid of Health fire we know what Hellfire is the vast majority of Muslims say yeah yeah Hellfire is very bad but how do you feel now personally hot because air conditioning is not working you say I'm come from Saudi Arabia everything is a conditioned there it's okay I know Malaysian people are poor they don't have alhamd may Allah grant them money Allah gr them money so is or I would answer you yes or no so you choose anyhow so uh um every Muslim will enter Jenna but after what after doing his time unless Allah with his forgiveness and mercy says I forgive you and this is in Allah's hands we don't we are hopeful we are depending 110% on this on Allah's mercy and forgiveness while being afraid 120% that he may not so it's a balance and I did in peus last time I came a lecture it's on my YouTube channel how to balance between fear and hope in Allah so you can refer to it it's free thank you very much now this was a very good one all of us has gone through this it however depends uh when and how often how to feel connected to Allah in Salah Comm to love performing Salah to love and to not feel like Salah is a call a ball this is something that requires a life changing experience it's not a magical pill alhamdulillah I'm praying with and 100% And if the Scorpion comes and climbs on my shoulders I would not feel it nowadays if you're in the mjid in the first row in congregation in F prayer andas is reciting the the Quran and a cat comes between your legs you will jump and hang in the chandelier where is the where yeah I was frightened like crazy because of what of a cat and this happened yesterday by the way in the Masid I was in they left the door open and a kitten just walked in in F now luckily I am originally Indonesian so I can see from the side so I saw the cat and I was watching people jumping you know as it came and touched it's you're startled when when when when something like this in the touches you you don't know it's a snake or something you just jump but the unfortunate thing that there were people laughing in the Salah of things happening to to the people in front of if it happened to them they wouldn't be laughing but Subhan Allah it shows you how far we are from Allah how many of us when we were young we used to pray and the IM makes a mistake he's among us and we make yeah we laugh and we break the Salah because we don't know who we're standing in front of we don't know Allah if your father was leading the pray you would not dare do a thing because you know what's coming to you so it's not a magical pill it's a way of life and this is what people are unable to concentrate and comprehend you go to the gym for 4 weeks with a coach professional trainer and he works with you for an hour or an hour and a half after 4 weeks you do this coach there's nothing what does the coach do he laughs he said you need at least a year and a half or two years to see something Salat is the same thing it's not a switch you turn on cats or dogs no matter what comes I'm not going to be startled no the first thing and I always tell people to do this if you want to have in if you want to find the sweetness of Salat you have to know who you're praying to so when I say to people how many names does Allah have they say what we know 99 Names 100 minus one you know the Hadith whoever knows them the meaning and implements them he will enter Jenna said okay how many names of Allah do you know they say a handful she said okay the handful you know what are the meanings of that said I don't know sh so then who are you praying to Allah who is Allah Allah this Allah no it doesn't work like this you have to know Allah's beautiful names and attributes so that when you hear what does entail the Hadith whenever my servant Allah says recites the Salat whenever he says Allah says my servant has praised me whoa who's saying this Allah now when you pray and say alhamd and you feel that Allah is responding to you how are you going to prayd people are moving in Salat picking their nose their ears look W in Salat one had his Mobile ringing he does this in Salat next to me I don't know if he answered it or not but he went on like what kind of of of a we have so if you know Allah's beautiful names you will have a strong shift in your email on my YouTube channel there's a playlist by the name of the beautiful names of Allah it's free I benefited because I did this program and whenever I do a program I benefit the most because I have to do research and when I do research I benefit from it inshallah I'm trying to write it in a book hopefully next year daa corner or that what what this called yeah whatever they will print it inshallah inshallah but this is important for you to know Allah's beautiful names number one number two it's a life process changing if you watch Netflix if you listen to music if you do Haram things and you come and pray what do you think will go in your mind no it's got to be the scenes that you've seen the music that w i get people youngsters coming to me in the Masjid saying sheh we pray five times a day in the Masid but we have one problem said what said when I come and make and I say sub subh with the last song I came in the car listening to the same the music is in your ears and it it resonates with you without you being able to control it and this is the evil of music is Music Beautiful well it is come on music is beautiful nothing is more beautiful than a song you hear that controls you and moves you you're driving in the highway speed 120 kilm you're doing 10 why I'm listening to sel Deon everybody behind you honks you highlights I just listen and when the traffic sign says 30 km/ hour you're doing 150 why I'm listening to rock music it changes you beautiful music is beautiful but it makes you a slave to shaan this is why Islam freeze us don't be addicted don't be a slave to other than that's why you find righteous people the moment watching news breaking news music comes what's wrong with you you have like electric shock he said yes because I know what music does to you so in your life you have to change everything in order for you to be able to say Allah abbar and feel connected so one says now H I have to change everything in life to be connected it's too difficult no I'd rather say as I am this is the vast majority of us now I told you the way are you going to change too difficult she too many things I have to change I cannot you know my wife is going to nag me if I take Netflix and the children are going to uh fight with me I enter people's homes to visit and I see elephants dolphins Birds statues that prevent angels from entering the home this is Angels do not enter your home she I cannot move it sh my wife will be very angry Subhan Allah they're wearing gold rings I met a brother brothers and I said a wedding ring is Haram in Gold said yeah I know it's har oh I never knew okay take it off no I can't why oh this is will break my marriage in in the Le countries Lebanon Jordan Palestine Syria and Egypt and most they believe that this in Arabic they call it they don't call it they call it because it makes you bond to your wife if you take it off the is broken the beliefs so in short she is kicking me with his foot saying come on what was the question by the way oh excuse me you know the heat because I can't breathe and um next time I'll bring you an air conditioning had may Allah make you one of my big fans um so concentrating in Salat requires a life change maybe I cannot change my life I'll do my best I'll try my level best to fix things it's not Make It or Break It no I'll try to cut some edges here to align with Islam and the more you do this the closer you get to Allah alongside no no no then they will curse me no leave it leave it there I don't I need Dua I don't I don't yes yes uh Just for information we have an program theut Allah on every Sunday so please attend please come very good W this is the most important science on Earth how the importance of science is weighed by the thing that you learn and what are you learning about Allah there is nothing more important than Allah St no one says okay but what about this is what about this is the most important science on Earth the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names and attributes so thise please come here please attend every Sunday and it's free I don't [Music] know this is from my pocket I don't know yes thank you Mo on to the next question a husband fores his wife to serve his mother and say she's obliged to be to obey him what to do no this is not true Allah Allah obliged a wife to serve her husband and children full stop he cannot abuse this by saying well Allah ordered her to obey me so I'm order ordering her to serve my mom and my dad and my sister and her husband and their children and if she has free time to do the windows of our neighbors what is this Simon says no this is a marriage so no she's not obliged but having said this I'm seeing some sisters taking a paper and fighting for divorce from now no not not now not wait wait wait having said that a sister has to be diplomatic and smart you don't want to be confrontational life is not run by this way if you live in a joint family like most people in the subcontinent in Malaysia I don't think you have this do you alhamdulillah living in a joint family is not a choice in the subcontinent this is how the whole joint family is made they they are forced to do it so some women reach the age of 40 and no one is willing to marry her why because when she says I'd like a separate home they immediately move out so she said what do I what to do she it's your preference stay without marriage or marry in a joint family she said I have to marry in a joint family alhamdulillah what to do next you have to live as per the rules and the Norms of the family which I don't approve of but your hands are tied you have to do something so be as diplomatic as possible as wise as possible try to uh um convince your husband little by little to save money so that you can buy a house for the family and move on and this happens usually but it may takes time and Allah knows rest thank you very much hope it answers the question you move on alhamdulillah I'm not a practicing Muslim but sometimes walk the blue I feel like Allah is not having mercy upon me suddenly suddenly I feel very lonely and depressed I feel like my level of spirituality has gone down they heal without any reason is this the was was of Satan what should I do well I'm afraid Satan himself would say what are you doing to yourself how can anyone think of Allah not having Mercy on him Allah's beautiful name and you're saying Allah is not having Mercy this is something wrong with your head why don't you think before you rephrase your question sometimes the word that we utter say fear Allah don't don't don't say me keep me keep your mouth closed because once it's out you're a prisoner to it now it controls you you're a slave to it but once you keep it within your mouth you still the driver you can well whether driver one or two this depends but this is something you can control it is a major sin to think negatively of Allah Allah doesn't need you Allah will throw you in hell think as you wish Allah doesn't need you Allah will put you in hell and how many does Allah have this is crazy when and I had a counseling session today with a brother who is thinking like this and I had to smack him left right in center and then the guy says I now I know my problem because lots of us talk without thinking they don't know Allah and they speak very badly of Allah why is Allah doing this to me I think Allah doesn't love me I think Allah is unfair you don't know Allah so first of all you have to know Allah second of all you cannot think negatively of Allah because if you do Allah will throw you in hell simple as that you think as you wish Allah doesn't care about you because Allah doesn't need you Allah has all this universe under his control who created it him who owns it him if he throws it all in Hell nobody can complain or say anything and when Allah doesn't give you he doesn't give you because he's poor he has everything in this world and he doesn't give you because he's still thingy he's the most generous who gave Ellen musk who this these billions Allah and Ellen musk is an athus CF so does Allah love him no it's a test Allah gives wealth Health prosperity to those who he loves and Those whom he doesn't but he only gives Iman and content to Those whom he loves full stop so when you feel this low and bad know that Allah doesn't love you because you're feeling like this change immediately repent ask Allah for forgiveness show remorse and think positively of Allah and I ask every single person who comes to me in counseling not everyone the majority when they feel deprived like him who's more living a lavish life you or the prophet Alam a simple question who's living a lavish life having a car having air conditioners having um no pun intended so who us does Allah love us more than the prophet Subhan Allah so think twice life is a test can you find me some one single person on life in life on Earth who's not being tested one just give me one who is not being tested musk he is being tested Big Time Allah says in the Quran we shall test you with evil but also with goodness so even your health is a test your wealth is a test your wife your children your prosp everything Allah gives you is a test don't think Allah is giving it to you and you're not going to be held accountable no at the end of the day you're going to be asked about every ring so everybody is being tested but tests vary and when you're content you say alhamdulillah the prophet had seven children six died in his lifetime and the seventh Fatima he was told on his deathbed that she's she's going follow him 6 months later how did he feel did he feel resentment complaining no and whatever Allah decrees we are satisfied with it yeah ibraim we're saddened for losing you the eyes Weep the heart is saddened but we do not say anything that angers Allah this is the content that you should have and this is what will take you to Paradise but if you have resentment if you have objection if you have complaints you're the only loser Allah doesn't need you Allah has billions of human beings who feeds them when I go to my festar hotel on the executive lounge and I overlook kalur highways in the rush hour and the traffic jam is horrible and I see these bikers and these cars in the tens of thousands hundreds of thousands what do I say I'm a wise man H I sit and think hm who's feeding them Allah each one of them has rent to pay at the end of the month who's giving them money Allah each one of them has debts has problems has worries has children has this has that who's facilitating all their Affairs Allah and and this is only a small 7 billion individuals living on Earth who's taking care of them subhanahu wa how many animals do we have on Earth hundreds of billions who's taking care of them and feeding them how many fish do we have in the oceans how many birds do we have in the skies how many insects around us who's taking care of them I think Allah is not happy with me I think Allah is angry Allah is not giving me who are you you ignorant imbecile you're nothing I am nothing I need Allah I am his servant not his peer I am his I have to express my poverty my humility my need to Allah otherwise Allah doesn't care about me so I hope this yeah gives you a reflection how to answer it thank you very much is a very good answer comprehensive now we need is counseling on disc question and this is a serious issue and quite common a bit long but I choose this question my partner and I committed adultery what do you mean by my partner and your wife your husband your boyfriend girlfriend I just read this question okay to ask it the question my part and I committed adultery and we wanted to get married okay our fault and we want to make the repent but this mom rejected me because she said her predicted we will be divorced after marriage and now she find a new girl on him with a share advising and me a she's daughter yeah my partner being forc to accept vage as his mom has to choose between his mom and me he decided to choose the mom and i' be so useless and depressed right now how I wanted him to take responsibility on what he has done and should I his family need a counseling sir no counseling needed how should I react to his what last line how I wanted to take responsibility for what responsibility of what you went to to bed with him he didn't force you you crazy this is the problem with women with all the respect listen listen listen don't get me wrong it it takes two to tango you don't blame the man oh he cheated me he did no no no no no no no you didn't do this when you had your makeup and perfume that makes men's Head turn you didn't think like this when you wee these sexy clothes and high heels and you softened your voice and you acted devilishly so now you're crying and weeping it takes two to tango you're not a child that you say that no no he fooled me both of you will go to hell inshallah from the whitest Gates of of Hell unless you repent because you contributed to this so don't play the victim's game number one number two he chose his mom over me excuse me how many mothers does he have on Earth One how many like you can he get 100 a thousand a million younger more beautiful more religious and probably richer maybe if he's lucky the daughter of Ellen musk you get a free Tesla alhamdulillah so he will always choose his his mom thirdly if he chose not to marry you then you should praise Allah and say alhamdulillah because he's not a real man if he was a real man to depend on he would have not said oh my mom did not allow it no he would have been your rock he's not a rock he's not even a pebble he cannot be trusted so ask Allah for forgiveness repent feel remorseful and thank Allah you did not discover his true nature after having four or five children 10 years later on then you would have had a real problem and we all do mistakes but we cannot justify our mistakes by blaming others the blaming game is everybody's game no acknowledge your own mistakes ask Allah for forgiveness truly repent and show remorse and move on with your life is he yes or no the last man on Earth Allah will send you someone younger more be handsome and richer and maybe more religious so fix your relationship with Allah trust Allah and move on with your life thank you very much it's very good answer right answer so we'll move on minutes to go on time but we move to minutes I understand that there is a Hadi that prohibits women from traveling without I would love to travel and see the other parts of the world but I have no male I just who are able to accompany me I have no husband or brother and my ELD dad is no longer able to travel does this Hadith apply to a person in my it fits you like a glove without any male protector you are an easy prey to those Predators outside if you had a father and and a brother who would take care of you m this is is a little bit less but now you're no one to take care of you so I can take advantage of you alhamdulillah we have many men here maybe you will find your match so I hope that would start this matchmaking service and then you will have plenty of M in or potential M no you cannot travel and you ask yourself this beautiful logical question question is traveling a precondition to enter Jenna so one said oh I did not see uh uh this place Switzerland I did not see London I would like to see the world you know the evil tower in in Paris said okay is it a precondition to enter Jenna if you don't go you will not enter Jenna the answer is no it's not a precondition but if you travel without a Mah is it a precondition to enter Hellfire you're sinning you're disobeying Allah what Jenna are you looking for you have to comply with the religion of Islam not the other way around it's not the religion of Islam that should comply to my desires and needs it's the other way around I have to submit my will and Allah knows best thank you very much go on to another question if our death date is already written and fixed is making Dua murder and Society going to change our death dat or is it plan that we this question relates to factor number one can anyone know when the date of death is written no so what does it matter to you it's fixed soone says H so should I take the medication that saves me from this illness or not if it's fixed this is not logical because go down a little bit I'm hungry if I starve to death am I committing suicide yes I can eat why don't you eat why should I eat my death is already prescribed predetermined because Allah told you to take the means so there are two things that you have to be aware of and taking the means someone says I have full trust in Allah okay go and cook a meal to eat said no if Allah wants to feed me Allah will feed me okay starve and die and go to hell and if someone says okay I'm going to cook I'm going to eat but I don't have any or trust in Allah I'm going to do it on my own Allah has nothing to do with it go ahead enjoy your be you're going to hell you have to have both full trust in Allah knowing that no means can benefit you without Allah but if you don't take the means you will also not being trusting Allah coming back to the question does Dua make a difference the answer is yes how if my death is on the 23rd of November is tomorrow 21st of November just to be safe if my death is on the I don't want you have problems with the funeral I have a a lecture on the funeral rights inah on the 25th so no problem so if my death was pre-ordained on the 21st of November I don't know when it is if I make Dua this Dua of prolonging my life would be included in the preordain and the predestiny of Allah so it will be part of it so H did it change it yeah you don't know what is change or not you just make Dua and it helps the prophet saidat whoever wants Allah to prolong his lifespan and increase his provision he should connect his next of kin so I go and and visit the uncle and I go and visit my aunt and I collect with my cousins and I call them and I say this will prolong my life hey wait wait wait wait your life is already pre-ordained your date of death is already written said yes I know but this would increase my chances of prolonging it how because it is also written that aim would do this and that and connect to his next of kin and his date of death instead of being 21st of October is going to be 21st of November I get a one month period but do I know does anyone know it's all in so suicide murder Dua they're all part of what is pre-ordained your destiny it's all written you don't know I don't know Allah knows so you do your homework don't go to the exam tomorrow in the university and say Allah if Allah pre-ordained it I will pass I will pass study no I'm not going to study it's in Allah's hands no we going to fail or you cheat it's also pre-ordained that you're going to cheat and you're going to get caught red-handed and you're going to fail in for the answer this one is it's very good inah an a 26 Allah stated that V women are for V men and V men for V women good women of good men and good men for good women but why did Allah match prophets Noam and Lam with disbelieving wife or woman wife who was against them and why AA who is muslima and believer Asia of Asia who is a muslima and believer and up with and Zula who committed infidelity and was unfaithful to her husband and then up with prophet yfam as for Z this is not authentic that she got married to Yousef peace be upon him nor that she committed infidelity because she didn't Yousef did not budge to her attempts peace be upon him as for the Ayah this is a common mistake in Translation this is translated in many as being righteous women are for righteous men and righteous men are for righteous women and vice versa this is not the most authentic opinion and T of it rather this Ayah is related to the slandering of mother and the slandering is done by what by words so the Ayah is referring to good words are for righteous men and righteous men speak good words bad words are for bad uh uh men and the likes and if you go to Islam Q&A you will find this the opinions of of mu and you will find that this is the most authentic opinion that the verse is referring to bad words that come out from bad people because as correctly uh answered mother uh uh uh Prophet n and Prophet L their wives were disbelievers but again even if we say that how could this happen if we were to take the interpretation or to be righteous men to righteous women we would say that this is called generally speaking there always can be exceptions so in the Quran there it has to be understood by the language of the Arabs not by the translators and this is why we say learn Arabic when you learn Arabic you can learn the Quran and the Sunnah but when you depend on my interpretation my translation you will suffer because any mistake I make can be uh um conveyed to you accordingly and Allah knows best thank you very much that's very good question and to that is which is the best of in English I I don't read English no no seriously I don't read English at all I never read English I cannot even read a book in English it's the most that's why I have a moderator because I hate reading English I can read a page of English and equivalent to 10 pages in Arabic because I'm lazy since I was young I would never read English but to my knowledge at the moment alhamdulillah they have accomplished [Music] translating and he is theh of and in Arabic it is one of the best easy going to it's not the best in the sense that it gives you every no no it's contemporary it's easygoing easy to understand IB C is one of the best but if you go to IB C so many narrations and weak and he gives you like half a page and they said and this is not authentic why why because this is how they used to do it they're all and this is part of the knowledge that he has to give you the Hadith with the chain of narrators and you would know that this is not authentic but to our times this is confusing so many opinions here and there like Islam Q&A the best Islamic website on earth and the most visited Islamic website in the history is islamqa a.info but to laymen it's one of the worst that they should be aware of especially those who have OCD because a very simple question that I can answer yes or no but you will take my answer because you trust me you know me so I trust I trust his intellect sorry for you but this is what's happening people who come to me they trust me say say okay I trust your judgment when they go to Islam Q&A they end up with a three or four a four pages and IM Malik says 10 opinions I'm lost I'm confused and this is good for business they come to me afterwards for a counseling session she I don't know did I divorce my wife or not pay $100 and I'll tell you so it's good for business but but it is not a good thing for people who are confused or people with OCD students of knowledge or people who are normal and they're thinking they can differentiate it is the best site without any doubt a huge amount of research and and dedication in this website so my point is is one of the best for us in in these modern times Allah knows best Just for information we do this T in our program I think if I could recall on the Tuesday or the Wednesday uh 103 to 12 this is the ex book and he the one was student of so please come the class is about 70 so do you sell the book uh the book uh I think uh we have options to sell a book but sometimes the the student prefer to listen to the and does his summary as he lectures okay because buying this and having it in your home is important I don't have any shares in the company but I may you discuss with them inah commission but seriously you do need you do need to have this I don't think it's in in soft copy because of of copyrights and and the likes and the dedication they put into translating it it's Haram to have a soft copy without paying it so yeah invest some money have it read with your children in the home 15 minutes every day few ay in the you will benefit inshallah hugely from it are most coming now for another 10 15 minutes I don't have anything tomorrow up to you okay so we'll do another 10 15 minutes okay sisters and brothers now this again interesting polygamy is not acceptable and Zena is acceptable amongst our relatives and Village and Villages or Village how to tle this me sh how is how to tle this me get married yeah again I always give this example I don't know if I gave it today or not I'm I'm losing track age has its defects I don't recall things uh a lot when someone with cancer comes to you and he's complaining of a severe headache what's the best headache pills Panadol Tylenol FID what I don't know here panad and immediately the guy say wow that's Magic Man alhamdulillah 4 hours later he comes back two panad 4 hours later he comes back and you do this for a whole week are you helping him why because you are tackling the symptom and not the core illness she my wife doesn't wear the hijab symptom my children love to listen to music symptom my husband doesn't pray in the Masjid symptom all of these sins are symptoms and this is why you struggle to tackle them it may work it may not work but if it works others will resurface and you will continue Struggle No directly go to the main illness and the disease the heart Islam is not properly implemented Islam is not properly followed and adhered to Allah's beautiful names and address on my YouTube it's free um knowing the SE of the Prophet Alam knowing the a things that relate people to Islam then these simp Syms will disappear so going back to adultery and fornication and Haram relationships these are symptoms I can force my daughter to stay home okay then what there is mobile phone there is social media there is work she has to go go to she there is a school there and you keep on trying from here from here from here it's too there are too many loopholes go to the core of the illness polygamy and seriously speaking who wants to get married to a second wife no no seriously I've been there and I've done that I was married to two women for 25 years at the same time and then I divorced my second wife why it's a long story but I can show you the traces of the high heels and the dough stick make it's so anyone who wants to get married again I advise him to come and speak to me first seriously of course he has to pay good for business but most of those who want to get married again oh she I have a friend who's married to two and I have another one who's married to three and I feel like you know degraded I have only wife one wife is good but if this is the only reason you want to get married to two don't I have to make a questionnaire I have to test you are you a real man to get married to two or not ask me how many counseling sessions do I do per week for people who got married to a second wife and now they sh what do I do my first wife wants a divorce and I have three children from her it's going to break the house didn't you know that before you knew so now what are you going to do she I have to divorce a second wife because she doesn't have any children mallah mashallah you're a real man no you're a chicken you're not a man you should have known if I had the need to get married again then I will put myself in a crossroad my first wife want to divorce I'm going to miss her I'm not going to compromise my second marriage and make because of my first wife you want to stay you're more than welcome you want to go all of this in Arabic I don't know how to say it in any anyhow so this is important because it's not an impulsive decision you make and it's not a one night stand this is a life that has that has consequences and everybody so don't jump in the ocean without learning how to swim so I hope this answers your question thank you very much that's a very very good answer to be advis us to do a meshing program it's not here right but we have been constra that for so many times but we can't do it maybe consult him after this $100 per okay we move on two or three questions so that uh you coming to close give I understand is required and you have to maintain s my question is how to attain and maintain the required level of s especially when is with challenges no this is too much yeah what do you want me to say sa okay you have to raise your tolerance to number five okay now alhamdulillah I have S sa is again a collection of things knowing Allah knowing the sweetness and the result of sa knowing the consequences if you don't do sa what will happen and if I do sa what will happen and what is more rewarding to Allah this is something you have to work on I have a child the child dies what should I do I have two choices number one bang my head in the wall start screaming and and crying and complaining and and why why why this and that at the end result I'm sinful and the child is dead is not going to come back to life choice number two is to be content alhamdulillah Allah has chosen this and decreed Allah gave me so many things other than that I'll be patient and content I'll be rewarded the child is still dead he not going to come back to life so at the end nothing is going to change your reaction is What Will Make It or Break It what will mean that you will go to Jenna or go to hell be rewarded or be sinful so the sa is divided into three types as youve always know the sub on doing righteous Deeds you need patient to go to F when it's early in the morning or cold it's never cold in Malaysia it's hot but yeah this is beside the point you need sa to refrain from doing Haram Temptations so many things no I'm not going to do this I'm coming in a flight 8 n hours everybody's watching movies no I'm not going to do this I'm closer to Allah I need Dua but temptation is there I need sa thirdly sa on calamities tests I was sacked from my job what should I do have sub look for another job I was was divorced have suffer I was abused have suffer my my kinship are saying bad things about me half calamities from Allah what to do this is what defines you and this is what states whether you're going to Jen inshallah or somewhere else but again the issue of sa is a vast and wide topic and there's a beautiful book by it's called because in IM is divided into two two halves patience and shuk gratitude so he makes in this book a comparison who's better at the side of Allah someone who was blessed and grateful or someone who was was tested and patient and he makes a comparison and beautiful book very and I'm definitely certain that it's been translated because it's one of the fundamentals of of these books buy it inshah and read it it's going to add a lot of value to you Allah knows best thank you very much the last two questions can we perform umra and read Quran for the disease father of Grandfather I don't know why the mother is not here and make Dua to Allah to reive them if they're diseased you have to take them to hospital deceased ah deceased okay see this is one of the disadvantages of being an English teacher it's an all habit so when a person dies and this is what we're going to talk about in in the fourth lecture on the uh uh the conference I don't know what's called uh inshallah on Sunday the rights of the deceased what are the his rights in our family so it's a issue of dispute a lot of us here think that whenever someone who's dead is is mentioned what do we do no not [Music] du they start rubbing themselves and what are you doing this is what we every where are you getting this from I don't know but you're wiping yourself rubbing yourself having a shower this is not from Islam not of the companions ever done this the elders do it don't follow the elders follow Quran the Sunnah don't follow me don't follow follow the Quran andah show me something that this is in Islam I'll follow you so Al f is a practice done in the Arab and the Muslim World hugely which is baseless when they do it when a person who has died is mentioned they read fa for his soul okay and when when a person gets married as if his soul is departing his body so we had marriage contract why the poor groom is sitting there read Bak is not enough so what is happening this is all Innovation Froman there's nothing in Islam yeah the faat is the greatest Surah in the Quran no doubt but I cannot relate to it in every occasion and read it and just patch it up with Islam because neither the prophet had done it nor the companions so where am I bringing it from Innovation now what are the authentic things so that we don't extend the lecture more and more what are the authentic things that would reach the deceased number one Dua without any doubt whether from his offspring or or from loved ones or from random strangers make Dua what kind of Dua the sky is Limit Oh Allah expand his grave oh Allah fill it with light oh Allah have mercy Allah have forgiveness Allah Grant him risk all everything Dua number one riches number two charity may Allah be pleased with him the head of the house tribe of came and he said oh Prophet my mom died but I think she would have loved me if I gave so and so sod should I do it yes so any type of Charity does the job what type any type of Charity digging a well for people to drink water this is the best of the Prophet said the best of Charity is to give water for people to drink from building a Masjid building an orphanage uh having circles ofran printing books and distributing it um doing da on the radio and mallah imagine I don't know if I heard it here or somewhere else but there are people businessmen millionaires who go to places like Africa and they make a small radio station for Quran and teaching how much would it cost $30,000 $100,000 peanuts is it not I can buy a Mercedes for $150,000 a Porsche likewise it's nothing not to me it's a lot but to you guys Malaysia look at the air condition here so alhamdulillah you can do this but imagine how many poor people in villages in tribes they don't have anything except radio dials and they listen to the Quran and listen to the information and reaches them with this money and you say this is for my father who's dead boom what is going to happen to his grave lit with Christmas tree not Christmas lit with lights with with with from so charity various and disguise the limit number three number four ha whether you do it or you pay for someone who does it so I know the brother did for himself and I said I can't here is 15,000 20,000 ring go for Haj on my behalf of my father and the guy loves to go to meca he's not making a business he's paying for the ticket and for the hotel and for the h expenses and he's enjoying going to meca and Medina your father in his grave will get the reward because of you so these are the four things that are 100% authentic to reach Quran it's issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that is not because the prophet when he buried his companion he said to those gathered seek forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah for him to be steadfast when answering the questions of the Angels because now he's being questioned he didn't say recite the recite recite thean no make Dua and ask Allah for forgiveness thank you very much and the last question it's a very simple question but it's a good remember Rememberance remebrance for all to all of us is there a where Prophet says is an obligation upon every Muslim to acquire knowledge yes this is a um an authentic Hadith but what kind of knowledge and knowledge is divided into two types mandatory obligatory knowledge that your Islam is not accepted and valid with without and knowledge that is a communial obligation that at the moment you don't need it so someone says sh do I have to know the rulings on zakat so I said how much do you have in your bank account none of your business I'm not asking to take money said I'm Stone broke I don't have any savings no money said no you don't have to someone says do I have to know how to perform Hajj when is your draw a lottery or whatever you call it here to go so 25 years sh so no not now you don't have to because it's not immediate but someone comes and says do I have to learn about Salah of course 100% the pillars of Sal mandatory acts of Salah this is mandatory because you're doing it five times a day it's a must this is knowledge that you obliged to learn knowledge about Allah knowledge of the meaning of knowledge of the meaning of subh and and the likes this is essential for each and every one of us to know because he's doing it Ramadan is close so do I have to know the rulings on fasting what breaks my yes because you're about to do it so I hope this answers your question"
