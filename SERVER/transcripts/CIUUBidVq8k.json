  "transcript": "My question is, is it permissible for a fully veiled woman to study in a co-educational medical college if she doesn't have that opportunity to study in a women's medical college? Is it permissible for what? A fully veiled women to do what? work and to study in a co-educational medical college. Yeah. She doesn't have the opportunity. Okay. If if she's studying medicine and she's fully abiding by the hijab and not showing any of her body part and at the same time she is trying to segregate herself from men and boys not socializing and not chitchatting then there is no problem in that inshallah and allahel knows"
