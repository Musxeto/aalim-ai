  "title": "Is wearing ankle boots ðŸ‘¢& short dress that shows boots OK as islamic wear for women? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so my question concerns about um if I wear ankle boots with low heels and a shorter dress so my feet and ankles are covered by the boots but the part around my ankles like fitted on my feet so would this be considered appropriate according to hijob guidelines no it would not be considered appropriate because this is eye-catching and it is quite attractive to some and what would be the limit if someone says okay I'm wearing a my boots to my knees and it's covering my feet but I can see the boots this is quite uh attractive to so many people so no this is inappropriate for a woman to wear such uh uh shoes and expose her feet this way by wearing boots and Allah knows best if her dress or ABA is going down and covering it there is no problem in that inshallah"
