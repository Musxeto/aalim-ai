  "title": "'All that belongs to you is your father's', Does father have full control over my wealth Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "suh says can your parents especially the father can he have all control over your money and finance as there is a hadith where the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says all that belongs to you is your father's the hadith is authentic and the people understood it wrongly the the letter lam or el does it refer to possession or does it refer to permissibility to use and the most authentic opinion is that it is the permissibility to use not to possess otherwise if the hadith meant that you and your wealth all that you possess belong to your father if this is what the hadith means therefore if you were to die there was there is no need for your wife to inherit your children to inherit your mother to inherit because your father will take everything he says all what my son possessed during his lifetime is mine so after his death by default it should be mine and no one had ever said this before so how do we understand the hadith we understand the hadith that the father has interest in what his son or daughter possess and own however this permissibility for him to take from his offspring's wealth has for conditions as scholars say the first condition that there should be no harm on the child so if my father comes and says to me you know these medications you take for your diabetes or for your uh blood pressure whatever i'm gonna take them all because i need them and i do not have sufficient funds to buy such medications except those that i have with me this means that he's going to harm me if i'm having a blanket in the midst of winter that warms me and helps me to stay warm and he comes and takes it and snatches it and says that no it's mine because you and your wealth belong to me this is not permissible because there's harm on me second condition there should be no harm and no dire need for it so yes i may possess a car i don't have financial means to buy another car i need the car to go to work i need the car to do my shopping to do my transportation and all of a sudden my father comes and takes the car i'm not gonna die because of that there's no harm from that but there is a need that i have to this car and by him depriving me from what i need scholars say he has no right in that condition number three it doesn't harm me i have no need for it i have a lot of it but he is going to take this wealth and money from me and give it to one of my siblings this is totally prohibited and what it would increase enmity in my heart towards my siblings for my father is favoring them over me and taking from my hard-earned money to give them and this is not legitimate not permissible and he's not allowed to do this and i'm not even obliged to give him and the fourth condition as scholars say is that he is actually in need so if my father was stone broke he may take from my wealth that would fulfill his needs and i'm obliged to give that to him but if he's rich yet he doesn't want to take from his own savings and he comes to me my house and he takes from my wealth and he says that you and what you possess belong to your father no this is not permissible and i i know few rich men who masha allah they are rich and wealthy yet they insist that their kids buy them cars buy them tickets pay for their rent do things that they don't need because they have money but they want to keep everything for themselves the children are not obliged to do this and allah azzawajal knows best you"
