  "transcript": "meh which says eating the eggs that are available in local chain supermarkets in the UK the hens fed on quote unquote maybe pork and other inorganic material is it halal again may wish maybe maybe does not change the fact everything on earth is halal by default until proven otherwise if I start to look at things from the perspective of maybe then with all due respect maybe you're born out of wedlock how would I know that your father married your mother before giving birth to you maybe they were boyfriend/girlfriend I don't know you weren't there how would you build ah if I start thinking like this I'll ruin my life and my religion so the default is the egg is there it smells okay it's tastes okay the default it is halal regardless"
