  "title": "How should men wash their chin in wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Trin says do men have to wash the chin when doing Woodill with long beard or is it sufficient to just run the wet hands through the beard including sideburns after washing the face when you have a beard like mine it begins from here so this area which is a chin is covered completely so what to do I wash my face and the water goes in but not thoroughly and at the end with wet fingers I do this so this ensures that the whole beard is washed but not soaked in water it's not doing this and putting water on it and soaking it or putting in a plate and going for a couple of minutes this is not the sooner the Sun is to wash your face and at the end with water in your hand not necessarily scoops of water but wet hands do you just thoroughly do this ensure that the water that already came in with washing the face and penetrated some of it it goes inside well this is all what you have to do and you should not of course it's not for you for tomorrow and a man should not open the door for OCD of Satan's whispers to mess up with his mind spending minutes and minutes maybe more than that doing Google which is a process that should not take more than a minute and a half"
