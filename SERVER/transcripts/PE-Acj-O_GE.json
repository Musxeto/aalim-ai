  "transcript": "I'm Dr I'm a pediatrician in India I've come just to attend this [Music] conference there is a Hadith that Allah subhana tala will not talk with three types of persons the third type is those who cover their ankle bones some say it means those who have takur and it is not the literary meaning of the Hadith there are few people who wear short trousers but they cover the ankle bone with socks there are others who wear normal trousers and fold during Salat time may I have your opinion on this had this please okay um I need another lecture can I have another half an hour I don't think so so in a nutshell I'm going to give you the juice the fruit of all of this it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that Allah has placed two punishments for those who extend their garments below their ankles and I'm talking about males and not females of course I don't want sister to come wearing short uh uh dresses saying above the ankle no they have to cover the whole thing so the first punishment is the ankle bone and the heel this area is punishable in fire if you extend your garment depending on the extension that's it so your whole body is not in fire but this particular area will be punished in fire of course the prophet Alam told us that the this in hell is a man who has a stone of fire put into his sandals now he's not literally being punished but this is the only thing but because it's extremely hot his brain boils so this is a little bit similar to that the second punishment is something which is a sin that pride is accompanied with the prophet saidat wasam three Allah would not talk to them would not look at them would not purify them and would punish them severely the first one Al the one who drags His Garment below the ankles and in another Hadith the prophet told us about that specific sin which is pride in addition to dragging the Garment below the ankle so these are two different punishments and to someone who extends and prolongs His Garment below the ankle to claim that I am not doing it out of arrogance has to prove that because Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him stood once when he heard this Hadith he was terrified and he said oh prophet of Allah I'm a skinny man I try my level best to have this waist wrapper as tight as possible but whenever I walk it falls below the ankle so I immediately pull it up so am I among those whom will be punished he said no you are not doing it out of Pride so if you have someone like the prophet Alam to give you this certificate of pride free garment go ahead otherwise you should be like everyone else as for prayer okay I'm sful from 9: to 5:00 I have to go to work I'm working in the corporate management and wearing a suit they will laugh at me when it comes to prayer I will not do anything I will pray with my trousers below my ankles no you can fold that then it would mean that you have like 15 minutes free time from punishment but then you will be the rest of the day in punishment and Allah knows rest thank you"
