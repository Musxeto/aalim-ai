  "title": "Ruling on using GIF made from Movies & Shows - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it halal to use gifs that are made from movies or haram tv shows so jif is basically a small video clip of two to three seconds that plays continuously nowadays many gifs are made from movies or haram tv shows i know that if that gif contains females it is haram to use them but what about gifs made from movies or tv shows but these gifs have only male actors in them a muslim must not come close to something that is dubious the prophet said al-islam halal is visible and apparent and clear haram is visible apparent and clear and between them there are dubious matters whoever stay away from them then he has saved himself and whoever indulges in them he is in the proximity of haram and he may fall into it therefore these uh i think it's called gif or gifs or whatever they're taken from movies and they portray men in funny um uh uh positions or laughing or um going to hysterical laughter or throwing uh uh out water because of a situation so usually they use it when they want to express their shock or laughter of something but he's an actor he's a kafir and this is taken from a haram movie and this may lead to someone who's ignorant like me to say oh this actor is funny so where is it coming from it's coming from this movie okay let me watch the movie maybe this is far-fetched maybe this is what will happen and you will be the cause of it and you don't need more sins in addition to what you already have therefore a proper muslim would not share or endorse uh such things and allah azza knows best i shall you"
