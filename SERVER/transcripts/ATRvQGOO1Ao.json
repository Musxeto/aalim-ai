  "transcript": "uh we have question of om ABD Kim stating that what's the ruling on giving Salam to a relative who is non Maham it's a long Topic in a nutshell if you are with your Maham if you are with your husband if you are with your father your brother and there is no fitna involved this is permissible there's no problem saying Salam alaykum my cousin how are you how is your wife how's your mother and that's it as long as you're wearing the prop hijab and you're not uh socializing you're not cracking jokes you're not um doing anything that would be a means of FNA because this happens among the relatives especially among the relatives so if you avoid this there's no problem if you're on your own no this is not permissible at all"
