  "transcript": "Taymor says I bought a mouth freshener spray yesterday I used it once later when I checked the ingredients it contained alcohol is it Haram or Halla to use it now the issue of alcohol in substances that we use if it is externally used like in this in the form of body creams lotions perfumes there's no problem in that if it is something that is consumed it is dependent on the amount of alcohol in it if the amount is sufficient to intoxicate a person then it becomes Haram when you consume it and if it is not if it is negligible as in so many cakes so many juices so many drinks that may have 0.1 or 2 percent alcohol even if you drink a six-pack it would not intoxicate you so in this case this becomes Hallett coming to the mouthwash or to the mouth freshener the amount of alcohol if it's written like it's like 30% this means that if you were to consume it and one says hey but who consumes it well hypothetically if you were to swallow it and it would intoxicate you then this amount which is very negligible and little to wash your mouth with is prohibited but if the amount is negligible in it doesn't have an impact then there's no problem in it insha'Allah one might argue and say isn't wine nachas impure well this is an issue of dispute among scholars is intoxicants which usually is referred to as hammer wine in the Quran is it physically impure or is it spiritually impure if you look at the verse in chapter 5 Surat al-ma'idah allah azzawajal is combining it with gambling with lots drawing and with idols and referring to them as rich from the acts of Satan but we know that gambling is not physically impure so ever played blackjack this doesn't mean that I have to wash my hands because now I'm in the state of impurity rather it is spiritually impure because of its sin as in the case where allah says in chapter 9 surah at-taubah in ml mushrikuna najasun the idol worshipers are impure Nadja's so their impurity is not physical if I shake hands with a an idol worshipper I have to go and wash it seven times and one with soil no it is spiritual because of their this belief and a la Sol knows best"
