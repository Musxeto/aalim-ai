  "transcript": "maaan Durrell says Allah created Adam in His image what does it mean as we know that Allah s image is different from us first of all this is an authentic hadith there are a number of authentic hadith that revolve around this meaning among them is that Allah created Adam in His image so do not strike the face and among other authentic hadith without any doubt so how can we understand these Hadees first of all a rule of thumb that all Allah's attributes the meaning of such attributes are the meanings meanings are understood and we cannot attribute something to Allah unless allah azza wajal tells us about it or his messenger alayhi salatu salam describes Allah by it the attributes of Allah are not what we call logical because we have to have evidence from the Quran or from the authentic CERN to back here up one can't say out of the blue that Allah is this or Allah is not this generally speaking so when we go to the Quran we will find that Allah described himself of having a face of having an eye of having two hands especially when he was addressing straight on Satan and he told him why did you not prostrate to what I've created with my own two hands and we find that allah azza wajal stated so many attributes of his he is all-hearing all-seeing his wise that he is knowledgeable that he's powerful but we see other people and they are also seeing hearing strong they can they have a face they have hands so is there any similarity there's no because Allah tells us clearly in the Quran that there is nothing like to him there's nothing like Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and he's all hearing all seen so we cannot describe allah azzawajal except with what he had described himself by without any misinterpretation without any giving assimilation or rejecting it so or saying how this is and we explained it we have to believe in it as it is so when we say that does Allah exist as we just do we exist the answer is yes is Allah's existence like ours definitely not does Allah hear and see yes do we hear and see correct is it similar to what we hear and see there is no comparison none whatsoever we come to the issue of image there's a lot that we shall have an image all the scholars of Islam agreed that Allah has an image is it like our image definitely not and you cannot even comprehend it you cannot even imagine it because there is nothing like allah azza wajal we know that the Prophet SAW had his awesome gibreel and he had in his original form and he had 600 wings blocking the horizon and from his wings there were diamonds emeralds rubies falling to the ground so if we have a bird and we were asked to place two wings no problem if someone says okay place a third wing that would be problematic where would I put that wing let alone think about 600 wings so this is one creation of Allah and you want to think about allah azza wajal this is impossible so we agree that Allah has an image and Allah created Adam according to that image meaning that adam has two eyes adam has two hands adam has a face etc now because allah created adam according to his image that does not mean that he is similar subhanahu wa'ta'ala and when the prophet tells us i assume that the first patch to enter paradise among the muslims are upon the image of the moon the full moon would anyone say that they will all be round and come like the moon no but they would have the image the look the globe the beauty the clarity but that images are different yet the Prophet Edison said they would have the same image of a full moon so we believe in the hadith we accept it as it is but we don't go like the deviant sex who try to simulate and to give similar attributes to allah azza wajal that he did not tell us about an illusion knows best"
