  "title": "Ruling on wearing niqab while performing umrah or hajj",
  "transcript": "okay going back to uh sister Karima from Saudi she's asking about the nikab and what is the a is derived from the word and means a hole andab is something that a woman wears on her face with holes so that she can see through so some people say it's like zoro's masks or some like the Ninja Turtles whatever they ridicule this beautiful ritual with it's to them and it would not harm our Dean alhamdulillah this is something that is part of our Dean it is mandatory how this is what I believe and this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars it is mandatory for a woman to cover her face and she is permitted to have an opening so that she could see through but if she can do without that then that would be great but if she can't she has to see the road she has to look uh in front of her then this case she is permitted to wear theab that only would allow her to see not this big because then it would show her color it would show the the size of her eye and eyebrows and how beautiful she is maybe she has crooked teeth maybe she has a a busted nose so by doing this she would look the most beautiful woman on earth no she has to make it as narrow as possible this cannot be worn in Haram when you're doing or when you're doing Haj because the prophet forbade a woman in the state of to wear the or to wear the gloves now if you go to Al wearing the a lot of the people would tell you you have to take this off because you're a you're in the state of but this does not mean you have to uncover your face and show your face because this is even worse and a lot of the scholars of Islam say there's no way or nowhere in the Sunnah where the Prophet peace be upon Him instructs people or women to unveil on the contrary there are en normous of evidences proving that the companions of the Prophet Alam and the mothers of the Believers the wives of the Prophet used to cover their faces while in the state ofam especially when men come but when there are no men around they unveil so this is the Sunnah so in this case yes you do not wear the nikab at all well uh in the state ofam but you simply put one layer covering your face or two layers depending how uh uh uh transparent that layer is you can also tie it behind your uh uh head but no uh holes or no openings to see uh through"
