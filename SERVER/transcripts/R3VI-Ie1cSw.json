  "title": "Is it fair you're born in Saudi & me in non muslim country, in non practicing family assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my my question is about entry checking uh it is about someone who is born in Indonesia which is not from active practicing Muslim probably in terms of community by that how are they differ than someone who is born in a very good family property in Medina or uh in terms of the rewards that is my question okay first of all a lot of the people think it is not fair for you Sheikh Russell to be born in Saudi next to McCain Medina you get to learn Islam you get to go to Makkah every month you go to Medina every few months you worship Allah while we were born in Morocco or in Indonesia or in the Philippines and we're not from a practicing family it's not fair who are you judging Allah Allah gave me this gift and Allah gave you that gift if you look in Indonesia you will find more practicing people than me more knowledgeable people than me and if you look in Saudi Arabia you will find people in Makkah who had never gone to Haram residents of Makkah living in Mecca five minutes away from Kaaba never went to Cabo why they don't like Kaaba they never prayed in Masjid al-hara so guidance is in Allah's hands he gives it to people in America and I've seen Scholars and students of knowledge in America masha'allah that are abiding by Islam like we are abiding in Islam in Medina very heartwarming but in Muslim countries we find women not wearing the hijab men going to concerts movies not praying on time doing drugs so this is not unfair this is your choice if you wanted something you work hard for it you in any country of the world like Spanish you will learn it from an app you will subscribe to an Internet site that will teach you you will pay money to learn until you master Spanish you look for it you love Allah you work hard to strive and learn your rebada and learn your religion properly and you will reach there so it's not the country it's in the guidance of your heart if Allah guides you you will reach there inshallah right okay"
