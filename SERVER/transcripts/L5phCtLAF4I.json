  "transcript": "I'm Sheikh in my country Mauritania is it became unfortunately a trend from this about maybe a year that many of the many the women and men that they go migrating to America due to Poverty or other reason maybe and now I think more than thousands migrated there so what would be your advice for all the Muslim living Muslim country who face poverty or so and think about marketing to a non-muslim country migration we've said that many many times from a Muslim country to a cafe country is not permissible regardless of how poor and needy you are you cannot migrate and leave your Muslim Heritage and Country to a cafe country you can go for five ten years 15 years to work and gain money and then go back go back to your country or to any Muslim country but to migrate and fully settle down there this is totally out of the question in Haram and I'm not hiding any uh thing when I say that monthly I have tens of counseling sessions with second and third generation who parents or grandparents migrated to the U.S Canada or Europe and the problems they're facing people are saying our children quote unquote are out of the closet they're drug addicts they're criminals they're socializing with the wrong company they have abandoned Salat my daughter doesn't wear the hijab doesn't have any interest in Islam and if we can't do anything they force our children to participate in physical education classes to go into the swimming pool with the opposite gender if my daughter is there she has to swim and wear swimsuits they learn music everything that Islam teaches they force them to do the opposite and then they come and cry to me and say what can we do Sheikh I don't know it's too late you chose the American dream or to live in such a luxurious standard Stander of living you chose that but this comes with the the the territory you have to pay the price it doesn't come cheap and unfortunately your children are the price and some and a lot of the times your spouse is the price when she's liberated and she says I want out I'm not going to stay in this marriage and if you don't have a prenup she's going to sue your backside for half of your property your income whatever for the rest of your life then what so you guys have to understand that going to the west or to the east to work and improve your financial services Helen going to migrate and dispose of your Islamic identity and take a passport and give the pledge of allegiance to a cafe country or a government this is totally unacceptable"
