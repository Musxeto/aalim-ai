  "transcript": "Abdullah says is it mandatory or considered good to visit the graves of relatives such as parents on regular basis there are people who tend to do so in their death anniversaries if a person chooses not to visit the graves of their parents is it considered bad or means uh they do not love their parents if a person loves their parents they will seek their forgiveness in prayers I have witnessed this in Bangladesh among uh my relatives what is the Islamic view on this visiting the graveyards is something recommended in Islam for male for men the prophet Alat wasam said that I requested Allah to visit my mother's grave and he allowed me and he said visit the graveyards because it remind you of the Hereafter so this is this is a form of worship you do it regularly you do it once a year no problem in that appointing it or doing it on the anniversary of the death of the disease this is an innovation specifying only to go inid and visit the graveyards to congratulate them of the Eid this is an innovation doing it every Friday after Salah this is an innovation doing it openly in any time without specifically appointing a Time this is permissible inshallah and there's no problem in that"
