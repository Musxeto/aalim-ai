  "transcript": "hello ah hadith number 172 deals with the conditions of salat as we're still studying this chapter and it's narrated by muawiyah ibn hakkam and i believe that brother mustafa will read it for us narrated by abner may allah be pleased with him allah's messenger said talking is not benefiting during the prayer for it consists only of glorifying allah declaring his greatness and recitation of the quran now this hadith definitely tells us one of the things that a person should preserve during his prayer and that is he should not talk through throughout the prayer and talking is not acceptable we will learn later on inshaallah that this was the case at the very beginning of islam that muslims while pray in prayer they could talk together so while they are in the congregation praying he could look to his left and say hey muhammad what are you going to do this night and the guy says well i think i'm going to go you know do some bowling or whatever you have anything in mind said well let's finish praying and talk afterwards this was acceptable at the beginning in islam they used to talk and you know but until allah told them not to do this and we will come to this inshaallah later on in this hadith spoke he talked and he didn't know that it was not permissible the prophet salam told him that this is not benefiting it's not good it's not suitable for uh prayer and it should consist the prayer should consist only of glorifying allah declaring his greatness and the recitation of the quran this is the only thing that is acceptable in prayer there is another hadith and it might be related to this one where and and it could be this one where someone sneezed while in the congregation prayer and of course you know that when someone sneezes he should say alhamdulillah and those who heard him should say so this man whether it's malia or someone else heard this companion sneeze so he said allah during the prayer so the companions themselves you know started to move in their places as if they've looked at him and he noticed that they are looking at him so he's talked again why are you looking at me he shouted why are you looking at me that was during the congregation prayer so they started clapping their their thighs making a sound of asking him to shut up so he did not talk after the prayer he was called by the prophet and he did not he says the companion he said that he did not shout at me he did not reprimand me he just said my the osana son of my brother o nephew of mine the salah is not uh acceptable for such things it's only acceptable for this and this and this and this so the prophet sallam taught him what to do and this is the way of the prophet allah teaching others no shouting no slaundering no labeling no accusations he had all the love in him to teach people we were told once that a a a a bad one came from the desert into the mosque and looked at the side one side of the mosque and started to urinate in the mosque in the masjid the companions all stood up to beat this man and stopped him the prophet told them all leave him leave him until he finishes because if you startled him he's going to spread his urine all over the mosque running away from you and the the danger and the filth would be spread so leave him it's contained in one area and after he finished the prophet called him and told him oh nephew of mine this is unacceptable in islam these mosques are made for the recitation of the quran for glorifying allah and so on what did the man do the man raised his hand and said o allah forgive muhammad the prophet sins and me o allah have mercy on muhammad and me and don't include anyone else with us because the companions shouted at him and wanted to you know uh beat him when he was urinating and then when the prophet saws clarified things to him he he supplicated he said oh allah have mercy on muhammad and myself and don't join any of these guys with us so the prophet told him that this is allah's mercy why limit it on only us this is something that should be to all mankind so it teaches us that the prophet sallam was had his way with those who were ignorant and he was nice and kind to them and this is the way we we should treat ignorant people there are so many times that people complain of good and committed muslims calling for allah or calling people to allah in a wrong way they go and accuse people of being not good muslims they shout at them they talk to them as if they are teaching kids and this nobody accepts this way you have to be modest you have to be sincere you have to show people that you want all the good possible to them only then they will accept your call and this is the way the prophet saws used to call the muslims and his followers again this is not this is the general trend of course for example when a man came to the prophet complaining he said oh prophet of allah i have committed intercourse i did i had intercourse with my wife during the day of ramadan and i was fasting now the prophet if anyone came to us with such a complaint we would immediately say are you crazy are you insane aren't you a good muslim don't you fear allah don't you know it's a sin you have sinned you have did this you have did that and the guy would think that he's in hell did this that the prophet did this it was very simple and easy the prophet told him free a slave the man said i don't have any slaves so the prophet said okay then feed fast two months fast two consecutive months so the man said prophet of allah i did this in one day you want me to fast whole 60 days i can't i'm i'm unable to do this so the prophet says islam then feed 60 poor people as a punishment you have to pay and and feed 60 poor persons so the man said i don't have any money so the prophet told him to sit down he sat down after a while some people came with their charity their sadhaka and gave it to the prophet so the prophet said where is this man asking a while ago so he stood up and said here i am so the prophet told him take this and feed 60 persons poor people so i said prophet i'm the poorest person in medina i am the poorest person in medina so the prophet laughed and said take it and feed it to your family so it tells us that how kind and merciful the prophet sallam was with those who were ignorant and those who did not know but with those who were arrogant the prophet saw asylum was very tough with them with those who didn't know yet chose to choose the other direction the prophet was tough with them as in the example with a buddha when he had this dispute with bilal even may allah be pleased with them and they had this argument that happens with among or between everyone and abu dharr went out of his way he crossed the red line and he said to bilal shut up you the son of a black woman and this is an insult if it's intended to be an insult but if it's not intended to be insult a black person's mother is black and uh a yellows person's mother well yellow meaning that a descendant of the of of of east asia not yellow meaning coward but a a a person from africa's mother is african a person from asia she's asian a person from europe his mother is a caucasian or whatever so it depends if you're saying it with the intention of an insult or with a pure and clear conscious abu dharr when he said bilal you are the mother the son of a black woman he meant it as an insult so bilal did not say anything he went to the prophet and told him that abu dharr said so-and-so the prophet was so angry with abuzar and he told him that you are a person that still have this jahilia in you your islam is not complete you you've behaved out of arrogance so abu dharr went to bilal and asked for his forgiveness some narrations say that he put his face on the ground and ask bilal saying o son of a black woman put your foot on my cheek just to show you that i am not arrogant anymore and bilal said may allah forgive you brother stand up and they they made up another example of the prophet sallam being tough without with those who are were arrogant and knowledgeable when he saw a person eating using his left hand the prophet sallam uh told him eat with your right hand and this is what we should do whenever you see someone eating or drinking with his left hand you should tell him brother use your right hand because forbidden to do it with the left hand but the man that the prophet was talking to ali was arrogant so he says he said i cannot though he can but out of arrogance he said i cannot so the prophet said allah may you cannot well this is not good english this is awful english the prophet prayed and said i pray to allah that you may not be able to lift your left hand your right hand to your mouth and his right hand was paralyzed instantly and this was reported in muslim he could not lift it up to his mouth because he lied when saying i cannot use my right hand so the prophet said then it should be as you claimed it to be and it was paralyzed so this tells us that it depends on the situation when to be lean and soft and and and good when they're at when they are not knowledgeable or they need knowledge and when they uh are arrogant with knowledge but they would not comply to what you are saying i believe that we should take a short break so stay tuned so this is something that you have to point out to the to them in the bible something which is i think very rarely needed by the youth which is staying firm on the truth this is just one of the greatest examples for me of how to control your anger within the framework of being the cleanest religion the cleanest jurisprudence and in the meantime the kindest religion to animals watch let's talk with khalil ahmanet as he interviews guests and discusses a variety of topics everything from youth issues to religious issues join us here on hoda tv the following hadith hadith number 173 i think abu madik will read this hadith for us we used to talk while engaged in salat meaning prayer during the lifetime of allah and one would talk with his companion regarding his needs in sarat meaning prayer till this verse was revealed guard strictly the prayers especially the middle prayer and stand before allah with obedience then we then we were commanded to observe silence meaning in prayer and were forbidden to talk of course this hadith falls in line in what we as muslims all do that is no muslims talk or speak during prayer and this is common knowledge and common sense because you are praying you should observe your prayer and safeguard it without talking to guard it strictly and not to talk in it now we mentioned this earlier that at the very beginning companions used to talk during prayer it was okay for them to do so until this verse was revealed and what is the middle prayer s then you have to guard strictly your prayers especially after prayer and why ask a prayer because lots of people sleep over us or prayer after they come back from work or uh forget it mustafa so if now someone talks in prayer then his prayer is not accepted if a person talks intentionally during prayer yes it's not accepted okay what about unless the imam makes a mistake during the recitation of the quran and he corrects it yes what about if sometimes children when they come to pray in the masjid they laugh so does this not the fight there okay we will come to that inshallah abu malik oh if like somebody's praying and you know like they see their child going to play with electricity or with fire if they like shout out to them stop or sit down or come back will that break their prayer if they talk intentionally this nullifies their prayer they pray again if they move from their position and climb the stairs and take the child before falling from the stairs this nullifies a prayer they pray again but they have to do this it is a must that they do this the short movement or small amount that that is not considered to be lots of movement this does not nullify the prayer yes one of the sahaba i believe and uh i recalled that in uh i don't remember the exact verse but uh he met an enemy and he fought him while he was praying you know yeah positioning by the head and he followed him he was in the prayer salah what does that have friends the prayer that one performs while in in the state of war when you have a war in the state of war you're praying and your enemies in front of you or behind you or around you you pray you are allowed to praise allah salat is a different story all together because in salat you may face the direction other than the qibla you may pray the four rakah into one single rakah it's shortened into one as in some uh versions of the hadith the the the the way it's done the movement carrying the weaponry observing your enemies maybe not prostrating all the way just to keep eye contact and so on it's completely different so it does not apply here we're talking about the normal uh standard obligatory prayer okay i'm sorry for interesting but isn't there a hadith where it says that we're there's certain insects or animals we're supposed to kill our praying isn't that concerned movement yes it's as i mentioned earlier you're allowed to move but within you know unacceptable boundaries now if i see a scorpion in front of me i'd kill it but if the scorpion moves from my room to the other living room and i ran after it you know holding my slippers and trying to catch it and here and then it goes up the stairs and i follow it this is not prayer this is too much this is taking the movement is a lot so you're allowed to kill certain types of insects or things that harm you providing that it is not a lot of movement in islam it's okay for example if i'm praying and i'm carrying my child whenever i bow or prostrate i put it aside whenever i stand up i pick it up and put it again this is movement but it's acceptable if there's an opening in the row in front of me it's okay if i walk two three four steps until i fill this gap in the row in front of me this is acceptable but lots of movement makes the prayer invalid such as you're in prayer your mobile rings you pick it up you look at the name it's a missed call you try to see who's who was calling and then oh it's my grandma you send her a text message saying that okay i'll be home for dinner at nine o'clock and then you put it back again in your pocket this is this invalidates your prayer so the movement has to be you know measured in the sense that would this accept it be ex regarded as a lot or would this be regarded as permissible and okay uh what brought us this subject i forgot about science in the prayer about silence in the prayer silence and the prayer so one should observe the silence in his prayer and not uh talk in his prayer mustafa i think was question was about laughing children laughing now scholars classified the sounds that come out of a person so some of them say if a person says two letters or more then this is considered to be talking and this nullifies your prayer and there is nothing so if i say this this is a sequence of like what five five letters they say well this is talking your prayer is invalid there's no evidence on this i didn't talk i coughed and sneezed and did god no i cleared my throat this is not talking so this is not authentic you have to have an authentic thing as far as laughing laughing is even worse than talking because the essence of prayer is submissiveness contemplation and if you laugh in prayer then this contradicts with the essence of prayer then your prayer is invalid what about a smile if a person just smiles this is not recommended but it doesn't nullify your prayer a smile does not nullify your prayer we come to the before we come fadi has a question what about if someone is really submissive during tarawih and he says as a replication to a uh supplication oh god or say it in arabic like yeah no this is not not not uh uh recommended see what's recommended during salat is what the prophet saws used to do the prophet sallam used to whenever he read or recite recited whenever he recited a verse that had the mentioning of jannah or reward you would say oh allah grant me he would ask allah from his father and generosity and whenever he recited a surah or a verse that had punishment and hell and torture he would say oh allah i seek refuge in you so this is acceptable but to talk during the prayer by saying ya allah and raising your voice as a lot of people say this this is not acceptable unless it's done without your intention and so many times people talk and do something without intending it so i i i've seen this in front of me my wife was once praying and while she was praying one of the kids was on a chair and almost fell and she noticed that and she said you allah allah the kid's the kid while she was praying and i jumped in and and saved the kid from falling down and she continued praying and that's what she said she said what do you think should i pray again the answer would be no because this was done unintentionally if you do it intentionally it's forbidden and just to to to recap i think mustafa has a question but before we go to mustafa's question in taraweeh night prayer in ramadan you see a lot of weird things you see a lot of weird things people talk during the dua especially in the dua of kunut the last raqqa where the imam makes a dua you hear people saying things ya rabbi don't do this i don't do that yeah and maybe sometimes you this is funny but it's actual you hear people crying you had ladies men saying oh sudes the imam of the haram may allah preserve your mouth islam in the in the salah what what are you doing and and they when you ask them they don't remember okay this happened unintentionally this took place because they did not intend to does this nullify their salah do not punish us if we forget or we make a mistake and this is out of this is not within their hands but if it were to be within their hands if they did that intentionally their prayer would be nullified mustafa if someone if you're praying and someone tells you assalamu alaikum should you answer back no you should not answer back but there are hadiths that you may answer by waving raising your hand so if you are in prayer and somebody says you may raise your hand this is okay it was reported by the prophet alaihis osama that he did this so i i believe this is okay and of course this is depending that you are praying on your own because if you're in the congregation it wouldn't be acceptable that someone comes into the mosque and says and this happens a lot of people are entering the mosque the people are praying he says are you doing this for so this is not recommended yes mustafa so i have a question about laughing assuming that you're in a modest for example and there's a small child and then he does something funny that's so funny that you just can't control yourself and you laugh you don't just smile you actually laugh does this notify you yes pray yes but you didn't unintention this is yes but this took you off the prayer see if you do something unintentionally because for example you had to you're afraid of something but when you are in the case of laughing this conflicts completely with the submissiveness it's different when someone is about to fall and you say watch out and you were you did not intend that it's different than when you laugh because when you laugh this means that you have no fear of allah because it's funny yeah it's funny but if you just try to try to recollect and think of allah azza greatness you cannot even smile because you are standing before the creator of the earth's and heavens the creator of helen and paradise so no matter what happens in front of you it you have a serious face with the city that reflects a serious heart but if you laugh and i've seen people laughing from the recitation of the quran you know people go and and laugh and they make they laugh because of this i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshaallah until we meet next time"
