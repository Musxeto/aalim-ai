  "title": "Wife accepts to live with in laws as condition before marriage, can she later change her mind? Assim",
  "transcript": "right now you answer some one question that grand family is not allowing islam what about the wife agree is the husband having seen there okay if you make this as a condition or a request and the wife willingly agrees alhamdulillah this is a win-win situation yet she still has the right later on to change her mind it is like a wife coming to the marriage and saying listen i am a rich woman lucky you and i don't need you to provide me with a house i have a big villa you come and move in whoa that's freebies who hates freebies so you move in after five ten years not paying the rent not doing anything she says i change my mind i'm going to sell my villa now you provide me with a flat or a house does she have the right to do this definitely because when she gave up her right this is not for eternity she has the right to ask for it later on she waivered it but she can ask for it so if you find a woman who's decent and willing in many cases there are people who have only their mother and no one to take care of her it wouldn't be feasible to rent another apartment if the guys financing financials are not that good so in this case he has to look for a woman up front says listen i have nowhere to take my mom she has to live with us you're okay with that because if you're not i'm gonna go and look for someone else who is if the woman willingly agrees to that alhamdulillah it's totally legit for us you"
