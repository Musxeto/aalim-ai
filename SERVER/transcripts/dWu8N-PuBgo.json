  "title": "Making dua for others & telling them VS Giving charity on behalf of a sick & telling Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says sometimes we may give sadaqa charity on behalf of a loved one who is ill or who's suffering hoping that allah azzawajal would accept this charity and relieve his illness or ward off any problems or calamities this individual is going through so is it like dua that i should keep for myself so that the angel would say and you have a similar amount so that when i make dua for my brother o allah azza i pray to you that you pay off his debts there is an angel appointed by allah to say to my dua and to you similar to what you have made dua for your brother so the norm is i make dua for you i don't come and tell you that i'm doing dua for you every night no problem because then the angel would stop saying i mean and making dua for me i should conceal this now is it the same when i know that my brother is sick and i slaughter a sheep for him do some sadaka some kind of charity and i tell my brother listen uh yesterday i slaughtered the sheep for you insha allah allah will accept and that will ease your pain hopefully should i or shouldn't i there's no preference because we don't have a hadith telling us that an angel would say i mean rather this is something that might be beneficial more to tell so that that individual would feel relieved so if i'm sick and i'm suffering and someone comes to me and says inshallah the cure is coming soon because yesterday i did this and this for the sake of allah so that allah would grant you shifa and would grant you healing and cure from your illness how would he feel he would feel relieved he would see some hope because of what you had done and there is nothing wrong in that inshallah you"
