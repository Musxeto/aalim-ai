  "transcript": "asking about to what look and tell what rook is to sit in prayers on your left buttocks on your work while if the ash is to sit on your left foot in normally sitting positions the warlock is one of the sooners of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and in the Schaffer Emeth hub they sit to work in any final tisha hood so whether it is Torah has a fetcher or of Sunnah or three records of Maghreb or for a cos of Aisha the last before you give Salam use it into water position but the most authentic opinion is that the word rook can be performed when the prayer itself has to tisha hood so if I were to come from behind a worshipper and I see him sitting in the FT rush position I know that this is not if it's an Asia prayer for example then I know that this is the first Asha hood and the Imam will stand up to pray the third and the fourth but if I see him in the terror rock position I know that this is the final raka so this is not an indication but this is what the hadith narrated that the telluric would be usually performed only when the prayer has to tashahud first a shot and the last shot therefore you should not offer it when you're praying one raka of whitter nor when you pray Mirek are connected of whitter without sitting in the second which is according to the Sunnah and you should not perform Tawaf Rock when you praying the Taraka of Sunnah or the Taraka of fetcher and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
