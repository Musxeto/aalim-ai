  "title": "Someone who dies defending his wealth or honor considered a Martyr? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ednan says i have read and heard of a hadith to which the prophet alayhi salatu salam states he who dies defending his wealth his family his property his religion and he who died of stomach diseases all died as martyrs could we apply this hadith to someone who was defending his possessions while being mugged and we and he was killed would he be considered a martyr in our faith the answer is yes if someone mugs you and wants to take your wallet and you defend yourself and try to fight him off and he kills you in the process you are a martyr and if you kill him in the process he's in hellfire and you're exempted from any punishment nevertheless you have to weigh the pros and cons if I have hundred dollars in my wallet which is nothing to me and he wants to take it or kill me I'd rather give it to him yes I have all the right to defend my hundred dollars my dollar even but is it a mandatory and I must no it is not so you have to weigh the pros and cons and sometimes putting yourself in such a situation no rather buy yourself out with this instead of either killing him and being interrogated accused of killing and maybe you don't have witnesses to prove that you were defending yourself and then end up being accused of killing him unlawfully"
