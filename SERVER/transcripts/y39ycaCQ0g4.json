  "title": "Fasting on Friday alone and choosing exclusively the night of Friday for praying!",
  "transcript": "thing about the hadith we spoke a couple of days ago that the prophet Isaiah forbade us from specifying so someone does not fast the whole week only to come on Friday and says oh friday is a beautiful day I'm going to fast today because it's a day of great value to a larger this is haram this is not permissible to specify Friday just because it's a Friday of a week and also not to pray the whole night and decide of the week and decide only to come thursday at night which is the night of friday and fast this is not / let me rephrase that fasting has its influence on me not to pray to decide only to prey on the night of friday this is prohibited by the professor salam because doing that means that you're giving something of a body or form of worship that the Prophet did not do it is awesome so this is not permissible if you pray alternate day thursdays fridays maybe monday no problem but to specify only friday this is not permissible"
