  "transcript": "peace of Allah and blessings of Allah beond Allah peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a prophet Beyond peace alhamd dear brothers sisters in Islam we're still discussing the beautiful mercy of Allah Asel and how he opened the door for us sinners to come through and repent to him the almighty Allah Asel says in a very beautiful verse it is Allah who accepts repentance from his servants and pardons the sins yet he knows what you do so he opens the door for us to enter from but how do we achieve repentance Scholars say that there are conditions for your repentance to be accepted by Allah therefore it's not merely seeking forgiveness with your tongue by just saying I seek Allah's forgiveness it has to be accompanied by other things on the top of the list you have sincerity because repentance is a form of worship to Allah asael Allah never accepts any form of worship without having sincerity at the top of the list so for example if a person is doing a sin or actually going to commit a sin he's going to break into to a house and he's got all the keys and chains with him and he's determined to do so as he goes in to break into the house he finds a patrol car or a policeman walking by then he stops and says this is not the right time to do it maybe I'll come tomorrow and he goes back is this repentance the answer is no because he stopped doing what he intended to do or he quitted a sin not because of Allah's fear or for the sake of Allah but rather for a different reason and Allah does not accept except what is for his sake sincerely another example a person a chain smoker diagnosed with illnesses related to smoking and the doctor says if you don't quit smoking you'll die in three months so he quits smoking and when someone asks him why did you quit smoking he doesn't say because it's Haram I fear Allah he says because the doctor said I have to quit otherwise I'm going to die so this repentance is not accepted Allah does not accept such a repentance the second condition remorse when you repent you have to have the remorse in your heart the prophet said an authentic Hadith remorse is repentance so he limited the actual meaning of repentance in one of its greatest actions and conditions and that is remorse it is similar to The Prophet saying is though we know that there are a number of different pillars other Thana but because it is the most important pillar of all the prominent pillar of all as if it is as the prophet saidat now how do we know that a person is remorseful he knows that of himself he has this anguish this pain this burning pain in his heart whenever he remers that sin and this is a gift from Allah not every person can reach that so many people indulge in sins they do sins without any attention to them and not feeling remorseful those are in great danger however those who fall into sin and feel the remorse burning their heart regardless of how major and heinous that sin was as long as they have the remorse you did something wrong and you feel that you did something wrong and you're your heart is aching because of that fearing allaha fearing the punishment then Allah would repent for youlim may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet Alat wasam and he said in public oh prophet of Allah Purify Me and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said to him go back seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him the following day he comes and says oh prophet of Allah Purify Me and the prophet Alam tells him again go back seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him until the fourth time when he came and said oh prophet of Allah Purify Me The Prophet only then asked him pu purify you of what Subhan Allah three times the prophet does not even inquire does not even ask him and why is that because the prophet Alat wasam wants the door of repentance to be open and Allah's mercy upon his slave by concealing his sin to be prominent imagine if the prophet from day one told him what did you do go and kill kill him that would not have been merciful so the man said oh prophet of Allah I committed adultery so the prophet saidat um he asked those around him who know him is he crazy is he insane he said no we know of him to be sound in mind so he asked them go and smell his mouth maybe he is drunk he had something to drink and he's intoxicated and saying something that he's not uh intending and they said oh prophet of Allah there's nothing wrong with him so then the prophet Alat wasam asked him a clear question did you commit adultery and the man said yes Purify Me So the prophet Alat wasam ordered the companions to take him away and to Stone him and he was stoned to death few days later the prophet Alat wasam said to his companions seek forgiveness from Allah to your brother Malik for all for by Allah he had repented he had repented a repentance had it been divided by the whole umah it would have sufficed them Subhan Allah this is remorse he could not tolerate the agony and pain of sin in his heart unlike us when we sin and enjoy the sin as well few days later a woman came to the prophet Alat wasam and she said the same statement oh prophet of Allah Purify Me Prophet said seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to him so she cut a long story short and she said are you trying to turn me away like you turned Malik this would not work our prophet of Allah for I am pregnant and the prophet said who is pregnant she said I am and she's pregnant out of woodlock out of Zena out of adulter Tre so the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said that go and come back when you deliver your child so she went and 9 months or eight months later she came back with a child in her hand still persistent oh Prophet prophet of Allah Purify Me and the prophet Alat wasam said I can't do that while you're still suckling your child go and once he's over suckling then come back and she left for another year or two depending on how long she took to breastfeed her child and she came later on after all these months and years with her child holding a piece of bread in his hand hand as an indication that now he eats and she is still insisting oh prophet of Allah Purify Me Subhan Allah enough time about two and a half years at least she could have gone to the end of the world and no one would have looked for her the prophet would not have had sent a posi to get her back he's trying to conceal her sin but the remorse in her heart is something Beyond bearing she could not tolerate this so the prophet Alam ordered her and she was stoned to death and then he saidat by Allah she had repented a repentance that if attacks collector would have repented Allah would have forgiven him and this is showing you that tax collection is one of the major sins in Islam similar to fornication or adultery or even more and this shows you that repentance is something that eats the heart when it is filled with remorse now this is out of context but maybe someone who is watching who's not a Muslim may think that why is it that stoning is in Islam but I believe that we uh uh have a short break to fix a technical um error not not that I have been suntanning but apparently we

Ramadan for Better Health stay healthy and stay tuned radad Salam alaykum and welcome back I think this uh suntan is still appearing on me it is Ramadan I don't go and San in Ramadan but again we have a problem with the light so maybe it's better not to see my face and just to listen to what I have to say a lot of the non-muslims criticize Islam for its prescribed punishment they say it's a brutal religion it's this it's that first of all we we could care less because this is the religion from Allah and the evidence is backing this up are Beyond count so alhamdulillah we are confident of our religion we don't have to explain explain it to others if they are willing to objectively look into it they will find an answer second of all stoning in Islam is only for one sin and one sin alone and this sin is If a married person or previously married or widowed or divorced commits adultery in this case he has to be stoned only if four male Witnesses say confirm and testify that they've seen the actual intercourse taking place and the actual organs in each other or the man confesses or the woman confesses other than that it cannot be implemented however if you go to the Bible for example you find that stoning is a prescribed punishment but not for one sin it is pres prescribed punishment for blasphemy as in Leviticus 24:16 for fornication Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 22 23 to 24 to associating others with Allah you Stone them to death even bad Sons if you have a bad son and this is in Deuteronomy 218- 21 if you have bad Sons you Stone them to death if you have any fortune tellers Leviticus 2027 you Stone Those who work on the Sabbath in numbers 15 32-36 and those who curse the king you even Stone them in 1 Kings 21 uh uh 10 so cursing the king also requires to be stoned and last but not least the Bible calls for stoning of animals so if an ox Gores a man or a woman he is to be stoned to death this is in the Bible Islam has it only in one sin and this sin is to protect humanity and to protect the society from such infidelity in such filth if you don't protect the society with such prescribed punishment that are to be implemented only by the Muslim ruler after being tried and convicted if you don't do this this you end up having homosexuality you end up having incest you end up having chaos and corruption in societies now few weeks ago they have approved of uh uh uh gay marriages in a number of non-muslim countries and definitely allaha would not leave them alone Allah awaits for the right moment when he the almighty takes them but when he takes the almighty takes severely and with anger the third condition for repentance that you resolve never to go back to that sin in the future so if I have a habit of going every June and July abroad to party to drink to have fun and come back to the land of Islam make a and then this erases my sins as I think and hope and I say that I have repented though I've called my travel agent and told him listen the hotel you booked Us in was lousy next year put us in somewhere more decent like four star or five star hotel so I'm intending to do it next year this means that my repentance is is not accepted even if I have remorse because I'm planning to do it again the fourth condition that it should be or I should quit it on the spot how is that if someone is drinking alcohol is drinking wine and then he says wine is Haram it's a major sin I should quit I have to repent to Allah but um okay let me finish the bottle then I'll repent his repentance is not accepted because among the conditions is that you quit immediately if you still have the pack of cigarettes in your pocket and say yeah I've got like eight or or nine rolls I have to finish and then I'll repent Allah would not accept your repentance because you're not sincere those who are sincere repent on the spot this was exactly done by the companions in Medina when the prohibition of wine or intoxication came on three degrees one when Allah said that there is a lot of harm in it in some good however the harm far exceeds the good but he did not tell them it's Haram he just gave them a a thing to contemplate on and before that Allah Asel told them do not approach prayer while you are in the state of intoxication so if I am intoxicated I can't pray this means that I have only a limited time to be intoxicated or to be wasted in and this is between and so this limits the time of free drinking and then the last Ayah came that you have to refrain and abandon it totally and this is when the companions who used to drink once they heard the Ayah immediately they tossed whatever they had and the streets of Medina were running with wine because they spilled it all on the roads immediate repentance they quitted on the spot not delayed it or hoped to do it after a while on the spot fifthly the condition is that you repent when the time is allowed because there are two times when repentance would not be accepted a personal time and a general time for the personal time this is individual and this is as the Prophet said Alam Allah accepts the repentance of his slave so long as the death rattle has not yet reached his throat so the last moment when his soul is about to exit his body this is the death rattle that reaches the throat and he's unable to speak or talk or breathe and then he said I want to repent this is beyond on the time of acceptance of repentance this is what Pharaoh did when he was in pursuit of mssa and the Jews with him and then Allah drowned him in the sea he said I've believed in the Lord that Moses and his people believe in Allah tells them that this is too late because now you are almost dead so Allah does not accept his repentance and this is why we have to repent as soon as possible because we never know when Allah Asel would take our souls even when we go to bed no one can say that yes tomorrow I'm going to wake up because the possibility of Allah not letting you wake up he's there however we are in our negligence unfortunately the second time when Allah does not accept repentance and this is for all is when the Sun rises es from the West every single day like clockwork the sun rises from the east on that particular day when doomsday is due and the world is over and finished the Allah Asel would order the sun to rise from the West the prophet tells usam that every single day the son asks permission from Allah to rise and Allah gives her that permission until that day Allah tells her to or tells it to rise from the west then the people want to repent but Allah does not accept their repentance some Scholars add a sixth condition and this condition is related to the rights of others so these conditions are between you and Allah however if there is something else that is between you and another human being then you have to either return that right or seek his forgiveness the prophet Alat wasam told us that whoever did wrong to his brother he should ask him for forgiveness before the day of judgment because then there is no Dirham or din there is no money you can buy yourself out it is only good deeds and bad Deeds so whoever has an issue with his brother he should seek his forgiveness for example I took my brother's money unlawfully and now I want to repent so I feel the remorse I quit taking his money I insist uh not to do it again and I do this for the sake of Allah but I fail to give him back his money he will take it from my uh uh Good Deeds on the day of judgment I back bit someone he's tall he's fat he's short he's lazy he's this he's that and then I repented I have to seek his forgiveness and so on however Scholars say that if by going to him and telling him this more harm would be caused then this is something that I have to uh balance if I go to him and I say a I took this amount of money from you and I'm giving it back if I went to the shop and I uh shoplift this and that from you here's the money or here's the items back again and I know that they'll throw me in jail or they will make a story out of me in this case the harm is more than the benefit try to get the money back without them knowing it either by secretly depositing it or sending it in mail or give it to someone Anonymous and tell them that uh someone gave it to you Etc you have to improvise and likewise in backbiting if you go to someone and say listen make me uh uh ask Allah for forgiveness for me and and and forgive me you as well and pardon me because I did something bad to you he says what is it said no no I I can't tell you but you said no I'll never forgive you until you tell me and if you tell him he's probably going to bycott you for the rest of your life or he is going to tarnish your reputation or he's going to attack you or in this case the harm is more than the good so either get a general uh uh amnesty from him so that he would say may Allah forgive you don't say I did something bad she just ask Allah for forgiveness may Allah forgive you and you also forgive me say I forgive you this is what I always do with anyone who says to me she I did wrong can you can you forgive me I said may Allah forgive you I wouldn't say huh what did you do no you have to tell me when and why and who was present and why did you say this I'm not going to going to forgive you until you give me €10,000 or I'm going to take your good deeds some Scholars say if he says this you have to pay him seriously you have to pay him because this is his right so don't put yourself in such a situation and try to coulage it in a sensible way and refrain from doing something that you will regret tomorrow or you would have to apologize for the following day it is not worth it nothing is worth it in this life what people say about you is worthless what people think of you is worthless it is what Allah has in record for you that counts so be sincere quit your sins insist not to do them again repent when it is time have this remorse burning your heart for the sake of Allah and if you have wronged others try to get even with them try to ask their forgiveness and pardon and by this your repentance would be accepted with the grace of Allah we have a short break inshallah and after that the lines will be open for your questions and calls so stay tuned"
