  "transcript": "Farah has asking a very important question which I believe that we've answered so many times Islamic banking is not a label you stick on the sign outside of a glamorous building Islamic banking has to walk the talk so nowadays if we go to the Gulf area we will find a lot of so-called Islamic banking and if you go inside and you deal with them you find that there's nothing Islamic and what they do so credit cards have a grace period of 40 days after that they will charge you Reba you go to Islamic bank so we have this beautiful Islamic credit card masha'Allah Tabarrok Allah how does it work in the same fashion forty days if you don't pay we will buy merchandise on your behalf and then we will sell it to someone else with a lesser price collect our money and then charge it to you in installments so it's the same concept how do you buy things this is see when you when we issue you you the credit card you have to sign on two contracts one of them stating that if I ever defaulted in my payments beyond the grace period that I authorized the bank to buy goods in the same amount and then another contract i authorized the bank to sell the goods somewhere else the same amount or a different amount and they charge it to me installments I didn't see any goods and I did not buy any goods and I did not sell any goods all of this is bogus but they then the vast majority of Islamic banks deal with this and there are so many many different ways of doing it and this is totally prohibited what they're doing is Una's Lomb ik and you can cascade this to so many transactions of theirs so I am hesitant to say that these Islamic banks are actually Islamic until I look into their Chery abort and see whether the scholars on the Sharia board are true scholars or they're just Tom Dick and Harry doesn't for a dime secondly I have to see if these real scholars implement what they issue of Islamic fat was on the transactions of the back or it's just on paper and there's no committee doing it afterwards I can tell you that okay this is a legit or this is bogus you have to do not believe in it"
