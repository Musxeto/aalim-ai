wabarakatuh hadith number 101 of our book under telecom was narrated by mother Aisha may allah be pleased with her who would give us the honor to read it for us yes brother I did I saw the prophets Allah is seldom send an army unit under the command of a man who used to lead his companions in the prayers and would finish his recitation with surah 112 say o Muhammad SAW Allah you seldom he is Allah the one when they returned from the battle they mentioned that to the Prophet SAW Allah Allah seldom he said to them ask him why does so they asked him and he said I do so because it is a description of the beneficent and I love to recite it in my prayer the Prophet SAW Allah Allah sallam said to them tell him that Allah loves him Bukhari now this hadith is regarding an incident that took place at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when one of his companions used to conclude his recitation of the Quran in prayer by reciting Hulu Allahu Ahad Allah who summoned and there are a different and a number of narrations of this hadith among them was that his companions complained and they said to him either you think that your recitation is not sufficient and that is why your reciting Allah Allahu Ahad with it or you recite Kalevala hat alone why combine two sewers especially always follow Allah had he said well this is the way I pray whether you like it or not suit yourself you want another imam get another demand but I will always recite Allah Allah had when they asked the man why do you do this he justified that by saying it's a surah that includes the description of Allah man and I love it because of that so the Prophet ordered them to tell him that Allah loves him because of his love to this surah the issue here that we can learn is one if you love Allah's beautiful names and attributes Allah who love you and we've stated this so many times it is unfortunate that you have people talking about things of lesser importance while they are ignorant about the names and attributes of Allah people talking whether it is permissible to put your hand on your chest or under your navel and if you ask him what is the meaning of I'll look it one of Allah's names I'm not is it first time I hear this name they don't know the names of Allah as erosion and they cannot explain the meaning of a lot 'if for example alcohol or al-jabbar and so on you go on and on so this is an indication of our ignorance because we do not know whom we are praying for whom are we praying to Allah so Jill what is his description I have no idea so this man's love to the description of Allah in this beautiful surah resulted in a larger loving him and by far if Allah loves you then you have got it mate because if Allah loves you you care less about anything else if Allah loves you everything else would love you the prophecy that is a lot Salaam that Allah when he loves one of his servants he tells G breed I love this person so love him and gibreel tells the people of the heavens Allah loves this person so love him and they all love him and Allah descends acceptance for that individual earth or on earth meaning that everyone on earth would accept him and love him so the love of Allah is extremely great secondly the man was the leader of an expedition of an army unit and he was the leader of the prayer as well which we learned from that is whoever assumes the position of leadership he should also lead the prayer even if there where people better than him in recitation in his unit that is why the prophet said sallallahu alayhi wasallam that it is not permissible to lead prayer in a man's home or in his authority so if you go to a company for example or a government institution which has a manager it is not permissible for me to lead prayer just because I'm the Sheikh unless he authorizes it so he is the leader he's the manager of that institution he's the one who's supposed to lead if he doesn't want to lead he may authorize anyone he likes and you have to obey that in his house if I go into his house and the man is shaved and he smokes and he does so many wrong things but he's a Muslim a present time and it's time for Maghrib I do not come forward and say after my salat no this is not my right to lead the prayer of a man in his house unless he accepts that and authorizes that among the things that we can learn from this hadith that when you report something to the leader or to the man in authority this is not considered to be backbiting we have an institution we have a school we have a company and one of the employees does something that goes against the law if I report this to the manager would I be backbiting no this is for the welfare of the company this is for the welfare of the school my intention is not to corrupt my intention is to bring things into order and that is why they went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and sought his religious opinion to what the man is doing among the things that we learn from this is that it is permissible to recite surah - a class Allahu Ahad or any other surah after the main surah we recite to a fiery site for example Surat al column and then afterwards I recite cool Allahu Ahad is this permissible it is permissible yet is it recommended or not scholars different some of them said that by the prophet alayhi salatu salam approving it this means that it is permissible and it is part of the Sunnah others say no no no hold on and hold your horses don't jump into conclusions though the Prophet alehsalaam approved of it he never done it in his life is that true prophets have never recited surat al-ikhlas after any surah he recited it was never reported to us and that is why they said though it is permissible yet it is not recommended why they said because we have two actions the action of the Prophet Isis Salam and the action of his companion what would you always choose the best which is the action of the Prophet I racism however if you do the latter is permissible can you give another example so yes a lot of examples but the time does not permit or actually I know only a couple examples but yeah the Prophet is awesome when he visited Abdullah phenomenal ass and he was newly weds and after he got married I'm Ruben alas may Allah be pleased with him and with his son to see his son so he went to see his daughter-in-law and he asked her how was my son with you the previous days she said masha'Allah he is the best of men praying all night and fasting every single day masha'Allah so I'm gonna ask one of one of these smartest Arabs one of the smartest companions of the Prophet sir understood what she meant she meant that he did not even touch me because he's all the time either praying or fasting where would it be possible so he went to the prophets and complained so Allahu Allahu Allah and the Prophet went to our beloved Nawaz to check on him so he told him how do you recite the Quran he said I decide the Quran once every day he finishes the whole Quran in prayer once every night so say don't do this finish the Quran once every 30 days see I can't do more say 20 I can do more two weeks until he says I saw Sarah ten days or one week and that is it how do you fast he said I fast every single day said no fast three days every month because this is equivalent to fasting the whole year if you fast three days a month Alonzo JAL would register you as if you have fasted the full year why because one good deeds is multiplied by ten three days every month is a whole month this means that you have fasted the whole year he said I can fast more than that prophet of Allah so the Prophet has increasing him says trust Mondays and Thursdays this would mean a little bit more I can do more prophet of Allah fast this fast that until the Prophet told him what we will find in sha allah after the break so stay tuned I said I my alaikum and welcome back so I've the love number may Allah be pleased with him and with his father wanted more of everything so the Prophet told him fast one day and skip one day throughout the whole year this is the fasting of the route peace be upon him he said I can do more he said you know one can do more better than that so this is not allowed so the Prophet instructed him to fast one day and skip one day now did the prophet alayhi salatu salam ever done such a thing scholars say no this means that when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam approves something that the companions did yet he did not do it this means that this is over lower degree and great however it's permissible so it's permissible for you to do but if you want the highest why would you choose something lower the highest is what the Prophet used to do either salat wa salam so if you fast mondays and thursdays and the three white days for 13 14 and 15 hamdulillah you've got it made more than enough we move on to the following hadith hadith number 102 job it will not belong alone sorry the long one the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said to my my it would have been better if you had recited sabaeans Malaba kilala and it's chapter 87 or some similar haha type of 91 or well lately either yellow shot chapter 92 for the old the weak and those who have things to do pray behind you Sahih al-bukhari there's a collage iran what is the origin of this hadith this hadith as stated before happened when were I've even jebel may Allah be pleased with him used to prayer YCJA with the Prophet Allah saw some in the Masjid of Medina and then go to his people who did not have enough knowledge and did not accompany the Prophet as salaam because they were farmers they were normal people so he used to lead them in prayer praying for records volunteering for him while it is fault for them Ayesha prayer and they were people of farming of taking care of their crops and so on so a man who wanted to go and water his crops before going to bed joined Mahad in prayer Mahad that night started to recite Surat al-baqarah and we know this is the longest chapter so the man waited waited waited hysteretic taking too long so he retreated finished his racea prayer and left to his farm to do what was needed to be done after isha prayer was over the good people went to Mahad as usual and said to him you know so-and-so he left you while you were in your prayer completed his prayer and left to his farm so God said he's a hypocrite he's a munafa so the good people took that word and went to the boy to the man and said do you know what my I said about you he said that you're a munafa I am a lunatic by Allah we'll go to the Prophet is a surah so he went to the Prophet as Simon told him why does this and that and that is why I left him and I went to water my crops the Prophet was outraged I didn't his salat WA Salam and he called Murad and said Mahad effect an ant are you the one who's testing people by what you are doing by prolonging the prayer and then he told him wouldn't you have prayed these chapters which are in the middle of the mufasal' in Asia because there are people who are weak who are ill who are needy they have things to do so this is the benchmark in the length of racea prayer and it is the benchmark of all other five prayers taken into consideration those who pray behind you and the prophet alayhi salatu salam called that man and said my friend what do you recite in your prayer because you finish pretty prayer and went so the prophet wants it you know he says I do not know you're done dinner you and wife then dinner you know danda in arabic it means is when you as if you're singing what is it then and then you're doing this so he's saying I do not know your then dinner no one more other than dinner you guys what you mumble and say I do not understand I ask Allah for paradise and seek protection from Hellfire this is what I know the Prophet laughs they said around them we make our den dinner this is exactly what we are doing and the man said Mahad accused me of being a hypocrite by Allah tomorrow when we fight he will know who is a hypocrite and soon afterwards there was a battle so they all went to defend Medina and after the battle was over they told Mahad look at the man that you spoke about few days ago and they found him with a number of kafir disbelievers killed around him before they managed to kill him about seven or eight and why I said by Allah now I know who is the hypocrite now this is not the action of hypocrites which means that more admits that this is a true believer what brought us to this subject was that whoever leaves a prayer must take into consideration those praying behind him and if he would like to prolong prayer masha'Allah you know Quran and you love your voice pray night prayer as much as you want for hours five hours take your time but when you lead people in prayer don't impress them try your best to be brief and to be praying the perfect prayer we open the floor for your questions let's take the brothers question their last row a Salaam Baalak shakes Angela like well offerings Allah after surah Fateha is it compulsory to like read the surah in sequence or like how it is I believe the brother is asking on the ruling on praying sewers in the 1st and 2nd raka in accordance to the sequence of the Quran or can we flip it's an issue of dispute among scholars but the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam states that it is permissible why because the order of the sewers are not by the order of the Prophet array salatu salam the prophet only ordered them to make the order of the verses so for example if we have 286 verses in surah Baqarah for example the Prophet told him to put each ayah in its position sure Imran each ayah in his position but he never told them put this surah before that or this or after that and that is why in the authentic hadith when one of the Companions prayed with the Prophet al-assad night prayer and the Prophet started with Surat al-baqarah the companion said he will recite 100 ayah and then make record and the prophet went on until he finished Surat al-baqarah and then he started with certain Nisa and then he finished it and then started with surah al-imran and then he bowed the companion said by Allah I almost did something bad and that is I almost sat down the Prophet looked to the sequence recited baqara Nisa al-imran although in the Quran it is Bakura and Imran Nisa so the Prophet of Islam made one surah before the other chapter 2 for 3 not only that authentic hadith the Prophet recited in the first raka well lady Aisha in the second raka om pseudo ha ha though the order and the Quran is different therefore the scholar say it is not recommended to them but it is permissible and I personally think that it is permissible all the way what is not permissible in my opinion is to recite the end of surat al-baqara ends first raka I'm a result with my Anjali never be he will move on and in the second raka you recite ayatul kursi which is before it because then you will mix the order of the Quran though some scholars say it's okay even that is ok as long as it in a separate rock I highly do not recommend it yes brother Salam aleikum Shaikh body my question is that suppose the imam is in the second raka and we have come in the second rank of the imam and so when the imam goes into shahu so as it is a force ricasso what should we decide that the imam is in the Tatra hot position and this is he yes to him is the third record a second raka and he has a third and a fourth you joined him in the second or you joined him in this the jihad position so you played the second raka with him yes the second record that you prayed is your first raka and that is why when he sits you're compelled to sit and do two jihad but this is still your first rock rap when he starts or stands to pray his third this is your second when he praised his fourth this is your third he offers Salam you bring your fourth record so whenever you join the imam whether it's in the 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th raka this is your first record regardless but when he is not Asha hood so what is appointment or decide you have to sit in the tisha hood and do that they shall hold with him in the first record for you because following the Imam is a must and that is why if the Imam forgets and instead of sitting for the second tisha hood he stands up for the 3rd Makaha do you say hey wait you pull him down no you have to go but I didn't do my Dasha hood you don't do your tisha hell you have to so following the mmm is quite essential the site Agra man shake we spoke about the different actions we do in Salah a person after stitute when he's standing up is there a particular way in which is to place his hands on the ground while getting up like the fist closed or you know by keeping the whole palm there it's an issue of dispute when I stand up those who say that there isn't a need for you to put your hands first when you go for prostration those who say you go on your knees first and then your hands when you stand up you you remove your hands and stand with your knees so they have no problem with your question your question is regarding those who fall on their hands and then their knees when they stand up it's an issue of dispute some of the scholars authenticate they make it had Asahi that the Prophet Aslam whenever he stood up he used to make as the one who make is preparing the dough you know the dough so people who make the dough they do this as in the fist and some say you do it on your fingers and Shambala it's wide I personally use this fist methodology which we have learned from sheikh nerudin Albani long time ago I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time for Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
