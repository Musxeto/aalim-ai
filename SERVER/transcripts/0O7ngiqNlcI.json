  "transcript": "Alum uh sh I want to ask a question uh I got married two years before my husband uh married second uh he married second time uh without knowing me just two months before uh he actually he cheated on me he was in Affair before getting married to that girl so after I knew I asked him to give me divorce so he's not giving me d was he said no I will not leave he will not leave me so what to do this is something that can't be explained or discussed in few seconds because this is a lifechanging decision number one it doesn't matter whether he cheated on you or not because even if he did not cheat on you and he still went and married someone else you would have asked for divorce and you would have been angry number two if he did not marry and he continues to go and have a girlfriend in secret and you know about this would you be happy or would you ask him to marry her the vast majority of Muslim women they would say no we're happy as long as we are the single wife let him cheat without any problem what kind of a Muslim woman would encourage her husband to do such a thing thirdly whether you want to stay in this relationship or not this is entirely your own decision if you ask him for to divorce you without any legitimate reason if he's capable of opening a house providing for you and being fair in distributing his time and his gift and he's doing everything that Allah told him to do but still you are the one who doesn't want to then you are in deep trouble because the prophet saidat any woman who seeks divorce without a legitimate reason legitimate reason she will not find the scent and fragrance of jenah and this is a very strong warning so if you have a legitimate reason you can apply for go to the court and file a case against him pay him the Mahar back and get your freedom he would be sad for a couple of weeks and he moves on with a new wife and probably take a second wife that is younger more beautiful and more righteous life goes on it's not going to stop you on the other hand may find a big problem in three to six months time when you're all alone and nobody's proposing and maybe you don't have any financial means to take care of you and then you start to regret and say whoops what have I done but then there's no going back if one goes to talk to him and say why don't you reconcile with your ex-wife said you crazy now I've just tasted the taste of Happiness of being alone from a woman who nags and complains I'm not accusing you don't judge me I'm not going to judge you I don't know you but this is not the place to discuss these things this requires a counseling session"
