  "transcript": "we spoke about islam we spoke about iman and we will talk about inshallah and all of these were mentioned in the hadith known as the hadith of jibril peace be upon him where he came to the prophet saws in the format of a man who has white clothes black hair does not have the traces of travel on him yet no one knows him among the companions and he asked the prophet about islam and the prophet told him about the five pillars then he asked the prophet isaiah what is he man so the prophet answered by explaining to him the six pillars of iman the six pillars of belief or faith so he said to believe and to believe in allah his books his angels his messengers the day of judgment of the last day and to believe in whether good or bad now scholars said okay this is a little bit awkward he should have listed all six together to believe in allah his his books his messengers his angels in the last day and in the divine decree this is would have been more logical but why mention and to believe in pre-destiny whether good or bad scholars say that definitely this was not said for no justification or good reason and the reason behind that is that to believe in allah to believe in allah azza his angels his books scriptures his messenger and in the day of judgment this is all not disputed upon among the vast majority of people but uh even among the muslims when you come to talk about the preordainment about destiny about the divine decree this is where people go astray in large numbers and why is that simply because pre-decree or free destiny preordainment is something that goes beyond our comprehension and this this is why the prophet wasallam got angry when he once came to the masjid and saw his companions debating and arguing about destiny he got angry and he forbade them from doing this one would say sheikh we are free thinkers nothing is taboo we have to discuss everything no this is not correct why does islam prohibit us from implementing our logic and minds and intellect to things in in in this world the answer is yes and no things that you can understand your words are welcome to discuss thing that you don't mean is to understand this is taboo you should know your limits without respect i beg to differ i have no limits allah created my intellect and my mind and i can use it and think with it and come to great this discoveries and trying to handle this i say subhanallah created us and he knows what is best for us and when we come and try to go beyond our pay grade we will fall and break miserably every one of us has limits and let me give you an example we have five senses and some add a sixth sense so we have the sight the hearing the taste the feeling what else i'm not calculating maybe comprehension understanding these are senses that allah has given us and we must acknowledge the fact that there are things that our senses cannot comprehend or reach for example my sight there are things that are so small i cannot see and just because i cannot see them this does not mean that they do not exist rather it means that my senses are not equipped to see them and there are things that are so mega and huge that if i try to see them it will blind me like the sun so if in high noon i try to go and look at the sun it will blind me so being unable to see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist it simply means that my heating my my sense of sight of seeing is not qualified to do so hearing is the same thing i can hear noises around me but there are levels of noise that we humans cannot hear dogs can special whistle you blow in nobody hears it except dogs and they come running to you and there are sounds that are so loud that if i do not protect my hearing i'll go deaf and it will bust my ears this is on the layman's level we talk about senses now when we talk about something that is far greater than our senses and that is this the the knowledge of allah azzawajal and what do we mean by knowledge of allah al-qaeda or the divine decree is the knowledge of allah subhanahu wa and hence we cannot comprehend it with our own limited senses and our own limited minds therefore the prophet isaiah in the hadith repeated the word and to believe in the preordainment whether good or bad because this is a category of its own and imam ahmad was asked what is the divine decree what is al-qatar and he said it is a knowledge of allah and also imam shafir before him he said whenever you want to debate those who disregard and ignore and neglect the divine decree debate with them with the knowledge of allah so ask them does allah know what is going to happen or not if they say yes then they're believers and they have rejected their own allegation about the divine decree and if they say no then they are disbelievers they are kafir this is an important article of iman so divine decree is what allah has preordained subhana wata and the scholars say that the divine decree has four pillars it is essential and important to believe in them in order to be a believer of the divine decree or of al-qaeda and what are these four pillars the first pillar is allah's knowledge so we have to believe that allah azzawajal knows everything in details and when we say everything we mean everything large and small past present and future and this is why allah's knowledge is not like ours our knowledge is limited to this room i can see that there is a tv monitor i can see that there are couches around me i can see that there are air conditioning lights things that i can see i have knowledge in what's beyond the walls i have no knowledge in what happens in the neighborhood i have no knowledge in what happens in the country what happens in the continent what happens in the whole world what happens in the solar system what happens in the milky way galaxy what happens in the hundreds of millions of galaxies what happens in this huge universe we have zero knowledge in allah's knowledge is unlike this at all allah knows what was in the past centuries and centuries of events and things that took place allah knows what's happening at the moment in every corner of this universe so allah's knowledge is so huge that allah hears the footsteps of a black aunt on a soft rock in the middle of the night allah azzawajal hears that and counts every step that ant makes allah's knowledge knows what will happen in the future not only that allah's knowledge is capable of knowing what will not happen things that will not happen how would it have been if it were to take place allah's knowledge knows this so the knowledge of allah azzawajal is one of his attributes and this is why when we talk about al-qaeda is it created or not we have to distinguish between the noun which is allah's knowledge and between [Music] the thing that allah has pre-ordained which is allah's creation it is like the mercy of allah we have a rahma which is an attribute of allah and all attributes of allah are not created and we have which allah has created and the hadith says allah created mercy when he created it into a hundred branches he placed one on earth and preserved and kept with him 99. this one branch of rahma of mercy is what causes a beast and prevents a bee from stepping and crushing one rahma so is this an attribute of allah or a creation of allah no this is the creation of allah the word creation this is one of allah's attributes but what allah has done through his actions are created the creation so we have to when we discuss these things to differentiate between we have to differentiate between the noun which is allah's attribute and the actions or the objects which allah has created going back to the four pillars of iman one knowledge so allah's knowledge dictates that nothing happens in this earth or in this universe without allah knowing it it's impossible so this means that allah knows what we will all be doing before even we were created one would say how is this possible this is allah his attributes are unlike our attributes so his hearing is definitely not like our hearing and his knowledge is not like our knowledge and sometimes we give the example and allah has the highest example when we say that a teacher who had taught his students for a whole year just before the final exams looks at a number of students and say you will get a plus grades he looks at an another group of students and say that you guys will get c's and he looks at a student or two and he says to them you too will fail and get an f and the students object so how do you know this do you know the unseen do you know the raid and the teacher says no but my knowledge of the subject and of your ability i can safely predict and say that most likely this is what will happen and allah's knowledge is unlike any of ours and hence we have to have unconditional conviction and belief in it pillar number two of our belief in the divine decree is that everything was written down so it's only not only allah's knowledge but allah azzawajal has written down everything that is going to happen and this can never be changed so in the authentic hadith the prophet says when allah first created the pen he ordered it to write so the friend said oh allah what should i write and last to the pen write everything that is going to happen until the day of judgment the prophet said and this was 50 000 years before allah created the creation so before allah created the whole universe that we see before allah created the earth and the skies and the sun and the moon allah when he created the pen he ordered the pen to write in the preserved tablet everything that is going to happen so this is written in a preset tablet that i will drop the pen today at this particular time and this particular fashion and also it is written that i attempted to drop the pen then i change my mind and i put it back again it is mind-blowing to know these things it is mind-blowing to know that every single leaf that falls from a tree it is written when it's going to fall how many will fall with it the down spiral it will take and how it would lie on the ground which side will it be facing the skies and which side it will be facing the earth every single detail that you can imagine or even not imagine when you have a sandstorm it is written how many sand particles are there and how they will move and shape and strike what will strike my face and what will not so miraculous so astonishing this is known as writing our that the soul is breathed into a fetus in its mother's womb allah sends an angel when the fetus is a hundred and twenty days old almost four months so the angel is ordered to write four things his deeds his provision his death and whether he is pious and righteous or evil and doomed this is the angel's duty to write and this is part of what is written already in the preserved tablet and when it comes to it being written down so many questions come to my mind so if everything is written down why do we make dua or allah give us this or give it that or cure our sake or prevent us from this or that why do we do this if it's already predestined one you do not know what is predestined to allah made your dua means of this destiny of yours so it was predestined if you don't make dua allah would not change what's happening to you but if you make dua allah would change this and there are two types of pre destiny that is written one that is written in the preserved tablet 50 years 50 000 years before allah created the creation and this does not change and there is a divine decree that takes place every single year for that whole year and this is written or dictated to the angels every year and this can change an altar according to what is found in the preserved tablet so for example it can be written that this year i should die and the angels write that on to die in like two months however it is also pretty distant in the preserved tablet that i should go and visit my uncles and my cousins and phone them and connect to my kinship which adds and prolongs my lifespan as per the hadith so allah azza orders the angels to erase that and add five years to my life i don't see this i i don't know this but this is what is taking place due to our good deeds or bad deeds but what's in the preserved tablet never changes it stated that i was supposed to die two months from now but due to the fact that i had spent my time calling my uncles and aunts and cousins then allah azzawajal prolonged my lifespan by five years more or something like that so first of all allah's knowledge second of all writing down of our destiny the third aspect of it is the creation and allah a lot of demon sects argued with this it said it is not possible that allah created our bad deeds and they say if i rape a woman allah created this if the burmese slaughter these buddhist monks and the burmese and many mar region they slaughter and rape our muslim sisters from the rohingya allah created this subhanallah and they confuse people with these thoughts and we ask a very simple question is there a creator other than allah's origin if they said yes they're disbelievers if they said no there's only one creator then they have answered themselves allah says in the quran when ibrahim peace be upon him is debating with his people who worship the idols and the stars he says to them look at what you're worshiping these idols it is allah who created you and what you make and manufacture and do so this is a clear cut evidence that it is allah azzawajal is the one who creates subhanahu wata'ala and all our deeds and all what we do are created by the almighty and it is allah who created everything and he gave it its destiny subhanahu so this is the third pillar and it is essential that we have knowledge in all of these things because without such knowledge we will go astray like all other deviant sex had uh uh gone and ended up with so we have allah's knowledge we have writing down of our destiny and we have allah's creation fourthly the fourth pillar is the divine will what does the divine will mean now did allah will the things to happen as we see them you see good things we have no problem in saying that yes allah willed that abdullah marries khadijah that's a good thing allah willed that the couple have a healthy child allah willed that people who study hard will pass their exams all of these things are accepted what causes confusion is when you say was it allah who willed that this poor girl would be raped or this whole village would be flooded with floods and mud and people would die or a volcano will would erupt or an earthquake would take place did allah will this so the prophet said was and to believe in the pre-ordainment in the divine decree in the destiny whether good or bad so talk to me explain to me does allah azzawajal ordain something that is bad that is evil i again we come back to the issue of allah as divine decree as an attribute which is knowledge and to allah's actions and of what allah creates the decree itself cannot be evil at all allah does not preordain allah azzawajal does not decree except what is good what results from what allah has created can be evil and can be good but allah's creation allah's decree allah's knowledge is all pure good no evil in it and this is why the prophet salallahu and he says addressing allah will be adequate and goodness is in in your hands while evil and bad things are not attributed to you but who created it allah there's no creation creator other than allah yet allah's decree is good we fail to see we fail to sense the goodness in it because when allah talks to us in the quran and he says that corruption has occurred on land and in the sea so that allah would make people taste some of what they had earned with their own hands so that they might return to allah azza the end conclusion is to return to allah subhanahu wa allah ordained upon us to fight in the cause of allah what we know and call as jihad but this is abhorred by human nature no one wants to be killed or injured but allah says in the quran maybe you may hate something but there is good in it for you so when one says allah's decree is always good but what is decreed what is created can be good and can be bad this is understood allah created a wolf a wolf is bad or good alpha is bad and allah created a sheep a sheep is good we can eat it use its wool what good what good is there in a wolf now the concept of creation of preordainment and divine decree allah's creation is good what is created the wolf itself is bad but not allah's creation one says allah ordained that there be satan now what good is satan allah's creation is good what is created that is satan is evil but through this evil we get people like us entering jannah because without this evil if we did not fight satan we would not enter jannah so things that may seem to us that are bad essentially they have a lot of goodness in it that we cannot see or feel without the presence of darkness we could never appreciate light without the presence of pandemics and illnesses we can never appreciate health and without the presence of evil we would not be able to appreciate the the righteousness in us that would that would qualify us with the grace of allah to enter jannah so you have to believe that allah willed everything that is happening around us and there are so many evidences of this in the quran now having said that and i know that i've taken so much time but this is why it is a very important topic and an article of iman having said that there are two types of divine will so we have al-mashiya we have al erada we have kitab al-qaba all of these things are divided into two types allah says in the quran you would not choose until allah azzawajal wills it so without going into details because this would take another hour there are two types of will of allah azzawajal there is the legislative will the religious there is the religious will and there is the universal will what is the religious will it is what allah loves we call it according to religion this is what allah azza loves you to do so allah loves that all people follow islam there's no doubt in that allah loves that the jinn and the humans worship him that's why allah says i have not created the jinn and the humans except that they would worship me this is the sole purpose of creating them to worship me now this is what allah loves that they all worship him what happens on the ground and in reality may coincide with what allah loves and may go against it nevertheless this is what will happen and this is the divine will that is universal whether allah loves it or not so the religious will or the legislative will allah intends and allah wills that abu bakr accepts islam and allah loves that accept islam because allah sent to the messengers of allah to call them to islam so allah loves this now when we come to the universal will which is what will happen whether allah loves it or not we find that both wills were fulfilled in abu bakr allah loves abu bakr to accept islam abu bakr accepted islam both wills were fulfilled as for the disbelievers allah loves that pharaoh accepts islam but allah's universal will stated that he will not accept islam and he will die as a kafir so this was not fulfilled and this was fulfilled so when you come to the divine will whatever allah loves whether it happens or not this is called legislative religious will and whatever takes place whether allah loves it or not this is known as that will happen that will take place and some translate as a universal will that will inevitably happen so this or these are the four pillars of the belief in the divine decree or the pre ordainment or in the destiny without it you will not be able to have a full iman if any there are two deviant sects part of the 72 sects that are all in hell except one we hope and pray that we are among the one these 72 sects among them are sects that said nothing in this world is predestined and nothing in this world is written down and allah azza does not know that things will happen and allah azza does not create whatever happens and this is total blasphemy and this no deviant sect is known as those who claim that there is nothing as such and there is algebria on the opposite side who say that we have no choice whatever takes place is according to allah's divine will and we have no choice therefore pharaoh and abu bakr are the same in the sight of allah because they are fulfilling what allah has preordained upon them and this is definitely blasphemous as well we believe that we have our own choices as our actions are divided into two types something that is voluntary in something that is not voluntary so my heartbeat is involuntary it's not with my own doing i cannot say stop for a couple of minutes and then reactivate i cannot my breathing is involuntary when i have a fever and i start to shiver because of the temperature my my fever this is involuntary parkinson's disease cures and protectus or alzheimer involuntary but when there is food in front of me this is my action i'm the one who's deciding to eat and if there is a lot of sugar in it i refrain because i'm diabetic i know that this is harmful when i wake up and i'm sick i take the medicine though i know it tastes awful and horrible and i don't want it but i have to take it and when i see good food that is calling me to eat it but i know that there is harm in it i refrain who's doing this me so i cannot use predestiny to justify my sins why did you fornicate with that woman wrote that upon me and i had to do it subhanallah is he right one would say well allah did write this upon him i know but is he right in justifying his evil act with allah's predestiny no because he when he committed zina did not know whether allah had registered this upon him or not so to fall into sin and claim that this happened because it was predestined by allah i would advise him to go to the highest building in town and jump from the sea from the roof and if it is predestined that he will fall in his feet and walk home it will happen and if not then this is allah's predestiny would he accept that i'm crazy of course i will not do this who's in his right mind would go and jump from 40 or 50 stories high you have to be crazy and i would say the same thing who in his right mind would go and fornicate knowing what allah has prepared for those who commit zinna or steal or lie or not pray faster on time or be disobedient to his parents because you would be crazy for doing this exactly like that man who is jumping from a high riser anyhow there are so many things that we can talk about but i'm afraid that we don't have enough time insha'allah what i have mentioned to you would be an eye-opener for you to understand the concept of uh divine decree"
