  "title": "Trading in Stocks or Shares / Investing in Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba etc - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hamza says is it allowed to trade in Facebook stocks or Amazon or Alibaba when there is some Haram on their websites some say that these companies do not sell the Haram rather the seller on such sites do those companies or these companies I mentioned just provide the platform for anyone to sell they have sugar in the tea I hope I don't think well this is beside the point what is the meaning of stocks or shares this is a company and the whole company's either owned by shareholders or it's privately owned by a person who has the majority of the shares so when I buy the stocks of a particular company I become a partner now though I'm not running the company I'm not in the board of directors I'm not managing it yet I'm a part owner of that company even if it's point zero zero zero zero one percent still the money I've invested makes me a partner this means that I am accountable for my investment depending on the line of work of this particular company Amazon what Facebook to begin with is a company that is dubious that has so many bad things in their portfolio such as spying collecting data leaking influencing open ian's blocking those who defend freedom or something that is good and opening the floor for someone who is corrupt and evil like Twitter like every but this is beside the point Amazon and Alibaba are the same they tend to control the market by selling cheaper than the dealers and cheaper than the shops because they don't have any capital ongoing yet they may sell alcohol entertainment Haram things that are obvious so you're a partner in this not only that these companies like most kafir companies and also unfortunately like a lot of Muslim companies they finance their projects and work through banks and loans based on Reba or they put their savings in time deposit fixed deposit boxes or they put it and charge interest from banks or from other companies and this is why if you go to their financial statement you'll find a lot of riba coming in and going out so this means that you as an investor is part of that and therefore a proper Muslim does not risk his income to be tarnished with anything that is Haram like this and allah azza wajal knows best"
