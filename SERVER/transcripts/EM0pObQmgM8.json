  "transcript": "however if you are financially independent and seriously you found the woman that you would inshallah be happy with you as a man do not require the approval of your father and your mother I'm not encouraging you to disobey them but you are the one who's getting married not them so if your mom says I don't want you to marry her why I'm the one who's getting married I'm not gonna make it marry your niece I'm not gonna marry your cousin or your relative I'm gonna marry the woman that I think that would make me happy and so many times the parents themselves are an obstacle a good boy a good girl they would make a good match the mother comes and says no no she's not she's not good for my my son the father says I need to interview the girl okay what do you mean you need to interview the girl your boy is a grown-up he's a man till now you're interfering in his affairs he may not know how to select he is getting married not you she's not a muharram to you he's allowed in Islam to meet her and to talk to her you're not yet they insist and so many good proposals are interrupted because of the interference of the parents so if you are the boy is financially independent be diplomatic be dutiful be obedient to your parents but marry the one you think is good if her parents are willing to accept and may Allah make it easy for all Muslims"
