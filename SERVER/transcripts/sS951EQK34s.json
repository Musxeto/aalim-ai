  "title": "Getting Intuitions, Premonitions and having the Sixth Sense - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sherina says shake I get premonition most of them are true I get them via dreams some are too deep that I can see a vague picture of something happening somewhere else while I'm awake mostly regarding my siblings or husband what is the basis of this in Islam why does this happen well premonition is something that you get it's like intuition it's like what they call the sixth sense sense where you see things or have the ability to anticipate something that will happen and most of these premonitions are bogus the vast majority of them are not true yet because we have so many of them and there are so many untrue if we get one that is true this is only what sticks in your mind it is like what the soothsayers say the Prophet told us how they thought Sam that the jinn climb one over the other until they reach the lower heaven and they eavesdrop to what the angels are saying to one another about what allah azzawajal has spoken so they snatch a word and they give it to the one below while mirror always start banging them off and killing them one of them manages to flee and he throws this word that he heard in the heavens to a soothsayer or a fort and teller from the humans who mixes it up with 99 lies these 99 lies include his intellect using his brain in analyzing what you're doing from your fingernails from the way you look from the way you speak from googling from looking at your face book page and Twitter and obtaining knowledge from you so when you come he speaks you know carelessly and puts these information inside about your school about your neighbors about your work about how you feel about your birthday's and you think wow this guy knows the future how did he know all of this and then he gives you one lie of a prediction that will happen in the future which relates to what was said in the heavens and when it happens the 99 lies that he had said you tend to forget all what resonates is the simple truth that he had said which was he's dropped from heavens likewise what we get from these premonitions from these intuitions from these gut feelings and it becomes true and this is why if you look at the past you'll find for example that Roman hottub had some of these visions if you smiie abu-bakr also had a very strong feeling that what is going to be born after his death because he was on his dying bed and his wife was pregnant and nobody knew that she was pregnant that she would bring a female and this they say how do you know I know Roman Roman hot bob was in medina on the pulpit giving the hotbar and all of a sudden he said yes area tell jebel yes sorry at elgible he started to shouting oh sorry i go to the mountain go to the mountain and then they ask him after the hot WA what was that he said what was what so you said this said I don't know I was so busy thinking about the army I sent to fight I think maybe the Persians or the people in Iraq and they were cornered and they were about to be defeated and killed so I saw a mountain and I saw the leader of the army whose name is Syria and I just thought of telling him to go and to protect your back with this mountain a month later they came back and the news came that on that particular day where Roma was giving the hotbar they had fierce fighting with the enemies and they were about to be defeated until they say they heard her mother's voice telling them go and protect your back with the mountain and they did so and Allah so she'll save them now this kind of stories gives us a wild imagination and it depends how wild it is on your email and on what's happening to you some folks tend to see dreams that come true and there's no problem in that because this was mentioned in the in the authentic hadith that nothing is left from revelation from way except truthful visions and they are one out of 46 branches of Revelation so a truthful person sees truthful visions and there's no problem in that the problem is when you become possessed with the idea that whatever I see is going to happen and when people claim to be allies of Allah they are aulia Allah because Allah has blessed them with this and that and we know that whatever we see or we feel is going to happen ah this is a different story a random vision that takes place and happens this is a good glad tiding there's no problem in that but to think that whatever I think of is going to happen now this is an obsession and this is whispers of Shaitaan to think that I am of great a level of Eman because of this also this is an exaggeration that must be stopped visions can be from Allah if they're good can be from Shaitaan if they are depressing and sad and evil and can be from your sub-conscience depending on your work depending on your daily activities so don't put a lot of emphasis on it and don't think so high of yourself because of it and always remember that one may happen and nine fails so don't rely always on your gut feeling and Allah surgeon knows best"
