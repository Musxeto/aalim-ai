  "transcript": "perfect with no fla at all are the laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of way of Muhammad brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to a new episode on the topic of marriage and in our last episode we started to speak about the idea of the In-laws in this marriage contract and uh however we did not dwell into this issue uh enough we just basically scratched to surface so how about we try that the in-laws what is their role how do we understand them what are their rights to what extent can they get involved in the whole marriage contract perhaps you would like to elaborate on this my dear guest I'll start off with this one I um I think there's a principle that the husband and wife need to agree on from the beginning it's we call it the principle of bit means this is the Affairs of the house they don't go outside the house this is the advice we hear sh say again and again that what happens in the house stays in the house and even if there's children there that might know like stories of what's Happening that even the children know what happens in the house stays in the house and I think if a husband and wife that even when you're when you're looking to get married from the very beginning say of course we respect our you know our in-laws but let's agree from the beginning that what happens in the house stays in the house is it possible that someone takes this to some extreme and therefore when consultation is required they don't consult anyone because they say well everything should remain in the home or do we have to explain that there are times when you have to go outside to to resolve internal domestic problem that for sure um those situations will will come up right where maybe the woman is being physically abused and he's saying just keep it in the house or something like that she might need to go and speak to somebody but obviously those are going to be cases that um they'll come up one of the one of the issues that I find myself dealing with of a lot of extremes in this case of the in-laws I mentioned in the previous uh episode the husband often uh listening to his mother so much that he actually even makes on his and I deal with his a lot very sad then the another thing that often happens still we're sticking on the topic of the men a little bit here um is that he doesn't uh encourage or sometimes he totally neglects his in-laws and I think I'm guessing there's this sort of culture is that the man's job is to look after the mother the man thinks that now you're my wife your responsibility is to look after me your parents are not important this is totally wrong he should should be encouraging his wife did you phone your mom did you phone your dad we need to go and see your parents cuz you still have to uh care for them and look and he should help her to keep this uh connection with uh her parents not prevent it as unfortunately we find in some instances which is very very wrong thing alhamdulillah do you agree with him on that why I like to add something Brothers here the issue of the in-laws before we elaborate more on this issue I would like to talk about love of yes love in marriage yes life okay is based on love and when you love someone you will sacrifice and life is about sacrificing and life is about give and take okay and every one of us should memorize and should keep all always this law in front of him the law of love the law of Love States you love what your beloved loves and you hate what your beloved hates this is the law of love if I love someone I will love whatever he loves as long what he loves is not Haram and that you will hate what he hates and an English man would say love me love my dog right that what the English man says love me love my dog which means that if you love me you will love me love my family but my relatives and likewise if I love you I will love you your family your mother your father Etc an AR poet said this what he said This is Love brothers and sisters the meaning he said this is before Islam he said I love her and she loves me and my camel loves her she camel that even the animals they love each other so if you love your wife really or if you love your husband you love her parent and if you love your wife you will love her parents and if she loves you she will love your your parents because loves you they become her parents naturally true or not they are exception some ills may be giving you tough time and things like this but we are talking about what Islam is teaching us what Islam is teaching us that we have to be nice and good and not depriving her or encouraging her to cut the ties with her Kindred with her kiss and kin some husband Unfortunately they do that I wanted to make a very what the said is yes many they do this and they we Face problems which is wrong you are committing a sin even some maybe he will not allow her to call them or to to help them or telling her that I'm not obligated yes it's not a matter of obligation but they are Muslims and that you are well of and they are in need what is wrong with this so this what will actually bring the ties and strengthen the ties of the marital relationship that when this mutual respect and love is there dominating the marital life of course I have to say this for the viewers we are speaking about what to look for in the potential spouse no one is insinuating that you fall in love before marriage and you become madly in love so that that will happen afterwards okay because some may think okay so think I think after marriage after marriage love is the one that will resolve the the problems but now before for marriage uh that is something you can't possibly figure out and also if I may comment I beg to differ because the terminology love is not what marriages are based on not all marriages are based on love so you find someone who is married for 40 years to his wife and not necessarily he's madly in love with her as the word love means there's respect there is affection there is Mercy and there is Repose in them but not necessarily the word love as people may think of first of all second of all I beg also to differ with him the love is there and we go back brothers and sisters who's your example and see his love for his wives for AA for all of them so this is very important because we have to keep in mind some of us as men due to the upbringing especially I want to admit the Arabs in particular especially those who grw up in Arabia it's because of the environment and the harsh we have this in us but we our Criterion and what we refer to is the Islam and our example is Prophet Muhammad s that is it and love is essential love not only essential even the is based on love but can I say something in defense of sh aim just a little bit I think I think he's he is of course agreeing with you totally on the importance of love and we should I think we need to make more of an effort if you don't find this why don't you make Dua to Allah increase the love for my wife but I think the she is making a point that actually in reality out there I'm sure there may be people watching us who don't feel that love in their relationship but you know for them it's a relationship that works maybe it's based upon Family Ties that's something that keeps it together maybe it's the children that's keeping it going uh maybe they don't feel this type of love but that doesn't mean they can't have the mutual respect for the in-laws and so on and so forth so I think is this I was going to say the same thing because there's no love and therefore there should be divorce for all what you've said I agree with but I be to differ for the second or third time I lost count agreeing with me as well okay I agree with you ald see what I meant when I said about love is mentioned also in the Sunnah or thear of the companion the may Allah be pleased with him was met by a man who wanted to divorce his wife so he asked him why do you want to divorce her he said because I don't love her and Omar almost beat him with a stick in his hand and said yes are all houses built on love meaning that houses marriages are not built only on love that the one we see you know candl light didn't and the violin next to you and the violin is Haram cand light is okay uh dinner but it is not built on that kind of love maybe we may interpret or Define love that is talking about is respect compassion love Mercy Etc this is point number one but I I think we have a break there is another point I'd like to pick up afterwards in and you shall inshallah we'll be right back stay tuned way of life and we are back so love is in the air or is it well the second point is I don't know about if love is in the air or not but inshallah it it would be um and and love would be spread all over uh the entire Earth the second point I wanted to bring up is that once a couple of years ago I was driving and this guy behind me giving me a high beam and low beam and honking me and I the road is is so wide what is this guy doing so you know I got hot tempered and I parked and I came out of the car and the guy came out of the car and he said said I cool down then the guy wanted to ask me a question he didn't want to pick a fight so alhamdulillah so I said what's wrong and he started complaining about his marriage and he said that I want to divorce my wife so I asked him is she evil she said no mallah she is half of Quran she is a wonderful wife always neatly dressing dressed in the house and she takes care of my child and she's a good cook and my family love her and I said why do you want to divorce her said I don't find this gut feeling of love and I say Subhan Allah you have a jewel do you watch TV a lot well this is what I ask the guy and the guy looked at the ground and said yes and he said do you watch soap operas and movies said a lot I spend like six seven hours said this is what's corrupting your your house because now you think that the love that is found in movies where when you don't see your loved one you you your sleepless nights and you write poems Etc this is not the actual love that is found in our houses all of us we're all married alhamdulillah we love our wives but it is not the love that sustains the marriage it is the responsibilities that I have to do it is the rights my wives give me and it is the mutual respect and compassion and affection that's with us and Allah knows okay and no one will disagree with this but love the problem that the concept even of Love Today is misunderstood okay so we are talking about the the real love when you love someone if you love your wife isn't a sign of love that you don't want her to go to hell and that's why you are trying hard to improve her IM and to encourage her that means you love her because the true love is that when you love someone you want to save him you want want him to to save him from the Hellfire you want her to be with you in the next life this means that when even jealousy is very important element a husband has to be jealous good jealousy yes and a woman likes that when you feel jealous of her not over jealous but you feel jealous oh Subhan Allah many of the can you give us example yes it is the okay so this is this is it that you feel that this is a woman and this is I have to protect her I have to she's a jewel she is a piece of diamond I don't want anyone to touch this precious stone oh just something valuable so this is creates that jealousy in you and the sahabah one day the prophet Sall wasallam said that if you God forbid if you find a man okay with your partner go and bring eyewitnesses s said what want me to wait and go and bring W eyewitnesses by Allah I will cut him into pieces with my soul and the prophet s wasam said oh this is the ruling of Allah the sahab the said oh prophet of Allah forgive him we know he's very jealous he's the most jealous Among Us right the most jealous even they said if he married a woman any woman that was married to him then he divorced her none of us would dare huh to marry her this was pre-islam pre Islam Subhan Allah and if any one of his wives okay he rode or beast or a camel the moment the camel reaches the destination he would Slaughter the camel Allah he would not want anyone to sit on that Camel that his wife mounted so this was but this is of course going to the extreme that's that's an expensive ride okay this is going to the extreme so the jealous is needed and love is needed but not love in the in the sense of the what we read in the novels and the movies no not this love we are we are talking about but it is an important element in the marital life she needs to hear from you I'm let us I'm talking about myself a woman he needs to hear from you this beautiful word yes darling yes sweetheart yes love yes honey yes so he should basically saying sh he should be romantic exactly I I was in Boston in the United States and the brothers they say give a talk to the sisters and I gave a talk to the sisters and I was talking telling them you have to be this take care of yourself and this and that one of the sisters you know mallah many of the American sisters they call it sp sp said what are you talking about okay we have a problem here I said what is it all of them screamed simultaneously romance we want romance romance is essential in the marital life yes what is wrong if you go and bring a bouquet of flour too expensive this is a stinginess we just we talked about generosity yes no very bring this bouquet of flower bring her a gift and come is that darling you know guess what close your eyes yes yes close your eyes mashallah MH you make her day you make her day the girls are very poor M when they hear these beautiful words she will we say in Arabic she will give you her eyes listen to this my dear brother the prophet wasallam in the the prophet wasallam he hates staying awake after is except with his wies chatting do we do this do we sit with our wives and chat let them do the talk and this is very essential we have to keep just nodding our heads don't interrupt yes let her bring his everything she needs the poor girl wants to to bring everything out let her vent it let it come out listen this is very essential be all ear attentive to her and even if she said something she is wrong he say yes you're right you're right and another way of showing love is uh an famous Hadith that the women quote I was always thinking of compiling a book the 40 Hadith that the women quote one of them is theith the prophet Sall that's their favorite Hadith that the prophet wasam used to be in the service of his wives they love that but I'm saying uh for the men that they also can when they're going into their marriage show their Love by washing the dishes sometimes show their love taking the yeah cooking I don't know not all of us are good not good at cooking but take the garbage out I'm going to you know uh fix the bed after the the the brother gets up taking the garbage out is the man's job right I mean you should the wife shouldn't be taking the anyway no I get what you're saying sheah alhamdulillah and I believe that yeah there are lots of qualities needed in a future spouse future husband so the sisters for example would look for someone showing his jealousy in a positive way way and that is by concealing her Secrets there are men who are male but not men actually they're male they go and sit with the boys and say well I did this and that with my wife and they expose their secret and they talk dirty and the prophet told us that this is a feature of the people of hell and any person doing this and talking to others about their intimate and the secrets is like a donkey or a male and female uh Devils having intercourse in the middle of the road and this is not uh befitting a Muslim uh man so this is what a wife what what a woman looks in a husband also I don't know if you may agree with me self hygiene a woman looks in a man to be clean to look representable and to smell good so many times sisters complain from practicing brothers that their husbands their beards smell awful their mouth smells awful and we as men expect our women to be in topnotch form but we we fail to do this ourselves the prophet used to to begin the first thing when he enters his house is by brushing his teeth and he used to love perfumes so a woman looks in a man such a feature n and uh other qualities let us elaborate on this is very important point they issue that of looking presentable and smelling nice and the prophet sallam is always the example and the reason that he would flush his teeth because the F the first thing he would do that he would kiss his his wives this is Sunnah and this is part of showing your love right yes and he would kiss them even before he went to pray in the Masjid he would go very so this is Sunnah so the having good smell and look presentable it is she's a human being at the end of the day not that you come from outside sweating and this and and you want her to come to bed doesn't work that is her right by Allah Allah made it that is how right just so that there will be no misunderstanding we sometimes we I find some things that I interject for the benefit of the viewers um the kiss that we're speaking about is not that other kind of kiss before you go to the m no that is becking in English right Beck someone just not French Kiss not that you know big old is not the French Kiss otherwise you not go to the mid okay that is should be clear to the people so the prophet Salli wasallam he is the example and the woman who came to say is before the Salah is going to make you get excited it will nullify your wo unless unless unless something wrong with the that person maybe you just need more to get you excited than afraid so now so here this woman came to he said I don't want to live with him I don't want to live with him said why what's wrong call him call her husband the husband came masallah his hair every stand is standing can you imagine visualize the seed Dy clothes said go take a shower CB your hair dress up and come nicely put on new clean clothes mallah he came back like a groom how about now he said I have no problem so this is something natural this is the right this is our Islam the problem brothers and sisters everywhere that we are away from our Islam the solution is in our Dean and Muhammad s Ali wasallam is the example just learn your dean and you will have the best life in this life and in the one to come up"
