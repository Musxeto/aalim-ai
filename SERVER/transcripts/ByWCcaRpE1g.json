  "transcript": "okay uh so my question is my pet Channel and it has given us many gifts like uh air conditioner using her husband's money while he was not aware her husband gave her the money to use for her household things but she gave the extra money to my parents so do we have to return all the gifts my parents don't know that it's Haram am I obliged to tell them and is it only Haram for my parents or also for me if I don't tell them it's Haram no you're not obliged to tell your parents or tell anyone because this is too extreme there is a possibility that your maternal aunt gave you these gifts without the consent and approval of her husband but her husband did not come and object or ask you back for such gifts in this case this is between her and her her husband and you have nothing to do with it keep a lid on it until he comes and asks for it then we will find an answer to that inshallah"
