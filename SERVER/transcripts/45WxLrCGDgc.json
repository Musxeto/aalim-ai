  "title": "Is it better to pray alone but on time or to pray a bit late but in congregation? - Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "ahmed from the uk says due to the lockdown we pray at home so there is a brother that comes where we pray jamar together but sometimes he comes late so what is best for me to pray early within the specified time or to pray to pray a bit late yet still within the specified time the answer is no it's best for you to pray in congregation a bit late rather than praying it at the beginning of the time alone and this is the same situation when people from the hanafi dominated areas and they say that the time of asar is quarter to four and the masjid calls for the ikama due to their delay in adhan as the hanafi school at 5 30 or maybe quarter to six so should i pray home alone as a man or wait and pray with the hanafi congregation that says no pray with the hanifi congregation because even when they prayed at quarter to six they are going against the sunnah and this is not the best thing to do but it is being prayed at the specified time and there's no sin in that inshallah"
