  "transcript": "the scholars say if the imam makes a thing in the prayer that follows his school of thought but it is not correct according to the to the most authentic opinion what should we do scholars say you have to follow your imam why because the prophet said that i saw some inna imam imam was made to be followed so i'm praying in kuala lumpur may allah azza will relieve all muslim countries from this pandemic and open the borders back again i miss going to malaysia i go and pray in the masjid the imam is a shafi in the second raka of fajr he makes dua i know for certain that this is wrong i know for certain that this is not from the sunnah he knows for certain that this is the only school of thought that follows this shafi hambali hanafi and maliki they say that this is not from the sunnah so what should i do if i am a follower in mum i follow him in the case of sujudu the hanafi school of thought gives one salaam then make i don't know how many sajdas they make the shahood and then make sajdah again etc this is not from the sunnah definitely but because the hanafi school of thought is a reliable school of thought and the imam who's following it believes that this is authentic in his opinion then this is what is the right thing to do in islam therefore you have to follow him without a problem insha'allah"
