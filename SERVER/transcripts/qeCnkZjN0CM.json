  "title": "Why do people dwell on Fiqh issues rather than ponder upon the Qur'an? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okie-dokie brother shri from the Emirates had a very good question see the question is what we revolve around in our lectures in our programs and everything we do but there is a twist so in essence Shrive is saying that the Muslims and he's generalizing and this is wrong but I'm just coating he says that the Muslims are always indulging in disputes over fit issues and neglecting the Quran and he coached one who said that if you don't recite the Quran you'll not be questioned on the or accountable on day of judgment Allah Jojo will hold you accountable only for salat cm etc and he's saying that one or two of the people were discussing about the length of the beard to the extent that one of them said to the other that you're a disbeliever you are a kafir over such a dispute so he is alarmed by this and he's saying why is this happening and taking place when we have the perfect guidance from Allah which is the Quran now I agree with you tribe to a great extent what I disagree is the attempt intentionally or unintentionally to isolate the Quran see the Quran is a book of guidance but it cannot work by itself otherwise Allah would have revealed a copy of the Quran for each and every one of us it had to be revealed to the best of Allah's creation who is muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam he is a role model he is the best of examples he portrayed the Quran in his character in the way he explained Islam to us without his Sunna and teachings we cannot comprehend and implement fully the Quran coming back to your question I am NOT responsible for the wrong understanding of the Ummah or parts of it so if you see two ignorant people two imbeciles disputing over something that is not mentioned in the Quran and they do not have the necessary knowledge to back it up to the extent that one of them gives the kaffir to the other this is not my problem this is not the Sooners problem this is not the scholars of fik problem this is the problem of individuals how they were brought up the community the media the political drive all of these govern how people react scholars there is students of knowledge are going out of the way to teach the Quran to teach the Sunna and to uplift the people from such ignorance and to purify their hearts from grudges enmity hatred etc now if they don't do not comply this is something that has to be fixed but it is not because they are studying the core that the Sunnah or they are researching in fact it has nothing to do with that so my concern tribe is nowadays we see this trend and there are some dies who come and open in their lectures holding the Quran saying this is poor and we have nothing to stick with or abide by except the Quran and they reticule if not yeah any well ridicule is a little bit big let me retract that they disregard the they disregard issues of ikeda they may make fun of toe heat saying that it is not in the Quran and this is a serious issue we always tell people to abide by the Quran we always caught verses of the Quran before we speak over any issue if there is an evidence in the Quran so this is the norm but it has to be understood through the Sunnah it has to be understood through sound authentic Ikeda otherwise a person would be deviated so I fully agree with you and terms that the Ummah has to abide by the Quran and the Sunnah they have to learn the religion and above all they have to purify their character the way they deal with people and the way they understand that the Deen in order to be righteous practicing Muslims what use is the knowledge if I'm knowledgeable but I'm not truly practicing if I'm not righteous if I do not treat my servants my spouse my children my neighbors my relatives my colleagues in a way that is notable and people would say masha'Allah this is Islam then there is an error that has to be fixed but we cannot blame the message we may blame the messengers those who pretend to be implementing Islam and they tarnishing its reputation through their character and Allah knows best"
