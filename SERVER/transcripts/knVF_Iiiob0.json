  "transcript": "[Music] okay brushing teeth using toothpaste while fasting is it allowed can it be done more than once a day can we use mouth freshener spray can we eat chewing gum first of all the issue of brushing your teeth this is a Sunnah the prophet alayhi salat wa salam used to use this known as miswak and the companion of the Prophet said alayhi salat wa sallam i saw the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam use the miswak countless of numbers during the day while fasting uh-huh which means that brushing your teeth is okay now some scholars put restrictions on using toothpaste because toothpaste has mass to it so if you swallow some of it you would break your fast but usually people brush the teeth well until it's dissolved and then when they turn the water in the mouth and spit it out it's all gone all what remains is the taste and the taste is no problem it does not impact your fasting so can I do it number of times a day no problem can I use mouth spray oh this is different if you said mouthwash where you turn the water in your mouth and you spit it out nothing is left no residue nothing there's no problem when you use a mouth spray this is liquid and you don't spit it out you swallow it this breaks your fasting and you have to be careful likewise chewing gum chewing gum has particles in it that dissolve and you swallow that with your saliva and this breaks your fasting [Applause]"
