  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord and my bad Islam governs every aspect in our lives to the extent that some Jews came to Salman Al farisi may Allah be pleased with him making fun by saying your prophet taught you everything even what to say when defecating and Salman said yes he taught us how to clean ourselves by using three stones or more by not touching a private part or cleaning ourselves with our right Hands by not facing the Qibla or giving them backs to it and he was replying to them to show them that Islam governs everything in our lives not few things and the rest is open to your imagination but rather every single thing chapter 81 it says before sexual intercourse what to say well the prophet is taught us to say a Dua and this Dua is said by the husband before being intimate with his wife and the Dua is Bismillah in the name of Allah Bismillah oh Allah keep the devil away from us and keep the devil away from what you have blessed us with and saying Bismillah prevents the devil from eating with you saying Bismillah prevents the devil from having intercourse with you and this is all part of us being connected to Allah this Dua is only to be said by the husband and not by the wife chapter 82 when angry and everybody is inevitably will reach a stage in his life when he is angry so what to say the prophet Allah taught us that when one of us gets angry that the cause of this anger is Satan so the first thing you do is to seek refuge in Allah from Satan by saying I take refuge with Allah from the accursed Devil regime and also to perform mudu and this was mentioned in another Hadith and also to change the way you are so if you're standing sit down if you're sitting down lie down all of these things help you suppress your anger now the following chapter is regarding supplication set upon seeing someone in trial or tribulation Hadith number 194. if you walk and see someone who was afflicted by an illness a calamity an accident what should we say the prophet told the sale Islam to say the following foreign [Music] number 100 and 94. you say all praise is for Allah who saved me from that which he tested you with and who most certainly Favored Me Over much of his creation is this to be said verbally so that the person hears it definitely not if this person has been afflicted by an illness a Calamity who had just had an accident lost his money or the likes no I do not say this verbally because this hurts his feeling is it is as if I'm making fun of him rather I should say it to myself and show and express my gratitude to Allah by saying it but if that person was afflicted by sin so he's an open sinner he's doing sin in front of everybody else and I see him yes I may say this verbally to him so that he would feel that what has he done what he has done is wrong and that I am grateful to Allah that I'm not like him this is a form of looking down at him and saying him to him that this is a sin you should be ashamed of the following chapter is about remembrance said at a sitting or a gathering so what kind of vicar should I be saying when everybody is talking randomly they are talking so Hadith the 100 number 195 call um foreign would repeat this Dua and I would count more than a hundred times what is this beautiful Dua that the prophet used to repeat more than a hundred times in a gathering O My Lord forgive me and turn towards me to accept my repentance so O My Lord forgive me and have repentance upon me verily you are the often forgiving and the oft repenting upon others or you are the oft returning the oft forgiving more than a hundred times and the prophet used to say this over and over again with his Gatherings and with his companions this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave [Music]"
