  "transcript": "Solana Bahama hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa everything he was holding in I mean Rina muhammadin wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in I'm back assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to hadeeth number 97 of this blessed book of Allah - a calm and the hadith was narrated by Abu Abdo Samet may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said there is no salat for one who does not recite the mother of the book and the mother of the book it was translated here to be the essential chapter there is al fatiha there is no salat what does that mean this is a negation and in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and before that in the quran negation can be used to say that there is nothing existing as we say la ilaha there is no God worthy of being worshipped illallah so we negate something we say that it does not exist there is no one in the house meaning there is no person in the house also negation can mean to negate something out of perfection so someone says did you work out today in the gym I said I did not work out but I went for 10 minutes so by saying I did not work out I do not mean that I did not go to the gym I mean that it wasn't the perfect workout that I usually have and we have a number of evidences for example when the Prophet says Ali salat wa salam la e mana Liman Amanat Ella a person who does not have honesty he has no 'man does this mean he's kaffir when the Prophet says la mano a hadouken Hector you hit Ballia him I hit enough see one of you would not believe until he loves for his brother what he loves showing himself when he said lay Omid does this mean that he is not a believer he is a kafir scholar said no this means that it is not the perfect Eman and this is the difference between us and the deviant groups we who follow the methodology the main hatch of a hallucinogen are we believe that a man increases with good deeds and decreases with bad deeds or with since the deviant groups don't look at it this way deviant groups like who like at how RH or like Elmer Chia both of them are deviant on different extremes how are you saying that a man is a full unit mogea are also saying a man is a full unit how can that be they say that a man does not increase either it's there all the way or it's out all the way and that is why al Huaraz say if you make a major sin you've notified your Eman you're covered in urine hell forever any major sin and that is what Mooji I say no matter what sins you do major minor as long as you don't associate others law Allah you are a full-fledged movement and you are in paradise with Abu Bakr Amin Osman Ali so they both went to two extremes though the same concept is there which is Iman does not increase and does not decrease the believers don't believe in this those who are I have seen no Jumeirah they believe that it is increased by good deeds and decreased by sins and that is why it fluctuates the level of Iman and that is why the Eman is 70 plus branches meaning that if I have 20 branches I'm a believer but I still have 50 plus to complete and become a true full-fledged believer and that is why when we look at some of the hadith you have to be careful you don't take one hadith or one verse or one set of evidence and neglect the others this is not the doing of a proper student of knowledge this is the doing of the people of innovation the deviant sex they take one verse and that is it holla okay but there are other verses that can make you understand this verse better no no no I need only this and when you go to this hadith the Prophet says la salata there is no prayer so what does the Prophet mean other example las a lotta women love will do Allah there is no prayer for someone who does not have woudl is this specifying that the prayer is incomplete all the prayer is invalid it is invalid definitely all know this obviously likewise when we come to this hadith scholars different but they all agreed that whoever does not recite al-fatiha if he is an individual then his prayer is invalid with the exception of al Hanafy school of thought because they thought that no it is sufficient to read a portion of the Quran one eye of the Quran not necessarily Fatiha but this is an exception that we would neglect because we have the hadith supporting it so the majority say reciting the Fatiha is a must if you're an individual or if you are an imam and they differed whether it is a must for you if you are a follower or not we will come to this inshallah later on la salata Liman lamia kora to those who do not recite o Mulkey tap on means mother al-kitab is the quran the book so does this mean humble Khattab the mother of the book on deserve that the book has a father but what does this mean no in Arabic boom when used with something meaning that it is the reference and the prominent thing so when we say for example in describing matka what do we call it Oman Cora as described in the Quran what does humble Cora mean it doesn't mean the mother of all villages it means a prominent among all villages and cities and countries it is the head when we say I hit him on oh moriss a home I say what do they mean they mean that this area which holds all of the head the skin that holds all of the head so home is used with a lot of things we have the phrase of the mother of all battles on Wilma Eric not that it is the mother it means that it's the prominence it's the Battle of all battles and likewise and we know that the Fatiha is the greatest surah in the Quran no surah is similar to it and we know that it has a number of names al-hasan al-basri may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great a being stated that there were 400 sacred books all of them were summarized and composed in taurah injeel zaboor and all of these books were summarized in cement in al-quran and the whole of the Quran was summarized in the greatest chapter which is al-fatiha some of the names of a fatiha is humble kitab al fatiha ash apphia al kaffir I saw that rupiah because the Prophet as I'm considered to be rocky as well and so many other names a lot of names are compared the authors and the scholars have compiled to show us that how great the surah is and it's the habit of Arabs whenever where they glorify something or whenever something is if importance that they give it a lot of names that is why we have so many names for Alliance that we gel the one we know of is 99 names whoever memorizes them and understands the meaning and calls Allah by them will enter Jannah as in the hadith - aha the halogen also there are lots of names for hell fire for example so many names in the Quran mentioned and so many names for paradise so many names for so many things the sword for example has a number of names because the more the thing is valuable and prominent the more names it has now we come to the ruling on reciting the Fatiha we've stated before that it is a pillar of prayer to recite the Fatiha and without it your prayer is invalid la salat however the difference among scholars is great when it comes to the follower the moon the person following his Imam and prayer is he supposed to read the Quran or aside the fatiha or not we have a number of evidences and these evidences if we apply a portion of them meaning that we have to cancel the other portion so we remember when we have conflicting evidences the highest and best level is to join and combine why because we are applying both evidences if we are unable we have to look at the date so that we would say that the latest abrogates the earliest if we are unable then we have to authenticate and see which of the evidences is more authentic and hiring grade and degree than the other and we take that if not possible we abstain we stop and say I do not know how to combine these conflicting evidences but I believe that there are scholars who know I wait until they tell me and this is a sign of respect to the evidences that are conflicting I would not accuse my mind and say these evidences are wrong I will not accuse these evidences I will accuse my mind and say that I am unable to understand how to combine between them we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back la sala tell him Allah meeya club' OB al khattab there is no prayer for those who do not recite the fatiha so what is the ruling on reciting the fatiha as stated before it is a pillar of prayer for those who are leading the Imam and for those who are praying andhe visually on their own but the scholars differed regarding the moon the one who is praying behind the Imam and the reason of their difference of opinion is the evidences we have on one hand we have this hadith la salat there is no prayer valid so they've applied this to all types of worshipers whether you are an individual Imam or a follower and they have another hadith those who say no you don't recite it such as the recitation of the Imam is a recitation to those behind him and another hadith or ayah that when the Quran is being recited you must listen to it and pay attention and a third hadith that both are using both parties is the hadith Abu Huraira may Allah be pleased with him that they prayed once with the prophet alayhi salatu salam a loud prayer and after the prophet erases i'm finished praying he said did you recite Quran with me and they said yes the Prophet said do not recite Quran except on milk eat up only the fat had nothing else and after that in the same hadith Abu Hurairah says and after a while the people were denied even that this is his exact words so some scholars say the people have been denied even that means that even Fatiha don't recite it so when you look at the conflicting evidences you don't know which one to follow that is why abu hanifa let me Allah have mercy on his soul a group of scholars saying that the moon does not recite anything whether it's a loud prayer or silent prayer because the Imams recitation is sufficient for him the other part or the other portion of scholars were led by imam al Buhari the compiler of zyre who wrote a chapter on this saying that it is mandatory for you to recite the fatiha in all records regardless of your status individual Imam or a follower and they kept on pulling and pushing each other until al imam IBN taymiyah may allah have mercy on his soul came and looked at all the evidences and he wrote a small book it is found in arabic i don't know if is translated into english is called a lil mam boishakh milkovo at eHealth an imam the acquiring of knowledge regarding the ruling of the recitation behind the imam and throughout his small booklet or research he concluded that in silent prayers it is a must that a follower recites the fatiha and if he doesn't his prayer is invalid so it is a pillar upon a person in silent prayers or in silent request as in the 3rd and the 4th raka of Asia for example or the 3rd raka of Maghrib these are silent records in loud prayers and he said that in loud prayers in the first and second Rockefeller Maghrib and Isha when the imam is reciting loudly he said it is recommended to recite the fatiha but it is not mandatory it is recommended because the hadith support this but it is not mandatory because of the hadith of a pariah when the Prophet said and the people were forbidden to do that afterwards and by this you apply all a hadith so Hadees like las olas element Lamia clock there is no prayer for those who do not recite the fatiha we understand it in the light of if your person is an imam if a person is an individual or if a person is a follower reciting a silent raka and the other hadiths we understand it to be in loud prayers where it is recommended but it is not mandatory and with this all evidences are being applied and inshallah this is the most authentic opinion of scholars however is it permissible for the imam to have a pause after reciting in the FATA and saying idol model body mullet balding I mean and he waits for 20 seconds 15 seconds so that the followers would recite the Fatiha no this is not permissible it is not part of the Sunnah the Prophet Allah so Sam never paused between the Fatiha and the surah he immediately recited the surah after the Fatiha without leaving a pause so if I were to recite the Fatiha if I wanted to recite it just to be on the safe side when do I recite it scholars say you can recite it when the Imam is not speaking so if the Imam is reading a surah and between the verses he has a short pause you the minute he finishes the I you say alhamdulillah I mean he goes on reciting an ayah he pauses you say al Rahman al Rahim or you read it and recite it even if he is reciting the Quran and this is an exception from Fayed aporia Quran first amia who answer to because it is to a number of scholars mandatory for you to recite the Fatiha if you want to recite it there is no problem but you have to do this either when the Imam pauses or when there is a possibility to recite it while the imam is reciting we take your questions if you have any yes brother question is related to hadeeth number 93 I have heard a ruling if a woman crosses in front of you while praying prayer is invalid is this woman mature or immature second is she non Meryem or any women regarding the passing of women in front of a worshipper does it void or nullify prayer or not we will come to this inshallah very soon so we will not address this issue whether it is a woman who reached the age of puberty or not definitely a young girl does not nullify your prayer whether she is a muharram or nun Muharram any woman nullifies your prayer if she passes in front of you but this we will come in shallow to explain a little bit into more details yes brother I want to ask that can we lose the eyes in Salah this is a good question what's the ruling on closing the eyes in salat scholars differed some say it's completely forbidden and prohibited because this is the doing of Sufis and others say no it's permissible because nothing to prevent it and the best answer would be if there is a need for it and it is not a custom that the person does every prayer it is permissible meaning if I'm praying and in front of me on this particular prayer there is a child who is dancing break dance and if I opened my eyes he's in front of me and I'm watching him I'm eight life I might do something so it is permissible because this is not the norm so it's an a separate incident not something that's every time taking place this is permissible if there is something that is distracting me but if it's every prayer and shape on comes to you and say you will not have kosher you will not have concentration until you close your eyes this was not done by our Prophet Isis am nor my companions so it would be considered an innovation Sheikh as I mentioned that the namaz is a lot is invalid if you don't recite Surat al-fatiha but in certain remote villages people are so illiterate forget about reading or writing they are not even in a position to memorize this as a result father so rather than reciting this a little further if they say some glorifying words about Allah little says one Allah alhamdulillah Allah Akbar is the Namas valid and acceptable to Allah if a person does not know Fatiha he has to memorize forms of glorification of Allah such as subhanAllah hamd allahu allah allahu allah allahu la quwwata illa billah as the Prophet has taught us is awesome but to say that in rural areas in remote villages people are so ignorant that they don't know the Fatiha the fact he does not take more than one day to learn so they must learn it if they do not learn it and they don't want to learn it their ferry is invalid and they're not considered to be Muslims but if a person is so illiterate so incapable of memorizing it and he says I tried it's been three years I've been trying to recite the fact I can't and Allah knows that he cannot in this case Allah so L would not burden a soul above its capacity or capability yet it's very difficult that people cannot memorize the fact I was very short very sweet very easy and allah azza wajal says well look at the eternal Quran Allah victory for Hal minimum decade Allah has made the Quran easy for those to recite and memorize etc under a man shake up world of narrations where it says that one of the sahabi he came and you know he got the Salah in the roku they were say that the one who gets the Roku has got the pillar or the raka so what is opening in that regarding subtle Fatiha a very good question the consensus of scholars is that if you enter the message and the Emam is in the state of rock or the Fatiha is not mandatory upon you why because of the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam that when any one of you come to the message and the imam is in the position of rock or he should offer the record as well and also in the hadith of abu bakr aisaka female Allah be pleased with him when he entered the Masjid and he found the Prophet Aslam bowing alongside with all the other companions so at the gates he said Allah Akbar and he bowed he didn't reset the feta and he walked bowing until he was in the role after the Prophet finished the prayer awesome he asked who did this Abu Bakr said I the Prophet said may Allah increase in your enthusiasm in your effort to follow the prayer but do not do it again I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
