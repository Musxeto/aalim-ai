  "title": "Do we get reward for reciting the Quran or must we know meaning as well to get reward- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "the second question from Fatima what does exactly is meant by reciting the Quran is it just reciting it or must we know the meanings of it well reciting the Quran is something that you are rewarded for whether you know the meaning or not so we recite Surat al-kahf every Friday we recite surat al-mulk before we go to bed and we know that this exempts us and saves us with the grace of Allah from the torment of the grave yet we may not know the meaning of it however we reward it for that but if you recite it while have studied the meaning of it and you know what it means this is far greater for your reward at the sight of allah azza wajal"
