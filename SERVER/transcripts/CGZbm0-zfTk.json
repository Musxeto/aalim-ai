  "transcript": "[Music] Al we move on to the book that deals with prayer as we finished most of the things that we need to know about purity so we are now in the state of Purity we know the conditions of Salah so we would like to be introduced to the book that deals with Salat and how to perform it the things related to it such as the times the type the format and the things that we're not supposed to do when we want to pray Hadith number 46 Hadith of mas may Allah be pleased with him and who would give us the honor to read it yes brother in Al bukari and Muslim on the authority of Abu Umar aani SAS said it has been reported to me by the one who lives in that house that I asked the messenger of Allah who who who is the one that lives in that house abdah abdah so this is one of the he's saying that this man living in this house who is Abdullah Mas so now the Hadith is abdah go ahead that I asked the messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam which deed is dearest to Allah he replied to offer Salah at the stated fixed time I asked what is the next in goodness he replied to be kind and obedient to your parents I asked what is the next in goodness to participate in Jihad in Allah's cause Abdullah added these were told to me by the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam and if I had asked more he would have told me more very well now this Hadith indicates to us that there are Deeds more preferred and loved by Allah than others and I believe this is clear so no one claims that all Deeds are alike As We Know That No One Believes that all sins are alike we have major sins we have minor sins we have sins that Allah would never forgive and we have sins that it is up to Allah to forgive or not to forgive and Abdullah Mas is one in so many companions may Allah be pleased with them all who would always approach the prophet wasam for knowledge so many hadiths we have companions coming to the prophet and say advise me tell me how I can be with you in Paradise tell me how I can do things that please Allah for example one comes to the prophet wasam and he tells him advise me and the prophet says do not become angry so he says advise me more and the prophet continues to say Do not become angry do not become angry do not get angry which means that this was the best advice to be given to that man can we carry this advice to someone who is a tolerant and patient person when he comes for advice no and that is why people come to the prophet Alam and say what is the best of Deeds he says to give money to the poor when you are in need why because the prophet he felt that this man is a little bit stingy he doesn't pay sodak when he went to Abdullah Mas Abdullah Mas asked what is the best Deeds the prophet said to pray on time others would the prophet answered them differently why because the prophet was answering people depending on their status so the first thing is and this is what we need the Hadith for in the chapter that deals with prayer the best Deeds at the side of Allah is to pray on time now does this come in line with our daily routine or not seriously do we pray on time as a priority I've seen so many practicing people and this happens a lot with those who are involved in this Dunya I've seen practicing people people with long beards mallah following the Sunnah when it comes to a business meeting they postpone the prayer with the JAMA I used to pass by them in the offices and say it's time for prayer we're going for Jama I go and pray and come back and they're still in the on their meeting tables and they're all Muslims so if I ask them why did you do this he said we had something to finish couldn't that thing wait for you so many people in their shops in their companies in their work they find it easy to waste half an hour or 45 minutes of the prayer time and to pray it later on are they following the Hadith of definitely not but they complain we have a lot of things to do we have lots of work to do it was reported once that a businessman in his mid 40s was supposed to pick up his father who in his mid 60s to take him somewhere so he gave him an appointment at 11:00 in the morning and that businessman went early morning to his company meetings after meeting doing this signing papers and without knowing he found out that he was late so he rushed to the car and went to his father's house being late a whole hour the father was waiting outside the door in the Sun and he was Furious the son came out and apologized I'm sorry W I didn't know the father did not accept his apology and said get into the car yes but I was I'm afraid get into the car and shut up so the businessman went behind the wheel the father came in he told him drive where to Father shut up and drive the man was intimidated he was afraid turned right go left straight ahead until they came to the graveyard and then the businessman thought this was his end he was really afraid and the father said get out of the car and walk where to walk and do not speak so the man walked until they were in the middle of the graveyard and then the father looked at his son and said look around you what do you see and the the man looked around him and did not see anything he said all of these dead people had anyone of them died after finishing all of his work or all of them died with work unfinished he said no they all died with work unfinished he said my son work never finishes but your life does so what is your priority if Salat is your priority you're in Paradise this this is a transitional period you live 60 years 70 years 100 years and then it's forever Paradise or forever in hell so what is your priority as a Muslim it is your prayer if you do not offer the prayer as Allah wants it on the time that Allah wants it in the place that Allah wants it then learn that what you're doing is all in vain I feel sorry for brothers who look to be practicing and ignore Salah in the Masid I've never seen people praying or careful to pray in the Masjid except those who we call deviant and Innovative those who have Innovations they pray in the Masjid masallah and usah no we have enough credit I think I can skip prayer in the mid for about 3 4 weeks and then I'll do something good and this this is wrong priority is for your prayer so this Hadith clearly explains it there is another narration by may Allah pleased with him that the prophet said the most preferred and loved Deeds to Allah is praying at the beginning of the time not on time at the beginning on time so the minute you hear the aan you pray of course with the exception of AA prayer which we will come to discuss that the Sunnah is to delay it when this is possible the second thing is to honor your parents and honoring them means to obey them and to respect them and you will find in so many places in the Quran where Allah follows the instruction of worshiping him alone by obeying and honoring your parents and let us look at the Muslims nowadays how do they treat the parents I know and I've seen this a lot that people are disrespectful to their parents and by Allah any Muslim who is disrespectful to his parents he is not considered to be a good Muslim he's one of the worst Muslims Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him and this Hadith is in of bukari he saw a man walking with another man so he spoke to the young younger one and he said who's this he said he's my father said ah if he's your father never walk in front of him and never sit before him and never call him by his name now do we have children like this yes we do but we have a lot of children who do not care about this You' find people walking in front of their fathers going into to the shop before their father instead of respecting the father and letting him first many times you find the father and his son going into the house the first thing the son does is lie on the couch and not only that when we get guests coming to visit us what would the sun do would sit like a guest instead of going and pouring the coffee and giving the tea and doing the hospitality now he's sitting with a guest I'm the father is the one who's doing the job and do not call him by his name W I've seen this live in front of me people calling their father his father's name is Abdullah he says Abdullah why are you doing this Abdullah is his father and even worse some of them would call him old man so when he talks to his father says old man you shouldn't do this maybe you'll hurt yourself this is the greatest sin that a person could do to his parents I believe we have a break so stay tuned inshallah we'll be right [Music] back Salam alaykum and welcome back and the third part of the Hadith is to fight in the cause of Allah and to fight in the cause of Allah as we know this is known as Jihad and this is done when only we have an Islamic flag an Islamic Army an Islamic ruler we cannot have skirmishes here and there anyone going and said I'm going to do Jihad today I'm going to do this I'm going to do that no it has to be properly organized and under the ruler of a country or a region and it should be Islamic not to terrorize people not to spread chaos and mayh have in the world to defend what is virtuous to defend rightness to defend your own country and your own life this is inshallah part of the Jihad that is permissible we move on to the following Hadith Hadith 47 do we have any questions by the way okay 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 let's take your questions and see what can be entertained if a person is traveling through a desert and he he doesn't finds order so he performs AUM and praise praise His Salah and then he moves forward and he finds water so he should do ab Evolution and then perform Salah again or not that's a very good question regarding T if a person is stranded in the desert and he does not find water to perform Evolution can he perform tum he can if he may made all his efforts to look for water and was unable to find it so if he exerted all the effort and he did his best and water was unavailable and it's time for the second prayer to come in this case we tell him yes perform ation dry ation and pray after he finished prayer one minute afterwards he found water or it trained what do we say to him we tell him do not do anything you pray was valid your prayer was correct because you did what Allah instructed you to do it and Allah does not oblige you to pray the prayer twice but this is in the case of a person who exerted all the effort he has he did everything he can but if a person is lazy say yeah I know I have to drive 10 minutes to get water there I don't want to I just want to make and pray his prayer is invalid he has to go and get and fetch water any question many of the non-muslims have heard they have the argument that women are not giving rights because they're not allowed to enter the MOs when they're in the state of menes so how will we logically prove them why they're not allowed of such thing because they're not equal or not given proper rights as men because men are allowed to enter the mosque no no no no this this allegation that equality is not there because they're forbidden from entering the Masjid while they're in the menses would be also cascaded when they object that why can't we pray why can't we offer fasting while in the state of mensis so what do we say okay pray okay fast no we tell them that this is Allah's command to you when you have your mensis you do not pray if you do your sinful when you have your mes you do not fast if you do it's not accepted and likewise when you have your Mage do not enter the Masjid so it is the Commandment of the prophet of Allah and we do not have the logic to talk to them because Islam is not built on yours and mine logic that is Islam is built on submission on acceptance if someone comes to me and says why is it that we go anticlockwise around the Kaa I'd like to go clockwise what do I I say well this is how we were taught but this is not logical we can save much time by having different rotations we have to comply with the Quran and Sunnah and we do not go out of our way to explain it to people this is our religion love it or leave it this is up to them that the Jews in Madina they used to seclude their wives and they used to keep their wives during menes so when not the Jew practicing the law of Torah tat maybe uh during that time and if they are not practicing the law of t or maybe whatever the traces of scriptures available with them okay first of all we have to know that the Jews are not definitely following the law of the Torah neither the Christians and that is why Islam was introduced because they have deviated from the authentic revelation of the Torah and of the injil and they added things and they've changed things and they've inserted things that are not related to their religion however what does their religion say about women in menus I do not know because I'm not a scholar in their religion or in their books I know that the Hadith our Hadith tells us I'm taking my knowledge from my references that the prophet when he went there this was the practice of the Jews whether it was fabricated from their own minds and they felt that like a lot of us you know not a lot of some of us may think that I don't want to see my wife so what's the best thing to do oh you're mes get out go to your father's house maybe this is how they felt about their wives so they thought it was a good excuse to kick them out and to take one week off maybe but I cannot say that it's part of their teachings of the religion or not this is how the Muslims found them treating their wives and that is why the origin of this Hadith is from yes brother shik as you said that uh women are not forbidden to enter a a mosque while she is in her menes so we also know that Prophet sallam said that to AA that perform the Safa in Mar now the Safa and Mara is in the boundaries of the Masjid so what is the correct would you please explain okay the saf and the marwa was not part of the Masjid at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam and that is why the the majority of Scholars say that a woman in her menis may stay in the saf and Mar but she may not enter the Masjid where the TA is and up till today if you go to the Safa and Mara you'll find that there's a very big fence a high wall separating the saf and marwa from the Masid though it has another wall separating the saf and from the exterior of the Masjid but there is remains a wall dividing the Safa and marwa from the Masjid and that is why the majority of Scholars say that it remains to be outside of the borders of the Masjid yes brother Jihad in popular meaning most common meaning is fighting in the cause of Allah Jihad yes the most popular meaning is fighting in the actual fighting in the cause of Allah is that the only meaning of jihad no Jihad has a number of meanings linguistically it's to struggle anything you do that involves an effort or struggling it's called Jihad Allah says in the last verse ofah those who struggle in our cause Allah will guide them so any type of struggle in trying to identify what pleases Allah in learning knowledge Allah will guide you and Jihad mainly refers to the fight in the cause of Allah so if there's an oppression if there's an army attacking you you give them Jihad you defend yourself nobody tells you to sit like a limping duck and allow them to conquer your country and to humilate your people you have to defend yourself not only that Jihad is also considered to be part of jihad when you fight those who construct a barrier for the word of Allah not to reach them but again this is not individual Jihad this is Jihad of the state so as we have super countries invading countries for their oil or for their fortune or for their minerals or for political gain in Islam we don't have this the only means of jihad is to convey the message of Allah to give the people freedom to know the religion of Allah if they were prevented from doing this peacefully and this is not an individual effort this is an effort of the states of the countries the Muslim countries so if the Muslim count are not doing it then there is not such a thing as Jihad last question and then quickly please uh the question is related somewhat uh to the last question that is Jihad now like uh Jihad is as you said to struggle to strive but what if uh some of our brothers they exceed the limit for example they don't sleep or they cross the limit they are harming their body or they're not taking proper meals and they say that we are doing Jihad we are doing Jihad for the sake of Allah so is it justified in Islam no this is not part of the Jihad for the sake of Allah because harming yourself is Haram Jihad can be attributed to a number of things Jihad against the enemies of Islam Jihad against the Hypocrites by exposing them Jihad against the Sinners by telling them that this is wrong and forbidding them from doing it Jihad against shatan who continuously comes and attacks you and Jihad against yourself against your own desires so don't only limit Jihad to fighting though it is the greatest Branch but it is also considered to be part of the other branches as well and fighting your desires when you want to show off or want to extremely force yourself for things that Allah tells you is not mandatory you don't have to do this this is extremism and this ISU that the prophet forbade us from doing I'm prid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music]"
