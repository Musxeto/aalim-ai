  "transcript": "Amar from the UK may Allah you good health and you as well um she my question is um um I'm studying right now and I have some friends in the uni they're Muslim and they're good practicing but there's one big issue they don't talk they don't talk nicely about the scholars from the Arab countries like from Saudi they don't like them or if I talk any if I give any fatwa or if I share any information from for example or all of them like if I talk about them they don't like it so they take they talk ill about them and I it hurts me and and I don't like it and if I try to Def defend them they label me as um this they say bad things so my question is what should I what should my stand be like should I stop talking to them should I I tried to explain I tried explaining them a lot of time and the the consequence of like slandering someone without any knowledge but it doesn't they don't understand I don't know what to do sh what should I do with them like first of all uh um Amar first of all I don't have to approve of what Scholars of Saudi Arabia say or Scholars of Egypt or Scholars of uh Jordan or Kuwait say it's not the region that counts it's the knowledge that they carry so if someone you shared the fatwa of and he didn't like the fatwa this is his preference we have no problem with that the problem is when they speak ill about the scholars this is a sign of deviant people unless they can prove what they're talking about and bring evidence to back it up then they are slandering great righteous Pious Scholars of all times and are well known and they don't need people's recommendation their work the fruit of their lectures and and and knowledge is apparent to Blind Men let alone those who have intellect or logic so the moment they start to slunder Scholars of such a caliber most likely if you even bring rulers of Muslim countries they will slunder them so this is a treat of and they would not leave you without labeling you so I would highly recommend that you simply avoid such friends because they're bad news they're deviant they have no knowledge and they have black hearts and they won't rest until they make your heart as black as theirs by such slandering and Ill talk so avoid them and look for people who follow the Quran and the Sunnah and who are known to be righteous and God-fearing and this is best for your duny and for your as well"
