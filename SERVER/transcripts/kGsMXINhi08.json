  "title": "Is it possible to know who has done black magic on you? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "cigar says Oh Sahar is it possible to know who has done black magic on you there isn't to my knowledge any machine or a device that you can hook up in a patient and it tells you that reading and analyzes the system that this man has like free agent possession one male to females and three of them are Jews and it cannot tell you that you have evil eye or envy and it cannot tell you that you have black magic done for you in Transylvania in Romania for example or whatever this is there isn't anything like this to my knowledge so the only way that you can know that you have black magic on you one is by angels coming and telling you as happened to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and of course after the Prophet is a dead sallallahu Salem angels don't come to us and tell us anything the second way is that a person claims to know the future or his jinn ask him to worship it and he does and they sneak and leak some information about what had happened to that person and this is shirk seeking the help of jinn and claiming that you can unveil what is unseen to you this is shirk so nowadays you cannot and you don't need to so many people have cut their kinship severed their kinship with their uncles with their siblings somewhat even their parents because they went to a soothsayer and they told them that your father did this your mother did that your cousin etc and they believed that and this is totally prohibited it renders your prayer of 40 days unaccepted you just go for the fun of it but if you believe what they're saying to be the truth this nullifies your Islam totally may allah azzawajal protect us all"
