  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do on I feel how nice it is to be so NE to those I love oh dear brothers and sisters in Islam we move on to Hadith number three in the chapter that deals with fasting in the Great Book of Al and this Hadith was narrated by I Omar may Allah be pleased with him IB Omar says I heard the messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam say start fasting after you have seen it that is the new Crescent and end the fast at the end of the month when you see it if it is overcast and not be seen then estimate its sighting that is presume that shahan lasted for 30 days and this Hadith is agreed upon and the following Hadith Hadith number four Al bukari reported on the authority of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him complete the days of shaan as 30 days and this of course is a to the Prophet The Prophet says complete the days of shahan as 30 days now what do we learn and understand from these two beautiful hadiths the first Hadith the prophet Alat wasam is instructing us he is telling us he says start fasting after you have seen it and end the fast when you see it what is it in both phrases well the first one is the Crescent that initiates the birth of the new moon which is an indication of the beginning of Ramadan and the last it is the new Crescent that tells us that the month of Ramadan is over and the month of shaah has begun so from this we understand that the prophet Alat wasam is instructing the Muslims to fast Ramadan and to end fast of the month of Ramadan by observing the crescent and this is one of the ways of detecting whether the month has finished or not the other way is when the prophet saidat if it is overcast and cannot be seen meaning that if there is clouds in the skies and you cannot detect the crescent and you cannot see it in this case the prophet saysat wasam then estimate its sighting meaning that by conclusion the following day is part of shahan and that is why the prophet said in the Hadith of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him complete the days of shaan as 30 days and this explains it totally and completely that 29 days of shaan we try to detect the new uh uh Moon and if this is not possible then by default tomorrow is considered to be the 30th of shaan and if you look at the Hadith the prophet saysat wasam in the Hadith fast he says start fasting now who is he addressing in this Hadith is he addressing me and you is he addressing the Muslim thats yes yes but then we have a problem because personally I didn't site the moon at the end of uh shaan so am I addressed with this or is this for the whole umah and whoever comes forward and testifies this does the job for the rest in Islam we depend on Witnesses and if we have witnesses then this this gives us the knowledge that an event had taken place I didn't see someone kill someone but if two men came and testified that he the as salent killed the victim then I will testify as well because I take their word for granted and this is what the judge does he does not have to be in every crime scene as long as two trustworthy adults males Muslims testified then this does the job so the prophet when he saysat fast or start fasting when you see it this does not mean each and every one of us it means that this is a communal obligation if one does it then this is sufficient and there is a difference of opinion among Scholars whether one is sufficient to site the moon or two and we will come to discuss this later on inshallah now in the Hadith the prophet saysat that you either site the moon or you complete the month and we don't have a third option so the month is either 29 days or 30 days and how would it be 29 days by citing the moon and if seen and cited the then the following day is the beginning of the new month this is how we know that it is 29 days but if the moon was not cited or if there were clouds if there were dust if there were something to prevent us from detecting or seeing or observing or sighting the moon in this case we by default have to finish the month to be 30 days what about astronomist astronomers who come and say and do their calculation and say that through measuring and through our physics and uh uh astronomy Sciences we can predict and know for certain that the new born uh new uh uh uh Moon would be born on that particular night and that it is impossible to be born tonight for example or something like that now is this applicable because Islam supports science Islam is a religion of Science and no one can contradict or object to this where the church used to abuse torture and kill those who advocated science Islam on the contrary encouraged those who were scientists and who uh uh produced things and Sciences that would benefit the whole of humanity so if Islam supports science how is it not taking the statements and the verdicts of astronomers when it comes to detecting the moon where it's very simple because this is part of the religion and in Islam Simplicity as I mentioned yesterday if you remember Islam is based on Simplicity it's not something that is complicated and that is why when you look at the calculations of astronomers only a handful of people know it around the world it's not for anyone you have to be specialized in this field not only that even those who are specialized in the field they contradict with one another at times so one says yes it's possible to be cited one says no it's not possible so Islam does not limit such important knowledge at only uh the hands of a handful of people and their allegation nowadays for those who want to introduce the calculations of astronomers into citing the moon and detecting when the month begins or ends their claim and justification is that we would like to unite the umah and uniting the ummah does not happen through going against the Sunnah the prophet Alat wasam is the one who told us to site the moon though they had astronomers at his time and their calculations were precise and and good but Islam does not want to limit this privilege in the hands of few and Islam made it open to all of the Muslims to come and detect it and therefore we cannot uh um depend on them and we cannot use them as means of detecting or knowing when the month begins or when the month ends now when it comes to the issue of unity Unity is sought after but not through means that go against the Sunnah of the prophet and never ever in the past 14 centuries had the Muslim ever celebrated the same feasts all together because this is not possible as we do not pray at the same time because the sun rises and sets differently in different countries likewise the issue of the moon sighting should and must differ from one area to another and that is why the prophet saidat that you begin fasting when you see it and you end your fasting when you see it and those who are in Indonesia for example if they cited the Crescent we cannot tell the people in uh the US to fast because they did not site the moon themselves and this you needs a lot of um contemplation and a lot of reasoning to know that islamically this is totally out of the question to depend or to rely on the calculations of astronomers it's either by citing and observing uh uh the moon or by uh completing the month to be 30 days we move on to Hadith number five and also to Hadith number six Hadith number five is narrated by Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him Abdullah Omar says the people were trying to site the new moon of Ramadan and when I reported to the prophet of Allah sallallah alaih Al wasallam that I had seen it he fasted and commanded people to fast this is the first Hadith the second Hadith the Hadith that follows is the Hadith of IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father this is Hadith number six a bedwin came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and said I have cited the Crescent of Ramadan he then said to him do you testify that there is none worthy of worship but Allah the bedwin said yes then the prophet Alam asked him again do you testify that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam and the man replied yes the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam there there upon said oh B announce to the people to start fasting tomorrow now these two hadiths deal with the issue of citing the new moon Hadith of Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him tells us that he had seen the crescent and reported it to the authorities he went to the prophet Alam and told him I saw it so the prophet Alam immediately fasted the following day and ordered the people to fast which means that he accepted the testimony of one individual in the Hadith we learn that one is sufficient to announce the beginning of Ramadan however there are other hadiths that state that for ending the month of Ramadan two testimonies are needed so the you need two witnesses to come forward and say Ramadan is over we had cited the new Crescent of sha the following month that comes after Ramadan so from Hadith may Allah be pleased with him we understand that one testimony is Enough from the other Hadith of the bedwin we understand something else we understand that the person who testifies of seeing the new Crescent has to be a Muslim therefore if we get 10 non-muslims all confirming that they've cited the new Crescent this would not do the job if we get 100 this would not do the job there has to be a Muslim among them who confirms citing the moon why is that because this is something that is religious this is an Islamic thing this is a form of worship it is like calling the aan if a child calls the aan this is okay as long as he's calling it on time if an adult does that no problem if a non-muslim does that this is a problem this is not acceptable it's not valid so everyone has his field everyone has his duties and responsibilities and and it cannot be mixed what about if a woman cites the moon would that be appropriate and and acceptable the answer is yes because there's nothing to prevent that any woman a man can do the job and one would say why do you segregate then said well this is the segregation and and issues of testimony is well established because Allah mentions when it comes to registering debts in the longest verse in the Quran that it is recommended that we bring two male witnesses to witness the writing of the debt and if there were no two males then a man and two females where two females would take the place of a man so this is some of the things that Islam has had made a segregation in between man and woman so not always but in some cases a woman is half of the man and this is found in four or five places in Islam for example in testimony it you need one man in in Return of two women in the issue of debts but in other issues a man does not do the job in suckling in uh the issues of virginity of giving birth Etc a man does not qualify only a woman would do the job so in issues of testimony you need one man and two women in issues of when you slaughter a sheep for a newborn you Slaughter two sheep for a baby a boy and one sheep for a baby girl in the issue of inheritance for The Offspring a a male gets twice a female in the case of offsprings in the case of um setting a slave free if you set a male slave free Allah would save each limb of yours from Hell in the return of his liims but if you free two female slaves then Allah would do the same so the reward is uh uh different and and maybe there are things that are more I do not remember them now but this is what uh comes to mind um yeah the thing I forgot the fifth thing is the blood money so the blood Money of a person who kills a female by mistake is half what he pays if he killed a male by mistake so these are the five issues that uh mentioned long time ago now the Hadith ofar is clear the Hadith of the bedwin of the Prophet Prophet asking him is also clear however the Hadith of the bedwin IM albani may Allah have mercy his soul U did not authenticate it he graded it as weak and some Scholars said that it is Mel and a lot of Scholars authenticated it and that is why schols are applying this Hadith and they're using it because there are other evidences that support it among them is the Hadi ofar may Allah be pleased with him testifying that he saw the moon and the prophet fasted in accordance to to his uh uh testimony and what is the meaning ofi is a Hadith where the chain of narrators are all complete are all fine and good but the issue is between the prophet and the tab we don't have the link which is the companion's name so whenever the such as such as H alas any of these great those who had seen the companions but did not see the prophet Alam they are the second generation whenever they say the Prophet saidat this Hadith is graded as M why because we don't know whether he heard it from a companion or he heard it from another tab like himself if he heard it from a companion then we have no uh uh uh uh beef with that no problem because the companions are all trustworthy so whatever is reported from them whether we know their name or not as long as they are or as long as he is a companion we take the Hadith to be authentic so this Hadith as stated earlier is accepted by a number of Scholars so inshallah we can uh apply it now the phet saidat begin fasting when you see it what happens if one person saw it while the rest didn't in this case we have to analyze if he's alone in the desert if he's a bedwin or a traveler and he looks and he sees the Crescent he has to fast the following day what about if he is in a city or in the village in this case he has to report this to the Muslim judge or to the ruler of the country and announce his testimony what about if they rejected it I got an email from a place in India a few days ago where they said that in my locality the Muslim judge said that shahan is 30 days and we will not fast on Saturday but one of the scholars was flying in at night and he cited the Moon while he was on the plane so when the plane landed he went and announced his testimony to the judge and the judge did not accept it so what to do so this is a practical case in the case of the brother who saw the Crescent some Scholars say he has to fast on his own even if the whole community did not fast he's obliged to fast because he had seen it some Scholars say no h means that something that is so obvious and apparent that people can see all the people can see and therefore as long as it is not something that has been or is been practiced by everyone and they started to fast he should not fast on his own he should be with the flock he should be with the community and therefore for this brother he should not fast that day and he should obey the Muslim judge and follow his verdict one would say why would the judge reject his testimony I personally don't know maybe the judge knows something we do not know and maybe because the judge tried to look among the other people who went out and could not site the moon so they would rather doubt this brother's testimony because he might have done a mistake I don't know the circumstances nevertheless what I know is that we should follow the Muslim ruler or the Islamic judge and we should unite now what about the different uh means of citing the moon so calculations of astronomers we have agreed this is not possible and inapplicable in Islam what about the prophet when he says begin fasting when you see it how about if I try to detect it by looking through binoculars and magnifying lenses say would this be uh uh uh okay or this would be defying the purpose the answer is no this is completely acceptable because you've used your eyes you've used your sight through these magnifying glasses to detect what is there so you have seen it as the prophet Alam uh uh ordered you to do and there's nothing wrong in that okay what about the issue of difference of opinion can we fast in accordance to one sighting anywhere in the Muslim world this is a valid opinion of Scholars though it is not the most recommended or authentic but this is a valid opinion it's it's an issue ofad so people in the UK If the community there said that we are unable all year around to detect the Crescent so whenever they detect or observe the uh Crescent in Saudi Arabia we follow them this is a a valid opinion if someone says okay if they've seen it in Indonesia we will follow them if they've seen it in Morocco we follow them this is a valid opinion if all these Muslim countries were under the ruling of a Muslim ruler but unfortunately with the segregation we have the different countries and the different imams and the different rulers they don't seem to follow each other and the most authentic opinion would be that each ruler who rules a country or an area he's responsible for citing the moon in his area so if the Imam says tomorrow is Ramadan you have to comply and if he says we will go site the moon then you have to comply if he goes and say we would like to uh um designate the the beginning of the month through the calculations of astronomers you have to comply because you are under his Reign and it is his responsibility so the most authentic opinion is that each region has its own sighting and we cannot force a region over the other and definitely we cannot unify the whole of the globe on one particular side because as they all break their fast differently from one region to the other depending on the sunset which is daily going basis likewise the beginning of the month is monthly uh uh changing and each region has its own sighting we have a short break stay tuned and after the break I will begin taking your calls and answering your questions with the grace of Allah so don't go anywhere asalamu alaykum and welcome back abdurahman has a question he says I divorced my wife on the order of my mom right now my wife is staying with her parents observing her her reason is that my in-laws go to Sorcerers and succeeded in making my wife have control over me that I only do what they want me to do now I want to take back my wife but my mom says if I take her back she will disown me and will never step in my house again she will always or she uh will also order my siblings to stay away from me please advise me to uh what to do first of all ABD you have made a major sin by divorcing your wife because your mother ordered you to do you are a man and you should not be your mommy's boy and whatever she tells you you do without thinking or without seeking whether this pleases Allah or angers Allah the prophet says obedience is only in things that are things that are a legitimate and acceptable and not harming others and what you had done was uh uh very wrong you justifying it because she STS and claims that her parents go to Sorcerers and that they've casted a spell on you so that they can control you and if this was the case you would not have divorcer if you had a spell on you so you have done a a big mistake by uh listening to your mother and even if her parents do go to uh uh Sorcerers if the woman is a righteous woman if she is a good and loving and caring woman why would you uh um divorce her because of the sins of her parents you should not be uh unfair now taking her back is you're right and if your mother tells you that she will never step in your house if you get her back though you know and acknowledge the fact that your wife is a good righteous woman and she did not do anything wrong towards your mother and your mother is the transgressor in this case get your wife back and if your mother doesn't enter your house or does not talk to you this is her problem she will deal with allaha and Allah would punish her for that and if your siblings also obey her and and bycott you and and and cut off uh uh links and connections with you they are sinful as well and they will be punished by Allah and Allah Asel knows best we have Mali from Saudi Salam alikum I have two questions my first question is my daughter is coming of age and I keep telling her now she should get married and she keeps telling me Mom don't you have faith in God when the time comes um it'll happen but I as a mother feel uh that it's my duty to keep on her to you know meet up and see these boys and when I say see these boys meaning recommended by the parents um somehow the it's not happening so should I just leave it on God or should I keep pursuing her okay that's one question okay second question the second question is my husband uh had a with his mother he didn't have a very good relationship like he always tried his best but since a very small age he went to a hostel and joined um the forces and he's been aw and the mother has always uh been very close to the elder brother and um he tried his best to make her happy meet her but she wouldn't meet him very happily she just died a few months back and before she died um he was called and he went and alhamdulillah she died in his arms he was the only one there and myself when she died so he always has this feeling that will will God forgive him for that or has he done something wrong whereas he's always tried his best to please his mom okay so could you answer these questions please inshallah thank you very much you're welcome Adnan from Saudi Arabia I had two questions one is my one cousin he told that in one Hadith he didn't tell me the reference from where he got it that once um mam he asked Allah Allah I can I have the ability to talk to you and is there anyone um more nearer than me to you then U Allah said yes um after sometime they will come a nation when they will Fast there will they will be hungry and thirsty um then when they will break their they will be more closer than you to me um the distance between you and me me Mam and Allah is 70 curtains or 70 folds but after the time of them and me will be just less than one fold so is that is that Hadith correct and the second um in my school our teacher in the morning assembly we always uh he always tells to recite Al faat so when we recited he just he takes the mic and tells all the students to raise their hands while reciting Alat then when the recitation is finished he again take the mic and tell them to say mean loudly so is that also correct thank you I Mal from Saudi Arabia she says that she has a daughter and she always insist on her daughter to uh follow and pursue the issue of marriage and as I understood from the subcontinent it's the other way around it is the parents of the girl who keep on looking for proposals and sending proposals in Arabia it's the other way around it's is the men and their parents who go and seek after uh a proposal a woman in marriage not the other way around and this is the way it should be a woman should be with her dignity in her dignity and and being sought after by uh uh proposals not her going and and and seeking uh proposals though though this is applicable and and yeah permissible Omar may Allah be pleased with him when ha uh uh her husband died uh she was there and available Omar himself went to Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him and he uh uh told him about haa if he's interested in marrying her he went to who was widowed as well and he asked him if he's interested until the prophet came himself and married her so there is nothing wrong in that uh pursuing proposals and and sending uh a proposal this is inallah permissible but as she said that everything is on Allah whether now or after so if something comes and it's suitable yes I don't think she's gonna uh uh reject it but to have it as an obsession and uh to have it as uh the job description looking for spouses this would maybe be a little bit irritating so let it be inshallah try your level best to look for proposals and inshallah Allah will send you a suitable one uh from the Emirates yeah actually I have done H and later as I joined my further studies I got a little imperfect in it I forgot it and now I'm not perfectly in it I mean if anyone ask me from where I mean from any worse I won't be able to answer them so do I get the position of a half or I can I call myself a Haas and what are the punishments for such a person who forgets the Quran okay any more questions Mal's second question was that her H her husband wasn't at very good terms terms with his W with his mother not that he was abusive or disobedient but they didn't have the bond of a mother and child uh the affection the love due to his travel due to his distance due his to his work but lately he alhamdulillah got very close to her and she died uh in his arms and she was very pleased and happy with him so he's asking um is he sinful I don't know if he did any s she didn't say any specific sins that he said or raised his voice or hit her or did anything wrong but if he didn't then inshallah there is nothing on him and and the Deeds are judged by the conclusion so if you like for 20 years you're bad and in the last year you started praying and repenting and asking Allah forgiveness and you die Allah would erase the whole of the 20 years for that uh last year we have naah from I have two questions can I ask you yes the first question is can we pray if the first Jama is done can we pray again a second J in the same mid this the first question and the second one uh is it okay I think we've lost brother Naf got his first question so I hope he calls again for his second question uh Adan from Saudi Arabia says is there a Hadith of Musa and uh talking to Allah and the umah that will come that Allah would remove the 70,000 veils and talk to them uh directly the Hadith is fabricated it has no origin none whatsoever uh his uh second question is that the teacher uh asks them instructs them to recite uh the fa in the beginning of the school day and before we go to the answer I will take bahin Amin from bahin hello she I have one question yes uh in the morning before F aan if we are eating or drinking and as soon as we are aan can we still keep drinking water till the aan is over or should we stop at the first Allah abbar okay I answer your question inshallah thank you so uh adan's question the the teacher instructs them to recite the fa in congregation loudly while raising their hands and at the end he orders them to say a mean this is an innovation this is a clearcut Innovation and one should not do this and you should advise a teacher that it is not permissible to do it and if he does not want to listen to you don't comply because this this is a and we cannot allow B to be spread one would say what's the harm in in reciting it it's not an issue what's the harm did the prophet do it did he instruct us to do it did he instruct us to do it if not then it's an innovation and whoever innovates in the religion of Allah is rejected as the of Muslim and elsewhere where the Prophet warns us from Innovation besides Alat is never recited as it is not part of thear which we do in the morning or in the evening it is part of yes a means of healing and treatment yes but you do not recite it whenever you wish so they say okay we are making a marriage contract I give you my daughter in marriage he says I accept her marriage okay let's recite the faat why it's blessing the marriage hm that's strange and also when someone dies said oh so and so died okay let's just recite the faat for his memory so when people marry or when they die they recite the fa as if marriage is their sudden death this is all Innovation and it should not be practiced uh at all and you should advise your teacher uh we have Abdul from Lebanon is it Libya from Libya Abdul W yes I have this question regarding this Ramadan mhm and my work is very very difficult for me to be working at the same time and be fasting so I just want to know whether I can be fasting time and time so that I can be working I'm not able to understand you okay I think my work is very very difficult for me to be fasting at the same time and be working at the same time as you're working h no it is difficult for me to be fasting yes and be working at the same time I I the second phrase I did not understand it is very difficult for you to be fasting and to be waiting at the same time what is wetting working working at the same time I have no idea what are you referring to a like my work is very difficult difficult for me to be working or to fasting at the same time to be working I don't know send me an email uh my friend and I will try my level best to answer you inshallah because I'm unable to understand your question UHA from Saudi okay I think R okay don't think we have r on the line soia from the Emirates says that she started memorizing the Quran and she was very good at it but now her her yeah Perfection is not as good and sometimes she fails to know where this verse in what Surah she may not complete the verses uh correctly so would she be sinful for that the answer is no there's no sin on her inshallah would be she be considered a well depends see people who are may need to revise before they recite the Quran so you don't have 100% who are like a computer whenever you ask them answer no they have to revise it on and on day by day so if this is the case inshallah uh uh you are among those and try to revise it as much as you can Asia from Nigeria um my question is I want to get married but um I don't know the prayers that I will do for God to answer my prayers for me okay so I don't know if you can help me with any prayers I can do okay I will do that insh thank you you're welcome na Froman says that what is the ruling before he was disconnected what is the ruling on the second J in the Masid and the origin of his question is the well-known opinion of albani may Allah have mercy on his soul where he says that um the second Jama the second congregation in the Masjid is not permissible and he quotes a Hadith from Abdullah Mas and anas if I'm not mistaken that they used to pray alone in the Masjid if the congregation was over but the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of the majority of Scholars that it is permissible to pray a second Jama and the Hadith of the Prophet wasam when he prayed fer and he saw a man after the prayer was uh over coming alone and he didn't have anyone to pray with he told the companions who would go and give charity to him meaning to join him in a so this is permissible inshallah uh Amin from Algeria yes listen to me from the phone and mute your uh TV please sorry um I just want to confirm something brother yes I mean I have a brother a Muslim and he wants to get married to a Christian I don't know if Islam said that I really want to know okay I would answer your question inshallah uh a me from Bahrain uh he says that what is the ruling on eating while the aan is going on so if we start to eat our pre-dawn meal and drink before the Adan and all of a sudden the Adan says allahar what to do you have to refrain from eating as long as you know that the IM or the MU gives the aan on time you have to refrain from eating but if you had a glass or a container of juice water whatever something that is drinkable of course Halal uh if you have something in your hand and you hear the aan the prophet gave you the permission to keep on drinking until you're satisfied so even if you this takes you like 30 seconds and a minute and thean is going on you're just sipping bit by bit there's no problem with that inshallah because this is a the permission from the prophet in the Hadith that was reported by Alim in his uh mustra uh we have uh hea from Kuwait Alum allum Salam it's h from KU uh she I need to ask you a question regarding uh okay if a parent is abusive like the father is is abusive towards the mother what is the uh Islamic ruling on that uh I mean if you're watching your mother getting abused from your father for 35 years and then you ask him to stop that uh how should we do that and if you do that the father is like um he's uh exploiting Islam in that name and telling you that you're the kid and you cannot talk about it and you cannot stop me and if you do that you're being like um disobedient so what should the child do in that case okay I will answer your question inshallah what's that Asia from Nigeria she says that she's single and she wants to get married are there any supplications well we pray to Allah the almighty in this blessed month of Ramadan that he committed the major sin by abusing a father disobeying him and maybe hitting him at times Choice number two you may try to intervene diplomatically but this some sometimes would not work so many times I've seen similar cases and the child is lost and being stepped on because the father is abusing the mother shouting and screaming he stands up uh in his face and tries to defend them and the father takes a stand and the father is negative from his son or from his daughter and half an hour later they kiss and make up the mother and the father and they're having fun and they're enjoying their life but what you've done is still at the back of the mind of your father so what to do be diplomatic don't get involved try to give advice in a very nice and and and mannerful way try to see if your mother is doing something wrong tell her to improve tell her to stop nagging to stop doing the things that provoke his anger and tell him about the great rewards that Allah gives to those who uh uh suppress their anger maybe this would work shamim did not pray and fast and now alhamdulillah Allah guided him he's asking what are the benefits and the virtues of Charity of sodak there are countless among them one Allah would increase your provision two Allah would prevent calamities from falling on you and your family Allah will protect you he says yes but my my son has a fever of 40 uh uh degrees said yes but because you pay charity it is 40° he should have he should have died because of his illness but because of your charity Allah reduced it to this with Charity you make Allah's anger extinguished and with the charity you extinguish the sins that you have as in the Hadith of the Prophet with Charity Allah says the prophet says that a person is under the shade of his charity there are so many benefits and and virtues of Charity and it is one of the clearest evidences of your belief because you believe that Allah has given you the money and you believe that Allah would reproduce and uh compensate you for whatever you give that is why you give generously so the more you give the more evident and uh uh uh the more proof you are giving so that you believe in Allah asael and in what he has this is all the time we have until we meet next time while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start our we here tonight with family around the nice meal we're making do I feel how nice it is is to be so near to those I love whenever we think ofad all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can da"
