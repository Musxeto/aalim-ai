  "transcript": "reported that we used to pray with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the intense heat but when someone amongst us found it hard to place his forehead on the ground he spread his cloth and prostrated on it this hadith the author reported it because it's an issue of dispute whether it's permissible to have a barrier between your forehead and the ground and scholars differed a lot stating whether it is external or internal are you wearing it or it's on the ground whether it's this high or this low and they have a lot of comment on such an issue and the most authentic is that as long as that barrier is not considered by the people to be something extraordinary then it is permissible for example if you prostrate on your turban but you have a normal turban not like our brothers from sudan they have like 1 2 5 10 15 rounds and it's this big so if they prostrate on it actually they're not putting their forehead this is not permissible but if it's like this kofia or this rotra and it's very thin so it would not be considered as a barrier and it is permissible if a person prostrates on a carpet this is permissible but if he puts a pillow something that is higher than usual people would not be considering him to be prostrating on earth and that is why this is not permissible uh as well now we move on to hadith of anastas be pleased with him hadith 114 he says that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if one of you forgets a prayer let him offer the prayer when he remembers it as there is no expiation other than that he recited the verse and performed salat for my remembrance and in another narration for muslim whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps over it its expiation is to pray it as soon as he remembers it now this hadith we've spoken about before and it is essential that we mention the rulings regarding this hadith is the hadith authentic definitely yes it was reported in bukhari and muslim now what does it mean scholars differ the majority say if you skip a prayer intentionally you're sinful and you have to make it up as soon as possible others say that you make it up the following day so if you skip until after time was due you do not pray the hurt you wait until the following day when you pray the hurt you pray the yesterday with it and this is not of course acceptable at all because the hadith is not authentic and the hadith which is highly authentic with us states that you have to pray it as soon as you remember it and those who said that you can pray it even if you deliberately skipped it they have general a hadith to back their opinion up however this specific hadith is crystal clear that you cannot make up for a prayer you've missed intentionally unless you've missed it unintentionally for two reasons either you have forgotten or you have overslept one would say how would the person forget well i used to think this due to the fact that i am blessed by allah to live in saudi arabia which means that we pray all five prayers in the masjid and we rarely skip prayer in the message because masjids are everywhere so alhamdulillah it's a blessing from allah that we always pray every single prayer in the masjid once i was off-roading with my family and we spent answer prayer we prayed it we prayed maghrib and after maghrib we moved on back to our homes we reached there after asha prayer a couple hour drive and i showered and i got the stuff into the house at 10 30 or 11 o'clock i suddenly remembered that i'm used to praying where in the masjid suddenly i remembered it's 11 o'clock did i pray asha no i didn't because i was off-roading only then i understood how can a person forget a prayer because it is not your norm it is not your daily routine it changed and that is why you changed your prayers accordingly and immediately alhamdulillah i stood up and offered my aisha prayer another person can't forget by subhan allah being engaged at work sometimes you have a project you want to finish or you are in a hospital waiting for the doctor with a family member and the time for prayer is called and it's your appointment you can't skip because if you go and pray the appointment which is three or four months old will be gone you have to wait that long it's a necessity so you go to the doctor when he finishes you go back home so that you can pray home and by the time you reach home so many things happen you forgot that you did not pray and you remember maybe the same day maybe the following day so this happens the prophet tells us there is no expiation other than praying it on time or other than praying it as soon as you remember what is meant by there is no expiration did i make a sin scholars say no by forgetting or by sleeping did i sin allah says in the quran in the lust of surah al-baqarah don't burden us if we forget or make a mistake in sahih muslim allah says in the hadith i have done so meaning allah will not burden us so what is meant by there is no expiation other than that scholars say that there is no expiation for what you have done though it is not a sin but there is no expiation other than praying it on time such as feeding people or fasting few days or offering sacrifice there's no expiration it's expiration is to do what it's to pray on time and also you know that allah azzawajal says in the quran meaning that prayer has been set at a prescribed time and scholars say whenever allah prescribes something on a specific time whoever does it before or after the time intentionally his prayer or his form of worship is not accepted true the majority argued said no this is not true how do you dare we cannot make other if a person deliberately skips prayer he can pray it whenever he is capable of doing so he's sinful but allah accepts his prayer okay then we will tell them what is the condition of prayer they say one of the conditions is it is time for prayer so if i pray my prayer five minutes before the adhan is it valid can it be likewise if i pray it two minutes after its time runs over after islam runs out my prayer is invalid simple as that and this is the opinion of sheikh al-islam in tamiya and ibm has described this and discussed it thoroughly in his book and in other publications of his and also our shaykh may allah have mercy also supported this opinion strongly saying that whatever allah azzawajal prescribes in a particular time if you do it other than the time that it was prescribed for allah the almighty would not accept it hadith number 115 we need someone to read it for us reported said the night prayer with the messenger of allah may peace be upon him and then return to his people and then let them in this prayer okay the hadith of jabra abdullah ibn haram may allah be pleased with the man with his father he said that muhammad said the night prayer said it is not something that he has said said the prayer meaning that he prayed so this is one way of translating muad used to pray risha prayed with the prophet alaihis and then go to lead the prayer with his tribe with his people he would be praying and offering voluntary prayer and they would be offering their own fault and scholars brought this hadith to indicate that it is permissible to pray nafel prayer while leading someone in mandatory prayer another example the prophet alison once prayed fajr and after concluding the prayer he saw a man coming in what did the prophet say allah he said who among you would give sadaqa to this man was the man a beggar was he asking for money what did the prophet mean al-islam he meant that who would go and pray with him jamar so that he would not pray alone and one of the companions went and prayed with him though it was a time of prohibition a time of restriction after fajr yet because there was a legitimate reason and caused the prophet uh permitted that and allowed that this is all the time we have for the first segment stay tuned don't go away inshallah we'll be right back and welcome back hadith number 116 this hadith was narrated by abu hurairam be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said none of you must pray in a single garment of which no part comes over his shoulders first of all what was the garments and the type of clothes of the companions may allah be pleased with them they didn't have gucci or armani or whatever they had anything that covered their bodies so one set of clothes would be a shirt and a nizar an apron like from the waist down another would be a long piece of cloth like the saree the saree that women wear they wrap their lower waist and they put the remaining on their bodies so it covers the body and that is why it was time of hardship the prophet said that whoever has one garment this is the only piece of cloth i have he should wear it on his lower waist and cover one side of his shoulders if possible and if it's short he should only cover his lower body so if you have an idea of how they used to have their clothes and how hard life was then you read this hadith and in this hadith the prophet says allah do not pray in one though unless you put something off it on your shoulder and that is why al-imam may allah have mercy on his soul and he's the only one who says that it is mandatory to cover one of the shoulders while in prayer the majority of scholars say that it is not mandatory it is highly recommended and the authentic opinion of the majority is the authentic opinion that it is not mandatory if i pray from covering my navel to the knees my prayer is valid but it is not recommended if i can cover my shoulders by wearing a shirt a t-shirt by putting anything on top of my shoulders but if i don't have my prayer is valid if i have and i don't do this my prayer is valid but i am not doing something that is pleasing allah imam it says no if you do that your prayer is invalid but as stated before his opinion is not the most authentic opinion of the scholars now this is of course regarding a man but i don't expect a woman to come and say that i want to do this the prophet said that islam it is not permissible for a woman to pray without wearing a himalar she has to cover her head her hair her neck and the rest of her body and so many times we get the question is it permissible for a person if he's praying on his own in his house in the dark pitch black to pray newt is it permissible because his aura is covered no one can see allah can see it so it's dark it's even though this is the least the minimum costume or thing that you can wear for your prayer and likewise a woman says i'm in the home i'm in the house on my own no one is there can i pray without covering my head the answer is no can i pray wearing trousers the answer is no you have to cover your whole body fully you cover it and wear trousers underneath is okay but to wear trousers only without the outer garment this is not permissible moving on to hadith number 107 or do we have any questions before moving on you said about doing such that on a pillow it's not permissible but i've heard that if someone has a legitimate reason or if someone does not even have a legitimate reason he can offer his prayer on the mattress on the mat or on the sofa or on the bed so is it permissible you have to differentiate between prostration and the disability of performing prayer was meant that if i am praying standing up and then want to prostrate on a pillow this is not permissible because this is not the same level of my feet but if i pray on the bed standing up and i prostrate on the bed is this okay it's okay it's the same level now your question is related if i understand it correctly to some people who are unable to pray on the ground they pray on the chair because of their knees of their back some of them they bow like this and when they want to prostrate because they cannot prostrate on the ground what do they do they bring a pillow and they put their forehead on it as if they're prostrating on the ground and this is not permissible this is an innovation either you pray on the ground or you simply kneel forward because even if you put your head on a pillow which is on your knees this is not considered to be prostrating so this is not the case i hope this answers your question sheikh my question is that what should a person do if he falls in doubt whether he has offered a salah or not okay that's a good question though it's not related to our topic what happens if a person is in doubt whether i prayed or i did not pray now go back to the previous rule which is a very important rule i have something that is definite and i have a doubt that is coming to it now i do not know whether i prayed or not what is the default the default i did not pray the whole 24 hours every single minute i pray no the default is i do not pray and the certainty is that i pray five times a day now i'm doubtful did i pray an hour ago or not if i have this doubt this means that i did not pray go and pray so this answers your question likewise in wudu this is very important to learn i come out of my house i've performed ulu i definitely remember this i'm in doubt did i pass went well i fee i feel like i had something in my stomach running and boiling but i'm not sure did i answer the call of nature in the bathroom as if but i'm not sure you're not sure then you're still in wudhu don't think again go and pray opposite i come out of the house go to work time for prayer i enter masjid did i perform mudo or not i don't remember go out and perform mudo because the default is that you did not perform third question if a person has prayed already and another person comes to pray can i stand with him and pray again to make his jammer that is a good question a lot of the schools of thought differed about this saying that how can the intention change the man a while ago was a follower after the imam finished his prayer he stood up to complete his prayers another man comes and takes him as an imam and they pray together his his intention changes into an imam after he concludes the prayer the second man who just came in stands up to complete his prayer a third man comes and makes him an imam and this goes on and on and on is this permissible or not scholars differ the most authentic opinion is that it is completely correct and there's a fatwa from the permanent committee of ifta stating that even if a chain reaction the prayer finishes the other one completes his prayer another one comes the prayer finishes the one stands up to complete the prayer a third one and a fourth and a five and a six hypothetically if this happens all of their prayers are correct because the intention of the niyah the change and the difference of intention or nia does not affect the validity of the prayer yes brother can there be two jama in a single masjid that's a very good question the prophet salallahu said there are no two jamaa in the same masjid meaning at the same time simultaneously but if you're referring to what's the ruling on making another jamaa after the first jamaa has finished it's an issue of dispute the majority say that it is permissible and the evidence they use is the hadith i quoted earlier when a man came and the prophet said who would give this man sadaqa and pray with him so they said that the prophet himself initiated the request and he approved the second congregation in the masjid other scholars such as sheikh al-bani and those who follow him say no there are hadiths that anastasia malik of the lobbyists road and other companions when they went to the masjid and found that the prayer has been prayed and offered they prayed alone and they did not gather their companions to pray with them each one prayed alone and they say that this is an indication that it is not permissible to make another jamaa in the masjid but the most authentic opinion is the opinion of the majority the hadith of the prophet backs it up that it is permissible to pray another a second jamara to have two jamaa's at the same time this is not permissible this happens when you have a big masjid and the imam with four or five worshipers are praying his voice is very soft and low and another group comes from a second side of the masjid and they see that the people have prayed so they make their own jamaa and all of a sudden while both are praying they hear each other what to do the second jamaa should stop the prayer and join the first jamara this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
