  "transcript": "so I have a computer and I have two monitors for my computer so I have two screens my brother he has only one and he would like to get one just like the one I'm using one of the two I'm using is very good and he would like to get the exact one so he's asking me if I can give it to him and I don't want to give it to him but the problem is he uh pretty much only plays video games on it and I do not like what he's playing because it's not Al Khaled and it takes a lot of time so my question is if I just give it to him or I sell it to him and knowing that if I do not he will buy an exact one like the one I am using but he will just buy it um from somebody else or somebody else is going to give it to him is it Halal for me to give it to him even though I know he will most likely 90 of what he's doing is not Halal or video games if you know for certain that he'll he's going to use it entirely for Haram then you must not assist him on Haram but if you know that maybe 50 percent is Haram fifty percent is halal he may use it for Halal things to um trade to study or some or the likes but of course there is an element of him using it in Haram there's no problem in selling it or in giving it to him and Allah Knows Best"
