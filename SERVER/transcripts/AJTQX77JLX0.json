  "transcript": "so Sheikh my question is that that as you know in the last silent records of the congregation we have to research so what if we haven't completed the Surah Fatiha and the Imam goes into Ruku or if we mistake or if we make a mistake in the Surah Fatiha in the silent it is without doubt among the vast majority of Scholars the vast majority of Scholars say that reciting the Fatiha in silent raka is a pillar upon the Imam the individual and the follower all those who pray they must recite the fatihin silent rakas so if you miss reciting the Fatiha either due to the Imam is too fast or you are too slow then this raka is invalid what to do after the Imam offers salaam you have to stand up and make up for this mist raka now if you are too slow you have to work on speeding your recitation so when you're not praying just sit repeat the Fatiha a thousand times no Imam can be faster than me and I will still have time to recite another Surah this comes with practice so recite it one thousand times five thousand times until you master saying it without a mistake then you will find that your prayer is valid but if the Imam is way too fast and everyone in the congregation is unable to catch up with the Imam because it's too fast everybody acknowledges this kick him in the backside and put him let him stick into the front wall tell him don't pray as any man and learn how to pray recites slowly and add another Surah just so that those behind you would be able to catch up or don't pray don't lead we don't want you as simple as that and Allah Knows Best"
