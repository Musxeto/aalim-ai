  "title": "Prophet using Dye, Kohl & Antimony (Characteristics of Prophet) Ash Shama'il Al Muhammadiyah assim",
  "transcript": "the chapter that deals with the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam using D and as we said this is an issue that the companions differed upon and we will find out inshallah the solution to such a difference Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that I came to the prophet Alat wasam with a son of mine so he said the prophet is this your son so I said I acknowledge of him being my son I testify to that oh prophet of Allah so the prophet comforted him by saying You must not harm he must not harm you and you must not harm him there's mean there's no uh um conflict of interest between the both of you you're in harmony inshallah he says the companion I also noticed that the grayness of his hair was reddish so this is one companion acknowledging that the prophet Sall wasallam used Dy that's why it was reddish abuur may Allah be pleased with him said did the prophet of allaham dye his hair Abu Hur replied by saying yes anas may Allah be pleased with him says I saw the hair of the Prophet Alat wasam uh um died now this is what Anna said may Allah be pleased with him and hammad said Abdullah Muhammad said I saw may Allah be pleased with him or may Allah have mercy on him said I saw the hair of the Prophet alham meaning parts of the hair of the Prophet Alam that was kept as a souvenir with anas Malik and it was died the hair was died so what is the end result was it died or not did the prophet dye his hair or not the most authentic opinion is that each companion narrated what he saw at a specific time and that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam may have died sometimes and we know that the die of the white or the gray hair May remain for two to three weeks and then it wears off so it wasn't the habit of the Prophet to continuously dye it so that it is always concealing the greyness of the hair rather he used to do this sometimes and he used to skip that other times and Allah knows best moving on to the following chapter which is the use of by the prophet and is the eye liner that people use Abbas may Allah be pleased with him reported that the prophet Alat wasam said color the edges of the eyelids with antimony this is called in Arabic for it clears the vision and makes the eyelashes grow so this is a medical benefit it clears your vision makes you see clearly and it makes your eyelashes grow to those who may suffer from falling eyelashes IB Abbas said may Allah be peace with him the prophet of Allah used to color the edges of his eyelids with antimony before going to sleep three times in each eye yazid IB harun said that the prophet had a jar and this is not an authentic Hadith but the translators may have mentioned it because it's not of a great importance that's related to or to an Islamic ruling that's why they used it but a lot of the scholars say that this is not authentic jab abdah may Allah be pleased with him uh said that the prophet said you must apply antimony before going to sleep for it clears the vision and makes the eye lashes grow and Sim similarly the Hadith of Abbas that the prophet said the best thing to be applied on your eyes is the antimony for it clears the vision and makes the eyelashes grow the same Hadith by ibar may Allah be uh pleased with him uh that you must apply antimony for it clears the vision and makes the eyelashes grow what is antimony antimony or ithmid is a stone that is black and reddish usually it is in the western region of the Arabian Peninsula Al hij and the best of it is brought from asahan or asahan in Iran there is some in Morocco as well and this is a form of medication when used it is crushed and made as powder and it is very advisable to be applied to those who have problems with their Vision it is easily to be made into powder and it has a sort of uh uh sparkling um uh glow to it and in the inside of it is very soft and touching and it's pure it hasn't it does not have any impurity in it so it is a if you were to seek medication and you need to strengthen your um Vision with it and to make your eyelashes grow now the Sunnah is to be applied three times some Hadith say three times in each eyes and there is another Hadith which says three times to the right two times to the left so the total would be an odd number or three and three so each one is odd an odd number and this is why some Scholars said that that it is highly recommended for women and it's recommended for men when sought after for medical benefits but if it's not for medical benefits for beautification like Imam Malik and other Scholars they did not recommend it for men because such adornment for women for men is disliked and they would not recommend it and Allah Knows Best Al"
