  "transcript": "there is anith in abuth 4977 and it's graded as sah by the is do not say because if is really your master then you have angered your lord my question is can we use say which means Mis in English for non-muslims not intending to know them but because it is the nor saying means our Lord or our master and the Hadith is authentic we must not address this disbeliever or a hypocrite by glorifying them and praising them and saying that they are our masters our Lords and they're the best of us as found in the media sometimes we hear this to some politicians who we can confirm that they are full-fledged Hypocrites sometimes it's even said to disbelievers a say it so and so he's a cafir so those who accept it and say it willingly knowing that the prophet prohibited this they've angered Allah asael without any doubt now saying sir is a different story altogether because sir is said even to a janitor or a farmer or a Layman or a bedwin or a nomad there's no problem in saying it at all and Allah Knows Best"
