  "title": "What 2 do if we cannot pray in masjid during last 10 nights of Ramadan (Men & Women Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i think the question was uh what can i do if i cannot attend the masjid uh and you're presuming it's a sister or someone who's is sick did not limit the good deeds to the masjid the sisters are more rewarded for praying at home and the reward when they pray home is confirmed by the prophet therefore okay if the the the brother is a man and he's unable to pray in the masjid a lot of the companions used to pray home may allah be pleased with him did not pray the night prayers at the masjid because he was the caliph he had the country to run but he used to pray for hours at home so this is an alternative if you're unable to pray in the masjid stay in the prayer place hold the mushaf read as much as possible in night prayers and allah azzawajal would reward you immensely for that as well"
