  "transcript": "okay we have Salonga I'm sorry these names a lot of them are screen names in my opinion as-salam-o-alaikum who stares but all the banks has interests when we do loans you mean to say that this is haram to have to take loans I guess the question is the first time to know that taking loans and paying riba is haram so if you can yes sorry this is an issue that all Muslims agree upon any loan that allows a profit on top of it is considered to be RIBA and river is usually and it is one of the seven major sins of Islam and this was the doing of the Jews as mentioned in the Quran hakuna sir this is Haram money so I give you a hundred you give it back to me 110 and in America they do this a lot the loan sharks and they're ready to bust your kneecap with a baseball bat if if needed there's no problem in that this is Reema a loan is only permissible in Islam if its interest rate so you come to me as a good Muslim a good brother a cousin a friend if he give me a loan of so much and I said okay and you set a date for that and that's it I gain reward from Allah half of the loan that I gave you is considered as a Sabra for myself if it comes on time if it doesn't come on time I get the full loan as charity in my books of good deeds and if you postpone again after the second deadline for every single day I get exactly the same amount of the loan as charity so there is no investment in the world that is equivalent to the system the Islamic system does ecologic mnemonic logic"
