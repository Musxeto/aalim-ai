  "transcript": "my question is what is the ruling on applying sun block for example if i'm not in the state of wudhu and i have applied sunblock on my face and thereafter i would like to perform [Music] do i have to actually wash my face with a soap or i can straight away take wood okay if the sun block is water resistant meaning that it keeps a layer like a an extra layer of skin and when you perform wudu you see the water falling off not touching your skin because there is a barrier in this case your water is invalid you have to wash it with soap or with other lotion removers baby oil or whatever they use in order for the water to reach the skin but if it's like any normal cream it's not water repellent or resistant and usually this is observed by the skin in like two three minutes when you want to make wudu it's just sufficient to rub over it with your hand and that would do the job in sha allah"
