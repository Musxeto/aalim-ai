  "title": "Sister wears inappropriate clothes to school Is it permissible for me to wake her up assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign basically my mom sometimes tells me um to wake my sister up for school but the thing is like she sometimes um wears like her own clothing and I'm kind of scared if I'm like um endorsing her sin if I just like tell her or like wake her up to go to school is it disturbating if I just don't listen to my mom no there is no problem in waking her up to school but at the same time giving her advice about her clothes these are two separate things waking up waking her up to school is permissible because you're obeying your mom and she has to go to school or she wants to go to school whatever she does in the process is her own sin and your mom's sin there's nothing wrong in giving her uh nasiha and advice"
