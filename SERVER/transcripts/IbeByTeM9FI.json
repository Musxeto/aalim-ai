  "title": "Is making dua 4 righteous spouse without sending mahram 2 him sufficient as tawakkul on Allah? assim",
  "transcript": "my question was I know of some brothers with some good qualities but I do not want to thank I do not want to send any mushrooms to them because in our country it is considered shameful for the father of the female to go to the mail so if I make Dua to Allah foreign well you can make Dua and as long as this is a shameful act in your country and you know that there are no other Halal means and proper means to approach this shooter who's not even a shooter he doesn't know anything about you making Dua is the only option you have but I wouldn't do a lot of uh or I won't put a lot of weight on such Dua because we are instructed to take the means so if I see something or if I want to gain something if there is a particular science I would like to learn if there is a particular language and there are so many that I would like to pick and learn if I don't sit and learn and I just make do I it's not going to come through thin air therefore I wouldn't be doing proper tawakul when I say okay I made tawakul to Allah that he teaches me Spanish I I want to learn Spanish this won't happen or I want to pick up Bahasa this won't happen unless I go and sit down in a classroom or actually communicate with those who can teach me so that I can pick up this language making Dua is not sufficient I hope this answers your question"
