  "title": "Does touching non mahram break wudu? What about Smoking, watching Haram, listening music Assimalhake",
  "transcript": "sultan says does touching nullify your wudu this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the reason of it the verse is also an anisa so he refers to intercourse this is the vast majority of scholars interpretation imam shafiri thought that this is referring to touching so to him in his school of thought touching your wife touching your sister touching your mother touching in nullifies and this introduces a lot of hardship which is not based on authentic evidence and proof from the quran in the sunnah so the vast majority went against this opinion and said no this is referring to intercourse and they've explained this and also from the sunnah where the prophet assad used to maybe kiss one of his wives and go out for prayer without performing wudu so the things that nullify your wudu has to be have to be backed up by proof from the quran so urinating defecating passing of passing of wind sleeping and eating camels meat all are backed by evidences from the quran sunnah to prove that they nullify your wudu but when it comes to touching anon mahram this is sinful and not everything sinful breaks your wudu smoking is sinful but it does not break your wudu watching haram things or listening to music is sinful but it is not does not impact the validity of your wudu and therefore touching inun maharam does not impact your wudu unless this leads to a discharge due to such sin and in this case the discharge that is emitted invalidates and not the action of touching itself and allah azzawajal knows best zainab says"
