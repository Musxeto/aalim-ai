  "transcript": "well it appears to me that Allah has opened a door to Paradise for you and Allah subhana T closed it for your siblings if I understand your question correctly you are the only one who is taking care of your parents while your family members are not helping you out your parents are always nagging and they're always complaining for or about the smallest uh things and this is normal from uh uh old people unfortunately and believe me if you think positively and look at your parents as your gateway to Paradise you would find great joy in entertaining them in obeying them and in taking care of them you should always talk to them nicely and know that they are here only for a very short period of time tomorrow when Allah Wills they'll die but once they die you will start to regret every and each moment that passed without you seeking their pleasure and wanting to entertain them so I believe that you should look at the full half of the cup instead of looking at the empty half of it the full half is that the more and more you do well to them and the more and more you're kind to them Allah opens great doors of provisions of risk of health of wealth for you in this life plus what is stored for you on the day of judgment so do not worry about you taking care of your parents be grateful to Allah that he opened this door and it is okay for you and it is recommended that you give a friend the advice not so that your siblings and and and other family members would share with you this so-called quote and unquote burden but so that they would remember Allah and would know that they have an obligation that Allah would ask them about on the day of judgment and Allah knows rest"
