  "title": "Are we sinful if we don't make dua to Allah due to laziness & will Allah be angry? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if we got uh if we don't make Dua that Allah gets angry so is it okay to make Dua whenever we feel like or will we be sinful if we don't uh feel like making if you feel lazy for making it I uh um know that there is a statement by a poet that the son of Adam is angry when he's asked and Allah is angry when he's not asked and the Hadith I'm not sure if this is authentic or not but indeed is a form of worship and if you don't make Dua that this means that you feel independent from Allah's help and guidance and this is definitely something serious so do I become sinful if I don't make Dua the answer is yes because you've abandoned the form of of worship that it's more important for your heart than the oxygen you breathe we cannot remain idle without asking Allah azzawajal whether it's for forgiveness or to cast his mercy upon us or to facilitate our daily lives I am unable to answer your question without making Dua and I make a lot of Dua before attending this program because I don't know whether I will be guided or not whether I'll make a mistake or not I feel helpless without Allah's guidance to me I need Allah azzawajal whenever I visit the doctor or whenever I go shopping or whenever I do whatever I do because without his help and guidance I'm worthless I'm nothing so yes you have to make Dua to Allah feeling lazy this is a sign of Satan controlling your mind and engaging you in Trivial things and Allah Knows Best"
