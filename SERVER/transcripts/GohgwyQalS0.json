  "transcript": "Nayla says in India election results will be announced in three days so Maulana meaning scholars from India have asked people to read Surat Yasin and fat at for time for three days so that caring government gets selected he's reading surah in this manner aloud this is a blatant innovation this is baseless and it is part of the Sufi beliefs so even when the enemy armies are approaching and they wanting to attack us they just open Sahih al-bukhari or read Surat Yasin etc and wait until the enemy overtake the whole city while they are in their message reading this is not Islamic this has nothing to do with Islam you can make duaa that Allah appoints upon you those who are beneficial to Islam that Allah destroys those who are enemy to Islam yes make do our day and night against the enemies of Islam against the government that fights the Muslims oppresses them that takes their wealth that expels them from their their homes and lands yes make duaa day and night but to recite surat yaseen or sort so-and-so and for three days after fajar this is a an innovation"
