  "transcript": "I mean sayidina wanna be be now Habibi Ana Muhammadan sallallahu alayhe wa alihi wa sahbihi a derby was tender bassoon that he is a yummy Dean a mother dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of Escada broadcasting to you live from Jeddah Saudi Arabia brother Rashid says one of the knowledgeable show you here in the United Kingdom has deemed the university student loan scheme an investment transaction rather than a standard RIBA based transaction because it has several conditions attached to it such as you only pay back the money once you earn a certain amount and the debt is written off after 30 years when he or when you die is this a valid opinion the issue of student loans is quite common in the West and it is called student loans and the showery rule that all scholars agree upon is that any loan that draws in or drags interest then it is RIBA so if there is a loan and you gain something out of it of that then this is a river now come of lodging it or diverting it from its to true nature by claiming it is an investment this is not true you know it and I know it the government gives you nine thousand pounds per year and it tells you that if your income exceeds something like twenty one thousand annually in this case you have to pay the nine thousand back plus interest if it doesn't that is your income exceed it then we wait until it goes beyond that and if you die we forgive you for that and if you reach a certain age or after a number of years as it stated in the question they'll write it off thirty years so some say that this is an investment the government is investing in you and this is with all due respect any nonsense the government is not investing at all they don't believe in halal or Haram they believe that this money may have a very big possibility of return to them so their citizens benefit the government itself benefits from the interest money and from producing citizens that are productive by giving them university education however this doesn't change a thing it is RIBA it is a loan plus an interest on top of it which led so many Muslims and this is unfortunate to cheat and lie so they graduate system engineers or industrial engineers or chemical engineers or whatever a position they get a job but they agree with the company with the employer not to disclose the real salary or they insist on not reaching the threshold so that they would not be forced to pay the interest so they lie they cheat and they try to dodge if it were an investment they try to dodge giving the profit to their partner in this endeavor or in this joint venture but this is not this is clearly but I've asked to you and I'm talking about real scholars in Saudi Arabia about this and if there is a possibility of looking at it from an angle of so-called investment they said no this is nonsense this is clear Reba way very wavering or [Music] writing off some of the conditions of Reba does not change its nature it is still Reba so one says what should I do should I remain being unemployed ma hey this is something that you have to figure it out whether you have to study on a line which is cheaper and you have to put more effort into it whether you work and gain some money and then study whether you borrow from your relatives from people you know to give them later on this is up to you but you cannot come and come off large such a transia transaction which is RIBA based and claim that it is an investment when it is not may allah azzawajal guide all of us to the straight path and I always ask the brothers and sisters don't listen to me don't listen to Tom Dick or Harry go back to the grand scholars go back to the real scholars who can give you a sound fatwa which you meet allah azza wajal with now the biggest problem is when Tom Dick or Harry would tell you that these grand Muftis or these great scholars in Saudi Arabia or elsewhere they don't know what's happening in the UK so the fatwa is not implementable and this is a great and serious issue which raises question marks on such an individual who says this and the reliability of whatever he gives fatwas on Oh Mohamed from Saudi Arabia Oh Mohammed"
