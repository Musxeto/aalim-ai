  "title": "Islamic ruling on using credit cards & benefiting from their rewards & cashback - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the U.S sound like my question is regarding credit card hacking which is like using opening up credit cards to receive like rewards they say like let's say if you spend five thousand dollars within the first month you get a certain amount of reward points and you can use those reward points to travel and stuff like that we know that using credit card as a necessity is halal but what if you're using it let's say to use these rewards that are gifts from the from the companies and what if they have an annual fee now the issue of credit card the most authentic opinion is it's prohibited due to the fact that you have to pay sometimes an annual fee that is not logical and they put this annual fee according to the level of your card whether it's silver gold platinum or diamond or whatever and the more benefits they give you the higher the annual fee is which is not realistic it's not in accordance to the actual paperwork they have to go through to issue you such a credit card secondly they have a clause that states that you must pay them interest because they're giving you a loan whenever you use your credit card they're actually lending you a thousand five ten thousand dollars and they give you a grace period of 40 days if you pay within time then there's no harm but if you're late if you're imprisoned or or admitted to hospital and could not pay on time they'll charge you riba for that and one this is one of the major sins in Islam Allah has waged war against those who deal in River so it's a scary thing therefore it is not permissible to issue a credit card and the alternative is having a debit card where you charge your debit card with five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand Euros it's up to you and you can use this money which is yours until you run out of cash then you charge it again and that's the Islamic alternative and it's halal now if a person says well I live in the states and I have to build my credit [Music] and when I book uh airplane tickets or want to rent a car or get a hotel room they don't accept debit card and this is debatable but hypothetically assuming that is something that is required and needed for your day-to-day life and there's great hardship in this case yes it's permissible for you to take a credit card I would highly advise that you charge it up front before using it so instead of lending from them you charge it with ten thousand Euros or dollars and you can use that and whether the grace period is due or not you already have the money uh with them so there is no possibility of getting River from you and benefiting from the cashback on a credit card this is permissible inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
