  "transcript": "labour says in the hadith the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to the Sahaba who were facing the wish wasps that it is a sign of Eman there are many practicing Muslims I know but never in their entire life have faced the whispers problem also there are Muslims who are being crushed by this problem please clarify this first of all what is with swass mean with wasps means whispering of Shaitaan and it can be something of your sub-conscience and to say that many practicing Muslims never had this in their entire life is an exaggeration every single Muslim person and a believer must have this was was because this is only natural even a bass may Allah be pleased with him was once approached by his companions and they objected to him complained to him they said even our best when we pray we get thoughts and whispers and the Jews and the Christians mock us and make fun of us and they say haha you guys whisper in your prayers we the Jews and the Christians when we pray we have full kosher contemplation and submissiveness we have no whispers so even our best said and confirmed what the Jews Christians said he said they're right and his companions were shocked what do you mean by they are right he said what would Satan do with a corrupt heart so in another example if a burglar is out looking to break into a house he finds a big man and he finds a beggars house to break into the beggars house is much easier who would he break into definitely the big mansion because this is this is where all the money in the treasures are if he breaks into a beggars house he will not find anything probably it feels sorry and put few dollars or Euros or reals as a compensation to that poor person but a burglar would only break into a rich man's house and likewise Satan would whisper to the believers if he goes to disbelievers they're already cafard they were already in hell so why is he wasting time with them there's no need to that so the hadith you referring to labor where the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was approached by some of his companions who complained and said o prophet of allah sometimes we find things in ourselves that to fall from the highest heavens to earth would be better to us than to speak about it we'd rather be tortured rather than to speak about it so the Prophet said Allah saw some in one narration Allahu Akbar alhamdulillah Allah d-rod decada who ll was wasa praised be Allah who made his whispering that is of say Satan of the devil limited only to this whispering all what he can plot is to whisper he cannot do anything more than that so alhamdulillah all praise be to Allah in another narration the Prophet asked them are a sorcerer I'm rhetorically did you find this by Allah this is clear Eman now scholars interpreted what is meant by clearly men and this is what caused your confusion labor the profit when he said that this is clear a man did not mean that if you don't have whispers then you're not a believer on the contrary it means that not willing to speak about it and to utter it and to rather fall from the heavens to the earth and die before doing that this is clear a man not speaking is clear a man rather than that who goes and says I felt this and I have these whispers and he talks about it freely this sure surely indicates that he is not a true believer Cal film from"
