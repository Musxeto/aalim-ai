  "transcript": "so the problem now was they went out for the caravan once the news came back to the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam that the people of Mecca are coming out with an army now this is a different story so the prophet salallahu alaihe salam gathered the people and some of them did not like the idea of fighting even among the the migrants they went out for the money they went out for the caravan they were not prepared to fight so the prophets are solemn gathered everyone that was with him the three hundred and fourteen men and he said o people advise me what should we do so Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him and he's a migrant stood and said well he talked and said something that pleased the Prophet SAW Selim and he sat and then the Prophet said advise me people Omar may Allah be pleased with him said also something that was well and he talked and supported the prophet alaihi wasallam we can learn we can learn we can take from this point that the leader has to sit and talk and discuss everything with his brothers well it you cannot say he has to but of course it is something to be to be taken into consideration because if a leader puts everything into discussion you will never ever get one opinion the Owen his own products not all the people well in this case it was everyone in that battlefield but the Prophet had a purpose for that and we will learn this in sha allah as we go on so Omar also spoke and then I looked at him hammer may Allah be pleased with him spoke and said o prophet of Allah do you think that we are going to abandon you and say do you like the Jews said to Moses go and you and your rolled and fight we are sitting here without fighting no we're not gonna do this Oh prophet of Allah we are going to accompany you we are going to fight with you and by Allah wherever you take us we're going to follow you and you should not have any problem with that now the prophets Allah seldom heard three of his companions but they were all from the migrants they were all from Mecca praising the event and saying and supporting the the prophets are Salaam that we are with you all the way the whole nine yards but the Prophet did not want them to talk so again he said advise me people so one of the ants are stood up and his name was was Sagamore - inside the brew Mahad he's a man of his own this guy was the leader of the tribe of house and as we know we there are two dominant tribes in Medina the house hollard and Al hi Suraj so he was the leader of the house tribe and he was a young man when he accepted Islam he was barely 30 years old and when he died or or even less and when he died he was almost 32 or 35 at most yet when he died the Prophet tells us the loss in him that the throne of Allah the Almighty trembled out of joy because he was coming to join them in Heaven's sad no Mahad stood up and said prophet of Allah I sense and feel that you are talking to us and you intending that we talk instead of our brothers the migrants prophet of Allah we've believed in you we followed you and we testified that what you brought was truth we gave you our vows and our pledges to support you and to obey you therefore go ahead do what you want to do by Allah if you ride to the depth of the oceans we will follow you blindfolded Lee so you and none what not even one single man of us would stay back so go to what allah azzawajal has instructed you and ordered you to do and by Allah when we meet the enemy tomorrow you will see what type of men we are because we are firm when we meet the enemy and allah azzawajal will satisfy you with the way we fight so the service Allah Salomon was fair to inform to form the unserved to go with him so if the Prophet was did not want to force them yeah so they want he wanted them to bring them to bring this initiative from them themselves and he prayed for aha"
