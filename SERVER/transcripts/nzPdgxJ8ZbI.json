  "title": "Selling something you don't own, online business, dropshipping & a halal alternative - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Asya says i have a question regarding business I am an online wholesaler usually my customers have to pay for an item first then after removing my profit I will use the money to buy the item and send it to them but I used to tell all my customers that they have to pay for me to buy the items and send it to them I please I would like to know if this is permissible in Islam this is known as drop shipping and we've answered this before drop shipping is not permissible because the Prophet as in the hadith of Hakim Azam Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallaahu seldom prohibited selling what you do not possess what you do not own so this type of transaction is not permissible what is the alternative the alternative is I show you this pen on my Instagram account and you say I'm interested in buying it so I'll tell you that okay I'll ship it to you the cost of the pen plus shipping is two reals and I'll take one real as my commission he says agreed he sends me the money I buy it and I ship it to him no harms done no harm done at all this is totally private permissible but not to show the profit margin and not to take any responsibility because in drop shipping there's no responsibility on you the money's in your hand and the third party is responsible to cover any losses and this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
