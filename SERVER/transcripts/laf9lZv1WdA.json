  "title": "Qadiyani using Sheikh Assim's videos to support their dawah (Jesus dead or alive) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "aziz from holland he says that this uh caller was a kadyani and they make video uh clips of what you say and they use it to support their da'wah i don't believe that with all due respect who are the kadyanis they're nobody they're kafir sacked they don't do not relate to islam and their leader their founder who died in the bathroom a horrible death in their history it's nothing aadhyan is in occupied territory of palestine made by the israelis the jews this is where they pray to or well that was the baha'is well it's the same thing sorry i get always mixing up apples with oranges kadyan is in india and they do not relate to islam they may quote one verse of the quran the prophet muhammad islam is a messenger that many messengers before him have passed and died so this means that jesus peace be upon him is dead who said so because the ayah says all the messengers before him had died no it doesn't say that it talks about generalities in general so they come to this single verse and they disregard all the other verses in the quran that says that jesus christ peace be upon him will come at the end of time and will be to testifying and witnessing what the people do they neglect all the hadith in bukhari and elsewhere where the prophet isam said to us that he is going to come down he is on going to kill the dead and they said no no no only we have this verse so these people are not muslims so don't spend time waste time refuting them or making an issue of what they say simply ignore them when a dog barks you you do not bark back ignore him move on so i advise people not to make an issue let them use my videos that's no problem for me that's good advertisement because whenever people see that they're using my videos to support their own religion people would come back to my youtube channel come back to my material and see that i'm saying to everybody that adian all are kafir they do not relate to islam and there's nothing they can do about it ask any scholar not even reputable scholar any scholar in the entire muslim world go to indonesia go to malaysia go to jordan go to syria go to egypt go to morocco go to the u.s go to germany anywhere any muslim scholar would say yep they're not muslims end of story so yani move on"
