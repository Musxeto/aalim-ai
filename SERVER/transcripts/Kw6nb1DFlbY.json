  "title": "Can a woman pray on her own in the Masjid while the congregation is going on?- Sheikh Assim Alhakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question is that a woman went into a shopping mall and while the prayer was going on she entered the Masjid and prayed Maghrib on her own she did not join the congregation and she felt bad about it so is is she sinful dancers no we all know that it is not mandatory it is not obligatory upon a woman to pray in congregation so she is free if she want to pray on her own or join the congregation this is totally up to her but usually it's a bit weird when people are praying in the message and you praying on your own they would probably think that you're a Shia and there is nothing that calls for it but in terms of being sinful or not no you're not sinful"
