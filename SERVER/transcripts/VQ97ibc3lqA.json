  "transcript": "he says i have relatives that do acts of shirk and i'm not an expert in takfir and at the same time i know that we can't pray behind them so should i give them salam or not ok this is a package deal the default is a person is a muslim his name is ali his father's name is abdullah his family name is a muslim name so they're muslims by default if you ask them and give them the microphone are you muslims said of course so this is the default now what they do which is regarded to be acts of shirk is the thing that's coming to remove this certainty of them being muslims therefore it has to rise to the level of certainty in order to remove a certainty they're muslim by default that's certain in order to take them out of the fold of islam i have to have certainty till i have that certainty i assume they're muslims i say salaam alaikum without any problem now sheikh they're going to dhargas they're doing they're doing that okay i know these acts in order for us to take them out of the fold of islam there are a number of conditions that must be fulfilled and there are a number of obstacles that we must ensure they do not exist to prevent them from prevent us from giving fear and usually this is done by scholars so if you're not up to it in this case don't assume that they're mushriks give them salam for the benefit of the doubt and allah knows best friday you"
