  "transcript": "okay please if you have some doubt sometimes shaytan cuts doubts in your mind okay maybe the quran is from another source let's say it's from shaytan but it kind of um feared or deceived allah a prophet in thinking it is from god so you don't respond to such thoughts ahi if you have a shred of doubt about the quran then you're not a muslim this is not with us this is doubting see there is difference between getting intrusive thoughts that oh this quran may not be been revealed to uh jibril may not this and that and then you shake your heads this is shaytan this is intrusive thought i love the quran i read it i implement it in my life this is intrusive thoughts allah will not hold you accountable unless you speak about it or act upon it but if someone is reading the quran yet he's doubtful i don't know if this is from allah or not i don't know if this is from shaytan from jibril this person is not a muslim jani why would he spend all his time and life in a religion that he does not believe in part of islam is certainty and if you're not certain of the oneness of allah if you're not certain that the quran is the word of allah that is preserved till the day of judgment if you're not certain that the prophet muhammad ali is the messenger and servant of allah and that there's no messenger after him you're not a muslim so sit with yourself and reflect on what you actually believe because if you believe the latter you're in deep trouble my friend"
