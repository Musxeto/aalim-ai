  "title": "Did Prophet never yawn? Had cloud over his head? Was untouched by flies? Had no shadow Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "is it true that the prophet alison did not have a shadow and a cloud always was on his head covering him and no flies ever touched him and he did not used to yawn first of all whatever we described the prophet allah by it has to be backed up by an authentic hadith and this is one of the definitions of sunnah sunnah is defined as whatever the prophet islam has said the words or done actions or approved seeing something and he does not comment which means it's an approval or a description of the prophet israel how tall he was uh how he did this and that etc so the description of the prophet isaiah is part of the sunnah therefore we cannot affirm that this is true or not true unless we have authentic evidence backing it up so when we come to the first one the prophet said the prophet has did not have a shadow this is baseless nothing in the sunnah backs it up the prophet sallam always had a cloud shading him covering him this is baseless the authentic sunnah denies it because in hajj he had uh zaid and bilal if i'm not mistaken covering his head with a tent like from the heat of the sun if he had a cloud he would not have needed that uh no flies ever touched him this is also not proven so it's just from the imagination of extremists who wanted the prophet hassam to have a status different than what allah has given him so he is a human being i am merely a human being like you which means that he was created like us he is like us he lives and dies like us but the only difference is that allah has favored him with the message so this is the biggest difference difference is that he is given revelation so this is the status that allah azzawajal or the level that the prophet allah azza had placed his prophet islam in we should not go above that nor below that so about the flies no evidence none whatsoever in the quran of the sunnah about yawning well this we don't have evidence backing it up but the general evidence says that this is true because we know that in the hadith that yawning is from shaytan and the prophet islam cannot be touched or harmed by shaytan therefore if we were to say that the prophet never yawned that would have been a correct statement and allah knows best"
