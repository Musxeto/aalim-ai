  "transcript": "it's the ruling on rebelling against an Islamic state because the ruler is an unfair and unjust this answer or this question was asked to the prophet of Solomon he answered it so if you are a Muslim then you can find the answer there without any problem but if you are part of the nicest people of the terrorist groups or of those other cults and a deviant sex then of course you will not swallow it a well because it doesn't suit your ideology the prophet alayhi salaatu sam was asked by the companions shall we rebelled against the rulers who are unfair who delayed the prayers who do this who take all the wealth and give us nothing the Prophet said I know as long as they pray meaning that they are still Muslim and another narration he gave four conditions no unless you see one blatant - disbelief go for free that you have ample and strong proof from Allah upon it this is for so as long as it's an Islamic country and he claims to be a Muslim and he did not nullify his Islam with something that you had seen not something that you had hurt or they have bases of American forces here and there you have you seen this know everybody knows about it okay you seen it you should know sin then shut up oh they have they sell alcohol and they allow gambling is this go for soda this is a major sin is it comfort do they say it's halal so no but it's a major sin and they're sinful and surely Allah will punish them in hell for that yeah but they have banks they have usually the Allah ensure loads will punish them for that but it is not good for it does not allow you entitle you to rebel and the Prophet told us assume that whoever comes to you as a Muslim nation wants to divine you're a unity when you have one ruler and he wants to divide this by claiming his right so any ruler who rebelled on a Muslim ruler who's ruling a country and he comes and he says no I don't accept him ruling and he fights him then you should kill the lat the latter this one who's rebelling you should kill him this is a crystal-clear instruction from the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam"
