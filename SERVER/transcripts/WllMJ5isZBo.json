  "title": "Good deeds & Bad deeds on the Day of Judgement for Muslims & Non Muslims - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "basically speaking on the day of judgment we have a belief that there will come a scale which is a creation of Allah to weigh the good deeds and the bad Deeds to weigh the individuals and to weigh the record books and this scale has eyes and has a tongue and the default is that who's ever good deeds outweigh his bad Deeds The Good Deeds erase the bad deeds and he's admitted to Jannah providing he's a Muslim what about if a muslim's bad Deeds over ways The Good Deeds the norm and the default is that these bad these consume the good deeds and he has to be cleansed from his sins and hellfire unless Allah's Mercy catches him and Allah forgives the remaining of his bad Deeds and Allah's most forgiving most merciful if a non-muslim has good deeds regardless of how many Good Deeds he has because of his disbelief or shirk or associating others with Allah this is the cardinal sin as they say it erases all of his Good Deeds blocks them and he's admitted straight away to Hellfire for eternity"
