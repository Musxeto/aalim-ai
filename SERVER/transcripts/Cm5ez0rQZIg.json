  "transcript": "foreign oh is at the hands of the muslims the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had an agreement with them that they may work in the forms of khaibar providing that they give half of whatever comes out to the muslims and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has all the right to send them out of haibar whenever he wishes to do so at that time the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to know that his cousin and all the muslims that or who were in abyssinia my migrating in abyssinia 10 years ago came back to medina with abdumari and he was so pleased to see them and to see the ashari yin the tribe of abu musa al-assad allah be pleased with him coming and he was so happy he said that i don't know which one to be happy more with with the arrival of jaffa or with khaibar being granted to me by allah the almighty the companions who were in abyssinia came to medina to find a different world than what they were used to remember they fled the oppression of the polytheist in mecca four or five years before hijrah so they left the arabian peninsula with the muslims being oppressed they are fearful of the polytheist and their oppression they don't have a platform to call people to islam let alone to be able to live in a muslim society and muslim environment now when they came back every the tables were turned they found that the upper hand was for the muslims everyone feared them respected them and allowed them to do their dawah work without any interference they had a truce with the people of mecca and the people of mecca had everything to fear for because those whom they kicked in the very beginning out of mecca are now more stronger than themse than the people of mecca so when they came back from abyssinia it was a completely different different environment islam was practiced and it was the norm it was a dominating religion the masjid of the prophet was filled with companions they are with the prophet alaihis and he's teaching them and he's uh solving their problems and he is taking care of them they were happy among them was may allah be pleased with her she was the wife of jafar and and in one hadith we are told that she was visiting hafsah may allah be pleased with her and um entered the house and he asked hafsah while asmat was listening who's this with you so she said it's asma bintu amaze and listen to the description of umar umar may allah please with her with him said the one of the boat the abyssinian one and he's saying this just to show her that you're nothing compared to the companions that migrated from madina to mecca from and he started saying and telling her that you have no migration like us we migrated with the prophet sallam while you went to abyssinia you did not migrate with the prophet allah so she was extremely angry and frustrated and said that you umar was with the prophet sallallahu alaihi you and your companions you were with the prophet he would feed your hungry and he would take care of the one who was needy while we were in a foreign land in a foreign language and we were so far away we did not know what was going to happen with us you were with the prophet sallam he used to teach you he used to take care of you we were alone in abyssinia and you claim that we don't have any migration by allah i will go to the prophet and i will tell him exactly what you have said and i would not add or delete anything and she went to the prophet and she told him what took place and the prophet sallam smiled and said you and your companions are rewarded by the side by allah twice because you migrated twice once to abyssinia and once to medina while umar and his companions only migrated once so tells us that the companions who were in abyssinia were never ever happier than when they heard this hadith on and on and on from been to amaze a smile to hamas by the way is a great companion of the prophet and she at first was married to jafar nabitali and when he died in the battle of motta as a martyr she married abu bakr dick and he when he died she married adena imagine this great woman this great companion of the prophet salaam she gave him three sons one of them was muhammad jafar abu bakr she gave him one son and that was muhammad even so she had two sons by the name of muhammad and once the story says that while she was married to ali muhammad jafar and muhammad all had a a fight not a fight but they all disputed and each one of them started saying that my father is better than your father yeah of course jaffa and mabel was the cousin of the prophet and he was the beloved cousin of the prophet he looked like the prophet and abu bakr of course is it's needless to say that he's the top in ranking among the muslims he is the the beloved friend of the prophet sallam who believed him and was the first to accept islam when the prophet sallam started calling people to islam so both of them are high caliber but without no doubt who's the best you have no doubt none whatsoever abu bakr is the best companion of all followed by omar followed by uthman and then followed by ali so both boys muhammad mohammed each one said that my father was better than yours so ali ibrahim told their mother to say a statement to relieve both of them so she looked at them and said jaffa is the best among the youth and abu bakr was the best among the old and veteran and ali said you haven't left anything for me and he was her husband the third husband he said you have not left anything if jaffa is the best among the youth the youngsters and abu bakr is the best among the veterans so what's left for me so she told him that freeze a freedom that you are the worst among them is is something that of a high status if you are the third among jaffa and abu bakr then this is not this is not a bad thing to be by the way ahmad bint amaze marriage to these three great men tells us that in islam it is not an insult to be widowed or to be divorced and this is a misconception that some so claimed muslims may have they may look at a divorced woman as a second class or something that has been used and this is not true at all if you read the seerah and if you read the biography of all the companions you would find that lots of the muslim female companions got married more than two or three times this was normal because you cannot guarantee that life goes on smooth with the couple and maybe a person dies during a war or due to an accident or to a illness or something so it is not advised in islam to leave a woman without a husband on the contrary if you look at the wives of the prophet sallam you will find that a lot of them were either widowed or lost the husband to an unfortunate uh uh event and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam married them in order to compensate them in a sense for the calamity that took place with them yeah i was about to say that the prophet sallam when marry only one virgin woman and the other was yes that's that's completely true and this tells you that islam protects each and every individual and the prophet allah told us that he who takes care of a widow or an orphan is with me on the day of judgment like this and he pointed with his two fingers and he told us also in another hadith that he who takes care of the widow or an orphan is like a person fighting for the sake of allah though he is he is in his city in his house yet he is rewarded as those who are fighting uh uh in the cause of allah the almighty ismail also by the way was the sister in law of the prophet because her sister maimuna bintil was the mother of the believers and we will come inshallah to talk about her later on after the battle of khaibar the prophet alaihi salat was salam saw among the slaves one of the jew women her name was safiya even she had an issue and this issue inshallah is what we will discuss after the break so stay tuned so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the hereafter as well each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it and welcome back the prophet sallam had the prisoners of heber and the slaves that were enslaved among them was safiyah binti and she was the daughter of one of the dignitaries of bani annadir and she was also the wife of canaan one of the dignitaries of khaibar she was enslaved and after distributing the the booty of khaibar even may allah be pleased with him had safiyyah in his share so one of the companions of the prophet alison went to the prophet and said o prophet of allah the one safiya in his chair in his share of the booty but because she is the daughter of their dignitary and she is the elite of the women of the jews she is not suitable for anyone except for yourself so the prophet salallahu salaam brought her and he introduced islam to her alhamdulillah she accepted islam so the prophet salallahu set her free and married her and restored her position to her back again after she was the wife and the daughter of the dignitaries of the jews now she is the wife of the prophet sallallahu alaihi and she became to be the mother of the believers and she was highly loved by the prophet she was a very good person and all the wives of the prophet saw were good and and and pious wives of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam also after khaibar was the battle of fiber was over the prophet sallam received an invitation from the wife of sallam ibn mishkam a jew a jew woman sent an invitation to the prophet so the prophet alaihis went and not knowing that this woman had an idea a devious idea and that is to assassinate the prophet she asked those who knew the prophet alaih about the best part of a sheep that he usually likes and they told her that he likes the arm so she put a lot of poison in the arm and shoulder area and she cooked this sheep and gave it to the prophet and his companions which tells us that it is permissible for a muslim to attend and accept the invitation of a non-muslim now this was a jew and it was at the time of battle nevertheless because he was invited he attended so he started to eat him and one of his companion bishop ibn al-bara even ma may allah be pleased with him bishop took one bite in some narrations the prophet sallam took one bite and spit it out immediately bishop because he was first he did not spit it out he swallowed it and the prophet sallam told his companions do not eat from the sheep that sheep because it just spoke to me and told me that it was poisonous bishop may allah be pleased with him suffered some narration say for a while to a period of one year some narrations say no he died instantly but it appears that he it took him a while few months before he died some narrations tell us that he told the prophet salallahu sallam that by allah i felt that the taste was not right but i could not spread it split it out in your presence of prophet of allah so i swallowed it the prophet tells us or the story tells us that the prophet salallahu salaam gathered the jews and in another narration he brought the woman and the narration in al-bukhari tells us that he gathered the jews and told them oh jews i will ask you a question will you be truthful with me and not saying any lies he said yes of course we will do that so he told them who is your father and this is a question when you ask someone about his lineage not who's your straight father who is your great-great-grand father so they said so-and-so to a name that was not right true so the prophet said you have lied your father is so and so so they admitted and said you know best abu qasim this is what you've said is true so again the prophet sallam asked them i'll ask you another question will you be truthful he said allah will tell you if we would say a lie like he did when you told us about our real father so he told them who will be in hell so they said the jews will be in hell for just a while and then we will go out and the prophet said you have lied may allah's curse be upon you you will be there forever and then he said i'll ask you another question and can you be truthful and they said you know you've told us two out of three and you've discovered that we were telling lies so we will tell you the truth so he asked them a straight question have you put poison in this sheep and the jews said yes we have and we and this is exactly the same answer that the woman gave and when asked why they said and she said that we wanted to see if you were a prophet or a king if you were a king you would have it would have killed you and we would have relieved the from you the the world from you but if you were a prophet then allah will inform you and tell you as usual the prophet salallahu set the woman free he pardoned her because whatever took place with him he would set them free but after a while after bishop died then he had to execute her because she killed him and this is exactly what took place also on this year and after the event of uh it was made forbidden for muslims to eat the meat of donkeys as mentioned before and also it was made forbidden for muslims to marry a particular kind of marriage which is known as muta and in english it might be translated into enjoyment and this marriage was allowed twice and then finally made forbidden till the day of judgment and it was allowed due to particular circumstances and the formality of this type of marriage would be to agree a man and woman to agree on a particular dowry and to have the marriage limited for a particular time a particular period of time so a man could propose to a woman and tell her that i would like to marry you for two weeks so on the 14th day without divorce without any commitment the the marriage is void and it's considered to be invalid and she goes her way and he goes his way this was allowed in the very beginning but now at the last uh time it was made forbidden some say it was met forbidden after the battle of aotas and some say it was in khaibar either way it was made forbidden upon muslims to marry this kind of marriage and this is the consensus of scholars of sunnah scholars they all agree on this and it is actually a form of adultery it was permissible for a certain period of time for a certain group of people because they were in deep need of this it's like when someone is stranded in the desert and he has no food except a a pork meat or a dead meat or he does not have drink except wine but this is another issue because scholars say even wine is not permissible for you to drink when you are almost dying of out of thirst because it would increase your thirst it will not relieve you from your thirst scholars say that it was permitted for this particular reason for the need that the muslims had at that time but now if you look at it it's a form of adultery if someone goes to a woman and tells her that i'd like to marry you for two hours for 100 and then after two hours after he got what he wants and she got what she she wanted the marriage is over this is not marriage marriage is a long-term contract where both parties participate in with the approval of the guardian with a dowry with the intention of having children and establishments establishing a family but to have it for such a period of time and it's limited and it's by default void this is not acceptable in islam on the battle of khaibar some stories though the fighting was fierce and strong some narrations say that 16 died from the muslims and others say it was about 18 while the the number of deaths among the jews was higher and greater and this is this was due to the fact that most of the fights were either dual or what was uh caused by the archers from the jewish side uh shooting and throwing their arrows at the muslims there was not a confrontation in the sense of an army facing another army so there is no there is no big fighting it's only arose only yes and and and duels probably now among the other villages around was the village of fadak and fedex themselves they were of jews and just as the prophet sallam was at khaibar they sent their invoice to the prophet telling them telling him that we surrender no need even to come and do anything and they've agreed with the prophet sallam to work in their village and to give him half of what they make out of that after that the prophet sallallahu moved to wadi al-qura where it had some jews and arabs polytheists there and he also besieged that village but inshallah we will try to continue talking about this uh expedition when we meet next time until then finally um hmm um"
