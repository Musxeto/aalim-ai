  "transcript": "aldam if you recall it's quite critical that we emphasize on this last time we met we spoke about the prophet Alat postponing and delaying Salat until the sun has set and we know that we have to pray on time however sometimes we have a meeting sometimes we're engaged in something or we're at the hospital or in a government office and we are unable to pray so we think until the following prayer comes so can I pray can I make up for the prayer that I've missed or not it's an issue of dispute among Scholars the majority say this you can you're sinful but you can however the most authentic authentic opinion is that you cannot pray a prayer that it's time was over unless the reason for you missing it is legitimate and what are the legitimate reasons the prophet saysat wasam if a person sleep over a prayer or forgets it not delay it he forgets it then he should pray it as soon as he remembers it he should pray it as soon as he remembers it because there is no there is no experation except that now analyze the Hadith there is no kafar meaning that he did a sin he was asleep and if you're asleep Allah doesn't burden you true he forgot it completely and if you forget something does Allah hold you accountable no nevertheless the prophet said that its experation is to pray it as soon as you remember or as soon as you wake up and that is why may Allah have mercy on his soul said is fixed on time that it was prescribed in a specific time prayer is prescribed cribed at a specific time meaning that if you do not pray it in its specific time you did not pray it and likewise with everything that is time Bound in Islam for example when do we stand on mounta on the 9th on the 9th of hij of if someone takes the Visa buys a ticket goes to the airport and then he's delayed in the airport because of a strike and then he reaches Saudi Arabia jida airport but then he has a problem with his visa and he's delayed for a day or two when it is the 12th of 3 Days Later he's cleared out he goes immediately to arafa and sits there with his umbrella what are you doing brother he says I'm standing in arafa yes but arafa is only limited to the 9th of close your umbrella and leave said no no I was forced to do this and I'm standing in araa is his Hajj acceptable no because he did not do it on time likewise if someone's heard thean of and he's in a meeting and people tell him there is half an hour before ass go and pray so no no no I'll just finish Now quickly 15 minutes 10 minutes 5 minutes before the aan he said I cannot leave we have delegation I have to stay and thean is called for now what is his duty does he pray and then says no he cannot pray is gone huh what do you mean gone I want to make it up I want to do this it's football match or whatever all of these people did not pray prayer on time and the evidence is the Hadith of the Prophet the two reasons forgetfulness and sleeping which a person is actually not sinful yet the prophet said that the only experation is to pray them as soon as he remembers makes it quite clear that if you deliberately postpone a prayer without any legitimate reason then in this case you cannot make it up okay what about the prophet Alam the prophet might have forgotten it because of the fear and might have been postponed deliberately because we have two things on the scale your life or your prayer so you advance you prioritize it by saying no my life is more important once I'm able I pray and this Cascades inshallah to all things that are hazardous to your life you may do this a pilot is in an emergency landing it's time for prayer he takes an hour or two flying in horrendous conditions one of the engine is out the other is on flames and he goes to the co-pilot listen I'm going to pray M and come back the whole people are going to die going to crash this is an issue of emergency and one should do that I hope this makes it clear if you have any questions we will allocate this inshallah at the end of the segment the grace of Allah we move on to Hadith number 52 and who will give us the honor yes brother narrated Abbas once Allah's messenger sallallah alaihi wasallam delayed the Isha prayer then Umar alab said oh prophet of Allah the woman and the children have slept the prophet came out and water was trickling from his head and then said hadn't I thought it hard for my followers I would have ordered them to offer Salat Isa at this time bukari this Hadith as we've mentioned so many times is a manifestation to what the prophet wished of course there are a number of narrations of this Hadith and each narration is used differently in different chapters for example the same Hadith of anas a different narration huh this is by Abbas a different narration by anas may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet used to delay the Isha prayer until the companions waiting for the prayer in the Masjid would fall drowsy and their heads would their chins would uh touch their chest because of their you know drowsing and and and waking so a lot of the scholars use this narration in the chapters dealing with Tara why to emphasize whether sleeping nullifies woodo or not so does sleeping nullify woodo yes or no yes I've seen people doing this deep sleep deep sleep deep sleep deep sleep yes deep sleep and what does deep sleep by itself nullifies w no the scholars say it is means of nullification but the Sleep itself does not nullify wo and that is why the prophet in an authentic Hadith that the eye is similar to the rope that you tie a water container made of leather with so the ey to the Aus because if you're awake you know if something comes out of you if you Fast Wind so the prophet says the eye to the anus is like the rope that ties a leather water container if you close it the Rope is untight which means that the water would come out and likewise if you sleep the possibility of you passing wind without feeling it is quite possible that is why sleep itself is not means of actual nullification of the woodo but it causes to and therefore the scholars say if a person sleeps lightly while being able to feel the surroundings then this does not nullify woo example a person is in a taxi going back to the hotel or in a bus or in a train and he's shaking and you know children the minute you put them in cars they because of the shaking of the movement we grown up also have this problem if you're tired and if you're in the car you just may do this and you know your head goes right and left and turning now does this mean I have nullified my Scholars say no because while I'm in this drowsiness if someone says aam is fat I immediately I'm alert HH I work out what do you mean by I'm fat and if someone tries to steal something from my pocket I immediately I'm alert why because I'm sitting I'm in a ready position scholar say that is why if you are sitting down and your drowsiness is light and you can feel the environment then this napping does not nullify your woodo but if you're lying down it's different than when you're sitting up because you're sitting up the position is not helping you to pass wind for example if you're lying down and you go into a nap usually you would not feel a thing and those who are lying down people come and take things from their pocket you know make change of the money and put the wallet back again and they do not feel anything this is definitely means of breaking your woodo so this Hadith was used in a number of different chapters here the prophet Alam postponed Salat and the companions were waiting patiently but Omar may Allah be pleased with him because he saw what was happening he complained to the prophet Alat what did he say this is inshallah what we will find after the break so stay tuned assalam alaykum and welcome back the Hadith of Abbas may Allah be pleased with him stated that the prophet wasam delayed prayer until complained to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this shows us that it is okay to advise someone who is older than you someone who is greater and bigger than you because this would not be impolite and we always make the mistake of thinking that if a sheh or an IM does something wrong it is impolite to go and correct him or advise him now this is wrong you have to correct him and advise him but what you should avoid is to do it in an insultive way or in a rude way or to make it to the public so that you would discredit him this is something that would not be advisable so Omar says the prophet of Allah women and children they are there and they are having a problem because they fell asleep and this is not the appropriate place for them to fall asleep and the prophet came out with his head showered recently and the prophet said by Allah had I not feared that I would burden my umah I would have made this time mandatory for them to praya in why is that the more you come to the middle of the night to the last third of the night this is the preferred time for Allah and that is why the best time of the day for us is the last third of the night two or 3 hours before F before the break of dawn this is the time of the righteous the time of the ignorant it's this time because they sleep the righteous always wake before F time they make their tud they make their Witter they recite their portion of the Quran they ask Allah for forgiveness because this is the time when Allah Asel Des sends to the lower heaven and heel calls his servants is there anyone who asks me so that I can answer him is there anyone who seeks my forgiveness so I would forgive him is there anyone seeking my repentance so that I would repent over him every night this happens and rarely we wake up for this great opportunity of answering Allah so we should try our best to devote some of the night for the sake of Allah we open the floor for questions we take one question from my right and one question from my left so those who on the left would get the microphone ready yes she when somebody insults wasallam what should the Muslims do number one and number two when you say in the Battle of trench was fearful or he had fear maybe so is there a Del for that in the Battle of trench because missed Salah he was fearful or he had fear is there a Del for that as far as is concerned not as for the first question whenever someone insults the prophet Alat wasam we have to look on the circumstances if we are in an Islamic State that practices Islam and implements Islam this person should be taken to the authorities and he should be tried and then executed there is no playing with the prophet Alam unfortunately this is not applied or applicable except in one or two countries in the world Islamic countries and therefore now days if someone insults the prophet or attacks the prophet due to the fact that we're not living in Muslim countries or we're living in Muslim countries that is not practicing Islam we have nothing that we can do except to shun that person and leave him and not communicate with him discommunication completely with that person as for the second question what is the evidence that the prophet was afraid I did not say he was afraid in the sense that he feared the enemy so he was fleeing them fear is a natural thing and the prophet was human so he might have been intimidated he might have been trying to avoid what was happening of clashes of someone attacking and this is only human there is nothing degrading or Unworthy of the Prophet Alat wasam his anticipation and his being there on the watch until time was over and M Sunset was there is a clear indication that this is what had happened yet it is not in the sense that oh the prophet was afraid that he's a coward nobody thinks this way and at the same time we would not say that the prophet was a superhuman and that he was not a natural person this is also not the case and Allah Knows Best yes brother Salam do we have to offer Sunnah with the first Salah which is offered after the prescribed time with the legitimate reasons excellent question the prophet when he told us to pray immediately as we remember it he did not indicate what to do regarding the Sunnah prayer and the scholars say as long as the reason is legitimate and as if you are praying it on time so if I over sleep on fuder prayer and I wake up at 10:00 a.m. what is the first thing I do I pray and then pray the two why because my prayer is legitimate and it was missed for a legitimate reason so I hope this answers your question yes brother shik alhamdulillah the uniqueness of the timing which you mentioned which has been mentioned and we are blessed that anywhere in the anywhere any part of the world there could be fjer somewhere could be ass Isa alhamdulillah so no time goes without uh the Muslims offering the Salah alhamdulillah sh my question is that what happens in places like Scandinavian countries like Norway and other places where the sun sets and after a little time it rises up again so what is the ruling on that regarding the countries that have sunrise and sunset the ruling applies even if the night was short even if it was 2 hours you have to pray in accordance to the timings given to you before while observing the Sun the question would not be here the question should have been what do the people in the North Pole for example or in the the far Scandinavian countries where night is prevailing they don't see the Sun for few months or few weeks or they see the sun continuously throughout the day in this case we cannot determine our prayers by observing the sun true because there is no Break of Dawn and there is no Sunset what to do Scholars say that alhamdulillah Islam did not leave any stone unturned in the sense that in theith of Muslim where the Prophet was telling the companions about a Dalal the Antichrist how many days he will spend on Earth 40 days one day is equivalent to a year one day is equivalent to a month a third is equivalent to a week and the rest of the days are like your normal days the first thing the companions asked was oh prophet of Allah the day that is equivalent to a year should we pray the prayer of one day meaning throughout this day only five prayers and the prophet said no meaning that this year is actually 360 days but the sun takes 360 days to set so the prophet said no you have to pray and calculate for your prayers meaning you have to estimate so we know that us usually between F and there is six or seven hours so okay now it's time and after 2 hours and a half it's time and after 3 hours it's time and after an hour and 15 minutes is time this is what the prophet said calculate for the portion of the day as much as you can and that is why the major Scholars and committees said that the people in Scandinavia and in the places where the sun does not set they have to calculate they estimate how they estimate by looking at the closest country to their South where you can determine prayer times and they should follow them so if you are in the furthest North you go a little bit South 200 km 300 km and there's a country that has sunrise and sunset you follow their time of prayer likewise for fasting by the way how would these people fast the sun is all week long or maybe a month long they say you have to do the same with fasting estimating when the sunrise and when there is the sun set as we know that praying F prayer any Muslims skip it due to over sleeping so is it a legitimate cause okay if you deliberately skip this is not a legitimate cause this is not a legitimate reason how do you skip it intentionally by setting the alarm clock at 6:30 or 7:00 you start work at 10: you set it at 9:00 deliberately in this case don't pray it don't even bother because you deliberately done that but if you go to bed at 10:00 or 11:00 and you set your alarm clock at 5:30 and you have four or I know people who have four or five alarm clocks and if they can buy a cannon they would buy a Canon next to their ears and they never wake up and they feel remorse they feel depressed but this is their nature would Allah hold them accountable the answer is no so skipping F prayer for sleeping is a legitimate cause if you tried and failed but if you definitely did not try or went to bed late and you refused to set the alarm clock then you are sinful I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time ah"
