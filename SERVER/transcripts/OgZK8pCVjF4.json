  "transcript": "Rizwan says I read in one of your tweets reply that in congregation prayers while standing up from ruku the followers need not to say semi Allahu Liman Hamidah what the Imam says is sufficient so what should they say then is it only for some aluminum and Hamidah or all other commands which the Imam says like Allahu Akbar while starting the prayer and for standing up from salute etc are only actions sufficient for all these or do we need to say something this one your question can be answered as follows those who pray are one of three either an imam with the congregation behind him or an moom who is one of the congregation behind an imam or an individual praying on his own whether a man or a woman in her home so for all of the three it is mandatory to say Allahu Akbar throughout the movement of their prayers of course the first takbir Allahu Akbar the first one which is known as takbir to a haram this is not mandatory only this is a pillar of salat if the Imam or the moon or the individual skips saying Allahu Akbar in the beginning their prayer is invalid other than that all the movements in salat where they say Allahu Akbar is mandatory for all now with the exception of when rising up from the rock or so if I'm in the bowing position subhanAllah Biennale I'd like to stand up the in and the individual they say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah what does literally semi Allahu Liman Hamidah means it means Allah answers and responds to those who praise Him so this is what the Imam is saying and this is what the individual praying on his own is saying they both say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah once they are all standing up from the bowing position to the standing position all three the Imam the moon and the individual say Robin Wallach al hamd so the Imam and the individual said semi Allahu Liman Hamidah Allah responds and answers to those who praise Him and then they follow that by saying okay we praise allah rabbun allah can hand o Allah to you beat all praise but the indeed that the follower them mooom he when he raises his head up he does not say semi Allah on him and Hamidah because he just heard the Imam stating to him telling him that Allah answers and responds to those who praise him so when he stands up he praises Allah soldier by saying Robin elekid hamd Hamlin Cathy Alon pay even Mubarak and fee to the end of the various supplications and Dras so I hope this answers your question"
