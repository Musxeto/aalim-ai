  "transcript": "bismillah al Rahman al Rahim and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa I really he or a soda hill Ameen nabina muhammad in wider rd he was happy he remain I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have today hadith number 128 from the blessed book of M that will a camp and this hadith was narrated by what rod who was the clerk of Alma rear of the Shah Baba may Allah be pleased with him he said that once and mahira dictated me in a letter addressed to more aware even abu sufyan may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam used to say after every compulsory prayer used to say meaning that this was his son that he always maintained saying this la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah lahul mulku lillah alhamd wahoo kaliesha in Kadir allahumma la ma√±ana ma Arpita one a more clear remember not what I am for the JD Michael jet which translates to none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and for him is the kingdom and all the praises are for him and he is omnipotent oh Allah nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what you hold back the wealth and prosperity of a person will not avail him from you what God said I went to MU how here after that sometime late and heard him ordering the people to say that and in another narration the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam used to forbade gossip for you wasting money and asking too many questions and he used to forbade disobeying mothers to bury your daughter's alive and not to pay the rights of others and to beg from others now this hadith illustrates that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam used to have or used to say a number of things after he concludes his prayer and scholars say that before the salaam it is time for dois it is time for supplications but after the salaam it is time for Vicar and that is why scholars say it is not part of the sunnah to raise the hands after every single mandatory prayer making dua and supplicating to allah and they even go further to say that this is an innovation why it is very simple what is the definition of innovation it is doing something and maintaining on doing it though the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not do it and this has to be related to matters of the Deen matters of the religion so for example one cannot say that riding cars is innovation wearing watches is innovation because this is not related to the religion however if someone says that after fajar prayer I would like to recite Surat ilaha illallah w'allahu efetch 21 times what is the ruling on that well we have to analyze its after salat aphasia its reciting surah of the Quran on a particular number or due to or according to a specific manner and the answer would be this is an innovation why first of all because the Prophet Allah saw Sarah did not do it nor his companions if you're trying to get closer to Allah by innovating this is not acceptable and to go a bit further there is a difference between innovating and following the general instruction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam how is that if someone tells me to recite surat al-baqara seven times or a hundred and three times so that this or that can happen this is an innovation because it is not part of the Sunnah of the Prophet erase a lot of cinema but if someone decides to say a star for Allah seeking Allah's forgiveness uncounted of times meaning that from this position till I reach my house I may say it a thousand times I may say it a hundred thousand times is there any problem in that the answer is no why isn't this an innovation the answer is no because the Prophet RA salat wa sallam told us generally to seek Allah's forgiveness not only that the Prophet sallallaahu Adi who are you were seldom also told us that we should do what is needed to be done in the sense that a large L told us in the Quran seek Allah's forgiveness so no matter how many times you seek Allah's forgiveness this is an open instruction unlike when someone says seek Allah's forgiveness 1274 times specifically why he said if you do this this way that may happen to you this is an innovation so if we come to the door after prayer one would say didn't the Prophet I thought tell us to supplicate to Allah didn't a large soldier commanded us to supplicate for him and that's release yes this is General Order or instruction so what is wrong in doing it after every mandatory prayer ah what is wrong is that we know that the Prophet Allah saw some prayed ten years in Medina never once after prayer he faced the congregation raised his hands and supplicated and they said I mean not only once it was reported to us that he supplicated on his own raising his hands facing the Qibla or the Companions therefore doing this would not be part of the synonym now having said that when there is a need that is not maintained every single form it is permissible for example I prayed Asia and after Asia I am supposed to go and propose to a woman for marriage so after I finished my prayer I raise my hands and supplicate to Allah o Allah facilitate this for me and make this happen not because it's after for prayer but because I need a large diversion on this particular thing I need Allah in everything but I have an incident that I need his guidance and help immediately so scholars say this is okay there is no problem in that whenever you have a need you do but what people do every single prayer and there is their hands and they do and mumble hum with things that they don't even think about and then they wipe their faces and their bodies this is not part of the Sunnah so what did the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam say he used to say la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah the whole milk well a whole ham wha-hoo ala kulli shayyin qadir this is his sunnah to say and to testify that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except him and everything belongs to him and he is the only praised one and then he would say sallalaho aleyh wassallam that nobody can hold back what you give and nobody can give what you hold back and this is very important to believe not only to say because once you believe in this then your trust and dependence and reliance on allah azza wajal would be perfect and complete and once you have this full dependence and telecoil on Allah Azza WA JAL nothing can harm you and nothing can bring you down because you believe in Allah Azza WA JAL our problem is that we depend entirely on our knowledge we depend entirely on our health we depend entirely on our bank accounts and we depend entirely on others and that is why you find people so worried when anything affects their income their bank account their salaries you find people worried when they get ill you find people worried when their jobs are threatened why because they do not have full trust and dependence on Allah Azza WA JAL when you say these beautiful words and you believe in them then you have true dependence and to a code and if you have full dependence and TOEIC : Allah Allah will give you provisions from sources and means you did not anticipate the Prophet said alehissalaam if you have true to a code true trust and dependence on Allah then Allah will provide for you as he does for the birds the birds yes the Prophet said they leave early morning with empty stomachs and they come at the end of the day a with full stomachs so the Prophet is telling us to depend on Allah but depending on Allah does not mean you sit back idle depending on Allah does not mean that you do what the Sufis do they don't work they don't act they don't seek Allah's provisions but they sit in the message it with prayer beads 1000 or 2000 pieces of them and they just say Allah Allah lalala what is this they say we're making liquor the profit never made liquor by repeating Allah's name - no no this is one of the ways of getting closer to allah azza wajal okay who feeds you whatever the people give us it's from a large soil so you're begging people this is not the way of the Prophet area solution ah this is not the way of the companions may allah be pleased with them so you have to go and work but when you work your dependence and reliance is on Allah Azza WA JAL I'm not depending on people I'm not looking at what people have in their hands I'm looking at what Allah Azza WA JAL has Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and that is why I am relying entirely on him and this is why he will grant me he will provide for me as he does for the birds the birds leave their homes do they have a bachelor degree no do they have any experience that supports them no they depend on Allah Azza WA JAL they look for food and they come back with full stomachs and then the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that those who have wealth and prosperity their wealth and their prosperity would not avail them from Allah no matter how rich you are would your wealth help you or protect you from Allah there is nothing that can protect you from Allah Azza WA JAL it would not do you any good to be the strongest man in the world or the richest man in the world or the most famous man in the world this would not help you at all at the sight of Allah Azza WA JAL now imagine that Muslims say this supplication every single mandatory prayer and if they believe in it Allah Azza WA JAL would reward them and would grant them the Eman in their hearts because they're full dependence on Allah Azza WA JAL their reliance is on Allah Azza WA JAL no matter what happens in the world I know it took place because allah awj decreed it so if I lose a loved one if I fall sick if I lose my money I could not care much I would worry a little bit because I'm human but my heart is connected with Allah and I know that Allah did not choose this except because there was good in it for me we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back Salaam alaikum and welcome back when Al mahira may allah be pleased with him wrote his letter to mahalia who was the halifa of the muslims at the time what right says that i went after some time to syria to a sham where Marya was and i heard him instructing people to do that what does that mean it means that the Companions were so quick in complying with the instructions of the Prophet Allah salat wa salam whenever they heard something that was useful especially from another companion such as Alma Veera they complied with it they didn't just learn things as a form of luxury they learned things to apply in their lives and this is what every Muslim should do because if you learn something and you do not apply it in your life on the day of judgment Allah will ask you why didn't you do it so it would become a burden on you it's there for everything you learn you have to apply and especially if it's mandatory but if it's a Sunnah which is not sinful not to do it is highly recommended that you do it the Prophet described it as if you are riding and this is what people used to justify what they're saying they claim I'm not saying that's true they claim this I am also repeating it and the Prophet says that this is Haram so the first thing that the Prophet item forbade was the chit-chatting and the gossiping then wasting of money and how do a person waste his money how does a person waste his money well by spending it in things that are not useful or rather by spending it on Haram so if you spend your money on Haram this is definitely forbidden and it's prohibited because you're actually doing Haram doing something that's forbidden but even if you waste your money on something that is useless someone who has the hobby of collecting cockroaches so he has a farm of 50 or 70 cockroaches and he puts them in a house and he feeds them what would we call this hobby of his how long why because he's wasting his money on something that is not permissible buying Haram such as buying things that are forbidden movies music buying a dog is haram buying a cat is haram and people say huh-huh first time we know this yes this is hadith authentic and so hey hey I'm a Muslim that the Prophet Allah says I'm forbade the price of a cat so you cannot buy a cat and you cannot sell a cat if you get a cat as a gift yes if you give it away as a gift yes selling it and buying it's forbidden likewise a dog the price of a dog is forbidden you're not allowed to buy or to sell dogs so wasting money in Islam is Haram and part of wasting your money is buying novels buying stories that do not add value to you and if these stories are forbidden then they become forbidden as well so if you buy for example Harry Potter's novels or watched in movies it's all about sorcery it's all lies it's all fiction and it's forbidden for you as a Muslim to believe in such things in people giving life to the dead or changing them into snakes or changing them into animals out of this no one can do except allah azzawajal so this would be considered of wasting your money and then the Prophet said Ali his salat WA Salam and asking too many questions this translation has taken one meaning only because the hadith is what customer to sue Al and so al might be asking questions as in the case when you sit sometimes with people in a train or on the plane or in a public transportation and the man next to you starts to interrogate you and you answer his questions as little as possible good day yes thank you what are you going I'm going to this particular City masha'Allah you from there no where are you from you married how many children do you have a job what's your job what's your title what's your salary oh that's a lot oh no that's too little you have another job you have siblings you have family what do you do for your Ledyard what is this what is that what what is this want what it we did it happen and he starts to interrogate you and this is not permissible in Islam the Prophet says alayhi salatu salam min Hosni islam ilmar e naraku who malayani it is part of the true islam of an individual that he does not engage himself in things that are not related to him this is not a business so when someone starts asking you like this you can either bluntly tell him it's none of your business or you can dodge his questions and the third way which I usually find it interesting is that you interrogate him yourself so when he says where do you live tell them I live in so-and-so what about you he says I live in so-and-so he live alone or in your house is it rented or you bought it and once he sees this barrage of attack he will refrain and stop from asking you because whatever he asks you of one question you ask him three questions unfortunately there are people are like this so nosey so irritating that sometimes the only medication for them is to gave them a taste of their own medicine and then the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam and he also used to forbid roko put on my hat here it says disobeying mothers and this is not the correct translation Oh coke is further than only disobeying is disrespecting as well and the Prophet told us that he who disrespects or disobeys his parents will not enter paradise like it hulu Ginetta ah he will not enter paradise because it is one of the major sins to disobey and disrespect your parents the hadith again Laird Hulu Jenna he will not enter Jenna who's ever is ah whoever is disrespectful and disobedient to his parents so it's a major sin and that is why when the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was once with his companions he said should I tell you about the most major sins and they said yes he said one associating others with Allah to disrespecting and disobeying your parents and he was leaning down then he sat up straight and said to say falsehood and to testify falsehood so this shows you how severe and great disobeying and disrespecting the parents and he also forbade from burying the girls while they were alive this was a tradition of the pre-islamic era they used to feel that girls are a bad omen so when a man's wife gives birth to a child if it's a boy he's happy and if it's a girl he either buries her immediately after birth when she's still a few days old or he waits until she is like six or seven years old and then he buries her he kills her and this was mentioned in al quran in surah attack we're worried alluded to so elect bi edom been cut alert if the girl who is buried in her infancy is asked with what burden was she buried and killed and finally the Prophet Allah saw salam forbade given withhold so he sallallahu land forbade those who do not give the needy if there's a poor person and I have zakat I prevent him from taking there's the card this is forbidden and also the Prophet forbade me from asking something that is not lawful for me I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fear Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
