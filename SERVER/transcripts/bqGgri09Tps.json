  "transcript": "i read that taklid is rajib for anyone who is not a mushtahed is this true these are islamic terminologies taklit is blindly following someone without evidence wajib is compulsory mushtahid is the highest rank of a scholar who has the ability to look through the evidences of the quran the sunnah and the previous scholars with his knowledge and detect what is the most suitable and correct opinion of all so now zaid's question is i heard that blindly following a person without evidence is wajib is mandatory is that true this depends on the individual people are categorized into three levels a scholar who is a mushtahit who does not imitate or blindly follow others rather he has to it's an obligation that he looks into the evidences of the quran of the sunnah of the in through the understanding of the favorite three generations looks into the different opinions and then comes up comes up with his own opinion that is 99.99 following those who came before him but he's doing that through his own observation not through cherry picking the second and these people the mushtahits the ulama they're a handfu uh myani um they're few of them the second level is those who are classified as students of knowledge and students of knowledge are people with appropriate amount of knowledge but they're not classified as scholars yet so they have the basics of the english the arabic language knowledge of the quran of the tafseer of the hadith authentic or not authentic of us and the others so they come and they look and search a topic they cannot come up with their own ishtihad rather they have to look into the six seven different ishtihads of previous scholars and come up with a conclusion that one of them is the most authentic and they adopt this so takleed for such people is not permissible because they have the means to search and they have the tools that would qualify them to search the third segment of people and this is the largest of them all are the laymen who can be professors in the university medical doctors neurosurgeons engineers pilots intellectuals but their knowledge in islamic sharia is negligible such people must follow someone or a math hab because allah says in the quran must ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so they ask and whatever the sheikh tells them they comply without knowing the evidence because even if the sheikh tells them the evidence they wouldn't know whether this is quran sunnah or just a quotation from tom dick or harry they wouldn't know so in this case yes such people must follow but they must not be blind followers for a school of thought in whatever they say good or bad because on the day of judgment allah would ask you about two things what were you worshiping meaning sincerity allah azzawajal of lordship worship and this fat the second question what did you answer the messengers that were sent to you so this means that you have to answer and follow the messengers and allah"
