  "transcript": "I was telling someone about the story of uh the monk who was praying and his mom called him and he wasn't able to respond so his mom cured him and uh the C called him so this person asked me what a mon was so um I didn't know what it means okay this is a story that was reported in IM Muslim and other books of Hadith where the Prophet saidat once said to his companions only three spoke in their infancy and he mentioned the story of J and he told us that jur was one of the monks of the sons of ezrael the Jews so he was a monk he was a God-fearing person worshiping Allah asael in his Monastery or in his small Hut on the top of a mountain and people spoke hugely about his righteousness and his God-fearing so a prostitute said I could seduce him and they said no way and they said to her if you succeed in seducing him we would give you so and so and this shows you how evil are the people who are away from Allah they won't rest until they see righteous and practicing people fall in such such swamps of Filth so she went and tried to seduce him and failed and this caused her to go and commit commit Zena with a shepherd and got pregnant out of that and after giving birth she came to the people and said this is the son of J so they took him down from his uh um place of worship and they uh uh demolished it after they thought that he was exposed not to be a real righteous person and they dragged him to the judge or to the king and when he was faced with the charges he said let me pray two raas and bring the child which was few days old so he did that and when he finished the prayer he poked the child and he said child who's your father so Allah made the infant speak and said my father is the shepherd so they set him free now this was all the result of a da a Dua a supplication J mother did against him in time in a time of Rage she over the duration of 3 days consecutively coming to him while he was at prayer shouting at him from the from downhill oh J oh J I'd like to speak to you and while he's engaged in prayer he kept on doubting which is best to continue his prayer for Allah or to interrupt his prayer and attend his mom so he continued prayer second day the same thing the third day the same thing when she was so angry he did not answer her back she said may Allah not make you die until you look at the faces of prostitutes and it was a strange Dua because the guy doesn't have social media he's not on Tik Tok and he doesn't watch YouTube and he doesn't visit downtown to have some fun every Saturday night so when this happened and they dragged him to the court or to the king's uh quarters or to the judge Court they passed throughout the town by a brother and there was like the red District in Amsterdam all them uh night workers so he looked and he remembered his mom's Dua and he smiled and they thought oh look at him the Sheikh is smiling because of these prostitutes what an evil man not knowing why so when they asked him he explain that so I hope this and I apologize for taking so long uh"
