  "transcript": "um she when I hear lectures or um any if I watch any Islamic videos I take notes of the Hadith or the quot quotes of the sahabi or the the words of the salaf so that when I talk to people about Islam or give them advice I have some evidence to what I'm saying so that people don't say that where is this Hadith from so that I can give evidence but um recently I don't know if what I'm doing is right because I heard one of the shik say that if a person gains knowledge only for the purpose of talking to people and not for their own benefit then this is prohibited because you are not doing this for your own uh growth of your for your own Islam but to talk to people only so I wanted your advice on this situation so because I don't know if I should continue writing what I'm hearing Amar amarar are you listening to these lectures in order to impress people yes or no no no are you listening to these lectures to be able to give or a present ation or to uh uh rule a gathering and be prominent yes or no no no then this ignore this this is from Shan you're listening to the lecture to benefit to learn and you're writing down whatever benefit you have learned so that you can quote it we all do this this is Froman ignore it and don't listen to any of such Whispers and keep on the good work you're doing inshallah"
