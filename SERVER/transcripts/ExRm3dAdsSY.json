  "transcript": "Oh Miriam's question is about esta harem how can we make it stay harem if you read the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it's a single hadith and if you read it you will benefit and learn from it and know exactly what is to be done and what is not to be done so the Prophet says al it's awesome whenever one attempts to do something this means either hadouken bill animal meaning that it is not to make a choice between two things I have two pens this one and this one so this black and this is blue which one to buy I wouldn't praise the Hara so that Allah would direct me and guide me to which one to buy this is not how Sahara works a man has two proposals one who lives in a zurka and the other one lives in a man so he's hesitant which one to get married to then he praises Sahara no this is this is not the way it works then how does it work the Prophet says awesome when someone attempts to do something meaning that I made up my mind to get married to the one who lives in a circle now I've made up my mind the conditions the qualifications the description fits what I want I made up my mind now I praise the Hara then what is the use of a Sahara ha the ISTE Hara is asking Allah Azza WA JAL to choose whether this marriage is good for me or not whether buying that car is good for me or not whether applying for this job which I have already got my mind made up on picking it is it good for me or not so I say the dua after I prayed so the prophecy assigned me the hammer had to compel Emery failure solid titanium in doing it for Allah you have to pray to rock as other than the freedom so Shannel fuzzier does a job it does the job the hated message does the job no problem boo ha prayer go for it so I pray 2 rakats after I give Salam according to the most authentic opinion of scholars I ask Allah do I raise my hands or not it's not mentioned in the hadith so say it without raising your hands and what do I say you say oh Allah Allah - the hero capital Mick watch dr. cabbie of idiotic was a newcomer in publican are we find Nikita the rock deal with Harlem wallah Adam indica and tell them who you you say these words I'm not at liberty to translate them you can find them in the fortress of the Muslim on Maryam I am presuming you're an Arab so I shall let you know so you say this asking Allah if marrying that woman buying that car applying for that job is good for me and for my welfare in this dunya and in the acura then make it happen and make it easy for me to get it and attain it but if it is not good for me in this dunya or in the acura and it's not good for my affairs then take it away from me and give me something better than it in its place and make me satisfied with that so you're asking a lot to make me satisfied with the choice sure I almost died just to get that car I love that car I pray the Sahara I could not buy it ok this is from Allah but if you're Sahara was original if you ask a lot there was your whole whole heartedly you would have felt comfortable so when you praise the harder and make the door and you apply and you propose and you move on go ahead and progress in whatever you want it to do and it doesn't materialize you feel content you never have regrets you would never come after ten years and say had I bought that car ten years ago life would have been different had I married that woman I would have done this and that no because you pray the Sahara you gave your control to allah azzawajal to choose for you and when allah did that you accepted it and were content with it about the conditions i don't know what you meant by that but some people say okay is it part of a stay Hara now I've proposed to the woman in a zurka and I saw a dream and in the dream there were a lot of snakes with blue eyes so that is this related search should i cancel it no he dreams have no impact on istikhara a lot of the girls call and say a man proposed I pray this Tahara and then he cancelled the proposal and when we asked the family why he said that his mother saw a nightmare related to the marriage and they cancelled it this is this is related to straight on Satan himself personally came and gave your mother this dream so that he would cancel righteous and and good and pious wedding like that so stay Haram has nothing to do with dreams it doesn't have anything to do with a sign so I looked at the sky and I saw like a window opening no there's nothing like this this is all nonsense it is not it does has nothing to do with I went out of my home and there was a car crash or there was a black cat dead on the doorway or what all of this is nonsense so what is the harem make up your mind to choose something pray two Rakas that are not related to Farb make the doora and move on continue proceed with it and in sha allah if there's good in it Allah will make it happen"
