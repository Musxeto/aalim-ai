  "title": "Is it authentic to repeat duas / supplications 3 times or in odd numbers? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I I read a Hadith of prophet Muhammad sallu alai wasallam which says U we should actually uh supplicate when we are supplicating we need to repeat the supplication maybe thce or in odd numbers in sah alkari I read it so is this authentic and should be always supplicate in odd numbers or three times the prophet liked and preferred as we mentioned this in on Thursday's episode in the things that the prophet loves he whenever he would make Dua he would make it Thrice and this is not a general statement meaning that every Dua I see for the prophet I would find that he would make it Thrice rather he would used to do he used to do this but occasionally so for us if you want Allah to forgive you as we when we conclude the Salat the Sunnah is to say the first thing three times not like people saying in the subcontinent which is wrong a lot of the Muslims say the moment they sayb this is totally wrong and this is not backed up by a Hadith that the prophet used to say this am on the contrary thei of in Muslim he said the first thing the prophet said after Salam is then Etc so making Dua Thrice is a good thing but it is not mandatory if you want to do it that's good for you the more you insist upon Allah the closer it is for you to get your Dua answered"
