  "title": "How to combat Islamophobia that is demonstrated through media? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you mentioned as you mentioned before uh there are so many countries that uh sharing hatred about Islam and you simply were saying boycott their product it might be economic growth might be distracted no my question is about uh if the uh in the recent days the media plays a significant role though shaping public opinion about Islam how do you think this impact effort to combat the Islamic will be shared by media right now thank you okay first of all the media tries but they will never succeed because the religion is not mine or yours it's Allah and Allah in the Quran said that he will give Victory to his word and to his religion so I have no problem with that the problem is what did we do in the media to honor our religion now if you go to the vast majority of Muslims Instagram I don't know what and you look into it do you find in the timeline ten percent about Islam you will never find ten percent five percent maybe one percent and the rest is all about movies about women about their profile picture I'm looking like this now today I'm and you see pictures yeah the people are proud of their pictures and it's ugly but they say no it's good it's nice and you get likes likes of what yeah if you put a picture of a dog you will get likes so the Muslims are not honoring their Islam so the media will continue to write things about Islam but it will nobody believes it nobody believes that this is bad about Islam because Muslims alhamdulillah are strong but we have to see what have we presented to Islam so when the media does bad things what should we do burn demonstrate protest no we write good things about Islam we be proactive and positive inshallah um"
