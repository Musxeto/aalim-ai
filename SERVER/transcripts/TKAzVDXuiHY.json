  "transcript": "[Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam IM Muslim in the reported that abuur may Allah be pleased with him said our Prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam once addressed us and said six are the duties of a Muslim over another Muslim it was said to him oh prophet of Allah what are these the prophet replied sallallahu alaih alh wasallam when you meet him offer him greetings when he invites you to a feast accept it when he seeks your counsel advise him and when he sneezes says alhamdulillah all praise is due to Allah you say may Allah have mercy upon you when he falls ill visit him and when he dies follow his funeral we talked last time we met about the greetings of Islam and one may ask why is it that a lot of the Muslims when they meet others they don't start them with the greetings well unfortunately this is a sign of the weakness of Iman and belief in their hearts because a true practicing Muslim would greet those who see him those who come face to face with him because he would like to get the reward that Allah has put for those who spread the greetings of Islam the prophet Alat wasam once was with his companions a man came in and said alayum so the prophet said 10 and then another man came and said and the prophet said 20 and then a third man came saying and the prophet said third and he explained to the companions that whoever says alaykum will get 10 Good Deeds 10 and whoever says he will get 20 and whoever says the full greetings that is will'll get 30 Good Deeds just imagine how many Good Deeds we are losing a day when we neglect this great Hadith iar may Allah be pleased with him was once with one of his companions whose name was Abu and they used to walk down the market may Allah be pleased with him saying asalam alaykum to all the merchants to all those who are buying to all those traders to whomever he sees he says Asam alaykum and they go back to their house after an hour or two of just walking through the market through the souk so Abu said to Omar you always go to the market without buying anything andar may Allah be pleased with him looked at him and said you love your stomach most meaning that all what you think of is wanting to eat wanting to buy something we go to the market to spread the peace the greetings of Islam so that we can get the rewards that Allah has promised us imagine this going to the Suk for the purpose of spreading the word of Peace by just saying assalam alaykum to whomever you meet and not only that who's doing it it is abdah the brother-in-law of the Prophet Alat wasam and one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet Al and the son ofar the second khif yet his status his social level does not prevent him from going down to the market and offering Salam to Those whom he knows and Those whom he does not and the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that greeting others with assalam alayum is not mandatory so if you go into a room and you don't say assalam it's up to you however you have neglected and you have lost a great reward by not doing so yet when someone comes and says allum you have to reply to him by saying is it mandatory upon everyone who heard the am or it is it a collective option meaning that if someone replies the others would not be sinful for not replying this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars so if a person goes into a room and the room has like 20 people in it and he says and only one of these 20 raises his voice and says this is sufficient but if he offers them Salam and none of the 20 replies to him in this case the whole 20 person in that room would be sinful and they would be questioned on the day of judgment another question may rise and that is are we allowed to greet the non-muslims with the greetings of Islam and the answer is no it is not permissible for us to start non-muslims with the greetings of Islam and saying assalam alaykum we may greet them with any other different greetings such as good morning uh good day good afternoon Hi how are you what's happening all of this is permissible but to say peace be upon you this is not permissible now if there are a mixture of audience Muslims and non-muslims this is permissible for me whenever I enter such a place to sayam alayum but I have to intend in my heart that I'm greeting only the Muslims with the greetings of Islam again there's nothing wrong in greeting everyone with greetings other than the greetings of Islam so I greet the non-muslims with good morning good day and how are you Etc okay then what about if a non-muslim greets me well this is an issue of dispute among Scholars the most authentic opinion is that if a non-muslim clearly says in pure Arabic in excellent Arabic words then it is permissible for say for me to reply to him by saying and that is it I must not add anything else to that I must not add because the mercy of Allah only falls upon those who believe in him and we're not allowed to greet them with the greetings of Islam so if they greet us and it's clear I can hear it I can say and if it is not that clear if it's not in the Arabic words the exact Arabic words as if they say assalam alayum for example then all what I have to say is and that is it and that is why the Jews used to greet the Prophet by saying andam means death so they used to camouflage their greetings by saying alayum wishing the prophet death and he would simply answer them by saying I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim Alim [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause]"
