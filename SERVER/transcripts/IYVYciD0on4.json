  "transcript": "my question is uh what should i do if for example i come late in a machine to pray with the congregation and i found the imam in the standing position so i joined the imam and then while sitting yes the answer is yes if you came late and by the time you started to recite the fatih imam went into rukur and you estimate that there is no sufficient time for me to finish the fatiha because if i do trying to recite it as fast as possible the imam will raise from rukur his head in this case no it's permissible you're exempted from reciting the fat go and join the imam in rukur you"
