  "transcript": "from the u.s somebody told him that the hadith which indicates that the smell the odor that a person who's fasting has is beloved to allah azzawajal and this is an authentic hadith so by their understanding they said that you should not brush your teeth or use them in swac and this is totally bogus the prophet allah as described by many companions used to use them as swag while fasting numerous times during the day and the night during the day of course but at the night also by default because he's not fasting so the sahabi says i've seen the prophet use them numerous times while fasting not once or twice or before it's permissible after the horror is not so all of this is bogus you can use it and the smell even if it goes the indication which is fasting it's an indication to the uh uh deed itself not that the smell itself is beloved to allah that it is a result of a good deed this remains as it is and there's no problem in that"
