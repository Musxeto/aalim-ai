  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] in the last episode we stopped at the mandatory punishment for adultery or fornication so what is the prescribed punishment because we are studying the chapter that deals with prescribed punishments in islam we spoke about adultery we spoke about so many things in the last episode the prescribed punishments and the justifications and how to uh counter attack those who criticize them or doubt them so now we're talking about the major sin of fornication or adultery so what is the prescribed punishment for that in islam there is a difference between a person who falls into such a sin and the category or the silver lining if you wish that divides between whether to be stoned to death or flogged a 100 lashes what differentiates between the two is the actual echan and what is on is a description that fits an individual if he were to ever get married in a legitimate marriage where he has consummated or wish she has consummated that marriage so a morsin is a person who is married at the moment has a wife or was married in the past meaning he divorced his wife or is a widow this person is considered to be a son and if he were to commit the sin of zina he would be stoned to death and what is anand anyone else is a non-muslim so even if a person got married but did not consummate the marriage and was divorced or widowed he's a non-muslim if he commits zina he would be flawed if a person never got married in his life yet he had many many many illicit illegal haram relationships that included zina he would not be considered as a son because there is a difference between committing the act of intercourse when you're not married and when you're married and doing it so the taste of intercourse for a married person is different than when it is illegal in haram and if a person had sexual intercourse illegally was never married or committed sodomy was never married or did anything that is haram while not being married this would not make him a son he's still a non-muslim and his punishment is being flogged 80 being flogged 100 lashes as mentioned in surat and nur and in order for this punishment whether stoning or flogging in order for it to be implemented the adulterer or the fornicator must have a number of conditions number one he has to be an adult one would say can a child have intercourse some cases yes and he's not an adult for a woman for a girl who's not an adult and did not reach the age of puberty she can commit the act of fornication and we cannot implement the prescribed punishment on her as well the fornicator has to be seen so if someone who is mentally challenged to the extent that psychiatrically he is labeled as insane if he commits zina then we do not implement the prescribed punishment he has to be free and this is an issue of dispute but there is no dispute that if a free slave commits zina and he was married then would we implement the stoning the answer is no he has to be flogged and he has to be flogged 50 lashes half of the punishment prescribed for a free person as mentioned in surat and nisa where allah azza stated that slave women when they commit adultery they should be punished half of the punishment of a free woman and when it comes to stoning you cannot divide stoning into two halves and give him or her half of the punishment so scholars say that it is remaining as it is which is 50 uh uh lashes and the fourth condition is that the adulterer or the fornicator had a previous sexual intercourse in a legitimate marriage so if the marriage was void or not legitimate he this punishment is not implemented give an example i'll give you an example a couple divorced three separate divorces over the period of five ten years they divorced once reconciled divorced again reconciled divorced a third time so the woman goes to a young man and says to him listen i'd like you to marry me for a couple of days and then divorce me after having intercourse of course so that i can get married again to my ex-husband and this is known in urdu or and this type of marriage is void it does not exist it does not take place because there is agreement between the two and the prophet alice islam described the boy the man as being the borrowed goat as if he's been borrowed so that he would have sex with other female goats and then returned to its owner so likewise a person who marries a woman who was divorced three times in order to make her halal and to make her allowed to get back to her ex-husband is a borrowed goat so they get married and the guy sleeps with her for a couple of nights and divorces her a week or two later he commits fornication with another woman he's caught red-handed or he confesses to the muslim judge and when going back to his history we find that he is previously married but his lawyer says your honor the man married in an invalid marriage contract it was void because there is an agreement between the two and it was timed for two nights here the judge says then we cannot implement the stoning because his marriage was invalid so the intercourse took place took place in an illegitimate and invalid marriage and he refers only to the second option of prescribed punishment and that is flogging a hundred lashes what about the mandatory punishment for adultery it is as stated before it is stoning so if a man or a woman who were legitimately married and had intercourse with their spouses while married if one of them commits adultery and he confesses or was caught red-handed with four male witnesses as we will come and discuss inshallah later on they all testify against him or her in this case that individual must be stoned to death and stoning to death is something that a lot of the muslims may find it um not usual because we don't have it implemented nowadays which causes a lot of the muslims to be doubtful whether to implement it and not in addition to the fact that many many unfortunately so-called preachers or scholars or dais who belong to the sects of um like the ghawaris like the more tesla like those who reject hadith they would probably cast doubts about these things in the minds of muslims and this would definitely lead to a lot of doubts in their minds and such doubts must not be present with a real true practicing muslim why is that see stoning is something that the consensus of all scholars of islam agree upon it was reported that umar may allah be pleased with him said allah sent muhammad ali with the message of the truth and revealed the book which is the quran to him his revelations included the verse that mentions stoning and we read and understood it meaning as companions the prophet sallam enforced the stoning punishment as we did after him so the prophet alaihis salat stoned and we have authentic hadith proving that whether it is the hadith of or the hadith of and the prophet stone and so did we after him then he says i fear that as time passes someone might say that the stoning punishment is not end up on in the punishment uh in the in allah's books and it's uh uh he says is not in allah's book thus people would err by abandoning something allah has legislated the stoning punishment is right and in allah's book applicable to stoning enforceable on adulterous men and women provided the required evidence is confirmed or pregnancy takes place or confession is given who said this it was um and one claims wait wait wait i've read the quran from cover to cover and it did not find any reference to stoning and we covered this before and we said that allah mentioned in surat al-baqarah we abrogate or we make you forget it meaning muhammad ali then we will replace it with something that is better than it or similar to it so what is the concept of obligation an abrogation has different forms and i explained that before but i am certain that most of you have forgotten it because knowledge if you do not write it down and revise it every now and then it will vanish from your head because we're not computers most at least most of us aren't yes there are people who are gifted with this gift of memorizing things but not all of us are like that so abrogation is of three types abrogation of the text while the ruling applies abrogation of the ruling well the text stays abrogation of both the text and the ruling so abrogation of the ruling while the text remains is what we read a lot in the quran where allah says for example about intoxicants do not pray while you are in the state of intoxication until you are aware of what you recite and this was in a particular phase of time when it was not prohibited to consume wine but as a preliminary and introduction introductive measure allah told them do not be in the state of intoxication when you have to pray so if i were to consume wine after after time i'll be intoxicated so i can't do that if i consume it after asar mariptam i'll be intoxicated so i can't do that so the best time to be drunk is after isha because you have like eight to two ten maybe eleven hours of night and you will have time to sober out maybe after fajr because you have six seven hours to sober out so this at the phase of time was permitted but was permitted but then it was abrogated where allah said you have to refrain and stay away from it end of story so this is the abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains the ayah itself is in the quran we read it the second type of abrogation is the abrogation of the text it's not in the quran anymore but the ruling remains and the scholars give an example of the stoning as umar said may allah be pleased with him stoning was an ayah it was abrogated it was taken out from the quran why this is allah's choice yet the ruling remained because we read the ayah before it was abrogated and not to be recited anymore as an i am we also stoned at the time of the prophet allah a number of times and we the companions after the death of the prophet islam we also stoned we also stoned adulterers so this is a confirmed ruling in islam the third and final type of obligation is to abrogate the ayah and to abrogate its ruling as well and we mentioned this in the book of breastfeeding or cycling where in the beginning it was revealed in the quran that ten sucklings would prohibit a child and would make him the son of the woman who suckled him this was abrogated into five sucklings instead of ten and even that was abrogated from the quran but the ruling remains so 10 is both abrogated text and ruling as well so nowadays stoning is being looked down at and the muslims are almost ashamed of saying it not all muslims i'm talking about the ignorance about those who are basically ashamed of everything in islam because unfortunately this is how they i were say brought up but this is what they were led to believe due to them abandoning the sunnah and the correct akida so how do we counter the attacks of people that criticize islam for stoning it's very easy of the tip of my mind i would say that when was the last time a woman was stoned or a man was stoned to death maybe once every 150 years or 100 years and you're talking about what you're talking about 1.8 or 2.0 billion muslims living on earth so the prescribed punishment of stoning is quite rare why is that because in order to prove it as we will see you need the confession with conditions of the confession two or you need four male witnesses testifying and again we will talk about this in a while in sha allah and this is not something that is easy to prove and this is why we don't see it often still chef it is a bit harsh stoning a person to death this is very harsh and excuse me if i say maybe this is barbaric this is barbaric this is what you say and no i don't excuse you you cannot say that because this is the ruling of allah azzawajal and allah is the most merciful subhanahu yes but why this severe punishment okay the cause of this punishment is a desire is lust is the pleasure of the flesh do we all have this of course we all look for pleasure and lust as humans we are keen to attain these pleasures of the flesh and because everyone has it islam channeled it in a very easy and beneficial way you wanna fulfill your sexual drive get married and made marriage so easy if you really want to get married it's the proposal of the guardian the acceptance of the groom the presence of two male witnesses muslims that's it boom she's your wife take her we make things complicated so we make weddings we make big dowries we make hotel receptions and this is not all needed in islam nevertheless if this is what's prevailing in the community you don't have to go for the moon you don't have to shoot for the stars most people want miss universe well go a bit down if you really want to preserve your chastity you can go really really down any woman would do if you are sincere but no she has to be this she has to be that her hair has to be this her height has to be that she has to be a ballerina and she has to know how to play the violin and the piano and she has to speak seven languages latin among them and she has to have repented and memorizes the quran in the 10 and the buhari and muslim if you find one like that i'll drop you my email this is only found in general and before you make such conditions and require such demands take a good look in the mirror and see if it fits with the conditions you're asking or not so islam saves your chastity by facilitating means for you to get married if you cannot get married then you have to fast but once you get married and then you've tasted what halal is yet your corrupt evil soul is yearning to haram and filth and you commit this sin and you don't commit it concealing your sinful acts but rather exposing it by either allowing for male witnesses to witness the whole action in colors then definitely you are an evil person and you must be eliminated and such a punishment as pres as we stated in the previous [Music] lecture or class such a punishment is a deterrent and this is why it's unlike nude beaches or some parks in europe or in the us where you would find a man humping a woman in the backseat of a car or in the park or somewhere without any shame guys get a room and they don't because this is how animals behave and these guys are closer to animals than to humans so islam prescribed this punishment to deter people from falling in such heinous crime by the way if you look into the old testament in the bible you'll find that stoning is live and present so islam is not the only religion that this does this but if you look at the sins that deserve stoning you'd laugh for example if a person fornicates with the daughter of the priest the priest has a daughter and his daughter is a bit kinky and she fools around and a guy had sex with her you stoned this guy oof i didn't know she was a priest daughter tough bananas stone him to death if a person curses the king or says bad thing about him stone him to death where is the freedom of speech first amendment stone him to death if a person is disobedient and undutiful to his parents take him to the outskirts of the village and stone him to death oof what is this we have we ran out of stones man what are you doing if an ox kills someone stone the ox to death either the animals yep even the animals and there are many other so when your house is made of glass don't throw people with stones don't criticize islam because islam only made stoning to death a punishment for a single crime nothing else even apostasy if a person curses allah or curses the prophet or the quran we don't stone them to death we behead them but we don't make them suffer before they die like as in the case so stoning is part of islam and the prophet as prescribed earlier stoned and confessed of adultery o prophet of allah i committed adultery so purify me the prophet islam looks the other way the man goes to the other side and said oh prophet of allah i committed adultery purify me so the prophet looks the other way and he did this four times which some scholars say that it takes the place of four male witnesses after the fourth time the prophet allah started to interrogate him hoping that he retracts his statement so he said maybe you kissed her and he said no i committed adultery i said maybe you hugged her maybe you just you know flirted with her and the man keeps on saying no no no and finally the prophet said i saw did you actually have sexual penetrative intercourse and the message is yes so the prophet looked at his people and said is he crazy and his people replied no prophet of allah he's saying so he asked the companions smell his mouth maybe he's drunk and he wasn't when everything was so clear and there was no escape no doubt in it the prophet told them to take him and to stone him to death now if an adulterer does not meet these conditions that make a person a muslim then he is given a lesser punishment and that punishment is to flog him 100 lashes and to exile him for one year and this is an issue of dispute the lashes we have no dispute in that because this is mentioned in the quran the exiling bit to exile a person this is what imam shafiri and imam ahmed schools of thought stated that yes we have to combine the physical punishment with exiling him to another country or another village imam malik says yes i agree the combination is legit and we have to do that as per the instruction of the prophet of islam but not for the female fornicator why he said the female fornicator needs a mahram and by ordering her to be exiled for a year we would actually also exiling her mahram who's innocent who did not do any wrong thing so why would we force him to accompany her when he's an innocent person imam abu hanifa says that no even boys and girls must not be exiled because this was not mentioned in the quran and because this punishment may lead to more heinous sins so if i were to exile a boy to another country he would fall into zina over and over again because nobody's watching nobody knows him and he would be encouraged to do these heinous sins but this justification this reasoning is going against the instruction of the prophet what did the prophet say in the hadith the prophet said take this from me take this from me allah has stated a way for them that is for the adulterers the virgin man and the virgin women 100 lashes and exile for a year so this is the authentic hadith of the prophet we cannot say that we should not implement this because of logic it's a hadith some scholars in contemporary times of our times said for example i live in jiddah so if someone fornicates and we catch him red-handed or he confesses and we flog him a hundred lashes when we exile him we said okay as a punishment where we will exile you to dubai maybe bahrain or maybe we'll send you to london or vancouver maybe paris so nowadays exiling people is a luxury people would love to be exiled because it's not like it used to be in the past so contemporary scholars said that locking someone up in a prison cell for a whole year that would be an excellent substitution to exiling him to another country where we don't know how things would progress and this is a very sound judgment and a very good alternative and allah azzawajal knows best we move on to uh should we move on yeah why not we move on to proof so how to prove the crime of zina we said this so many times either by confession or by the testimony of four muslim male witnesses and the confession has to be absolutely clear that it was a penetrative intercourse because somebody comes and says oh purify me i have committed adultery and i'm a fornicator i'm abiding in hell forever you have to clean me so what did you do he said i had uh uh fornicated with that woman he said okay if i am quick to give my verdict and put him in jail and stone him tomorrow or flog him tomorrow i would be doing a grave mistake why is that simply because i have to inquire what did you actually do in so many cases people think that lying down nude with another person is dinner touching and hugging and kissing is zina and this is not true the actual xena is counted with penetrative penetrative intercourse where the man's penis is inserted in a woman's vagina and there is a saying when people talk about this and they say there is no bashfulness in islam before they say something that is french and this is not a true statement all of islam is based on bashfulness but we say what the companions said this is right so you do not say there is no bashfulness in islam this is wrong you say allah is not bashful of truth allah is not shy of truth so sometimes when we explain things it has to be state said in black and white you cannot beat around the bush so this is penetrative intercourse burst sex this is what is called zina so the judge has to hear it describe clearly by the person before uh giving his ruling and this is why the prophet did this as some he asked marriage maybe you kissed maybe you hugged maybe you touched until he completely made it clear that this was not the case one of the conditions of such a confession is that a an individual has to stick with or by his confession throughout the whole process what do you mean so if i confess of such a heinous crime and they take my word and they issue the punishment and the following day i said um no i didn't do it you said you did it we have it on tape no no i did not do it i retract my statement yeah but you signed too late he said no no i didn't do it ah if he retracts if he does not stick by his confession we must accept that and halt and stop the punishment ya sheikh what do you mean massive pneumatic when he was sentenced to death by stoning the moment they started stoning him and he felt the pain of the rocks falling on his body he tried to run away so they ran after him and kept on stoning him until someone hit him with a big stone in his head and killed him so when they went to the prophet alaih and told him about how he ran away the prophet regretted that and said you should have let him escape he was tried convicted by confession and he was being executed yet the prophet said you should have let him escape be sincere once in your life and tell me is islam a bloodthirsty religion would this happen anywhere on earth if islam was bloodthirsty religion the prophet would not have showed mercy to such a person who committed such a crime confessed and was sentenced to death he would have told him you did the right thing you killed him that's good but he didn't he said as long as he had a room to retract his confession you should have stopped gave him the benefit of the doubt islam is not a bloodthirsty religion islam does not want people to die to suffer but islam is affair and just religion the other type of proof other than the confession is the testimony of four witnesses allah says in the quran why did they who slaundered not produce for it for witnesses and when they do not produce the witnesses then it is they in the sight of allah who are the liars in order for their testimony to be accepted and to be implemented there are conditions one there must be four of them together so if three come this doesn't count and they will be punished for slaundering there have to be four of them two the witnesses must be sane adults so children don't count crazy people or mentally challenged don't count three they must be men and not only any normal men men of integrity so you don't bring pimps or junkies or strippers to make such an accusation they have to be men with integrity if you bring a hundred women testifying this would not do because they must be for male muslims number four the witnesses must have seen the act of adultery so it's not enough to see a man on top of a whim of a woman and both of them are nude no it doesn't count they have to describe it in detail so their description has to be graphic by saying yes i saw the man's penis entering and being inserted in the woman's vagina and of course this is almost impossible unless it comes from a particular angle and it is impossible for a man to continue doing his thing when four at that particular angle are watching and witnessing so it is almost impossible to have four witnesses doing that and it shows you that islam is not bloodthirsty religion and the witnesses must be muslims and they must give their testimony in the same session we don't take a testimony of a man on saturday the second man is on monday the third and the fourth are on wednesday they have to be at the same particular time otherwise that would be slandering if these conditions are not fulfilled one says okay chef i have a tricky question how about if we place an hd camera and we record the angle we record the whole thing would that be sufficient the answer is no this is not sufficient check but we have an hd high definition camera and the resolution is so clear so graphic no this doesn't count so 100 women don't count and the video footage does not count why is that because this is a shariah ruling and not something that is logical so a third person says okay now i think i've got it so no videos and no women what about dna if we have the dna to prove that this and that happened all of these are circumstantial evidences cannot stand in a court of law in the court of sharia to implement such a prescribed punishment yes circumstantial evidences have weight in islam i can as a judge lock him up for five years ten years due to the circumstantial evidences but the prescribed punishment of stoning or of flogging cannot be implemented without these conditions fulfilled as mentioned in the quran and the issue of slandering is another topic that may take us a while so i'll be i believe that we may stop here and resume insha allah today's thursday on monday as uh so let's see what questions remain from the long list we had i think we have like 10 of them and then the admins inshallah will send me the new long list of the questions and we will designate hopefully um one day next week for a full session of questions answering your questions so muhammad says how could we help a family who cannot read the arabic dua for the protection from evil eye envy or jealousy since their knowledge of reading duas and surah is weak well unfortunately there's nothing much you can do you can write it to them in a piece of paper and ask them to repeat it every morning and evening and before going to bed and this would hopefully help them but if they are unable to read at all or to recite or to memorize there's nothing for you to do except to ask him to make dua generally to allah azzawajal nida says in our asian culture the elders say we must not place slippers or shoes at the doors or outside rooms as angels pass by is there any such thing the answer is no there's nothing as such angels don't care about your shoes or your slippers whether they're inside or outside whether they're turned upside down or normally as so many people think this has nothing to do with that and allah knows best shabana says is it obligatory upon a woman a woman to give udhiya on her behalf if she is not earning and she has gold more than the nisab level given to her by her husband and father the answer is the is obligatory or let us say as the majority of scholars say it is highly recommended upon the man who has a family so if her husband is offering this is sufficient for him his wife and children those who live under his roof but if she doesn't have a husband and she is the head of the family of the house and she doesn't earn but she has some gold it is not mandatory upon her to give her but if she is rich and can afford it in this case it is highly recommended if not mandatory for her to give authentos best farziana says do i have to cover myself like in prayer for the prostration of recitation so the question is clear i'm not praying and i am memorizing the quran so i'm reciting a verse that has frustration in it she says i'm not covered i'm not wearing my hijab my hair is uncovered i'm wearing a t-shirt at home can i offer this prostration the answer is yes not only that there are two prostrations that are offered outside of the salat prostration of gratitude and prostration of recitation whenever you want to offer them you don't have to be in the state of wudu you do not have to be covering your aura and you do not have to face the qibla when offering it what what is this first time in my life i hear such things this is what happens when you learn about islam question is your prostration prayer or not said hmm let me go back to the series where we began discussing prayer with the sheikh in islamic the sheikh says prayer is a specific phrases and actions inaugurated with takbira to and concluded with salaam okay this is the definition of prayer but prostration of recitation is neither inaugurated by takir nor concluded by salam so no it's not a prayer if it's not a prayer then you don't have to cover your aura you don't have to be in the state of udo and you don't have to be facing the qibla end of story wow this is something new well if you join in you'll always find and learn something new insha allah so the second question sheikh of farzana if after far dorsal and praying salah i discovered that my husband was not complete do i have to repeat those prayers the answer is yes if someone is performing hustle to uplift a major impurity and after he performed rasul he prayed fajr assad and at the end of the night before going to asia she discovers that she has her finger polish her nail polish on she did she forgot to remove it question is her wrestle valid the answer is no because it did not reach the nails due to this layer then all her five prayers are invalid she has to remove the nail polish she has to perform russell and she has to pray fajirdo and asia um says recently in the subcontinent some muslims volunteered to cremate to cremate body of a non-muslim as his relatives and neighbors refused to take care of him after he died can muslims perform last rituals for non-muslims according to their religion the answer is nope and this is quite weird we are prohibited to participate in non-muslims funerals or to assist them in it to cremate a body is even worse and if his own relatives did not want to do that you as muslims do you want to be more roman than the romans you want to be more catholic than the pope this is ridiculous they don't want to bury him or cremate him let them deal with them and in any way they want but to interfere and to meddle your nose in something that you're not supposed to this is totally sinful and haram hamiyon says i have three questions one can we join a congregation after a person who's doing sunnah prayer so we come to the masjid and there's a person praying and we don't know what he's praying can we join him or we know that he's praying sunnah after can we join him for us him being sunnah the answer is yes no problem number two what is the ruling of purbani that is a person who is not performing hajj we've talked about this and we said that the qurbani or the is highly recommended for a muslim who's not performing hajj and it is mandatory according to some scholars if that person is rich and capable of offering it with ease and finally in one family how many korbani is obligatory i mean every person who gives the cat should do qurbani the answer is no we said that it is one ram one sheep sufficient for a household where all live under the same roof and eat from the same kitchen so even if they're all earning like five boys earning their father is earning the sisters are earning their husbands etc yet they all live in the same house and they eat from the same kitchen they have to slaughter only one single sheep for the whole family and allah azzawajal knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's lesson until we meet next monday i leave you for alaikum warahmatullahi"
