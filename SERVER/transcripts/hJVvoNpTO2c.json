  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah the natural inclination or what is known as f is divided into two types something that deals with a which each and every human being is born with and that is to believe in the Oneness of Allah and the other one is a practical one which is something that we are told to do and these things were combined in the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her and the Hadith of an may Allah be pleased with him as we will come and see and these items these characteristics these inclinations are natural in the sense that no normal human being would reject them rather would adopt them and want to do them and they're related to cleanliness and Purity the first one is using the miswak the siwak or the miswak is that twig which so many Muslims use to clean their teeth and This is highly recommended as the Hadith of the Prophet used to use it most of the times the prophet saidat in Hadi the seak is cleaning to the mouth or it's a form of cleansing of the mouth and it pleases the lordel and also the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam said had I not fear burdening my umah I would have ordered them to use the siak for every prayer meaning before praying the prophet would have ordered them to do thisat and this beautiful sun is highly recommended when a person performs Wu when he wakes up from sleep when there is sort of a mouth OD when he wants to recite the Quran when he wants to pray also while entering the Masjid or entering his home to meet his family these are recommended situations where people are recommended to use the sewak some folks would consider it to be inappropriate to use it when addressing Elders or dignitaries or in a Circle of Knowledge it wouldn't be appropriate when you're talking to your father and you're just doing this or talking to the uh prime minister or talking to someone of importance because they may think that this is disrespectful and it might be so one has to limit it to the places where it is recommended or when there's nothing related to the situation when he's home or whatever the second characteristic of the natural inclination is shaving the pubic hair and the pubic hair is the hair that grows around the private parts and that is meant of the front private part because this is what is known as the pubic hair what about the hair that grows at the back passage this is recommended to remove if there's no hardship but it is not mandatory as in the case of Shaving the pubic hair and one can remove it with other means if he's reluctant to use the razor however the Sunnah is to shave it but if someone wants to use uh hair removal creams if someone wants to wax it there's no problem in that trimming it with a machine is not permissible it doesn't serve the job because shaving it means to totally remove it trimming it with a trimmer hair trimmer doesn't do the job sufficiently now the Hadith that obligates it unlike the miswak the miswak is a recommendation but there are some of these characteristics that is that are mandatory and these are combined in the Hadith of an may Allah be pleased with him an says the prophet sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam timed for us or a time limit has been set for us to and he listed the things that considered to be mandatory trimming the mustache clipping the nails plucking the uh armpit hair and shaving the pubic hair the prophet Alam timed all of this um that should not be left for more than uh 40 days so this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam that is mandatory unlike theak it is recommended if you don't do it there's no problem in that why would we say mandatory because an said it the time period was given to us so this is something that the prophet told them not to exceed that time limit however if these things such as the uh uh mustache hair and this is the third characteristics with us the Sunnah is to cut it short as much as possible not to shave it rather to trim it really really good and the reason is that it would not exceed the upper lip you know in the old days and sometimes nowadays we may share the same cup so if someone had big mustache and the hair is growing and you drink a lot of impurities would may may fall in the cup or it would be attached to a person's mustache and this is unhygienic and not clean and not appropriate but this is our way of thinking as for the legitimacy of this ction we don't give it a reason rather we say that this is the order of the Prophet Alat to trim it to the best of uh our ability so that it would not exceed the upper lip but not to shave it all together number four growing the beard I don't have to put fertilizers to make my beard bigger or use some medication no Islam just tells me to leave it as it is Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him stated that the prophet well actually this Hadith uh which is agreed upon does not refer to Growing the beard so we will skip that rather we would go to the following Hadith of mother AA which we um mentioned earlier mother says 10 things are part of the F and these things are trimming she says um cutting the uh short the mustache or trimming the mustache letting go of your beard using the siak rining the nose that is pulling the no the water up your nostrils uh then clipping your Nails um um washing your uh Knuckles and plucking the armpit hair shaving the pubic hair and washing oneself with water referring to which we talked about in the previous uh sessions these are nine and the 10th one of the narrator of the Hadith one of the narrators of the Hadith said I forgot the tenth unless it is r ing the mouth with water which is Al that is done in W so these are the 10 um characteristics of the natural inclination or that was mentioned in the Hadith of mother some are mandatory as we've mentioned before some are from the Sunnah number five is clipping the nails and this is logical and it's natural when you see someone with long nails that probably there are germs and dirt underneath even if they clean it it still doesn't look natural at all and it's not good number six is plucking the armpit hair whether by uh plucking it using wax or uh hair removal creams and if one is finding it difficult one can shave it as well as Imam shafii says so that that no filth or dirt is combined or gathered there and this prevents the uh um awful an abusive odor from um existing number seven washing the knuckles were also the areas of the body that may contain dirt and needs to be uh thoroughly washed number eight circumcision and circumcision is a natural operation that is done for newborns it is mandatory to circumcise male children male boys boys are usually male un and unfortunately except in nowadays where this weird inclination of not knowing what you are so this is part of the Sunnah it is mandatory to circumcise uh uh baby boys and it's a different of difference of opinion to female circumcisions and the most authentic that it is recommended but not mandatory and the vast majority of women nowadays don't do it alhamdulillah and if one doesn't do it there is nothing wrong in that and in addition to these characteristics we can also add rining the nose by inhaling up your nostrils to the best of your ability without harming yourself water and then uh uh blowing it out also rining the mouth or known as M and of course cleaning your private part after answering the Cod of nature with using water known [Music] [Music] as [Music] for"
