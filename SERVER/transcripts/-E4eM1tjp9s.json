  "title": "Working as a Cabin Crew on an Airline that serves Alcohol, Pork or anything haram - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdul Ahad says I wanted to know if I could be a cabin crew on an airline which serves alcohol obviously I wouldn't serve it I'll ask one of my colleagues to do it but can I work without touching alcohol or anything that is Haram I've been had I don't know I personally travel a lot and to be a stewardess or a purser or to be an air hostess this means that you have to work and you don't find a purser sitting there just reading a book or watching a movie they have to work 24/7 they're always on their feet serving people so to claim that working in an airline that serves alcohol and most likely serves pork as well and you don't serve the passengers this is a little bit debatable maybe you can delegate this but to also claim that you do not clear their tables and pick up the trays after they finish then what is it you're doing no one will accept this your colleagues will never say okay sit down I know your religious commitment you cannot carry a trays with wine or serve wine or take it or clear it this is not practical and possible at all maybe one flight you'll make it the rest of the flights you'll get a complaint and you'll be kicked out and I truly wonder how do people choose to fly on Airlines that serves alcohol it's a major sin it's not something to any okay no problem I'm not drinking how do you sit next to a person who drinks alcohol consumes it it's all around you and you're 35,000 feet above sea level and you're hoping your Allah Ya Allah make me reach my destination in safety and not have a crash this is problematic now having said that as a Muslim and I'm not endorsing these Airlines but you should pick and choose the airlines that do not serve alcohol and to my knowledge I don't know to my knowledge only Saudi Airlines and Kuwaiti Airlines do not serve alcohol maybe other companies in these two beautiful great countries also most likely don't serve them but I don't fly except these usually Saudi Airlines so you feel honored when you fly in a camp in an inner airplane that does not serve Haram especially when they have a prayer room at the back which costs a lot of money to allocate a space for Muslims to go and pray while other airlines the only suitable place to pray is in front of the bar they have between the first class and the business class a bar I would have Allah so do not work okay as a cabin crew in such Airlines because this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
