  "transcript": "ald we have with us now Hadith number five so who would read it for us please Alum narrated Abu Hur Allah Apostle sallallah alaihi wasallam said you should not pass your in the stagnant water which is not flowing you may need it wash in it from Muslim Abu hura reported that messenger of Allah sallallah alaihi wasallam said none of you must wash in the stagnant water when he is in the state of J sexual defl sexual defl or sexual impurity okay the of is referring to stagnant water water that is not flowing as in the case of rivers and streams and there is the instruction of the Prophet not to urinate and then wash from it and also there is the prohibition of the Prophet Alam not to bathe in it while in the state of sexual impurity why is that well simply Scholars say that because this renders this makes the water impure or at least it would make it dirty so that people after you would not be able to use it and this leads us to the issue of what typee of water to use when we would like to purify ourselves now the scholars said and they have differed in this regard they said that the waters are divided into three types which is possible to uplift the impurity with it and also to wash the impurity with it which is a lower degree which is pure in itself but it cannot uplift the purity of a person you cannot make wood with it but it's pure and the third category which is NIS impure that does not uplift any impurity and cannot clean or remove any impurity because it is the rendered as impure Scholars meaning the majority this is what they believe but the most authentic opinion is that water is one of two either or nais there isn't something in between and the scholars objected they said we're the majority how do you dare say such a thing we said with all due respect to you Scholars Allah described the water in the Quran as so how can we introduce something in the middle said I'll give you an example if I have a pot of water and I throw into it tea and I turn it over what is this this is It's Not N but can I perform W with it I said no Sheik you cannot say see I said with all due respect she but there's a small problem what's the problem sheh this is not water this is tea so we're talking about water water is either or n so if I have water that has tea in it this is tea not water if I have have a pot of water and I put some flour in it or I put some sand in it and I turn it as much as I can what is this water with sand water with some flour in it it did not change it's still called water so I can offer woodo and I can clean dirty or impure things with it likewise if it rains and I see a pool of water I go it's muddy can I perform wood of from that yes it changed the color is yellow and I cannot drink it yes you cannot drink it but it is considered to be water it's not like the tea we mentioned earlier so the most authentic opinion is that water is divided into two either Pure or impure or NES and the prophet is indicating to us stagnant water which made Scholars talk about the quantity of water that can be considered impure if an impurity Falls in it or pure if not and they have differed so hugely and greatly if you open the books of f of the shaf of the Hani of the H of the Mali I would be lost they're saying it should be 10 armold by 10 and they did not speak about the depth and they did not speak about this and that why because there are a number of Hadith that govern this Hadith number one the prophet saidat the water if it reaches the size of two two pots it does not carry any impurity which means if it's less than two pots then it carries impur so Scholars started thinking and calculating what is the meaning of two pots this big this big how big are they and they could not reach a conclusion because there isn't anything to find out there is no Hadith that clearly states this up and they differed yet the most authentic opinion and I'll give you this in a nutshell the most authentic opinion is that water is pure the prophet says in the authentic Hadith water is pure and nothing renders it as impure this Hadith was reported by Abu daud and in the Sun the water is pure and nothing renders it to be impure so is this Hadith by itself sufficient no because I can simply bring some urine and put it in huh is this pure definitely not why you just said the had water is pure and nothing renders it or makes it or Chang it into impurity so why are you changing your mind I'm not changing my mind when you study Hadith when you study you have to study the whole picture don't take what you like and turn a blind eye to the things you do not like as unit of knowledge does not take one verse this is the verse this is what did this is all the Deviant sex had done they take one part and this is it we follow that okay what about the rest no no we care less we care less about it this is wrong the prophet Alat wasam in another Hadith said that water is pure unless Changed by an imp Purity that affected its taste its color or its smell however this Hadith is weak as long as it's weak why are you saying it I'm saying it because the consensus of all Scholars of Islam that this rule is to be applied huh consensus yes the consensus of all Scholars no one differ and the scholars say that the evidences of Islam are taken from Quran meaning consensus and that is mentioned inah that whoever disobeys the prophet Alam and follows a path other than the path of the Believers then he will be thrown into hell this is one of the evidences of so Scholars all agree that this water is pure unless one of the three characteristics change with and this is underlined one of the three characteristics change with what an impurity why is so important to underline because I can turn the tab water and I have pig iron pipes and the water that comes comes down Rusty so the water is yellow can I make wo one says no Haram mallah when did you come today I'm student of knowledge mallah nice to meet you why is it haram said yes the color has changed and this makes it impure sit down or sit down go and learn why we said that the scholars underlined this and said if the three characteristics what are they smell taste and color if one of these three characteristics changed with an impurity with a njasa with urine with defecation with blood and in this case we rendered this to be be impure whether the quantity is this big or the quantity is this big so the quantity does not make any difference to us two pots five pots a swimming pool no problem even if it's a swimming pool yes how many children go in the swimming pool and in the swimming pool ah what what is he doing I know what he's doing okay can I make wood in that swimming pool huh can I make W in that swimming pool no no why because the impurity has been mixed with that water mtas who agrees one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 almost the majority who disagrees 1 2 so we have two we have two people who understood the lesson again I'll repeat we said that the water can only be considered impure if the three characteristics change with an impurity the boy who urinated in the swimming pool can you see the color changing can you smell can you taste it's so big it immediately dissolves so the water is pure I can make W it is extremely important to know how we reach this conclusion because once you understand it any doubt yes sh the doubt is the word impurity is not mentioned in the Hadith although it's weak the word impurity is not mentioned there in the Hadi the Hadith is to tell you as we've St is not authentic weak but the consensus of the scholars of accepting it and the consensus of the scholars that it should be changed by an impurity and that is why if it's almost impossible to find water that did not change the three colors in nature yeah in ponds in uh Lakes usually there's a difference The Taste is different if you taste uh uh the Nile water you'll find it different than a lake for example in here or there but this taste color or smell was not changed by impurity and this is the determining Factor once one of these characteristics change by an impurity it becomes NIS whether it's a big pond or a small uh glass of water so I hope this answers the question we have a break after a break inshallah we'll continue to take your questions so stay tuned asalam alaykum and welcome back so we're still discussing the water and the Hadith where the Prophet says do not urinate however if you look at the Hadith the prophet says do not urinate so can I defecate it's okay for me if I defecate in that water in the stagnant water why the prophet said only do not urinate this in it's called which is measuring things to whatever is on top of that in the sense that Allah says in the Quran do not say to your parents o so someone comes and says I'm going to slap my father wow Haram major sin no Allah said don't say o Allah said the least so by default what's more than that it is Haram and not only that some Scholars said the prophet said do not urinate in stagnant water then wash from it therefore if I urinate in a pot and I come and I spill the pot in that stagnant motor I did not urinate in it what kind of thinking is this is this applicable Islam talks to logical people when it tells you do not urinate it means do not filth do not spoil that water so that people can come and drink it or use it or whatever and that is why the prophet says in the Hadith be aware of the two things that cause cursing to come and fall upon you what are they the prophet said Alam to urinate or defecate in the path of the people or in their shade imagine in a hot sunny day you're tired you're sweating you want to go to this tree and rest and when you come you find traces of people urinating and defecating what will you do may Allah curse who did this and likewise while walking you step on something who did this may Allah curse him so the prophet is telling you don't do this and this indicates that Islam cares a lot about public opinion cares a lot about the others it's not me and the flood comes afterwards no it is us as a community that we should take care of these things okay if you have any questions by each session Mah I'm finding that people are having more and more questions so this is supposed to be informative not to be delusional once we say that our urination detriments of voodu it become null and void if you urinate okay if you urinate yes Woo is uh you have to make wo woo and the other said now suppose just off late you said in a pool of water if a child uniates now there's a certain portion of un un is there a minuscule but then it the heart says can there's water you certain portion is there so how do we know like set if you follow your heart you will be doomed because Islam is not following your heart Islam is following what you see what you hear what you sense what you feel and that is why I meet people and I say why don't you pray behind this IM he said I my heart tells me he's not a good Muslim Subhan Allah why are you sitting with this person who's innovator and deviant ah my heart tells me it's okay why are you dealing in ribba said my heart tells me Islam does not tell you to listen to your heart Islam tells you to listen to facts and when I come to judge a pond or a pool of water I judge it by facts because even Shan will come even if I have in my house a big tank full of water that I drink from wash from Etc after a while Shan would tell me how do you know that a mouse did not drown in it and died my heart tell tells me as long as this tank is outside things might happen to it I'm not going to use the water shitan comes and says how do I know that my wife is not cheating my heart tells me something is wrong why fear Allah your wife is committed to hijab she prays five times everybody knows I'm I have bad feeling yesterday I came into the house and she was calling someone on the phone and the minute I came in she said uh I'll call you later so definitely she is having an affair she could have been speaking to her mother to her friend she might have been speaking to someone you don't like your sister who you did not speak with for 10 years she's trying to reconcile between the both of you why do you always think negative My Heart Is Telling Me So this is not the Islamic way of dealing with things as Muslims the prophet tells usat I do not judge your hearts I judge what I see Allah is the only one who judg the hearts therefore the scholar said a big pool swimming pool six people 10 people urinate in it do you feel it do you taste it do you see it no you can make w and the water is is pure second question assalamu alikum sham she once it is asserted that such a thing has been mentioned in the S had authentic then we are supposed to follow it blindly without questioning the logic behind it or else there's a possibility that we might be thrown into the Hellfire like uh take for instance right from a young age we have been taught that once we step out of the toilet we are got to see a GFA which means I seek your forgiveness so why do we have to uh apologize because answering Nature's something which is a natural phenomena so you're asking about the wordan why do we ask for forgiveness and apologize for a call of nature exactly no no no no it has nothing to do with that when you say you're saying oh Allah I seek your forgiveness not because of sin I have done no because Allah relieved me from the toxin materials that if not gone out would have killed me and poisoned me right so so that is why similarly when I go out after answering the call of nature I pray to Allah and say oh Allah as you have relieved me from these toxin materials so I ask your forgiveness to cleanse me from my sins that would burn me in hell so it has nothing to do of sin you did not do a sin this is a blessing so saying is not because you've sinned it is a resemblance as Allah relieved you from the poisonous material in your body you're saying oh Allah also relieve me from the sins that would points in my soul on the Hereafter so I hope this answers itum uh if one of my brother is living life not not according to Islam and not taking tahara according to Sharia so what is the rule actually is my brother living like a mush he's not doing his Tara properly yes correct according SH now this is something that we have to all know Allah does not accept prayer without wo Allah does not accept prayer of a person who is not in the state of Purity so if your brother or this relative of yours is not in compliance with the Quran and Sunnah so he does not purify himself he urinates without washing without uh using toilet paper maybe he does not pray at all in this case he's not a Muslim and that is why we will come to inshallah pass by a Hadith that deals with purifying yourself from uh urine when you urinate but if a person does not paying attention to the Purity this means that he doesn't pray and if a person does not pray he is a cfer whether he believes in prayer or he is lazy or he doesn't believe in prayer at all he is a disbeliever because the only thing the only form of worship that the companions all agreed upon that abandoning is kufur is prayer if you don't give zakat you're a great sinner but you're a Muslim if you don't perform Hajj if you don't fast Ramadan you're still a Muslim a great sinner if you do not pray then you are not a Muslim and with this we conclude our session until we meet next time wasam alayum"
