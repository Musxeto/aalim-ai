  "title": "Is it halal to serve food to non muslims during the day in Ramadan? #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes I know I know a brother who owns the restaurant is he allowed to do business with nonim the majority of Scholars say that the disbelievers the cfir are addressed by the major concepts of Shar which is to accept Islam to believe in the Oneness of Allah to believe in the message of the Prophet wasam as well as they're addressed by the minor aspects of Shar such as to pray to fast to clip their fingernails to wear the hijab for women to grow the beard for men now just because they're cfir it doesn't mean that everything else they're Exempted from in Allah says that the Believers in Paradise look at the people in hell and they ask them why were you admitted to Hellfire these disbelievers say the first two things they say the reason we we're admitted to Hellfire that because we were not offering prayers okay you disbelievers you go to churches and synagogues what prayers are we talking about you're not supposed to pray like us Muslims five times a day no they are they are addressed by an order to believe in Allah and in the shahada and also to practice every single thing in Islam or they will be punished on the day of judgment we were not among the worshippers who used to pray and we did not used to feed the needy and the poor this is why the scholars say that it is not permissible to serve disbelievers food during the daytime of Ramadan because they're ordered to fast okay if they fast would their fast be valid of course not they're disbelievers nevertheless we as Muslims are not allow allowed to collaborate with them in such fashion and this is the opinion of a great deal of Scholars and schools of thought which I'm inclined to follow therefore if your restaurant works during the daytime of Ramadan and it Cooks food and people buy the food and go and eat it is not permissible for you to do this but if you are in a Muslim country and you cook food during the daytime or ass time of Ramadan where people would buy food and take it home to break their fast after sunset on it this is permissible and I hope this answers your question"
