  "transcript": "Rizwan a-- says I have missed a lot of fasts during my life due to menses pregnancy and breastfeeding and I've lost count of how many fasts have missed can you give me the best advice to what I can do now well first of all if you do not know how many days you had missed by default no one else can so this is something between you and allah azza wajal and you have to estimate what do you mean by estimate you have to calculate when did you get married so you say okay I got married 15 years ago so this means that there were 15 Ramadan's of an average of 30 days it can't be more than that so 30 days by 15 this is 300 450 days have you ever made up any of these days this is something you have to answer were there any more days before you got married that you did not make up this is something for you to answer but the benchmark is 450 days now it is for you to start bargaining so you may say okay I think I've missed like 20 days before I got married so this is 470 days did you make up any of the missed days you may say yeah I think I made up few and I say how many one should know much more so I said okay thirty said no no no much less give and take until you reach a number that is satisfactory to you and add it to the 470 days or whatever and consider that to be the number of days you have to make up now it's a lot of days but you're skipping fasting of Ramadan was due to a legitimate reason then what to do make them up according to your ability and if you fast Mondays and Thursdays and if you fast the three white days of every lunar month the 13th the 14th and the 15th this would mount up to approximately eighty to ninety days a year so you can finish this in like four or five years time with the grace of allah azza wajal and if you add more and more making up when it's winter when the daytime is very short this makes it even much much easier for you but this is something that you have to make up as soon as possible"
