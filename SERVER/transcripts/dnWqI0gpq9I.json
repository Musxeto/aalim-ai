  "transcript": "okay so this is question from one of my cousins he says that his parents like don't respect him so he says that they don't uh his parents especially his father they don't they don't treat him well so he says that I do all the duties and I keep quiet in front of my parents I don't yell back at them I just keep quiet whenever they yell at me so he says but I have no love and no respect for my parents so is this attitude okay in Islam and I hope my question reads it reached alhamdulillah and your question is commonly asked by people unfortunately we as parents sometimes fail miserably in our mission and vision statement in the sense that we encourage our children to be on dutiful disobedient and disrespectful how by our own transgression and wrongdoing by our own bad attitude and the way we deal with our own children this is Haram upon us we have to fear Allah azzawajal yes we do have rights over our children but they're human beings at the end of the day and we can't ask them or burden them beyond what they can bear so we have to be sensitive in how we treat them so that we do not lead them to Hellfire because of our attitude towards them which make them go against us and be disrespectful and unduteful now having said that if a person is tested by Allah by such abusive disrespectful bad parents this is a test from Allah he will be rewarded for being beautiful and respectful they will be punished not because he's your son it's okay to do whatever you want to do no you will be questioned and then you will be tormented and punished for what you had done to your son so if the Sun is doing his level best and being respectful all the time being dutiful all the time and trying to be as obedient as possible yet he has no love or respect in his heart he can't simple as that is this sinful the answer is no providing they do not sense or feel any form of resentment or hatred or disrespect because sometimes your eyes can betray you your tone of voice can deceive you and let you down if you succeed in not showing them any of such inshallah there is no sin on you may Allah make things easy for all of us foreign"
