  "transcript": "I never hain at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa theorem attend little Amin nabina muhammad in whether early he was happy he a German I'm back dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of women around the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa alayhi wasalam we need in today's times to have role models especially for women because all what we see and hear brainwashing us day and night are these weird calls coming through the social media the general normal media of homosexuals feminists liberals people who want to change not only our nature as human beings but also our religion which is the most precious thing we have and therefore it is important to have role models for women to look up to and try to imitate one of the women who was around the prophet arezzo salam and the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa seldom praised her for so many things in her was um sooo lame her name was Malaika bent mal Han and she is nicknamed as a room I saw and some say al home I saw she's well known by all Mussolini and we don't know of any of her offspring by the name of Celine before Islam she was married to malloc a new number and when Islam first reached Medina way before the Hydra the migration of the Prophet arrays salatu salam she did not hesitate to accept it and revert to islam when her husband came back and found that she abandoned his religion and his forefathers idol-worshipping practices he did not like that he was angry she didn't give that much thought she could not care because she found what she was looking for the religion of her nature the religion of allah so he fled medina went to syria and was killed there and died as a kafir the prophet alayhi salat wa salam had a habit not to visit women other than his own wives except for own silane and her sister umm haram there were two sisters and he used to go there and have his siesta in sleep before the horror after the her for a short nap to rest and then move on so the Companions asked him why is it Oh prophet of Allah that you choose her house and not ours so the Prophet said alehissalaam her brother was killed with me under my command so I have mercy over them her brother was Haram abnormal Han and he was one of the Companions of the Prophet Allah so salam who among seventy of his companions went to give Dawa answering the invitation of one of the tribes leaders only to be ambushed while giving the Dawa to that tribe leader a man came from behind him and stabbed him with his spear that went from his back out from his chest what did Haram do he said in a joyful voice I have one by the Lord of the Kaaba I have one the assassin who was a kafir said I did not know what that meant the man is dying I've just killed him and he said I won what did he win and when he asked around and found out that he was referring to paradise for being martyred in the cause of Allah the assassin accepted Islam the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said in an authentic hadith reported in the sahi that i saw in a vision that i've entered paradise the Prophet says erase all of Sam and I was met by a room I saw the wife of Abu Talha referring to almost lame so this is a glad tiding that she is from the people of Jena Subhan Allah isn't that sufficient for us to inquire what is so special about own so lame to be given such glad tidings that she is in Jannah this privilege this honor was given only to few selected companions of the prophet aerosol ofsome so what was it that qualified her for this honor I bet and betting in Islam is Haram but this is a metaphorical I bet you if you ask all the women you know in your family who owns a lame is that maybe one to five percent would answer our history has been hidden has been taken away from us on all what we see are singers actresses celebrities the scum of the society when it terms in terms of Islam and how people are evaluated in it they can be good people but religiously they're the worst of people nudity drug addicts illicit relationships profanity you name it they have it all for an indecent an indecent book but ask people about em so lame no idea never heard this name before so what was special also Lane is known to have done what no other woman did and subhanAllah she is so smart and intelligent if you were to call her an entrepreneur that wouldn't have been an exaggeration she had a vision that far exceeds what we see when the profit came Alice wasn't to Madinah she said o prophet of Allah not a single man or woman among the Ansar the people of Medina there is no single person among them except that he had given you a gift and I don't have anything to give you can't afford anything to give you as they had done except my son he's an 8 year old he's a learned boy he's smart he's intelligent other a narrations stated that he knew how to write read and write at that early age and in that era among the Arabs that was something out of this world so she said take him and he shall serve you as long as you wish so she gave her own flesh and blood to the prophet alayhi salaatu son at this early age 8 years of age when we are most attached to our own children she gave him a way to serve a total stranger no he's not a total stranger he's The Messenger of Allah whom she has unconditional belief in to serve for an exchange of how much nothing just to be with you o prophet of Allah and serve you and it says I served the Prophet alehissallaam for ten years never ever he had hit me cursed me swore at me nor he had ever found in my face she gave her own son to the Prophet as awesome as a gift to serve him he's a free man yet by doing so she gave us the Muslims this great gift Anna's serving the prophet alayhi al-salam and rating to us thousands of hadith about his worship about the way he dealt with people about his private matters and every time we hear anis we say may Allah be pleased with him and make dua for him and um Salim takes credit for that may Allah be pleased with her among those top five or six who narrated hadith anis comes in the third position subhanAllah after abdullah omar abu hurayrah and before abou shaded region abdullah and before aisha may allah be pleased with them all and her marriage is a different story we know that Malik and another has fled the country died she became a widow she vowed not to get married again until her son anis becomes old enough to speak among men Abu Talha a man of honor came to proposed to UM slain so many proposal proposals came to her she rejected them but when Abu Talha came she said by Allah you are a man of honor and any woman would accept to marry you but the dilemma is I'm a Muslim and you're not so if you accept Islam I will accept you as a husband and not only that I'll make my dowry your Islam so Abu Talha said give me time to think he went gave it a thought came back and said Islam is the right and ultimate religion I bear witness there is no god worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Prophet Muhammad Ali sosam is His Messenger and she married him fabbi till banannie says we've never heard of a dowry more honorable and generous than her dowry that is Islam the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam always mentioned their household of good things we know the hadith when a man came and asked for food he was a guest of the Prophet as of Salaam the Prophet sent to all of his nine homes do you have anything to eat and they all replied negatively so he asked the Companions who would host my guest Abu Talha took the prophet's guest to his own home told his wife heléne do you have any food for the guests she said I have nothing except little food for the children dinner he said okay give them whatever you can just put them to sleep but don't give them the food and prepare the food and when the guest comes to eat turn off the lights so that he would not see and pretend that you're eating and so they did that giving the impression to the guests that they're all sharing the food while he actually was the only one eating after fajar prayer the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam said Allah the Almighty in the description the description is Behrman Sania Kumar allah azza wajal was astonished of what you had done last night and this shows how great this family was um Salim had real wise decisions and she acted subhana Allah with great vision she had a son from Abu Talha but that son was like three four years of age and was always sick and every time about her goes to work and comes back asks about his son and she says he's okay he's better he's a little bit worse is this one day that child died so she put him on his bed in the side of the room she prepared herself took a bath light body lotion fix herself well when Abu Talha came he said how is the boy she said he had never been car more calm than now she didn't like because he's not moving he's dead so he had his supper then looking at her he had intimacy with her and after everything was over she said if our neighbors took and borrowed something from other neighbors and now they're refusing to give it back is this okay said subhanAllah how can that be okay it is a borrowed thing and they must return it back to the lawful owner then she broke the news to him and she said in this case your son who was borrowed with us allah azza wajal has retrieved what he had given us so he went to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and he told the prophet about her doing because this was not normal women usually pull their hair shout scream cry do horrible things but not that wise woman so he went to the Prophet Isis I mean the Prophet asked him did you have any intimacy afterwards and about I said yes the Prophet said may Allah bless your night which means that she has conceived in Allah would bless the pregnancy and nine months later she gave birth to a boy and they called him Abdullah in sahih al-bukhari sofyan says the man narrating and reporting this hadith said Abdullah the son of abu talha and on chalene i saw nine sons of his all memorizing the quran subhanAllah resolution all in rising Quran this is the Baraka the blessing of the prophets dua are a his salat wa salam she was a wise woman unlike other other mothers and it's tells us about this in an incident where the Prophet alehissalaam told him and sent him on an errand and told him not to tell anyone so when he came back home he was a bit late his mother asked him why are you late he said I was on an errand to the Prophet Ali's of cinnamon and she said what was that and I said I can't tell it's a secret any other woman would have beaten him to the ground until he confesses home silane she said if it's a secret of the Prophet Allah so Sam don't you ever dare tell a soul about it subhanAllah look at the amount of courage and bravery she's putting in her son instead of asking him to break the secret of the Prophet Isis Salam and she was truly smart she knew how to make advantage of different situations once the profit as Sam came to their house Anna's narrates and I was with my mom and my aunt on harem so the prophet alayhi salat wa salam was there they offered him food he said I was fasting so that was not the end of it she seized the moment she said o prophet of Allah your young servant Ana's what do you want she said make dua for him she didn't ask for a plot or a farm or a position of authority in the government she said make dua this lasts and this is better so the Prophet that is awesome made so many doors for me and at the end he said and this is in the sea allahumma actor mother who were later oh allah multiply his wealth and his offspring and blessed not only multiply but also blessed Ana's says that I have seen this dua come to reality and has lived until he was a hundred and three years of age among the last of the companions to die he says my farms produced twice a year while every others other farm produces once and I'm among the richest of the companions I have buried more than a hundred soul of my own offspring children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren in another narration the Prophet Isis am said and forgive his sins so he said my life is has been prolonged my wealth has been multiplied my offspring are so many and I wish and hope that allah azza wajal would also answer the last door which is forgiveness um so lame was not your normal woman who goes to the Salone take care of her hair and fingernails and there's nothing except that she was an active woman she would go out with the Prophet as a son in some of the expeditions and battles to help with the wounded carry water bags to give for those who are dying and help one battle in the battle of her name she was walking alongside her husband and the Prophet has a Salam and she was carrying a big knife around her waist so Abu Talha said who prophet of Allah look at him so lame she's carrying a knife so the Prophet said are in solid Sturm what is this knife I'm selling she said o prophet of Allah this is for self-protection if one of the idol worshippers attacked me I will open him up and if any of the Muslims flee battle the battlefield and turned their backs from you I will also kill them and the Prophet said to her ELISA lots of Sam boom Moshe lame allah azza wajal is better for us than all of this and he don't kill the Muslims who are fleeing because this is not how we do deal with those who flee battlefield but for the protection there is nothing wrong for a Muslim to carry something to defend himself it's horrific to see Muslims being killed and tortured without being able to defend and protect themselves no one says that this is not legal it's best to allow others and perpetrators to kill you to torture you to rape your family and not to defend yourself this is how she thought may allah be pleased with her and she was among the known companions may allah be pleased with them all to love collecting anything related physically to the prophet alayhi salatu salam seeking Baraka seeking the blessing because we know that the Prophet Allison is the Baraka on earth so everything related to the Prophet as a son physically is a Baraka that we can seek Allah's blessings through it and this is not an issue of dispute at all among Muslims so when once he drank from a skin water bag or container and he drank directly from it after he finished the project she went to it and cut the the place where the Prophet put his lips on and kept it aside seeking Baraka from it the Prophet came once iris Islam and had his siesta as usual it was hot so he started sweating she brought a small bottle and started to collect the sweat coming from his forehead and whatever fell on the leather bed so the Prophet woke up startled what are you doing she said o prophet of Allah I'm putting this to mix it with my own perfume and to get healing from it and the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not comment on that on the Hajj the farewell hatch when it was time for the prophet to shave his head he asked the barber to shave half of his head and to distribute it among the Muslims giving each companion one or two pieces of his hair as for the left part of his head he gave it all to about ha the husband of um Celine because they know that they appreciate this and that would be more precious to them than the wealth of the whole world she was a generous woman and so many incidents in the saya in the hadith of authentic hadith where she fed the Prophet Allah so Salaam and she fed the entire Muslim Ummah with the Baraka with the blessing of the Prophet SSM over a small piece of food that would suffice eighty a hundred a thousand men Subhan Allah and these are some of the miracles that she participated the miracles of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this wise noble honorable woman was with the Prophet Ali's awesome throughout his life in Medina she gave her son to help the Prophet I saw Sam throughout his life in Medina and she died on the 40th approximately 40th year of hijra when Mariah was the ruler of the Muslim Ummah may allah azzawajal be pleased with silane and may Allah Azza WA JAL make us all among those who enter paradise to see these role models who were around the Prophet sallallaahu Ali was seldom had Allahu Alem when he spotted in Miri Aslam was Allah Allah Mubarak I don't be in a Mohammed why the ADI he was happy he as mine assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam reminded us through his guidance and example that islam is complete submission to the will of allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test allah tested the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam severely in order that he sallallahu alayhi wasallam becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by Allah all lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of Allah when in a calamity as he does when in comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship Him if given bounties and comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life Allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxiety the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam showed us through his own example that for a righteous Muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets Allah for him tests will he conducted on earth while he lives are not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next world his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the deeds that he committed during a short span of time called life assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back Harley says how should we have a balance between dunya and akhira and I don't know why you guys like to ask questions that require a whole lecture this is a way of life to balance this life with the hereafter is a way of life it cannot be summarized in couple of minutes allah said in surat al qasas robert le fema attack Allah who Daryl awfully well attend senousy became in a dunya Allah says the people of Harun said to him in whatever Allah gives you you should seek the Hereafter meaning that this is your objective this is your mission and vision and while doing so don't be like monks neglecting your worldly needs no you have to take what is appropriate according to the amount you need from this life meaning whatever health we have whatever financial means whatever power that Allah has bestowed upon us we should devote this for seeking Allah's pleasure because my life span on earth cannot exceed average of 60 to 70 years maximum 100 then what then death and it's all in decline after 40 years of age so you should utilize everything that you have for eternity in paradise but while doing so do not neglect your needs you need to get married you need to eat and drink you need to wear good clothes right a good car have a sustainable income that would allow you to live an honorable life without begging people for money all of this is a combination if you manage to achieve it then you would be in good hands the vast majority of Muslims are focusing 90% on this dunya 10% on the Hereafter this is why they get usually a big zero it's a failure but those who go extreme and focus like 95% on the Acura with 5% on this dunya they would be begging people for money no you have to have this balance which the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam - Abdullah Abdullah's your Lord has rights over you your body has rights over you your wife has rights over you and your guest has rights over you so give all its due right so you have to balance and know that yes I memorize the Quran I read books of fancier I spent time worshiping Allah but I need time to go to the gym I need time to jog I need time to burn some calories to do some weight exercises or push-ups or setups or something to take care of my health I have to connect to my next of kin and entertain how guests that come to my house visiting me I have to also take care of my kids and my wife give them quality time this is the full package deal if you manage this balance then you are in good hands we have Yusuf from Algiers shut up water from syphilis and I'm to love our cat oh um did Allah how are you sure yes sir I have a question about a shooter hijab yes yeah you know in this time women's make the shoe job and my wife - I ask Allah to beat me to be married now since we have you and we've had description of him sorry what does mean she kept sorry and asked Allah to make my wife like on cinema okay okay any more questions now all feet Barack Allah so brother Yusuf is facing a dilemma with his wife now he says me a lot so I'll grant his wife the hijab of um silane and I would say a me and he says that his wife loves during Ramadan to watch movies TV series listens to listens to music etc and he doesn't know what to do see there is a big problem among or between the spouses the couple when one of them all of a sudden starts to be practicing this problem would not have appeared most likely if before you got married you selected a spouse or a wife to be in the same or better than you in your religious practice so if I were to get married I will not choose a belly dancer I would not choose someone who does immodest things I would have been laughs because I am investing I'm gonna choose someone who is going to be an excellent mother for my children I would know how she would bring them how what what is her mentality how what is she driven by but usually when people are young fresh graduates they're interested in a woman for her beauty so they get married not focusing on religious practice because I'm not religious I'm not committed so I'd like someone to be like me so after a while when attending lectures listening to good words watching a YouTube video on Islamic teachings Allah guides me to practicing Islam so I love what I hear and see I read the Quran I get more knowledge I'm getting stronger in Islam focusing on myself and neglecting my wife at the end of the day the gap is widening so now when she and I used to love to sit on the couch watch a movie I don't watch movies anymore it's all nudity violence music and lies after lies but my wife is still hooked on it so there is a big drift between us and all of a sudden we get a caller saying Cher we have a problem and I don't know what to do with my wife now the easiest way out can be summarized in divorce but this is not logical destroying your house your family over things that she disagrees with you over and you just call it a quit no this is running away from battle what to do Cher you have to focus on saving her from her so that she would be with you in Jena if allah subhanaw taala wills it and you both enter general how to do that try to start from scratch try to have her get closer to religion a little bit better than before she may not reach your level overnight it may take a month three months six months but you have to be patient and you can't just flood her with everything so quit music quit movies wear the hijab wear the niqab don't talk to anybody close your social media accounts might as well tell her to drop herself or throw herself in the ocean while she doesn't know how to swim she's gonna drown so you have to be wise weigh the consequences prioritize the things that to be addressed and give unconditionally with full conviction and love and respect and show her mercy don't speak to her from your ivory tower and saying that I know you don't know you're ignorant you're an imbecile you don't have any knowledge I know nobody accepts this so Fe it takes a lot of effort and the gain and reward is priceless but you have to put some effort into it you have to walk the talk you have to give her a quality time it's not it enough for you to grow a long beard and shorten your soap and pray the message it and then you do the whole nine yards of sins of disrespect of abused of this cheating and lying this doesn't work you have to be a role model and make a lot of dua in your suit try to give her a an alternative environment with good companionships so lots of good women who are wise and well educated to mix with her to try and give her Dawa because sometimes she may listen to them not to you and then insha'Allah Allah will make a difference Manila Zinedine from the UK Sonam but Allah alhamdulillah how are you my friend want ombre hair can you raise your voice a little bit it's a little bit difficult to eat you okay I want to ask you a few questions today yes so my first question is I play a game on I play a game on my on my Chromebook cool awesome la saga it's a game when you grow flowers in the game when you remove weeds although it has music and my mom has always been telling me to delete it should I delete it though that's my first question I didn't get your questions in what what to delete what on my that it I flagged going game but with music so this this app what does it do you write in it I prayed five prayers I read the Quran you know it's just a game of share about what what kind of game going flower growing flowers okay my second question is a few days ago my mother is my mother received a photograph and a video clip of this person who photographed a person a hand coming from the sky people were saying this is Allah this is a large and they she started crying but I told her the competition will hosted Mira bossy and so what did I see correct and how to address this and my third question is how could I'm I was I have Asperger's syndrome I have autism a buddy syndrome and I am age how can I be a resource from the Ummah at my age okay how old are you 13 inshallah I would answer in Sharma so our friend from the UK zina Dean says that he downloaded an app of growing flowers on his mobile and his mother is telling him to delete it so he's saying that should I am I obliged to obey my mother I don't know this app but if this app is totally permissible and legit and you do not spend a lot of time on it so it's like 5-10 minutes something that is random so you're not obsessed with it and there is nothing harmful to you then you should try your level best to be diplomatic with your mother and explain to her that there's nothing wrong with that at the end of the day if she insists on you deleting it being a dutiful son and such an app would not harm you to delete you're better off deleting it but try to communicate with your mom and try to investigate why she doesn't want you to play with it most likely it has an impact on your concentration which your mother is afraid that it would deteriorate because of that app and I'm Allah knows best now he says his second question is about the issue of a clip and a photograph that his mother received and it had a picture of a hand coming out from the clouds etc and she cried because people said that this is Allah's hands out of Allah this is blatant shirk how would anyone think of Allah in such a fashion this is the doing of Elma shabeeha and claiming something related to allah azzawajal who said about himself lasik a measly shake there's nothing like unto him subhanahu wa'ta'ala and it is totally prohibited to watched such clips let alone to believe in whatever Shaitaan is whispering to us these video clips these photographs are photoshopped so many people show us Gardens beautiful trees and they say look it's written on these trees la ilaha illa llah and they cut an orange open and it says muhammad rasool ullah and they show you clouds on forming the picture of someone prostrating and subhanAllah someone's prostrating all of this is nonsense this is Shaitaan messing up with your minds so tomorrow if someone opens an apple and there's a crush who'd said oh this is Christianity is a true religion if you see in a plant or some grass written Jesus is the Son of God would you believe that subhanAllah Muslims don't take their religion from such nonsense and Allah soldier knows best his third question says that he has I think Down syndrome or something like that and he's 13 years of age how can he help Islam well our he you sound to me like a very normal person so first of all don't believe in whatever people tell you and convince you off believe in Allah solution and after that believe in the powers that Allah has put in yourself think always positive of a large ocean and think always positive of yourself while depending relying and trusting Allah Almighty make a lot of duaa in your suit to make you better stronger and more influential more I think this is the right adjective to be more effective in calling people to Islam because masha'Allah you have the brains for it and you have the words for it so you can serve Islam even if you're unable to walk there's social media there are so many lectures youtubes that can benefit the whole world if you know how to select and to communicate with others and I don't see any problem in your communication skills so I mean Allah social use you in giving Dawa and to spread his word Fatima from Saudi Salam alaikum sound Allah I'm Sheikh I have a question my first question is am i a spinner if I watch UFC fight while I party and my second question is what's the ruling on building a house in the graveyard and my third question is using a house building a house in in my country here due to the poverty they are using a house in the great work ok and my third question is what's the ruling on posting in the social media while evening aunt a nation sorry what's the ruling on posting posting post posting what any videos pqm be ok I will answer in sha allah so fatima from saudi arabia saying what is the ruling on watching UFC I think it's called Ultimate Fighting Championship or something like this while fasting so it is MMA as well mixed martial arts whether you fasting or not this is beside the point fasting has a status that must must be honored when you're not fasting more so if I'm fasting I may refrain from things that I wouldn't normally refrain from while I'm not fasting so fasting should be more valuable to us than normal days and this is why the Prophet told us are some that fasting helps us to curb our sexual desires and to lower our gaze because I know that I'm fasting I'm observing Allah Azza WA JAL and I'm lowering my gaze now UFC is a violent that is dependent on choke choking locking breaking the joints and hitting the face so the intention is to subdue and to harm your opponent in any way you can and this is totally prohibited in Islam striking the face in Islam is totally Haram don't pay any attention to famous Muslim boxers or famous MMA fighters hitting the face is something that our prophet Isis I am totally prohibited end of story full stop so whether he's a Muslim he's famous he's doing la ilaha illaallah when he fights and hits people this is beside the point he's not a companion he's not a tabby he's not even a scholar to be followed he's just a fighter being paid for what he's doing and what he's doing is against Islam end of story so whether you fighting you are fasting or not it doesn't make any difference what makes a difference is it's even worse for a female to watch such fights men who are almost not wearing any clothes and enjoying what you seeing this is not at all permissible or normal her second question is what's the ruling on building a house in a cemetery this is not permissible the Prophet arezzo son prohibited walking over graves he prohibited sitting over graves so the graveyard is a public place and you are not allowed to build a house in a public place without permission and you're not allowed to build a house over a graveyard to begin with and Allah knows best and she says what's the ruling on posting videos and pictures on social media pictures of women are not permitted permitted because this defines the hijab when you post your picture on your Facebook or Instagram and anyone can see that then what's the ruling why wear hijab and if you say that this is only exclusive to private group so only my moms can see it we know that it's easy to hack these places and you can't trust everyone else from taking a picture or a snapchat shot and then posting it to someone else and all of a sudden your picture is all over the news so this is not befitting of a woman at all it is permissible for men and children providing that they are decently they're decent in what they are wearing Abdallah from Canada a colossi shake I have two questions for you yes shake my first question is is it possible for allah subhanho wa taala for him to change someone's cutter on lailatul cutter and how does how does one find that night and my second question is okay I read somewhere where Sheikh Abdulaziz bin bus that he would sleep only two hours a night and when he would answer questions he would be doing the zip between each question like a specialist or a list like that is that true okay that's the only questions I have all right so Abdullah from Canada says is Allah capable of changing the destiny of a person on the night of other lailatul father the question itself is inappropriate to ask because Allah is ogl is capable of doing whatever he wills first of all but maybe it was inappropriately framed or formed secondly the issue of cutter is a very important issue to know it is Allah's knowledge now you and I don't know what Allah's prescribed for us so when someone says how is it possible that making do I change the cutter so you're objecting as if you know that my other was to die today and I made Ryan Allah prolonged my cutter is that true you can't tell you don't know whether I'm going to die today as preordained or after 10 years so how dare you question the change of other when you actually don't know it so Dora is part of your destiny and dua has the power to change cutter which you do not know so don't think over things that are way above your pay grade trust Allah believe in other which is Allah's knowledge and that it was preordained fifty thousand years before Allah created the universe acknowledge this fact and you will feel happier and more content everything can happen but I don't know what's gonna happen five minutes from now well actually I know because the episode this time is over but no seriously speaking I don't know if I'm gonna have an accident if I'm gonna reach home well if I'm gonna die if I'm gonna fall and break a leg no one knows so thinking and overthinking of these matters would corrupt your life have trust in Allah believe in whatever happens it was with the destiny and preordainments allah azza wajal and finally as for the question of about Jacob in Bath's that he used to be to sleep two hours I don't know about that I know that he used to sleep minimal hours between two to four hours even while traveling according to those who accompanied accompanied him as for his continuous vicar I have heard this myself I used to call him every a day almost for a long period of time and ask him questions and he had to landlines so whenever one rings in he answers his assistant would answer the other one and says hold the line so while you are listening to him answering the other questioner after he hangs up by the time he takes the phone from his assistant he would you would hear him say a slow for a loss but and this is Nam and he would answer any this was on daily basis so this is a fact and I've heard this myself this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you fear Manila was salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
