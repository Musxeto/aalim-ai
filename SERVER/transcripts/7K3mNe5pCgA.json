  "transcript": "foreign what is the ruling between a step daughter and a stepfather is it obligatory for me to rise her in an Islamic way as like we do to our own children beat them for not praying at the age of 10 or will I be simple like if I give her to herself without just teaching her first of all Islam says that when a woman gets married to another man her children custody must be taken out or away from her and given back to her husband this is the norm because I as a divorced father would not want my children to be raised up in the house of another man who's not related to my daughter who's not related to my son I don't know how he's going to treat them this is the default but in some cases the man the father says I'm okay with that let them stay with their mother or if the man is non-muslim or he's a a bad Muslim who is not fit to raise the children we may compromise secondly if the children are to be raised in your house they have no obligation towards you yes you're paying the rent and you're paying for the food most likely their father is paying their mom for their food and for their rent so they're chipping in with the expenses so they're not obliged to obey you they're not obliged to treat you as a father and you have no right on in shouting at them or hitting them reprimanding them you don't have any right you're their stepfather that's it you're not their real father so yes you are not obliged to do on any of these things however it's not one size that fits all if I have children of my wife growing up in my house I have to be diplomatic first of all I have to win their hearts so they have to have the true conviction that I love them that I care for them like I care for my own children and that I want the very best for them secondly I have to know my limits so just because I love them this does not entitle me to beat them up or reprimand them as a real father no the real father has this power not me so I have to know my limits and not exceed that thirdly I should not have high expectations of them obeying the obeying me serving me like I do with my children so I know if I'm in the living room and I just do this I would expect my children to immediately jump and say yes Dad would you like tissues or should I get you some coffee or do you want to drink water what are you looking for this is what I would be expecting from my children I wouldn't expect that from my step children but if I get such treatment alhamdulillah it's so this is a win-win so you have to know your limits and Allah Knows Best"
