  "transcript": "if I am going to buy a dress for this one I'm going to buy a dress for that one if i'm going to buy perfume for this one I'm going to buy perform for that one and that's why it's a headache anyhow the Prophet says there should be no causing of harm or reciprocating of harm so you don't allow harm to happen to you this is haram and it's wrong for you to inflict harm upon people and whoever writes in his will something that goes against what we have stated before it is rejected so someone may have a will that states I'd like to be for example buried in Washington DC we cancel this wish paddy him anywhere once someone says I in my will I don't want my wife to remarry after me of course is any having concerned that over the people who would come after him is it for God's sake but do we have to do this no any will that goes against what is fair and what is Islamic is rejected and we don't look at it at all among the first things that you as a Muslim should indicate in your will the fear of Allah so it's not only financial aspects the first thing that comes on top of the agenda on your will is that you give advice your family to fear allah azzawajal i advise my wife to observe her a job I this is my will to my daughters to fear Allah to prey on time my will to my son's to fear Allah had to be to become good days and to become good practicing Muslims so you you write the guidelines that you would like to advise those who you leave behind and because we live in time of ignorance a lot of the Muslims are ignorant so it is advisable that you write in your will that they would avoid that they would innovations and things that do not relate to Islam especially related to your own death so you write in your will that I would like you to prepare my body to prepare my washing shouting and prayer and burial in accordance to Islam so I don't want any wailing shouting crying I don't want any dinner parties after my death though the wife is celebrating our let's have a feast is dead hamdullah know all of this you have to write down and say that these are not part of the Islamic tradition so you give them an insight of what you would like to happen after your death and we have a lot of things indicating this in the Sunnah for example heard a familiar man may allah be pleased with him he stated that whenever when I die do not proclaim my death to anyone for I fear that it might be or it may be a death announcement and I heard the prophet areas of Salaam with my own two ears forbid death announcements what is death announcements it's what used to be done previously where a man would go on his mule or his horse in the streets of medina or the seats of the city so-and-so has died so-and-so has died ask Allah for mercy and he goes and announced this this is forbidden and likewise nowadays announcing it on a full page and a newspaper that so-and-so has been transferred into a las mercy and he's now in paradise at the right side of a lots of Harlem what are you doing and at the end the name John Claudius antonio's he's clicks tea and we we did so many times in the newspapers that so-and-so has died and he is now in the mercy of Allah Georgia in paradise and you it is a Christian Christians choose no one enters the Paradise except a Muslim this is what the Prophet said I've Sammy sent one of his companions are even have a polyp and to announce to the people that only a believing soul would enter paradise only the Muslims of course I don't have to go into explanation that the time of Jesus peace be upon him before Muhammad Ali salatu salam Allah have mercy and praise upon him before the time of the prophet has done all those who were Christians are in paradise as long as they did not notify their religion and the time of Moses before the time of Jesus all those who followed the teachings of the old testament of the Torah are also Muslims and they are in paradise until ISA peace be upon him came I don't have to go to this you all know this and this is not part of the course so it is essential that we write our will so that we would clarify everything that needs to be clarified now what is the ruling on visiting a sick person is it mandatory it is one of his rights the Prophet said that is awesome one of the six rights of the Muslim among them you all know that if he gives salam you should reply and if he is ill you should visit him if he dies you should follow his funeral if he sneezes and says that hamdulillah you should say your ham okumura one thing to bring to your attention and I know you know this is shala if someone comes in the room and says assalamualaikum and one of us says why they come share our hot allah it's sufficient it's enough but if someone comes and sneezes and says alhamdulillah each and every individual in this room who heard him al-hamdu lillah must say your ham oh come on ma so this is known as for Delta fire for dying for Belka fea communal obligation or collective obligation as they translated into English if one person does it the others are exempted while for bein which is an individual obligation each one of us has to do it and any this is something on the side is every illness a cause for visiting is every illness a cause of visiting so if I have a slight headache are you supposed to visit me or once it is something that is not making me a go out and act normally is a cause for visiting scholars say that if it's something that is light and it's not considered to be disabling someone has a cut in his finger oh I'm going to visit my brother is sick this is not something that calls for visiting so it is not even called a cause for skipping a day of fasting Allah tells us that whoever is sick or traveling he's exempted from fasting and he must fast other days so if someone has a cut in his finger he says well Larry today's Ramadan I am allowed to I'm sick I have this illness no it's not and this is something that's crippling you something that is disabling you from functioning so this is the type of illness that it is instructed for you to visit among the obligations upon us when we visit someone when he's ill that we have to distinguish and to figure out if his if his illness is really serious in his on his dying bed I should prompt him colima kanima the organization is called kanima right so what's the Kolyma Lila helluva if he's on his dying bed but imagine if i visit someone who just operated on his knee and I go to say say later he'll Allah well what have I done c'est la la la la I will kill the guy before his time no this is not that I think or I will go and visit someone who's not dying he's sick he's just underwent an operation maybe in his intestines or something with appendix or whatever and I'm visiting his style and say say like I hit a lot this is depressing no you say this to someone who is on his dying bed so you have to know and we will come to the issue of how to do this in sha allah prompting the dying person how would i do this the shake and on your book he says that whenever a person is is on his dying bed so those next to him should do a number of things among them is to teach him the Shahada how is the Shahada taught to the people scholars say when they interpret the prophets hadith sallallahu alehiwassallaam prompt you're dying once to say la la la la and who's ever last words before dying are Lila halala will enter paradise one day even if he is afflicted before that by punishment so this is seriously an issue of contemplation when you die if this is the last thing you say you will enter paradise that doesn't mean that you will not enter hell maybe you'll enter how to just be purified and we hope and wish for Allah's mercy that we don't even be purified a large l UD would forgive our sins and we would go to a paradise inshallah but the problem is who is the one that Allah would grant this great fortune and blessing and favor to say it before he dies brothers and sisters we have a big problem in our lives how many times do we say Lila halala in the day we never think about it I'm driving in my car fast you know reckless Saudi drivers I think Emirates are more reckless now I don't know which is greatest accidents in Saudi or in Emirates this is all the same they're all dying people are dying by the hundreds in Saudi of traffic accidents of Hannah lock very reckless people very a bad regarding road sense they have no Road sense Saudis and I believe FML at ease as well matter no maybe you have more tickets here than us but we still it's a very dangerous thing so I'm driving and I see this big lorry big big truck filled with rocks and doing 80 kilometers an hour coming to me and I know it's going to hit me and I'm not going to die what's the first thing that comes to my mind shoot you know you play with the with the letters or an F word or whatever why this is all what that what comes on my tongue I only curse I only say bad things this is what has been affecting my whole life what do i watch through the day and night soap Oprah's movies I listen to music and all these words all the time so when something this serious happens do I say la la la la Allah Subhan Allah and these are my last words no they're not this is our life and this is interpreted at the last moments of our lives so don't even think I have a friend that was about 20 plus years ago who told me that he was involved in a car accident not personally but he sold the car flipped over so many times and they got the man out of the car and he almost had no bones it's all crushed olin blood the boy is dying is but 20 20 years old when 20 years old and they told him c'est la la la la and the boy could hunt he was singing and it he said that this was the cassette in his car of the song that was he was listening to before the accident so they say Legolas a nail I had a lot and he died singing in singing not of course with the singing saying the words and he died he could not and then the books affect so many stories similar to that of people unable to say the Kenema so imagine it is an issue of training if I tell you now let's play football or basketball and you're not prepared and you not have not warmed up what will happen to you you will get an injury you'll pull a muscle the worst tomorrow when you wake up you will not be able to get from your bed the whole muscles and bones are you know needs a week of rest similarly but not the same if you practice if you keep on saying these things if you're contemplating and living the Kadima when you are on your dying bed Allah would get would favor you and make you say it we say things we don't contemplate we don't think we don't glorify allah azzawajal and this I always tell my brothers and sisters I always enjoy saying this okay do you know anything greater than Allah is there anything greater than a lot know how many say how many times do we say in the day and night Allahu Akbar how many times does the more advanced a Allahu Akbar in the day and night yella calculators give me a figure 40 no mushkila something that we hear every single day five times a day I than 30 and the akama with the Karma it's 50 no it's different 50 times the Marvin says in the day and night Allahu Akbar and we say behind him a lot but in the five daily prayers how many times do we say Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar when we prostrate when we Plus how many other guys do we have in the five daily prayers calculators 17 thank you and the Shonan is 12 so these are 29 among them all with the moa then it goes over 200 times we see Allah ho Akbar in prayer every single prayer at the end we make liquor 33 times and so this is x 5 150 565 I don't know before you go to bed you say 34 times so our day is composed and it is formed over praising Allah soldier and glorifying Allah so a shell and testifying that Allah Akbar Akbar from what Akbar means greater than greater than what then everything but when you say Allah Akbar you have to imagine that he is greater than materialistic things he is greater than my boss he is greater than my parents is greater than my nagging wife is rating them my ungrateful husband the wife say this he is greater than this and that so when I pray I don't think of my calamities my problems my debts I don't think of everything anything I think that I'm praying to the greatest who is greater than everything if you live and contemplate in these things when you are in your dying bed with the grace of Allah the only thing that comes out of your mouth is remembering Allah so you will be part of those who are fortunate to say Lila halala but yeah when you go to your car turn on the CD or now unfortunately they don't have any cassettes now everybody's see these I don't know you see these turn the radio on is it on the Quran or is it on music so this is what you live and this is how you'll die your heart is a vessel either you fill it with the river remembering Allah or fill it with anything else it cannot have both and this is why it's very critical when we are on our dying bed that we try our best to end our lives with saying la Ilah illallah one of the things that were or one of the obligations upon us when we are next to a dying person that we make duaa for him one of the etiquettes that we make du'a for a person who's dying or a person who is ill the Prophet tells us at it's awesome that if you say in the presence of a dying person isola oddly Rob Badar Jalali and yesh vehicle how many times seven times if his death is not inevitable LOL cunin so you always say this there are a number of great door that the Prophet tells us and teaches us to say when we're visiting people sick people when was the last time you visited a sick person or a long time ago why we're in Dubai people don't get sick they die or they have to go to work unfortunately in a big cities like to buy you Judah people live in small boxes made of concrete you don't know your neighbor you don't know who lives in you with you in the building you we see people in the message society monitor and we leave if your neighbor comes in knocks on your door you look at what does he want so you open the door he says Salam Alex salam gave head like a hey I'm dilla and you try to tell your son before you open the door take my wallet and put it under the bed so if you want some money that will lie I don't have my wallet on I don't have money we always have these suspicions we always think negative and that is why it is very important for us to try and visit people i know people hamdillah who don't know sick people so what do they do you go to the hospitals they go to the hospitals and they visit the sick Salaam alaikum when they are I do it myself when I see old people on the stretchers or in the hospital if I'm going there I pray to this uncle uncle Salaam alaikum this is uncle look at you you look so great who are you talking hunk o you know that that mr. sorry so no seriously I go to them and I saved me i'ma make it easier on you and it brings joy to them it brings a lot of joy to the people when people supplicate to them and wish them well Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him once wasn't the message with the prophet and this is the habit of the Prophet awesome after every fechar prayer he asks them if they have seen a vision and a dream and he interprets it to them one day he said that it's a lot to Salem who among new companions of the prophet has fed a poopy a person so bakr this is farah so a worker said i did a prophet of allah who among you is fasting a booker I'm me prophet of Allah who among you visited a sick person me prophet of Allah cool among you follow the funeral me prophet of Allah for things are the Prophet she doesn't by Allah these four things if they are joined in one person in a day Allah would admit him to paradise now we fast Mondays and Thursdays most of us and feeding a poor person it's very easy in sanjeeda we buy half a chicken and some rice 10 reels and there are gazillions of people you can give them especially you know these African people who work and cleaning and so they're needy they so we give it to them visiting a sick person go to any hospital and in open words Salaam alaikum ya hey this is a tape this is a cassette this is a booklet I just came to pray for you in sha allah may allah make it easy upon you that I mashallah you look much better now may Allah's will make you stronger and going to funeral lahore assert any graveyard there are mosques next to it where they pray the funeral just go and pray there and follow it until it's buried Nicholas easy you can do this and you could be among the people of paradise will you do this inshallah shaking my summer vacation I have 30 days in sha Allah in November I will take it and I will we keep stalling stalling store next year the following year masha'Allah we're getting older and older and shallow we still have hope so we have to supplicate and make dua for the deceased and in his presence or in the presence of a dying person we should not say anything except that it is good now my advice to you is to look to your right and to the left if you see anyone sleeping just shake them do it now please look to your left and right if you see anybody who's asleep just tap them on the shoulder I'm old you know I could feel fall asleep talking to so if I see someone is asleep this is intimidating to me anyhow I know it's a little bit early for you guys but let's continue inshallah the Prophet says is awesome if you are in the presence of a sick or dying person so it's not only the dying one even a sick person you should say good things for various so you should you should say good things for verily the Angels say I mean to whatever you say so you should be very careful especially the women okay what do you have against women I have nothing against women i adore women i have two wives that handle that and i have 13 daughters so I have nothing against females I'm surrounded by females I'm swimming in an ocean of oestrogen so don't don't think I have anything against them hamdillah but it's it's very important to understand that women are soft by nature and the first thing that happens out of i can tell you because of my family and my relatives they would wail and do things that are unimaginable the easiest thing that a woman would say if her husband is dying or the sick may Allah make me in your place and the husband thing so don't there is an angel saying mean to whatever you call a lot Sojin so you should always be positive save me unlock your illness may Allah make you stronger you may Allah make you healthier because there is an interesting I mean instead of saying negative things okay now prompting the Shahada scholars have different opinions the Sheikh ban email have mercy no soul is following the hadith to the letter so when the Prophet says prompt any say Lila halala this is what you should say scholars say that this is not what is meant by spirit the spirit of the hadith is not like this it depends on the sick person some sick people on the dying bed they're strong their conscience if I say c'est la la hey la la he would say la la la la I would remind him some people would be in a state of frustration and maybe Shaitaan would overcome him so if I say c'est la la la la you say I'm not going to say this word why are you saying telling me to say this i'm a muslim and I don't need to have I don't have to say such a thing and he may die on this so the scholar said depending on the personality of the person on his dying bed if you think that he is strong and knowledgeable say to him hamdillah if you think that by hinting it would be enough then that's good so if I'm dying and someone next to me if not all of us now if I say la hey la la the first thing that comes to your mouth is now everybody is saying it you notice this if you go to the lift the elevator and you're in the elevator and there are five or six people with you when you say aloha masala dosa lemon a Muhammad what would they say immediately the Muslims would say o Muhammad solution man if you say la la la la and when you see via Subhan Allah dhul Jalali lemma it's in us it's an Arab our blood because we Muslims handle em we always praise Allah so it is in our system so if you're with a dying person you just said liya hai na ma he would say this if he didn't say it again in another way by saying the prophet salallahu RSM said that whoever says Lila hey Lala and this is his last words Allah would admit him to paradise you're just saying hadith what would a deceased person dying say hi Lala if he doesn't go directly to say c'est la la la la as in the hadith with the prophet alayhi salatu salam visited a man from the answer and he said uncle in the Arabic word it's yahel kyle is a maternal uncle yes and I'm is a paternal uncle so in English Hulk is the same uncle is the same so the Prophet went to him and said jihad se la illaha illallah so the man who's in the on his dying bed he said uncle paternal or maternal why because the people usually we would say to any elder am my father's side anyone but the Prophet said Hal why because his mother was from the medina people so that is why he used to address the people from medina as a while there his maternal uncles so the man is saying I'm work Holly said no hot girl from maternal side se la illaha illallah and he said is this good for me and the prophesied yes it is so he said la illaha illallah so in this hadith the Prophet instructed him to say all say also in the hadith of Abu Talib his uncle he will cherish it my uncle say la la la la a word that I would intercede for you at the side oval on the day of judgment so he instructed him so it depends on the personality of the individual and you have to try to reach that now you do not bug the dying person by every two minutes sale idolizes Lyla hello MA after two minutes c'est la la la la la and if you keep on doing this no scholars say that as long as he does not say anything afterwards Hollis so I tell him say light Allah he said slider and he doesn't speak for a whole hour and then he says can I have some water we bringing the water and say c'est la la la la he says that a lie it doesn't speak at all and then he says what time it is we say it's five o'clock say Lila hit number so it should be the last thing he says if he says it for us don't don't repeat it again because this would cause him to be fed up maybe or irritates him or increase his illness now a lot of the Muslims think that reciting surah yaseen and I get tons of questions from brothers and sisters not speaking in Arabic about Jesse shall we r I recited before we sleep so we decided over the people who are dying shall we recite it when we visit them in graves shall we recite it every single thing they insert Surat Yasin and unfortunately this is baseless in Islam yassine has no authentic hadith in it at all so what did the people get this from fabrication there's only one hadith which says prompt you're dying people Surat Yasin or recite over those who are dying who not debt so that you seen what and scholars differed whether this is authentic or not the majority say that this is not an authentic hadith so what I do people say that recited because in it there is glad tidings of that man who went and warned his people and he said that o Allah o gel has given me paradise I wish my people know about this and so and so so this brings glad tidings to the dying person that inshallah you will be like him that Allah has prepared the Jenna for you and so on but it is not authentic so we do not do it and we do not recite it to our deceased this is point number 15 in this point again or also the Sheikh saying the ruling on the dying person being faced to the Qibla and the chef says that there isn't an authentic hadith upon this from the Prophet re salatu salam other scholars say now this is part of the sooner because heard a familiar man may allah be pleased with him also instructed his people around him to make him face the Tipler in his dying bed so how would I face the Tipler if I'm lying on my back this is I'm facing the Qibla if I'm lying on my right side then my face should be towards the Qibla so what is the ruling on it there isn't any additional profit or it's about some authentic to be accepted but the doing and the choice of the Companions that they used to do it some of the companions and it is acceptable both ways to do it or not to do it would I personally do I would not why simply because it is much difficult for the person dying so imagine your brother or your father is on his dying bed and he's you know faced this way doctor blades there and all of a sudden you come and face his bed to the Qibla what are you doing s'okay father's ok and he was telling him that he is going to die so this is not comforting at all if he requests this is okay but you're doing it for him no it's not part of the sooner because if it was part of the sooner mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her told us that on her on the Prophet as someone he was on his dying bed where did he die he died on her chest he was putting his head on his on her chest my be necessary when he she says may Allah be pleased with her so she did not tell us that she made the face of the prophetess m towards the Qibla which indicates that it is not part of the Sun and it is not that recommended unless he calls for it and he asks for it what is the ruling on visiting a non-muslim sick person scholars say that if this is to show him Islam to call him to Islam this is highly recommended and the hadith in this that backs it up that the Prophet alakazam had a Jew servant who would do few things for him he got sick so the prophet has slammed him and while he was next to his dying bed he said to him accept Islam so the boy looked at his father who was a Jew by in a naturally and the father said obey Ibaka's him obey the Prophet so the boy accepted Islam and the Prophet came out erase a lot o sanam with his face glowing saying alhamdulillah who saved him from Hellfire because of me and when he died the Prophet said salala Hari of Salem pray over your friend or over your companion so from this we take a small glimpse of how the life of the Prophet was Alice latosa the Prophet would not leave anything for normal things in the sense that everything in his life was based on calling people to Islam where allah says holiness alati 10 Sookie Wilma hiya Wilma Mattie lillahi rabbil alameen what does that mean say my prayer my sacrifice my life and my death is for Allah Sojin a Muslim does not have something that is called spare time even his spare time is for the sake of Allah soldier"
