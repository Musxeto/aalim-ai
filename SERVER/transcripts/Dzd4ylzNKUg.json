  "transcript": "I heard that people say for every step you take to the Masid you get reward but how about if you take public transport would you still get reward the Hadith is specifically in regards to walking so whether you ride a horse or a mule or a bicycle or a motorcycle or public transportation this does not count as walking so when you walk from your home to the bus stop or to the tube and then from the tube station to the Masjid these steps are counted for you only and Allah Knows Best"
