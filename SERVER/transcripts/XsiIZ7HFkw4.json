  "title": "Is security guard exempted from praying Friday prayer? #Assim #friday #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what is the ruling on a security guard securing a Masid during jum and missing jum because of the shift would he be excused from jum due to this a security guard is someone who is obliged to protect their property whether he's protecting the Masjid itself especially in the US and North America and Europe where a lot of the islamophobes uh terrorists tend to try to attack the masjids and the worshippers so it's a communial obligation upon them to protect the masjids or they're protecting a mall or an office building or a shop and again as their job is to protect the premises they're Exempted from offering jum prayer and they can pray it without any problem inshallah"
