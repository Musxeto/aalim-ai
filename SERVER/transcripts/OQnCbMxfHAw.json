  "transcript": "regarding the number of narrators they classify a hadith of being I had I had me in once from one to nine so they say that if there is a hadith and in the narration there are levels so Aldo Hari says that I us at A&E his Sheikh said that soupy an authority his share said that shahab Missouri said Satan a boy on these are levels of narrations and we know every single person in there everything single thing he did we know them and they're all authentic if one by one narrated this this hadith is considered to be a hat and some people would not accept this this is this is the one man's opinion one man's narration and the most authentic opinion is it is accepted because when the people were praying to Jerusalem one man came to them he's a companion he said there was a verse revealed on the prophetess aram that the pitlor has changed into Makka immediately they went 180 degrees Jerusalem is to the north of Medina and Mecca is villa south they immediately moved so the amount was in the front now he's in the back but they continued the prayer they could not say his one no I need someone else to come with him and also in Ramadan when even our mail and pleased with him came and he said o prophet of allah i saw the crescent he's one he ordered the people too fast he did not say bring another one so her hat is accepted in Islam hey and the majority 99% of the ideas I had if you reject it then you've rejected Islam the second type is called mushroom then there is Aziz and also it depends on the number of narratives in every level the most famous hadith of a hat is Kingdom el-amar lupini yet the most hadith ever in the man a man who vignette verily the deeds are my intentions every single chapter of flip depends on it that is why mm shafi may allah have mercy on his soul said that three hadith that the whole of islam devolves upon among them is this hadith and hadith of Aisha whoever didn't awaits something in our religion is rejected and other Hadees so this is the levels of hadith the highest of all is a luta Wyatt error what is a motivator is defined as it's a hadith that a large group of people deported from a large group of people that it is impossible that they all collaborate on lying so if someone comes and says to me it's raining outside say yes it is definitely 2 3 4 10 20 100 this is definitely true it's definitely raining I don't have to go outside to check because it's impossible that they collaborate maybe three can collaborate but in whenever we have a lot of people then it is impossible poor man has been relayed to us through a matta wat a hadith qudsi is not there may be one or few very few a handful of happy thoughts you that is not a water but the majority are all a hat then we come to another difference Quran can be recited in and prayer but at its core series never we you cannot when that is why people sometimes ask can we recite the Quran in English because you don't know Arabic it's very difficult for us a new Muslim comes accepts Islam he says I cannot read that hamdu lillahi rabbil al-amin it is difficult can I read it in English it's not just difficult it is impossible for me to read Fatiha I cannot it's impossible so can we get him the permission to read it in English what would he do okay then hey this is said that sets of Hannah la la la what gets a present it's true what when you cannot read the fatty huh you should say subhanAllah and hamd allah allah walk but lie low until you master the fact i know they will fight over this i don't know who said it but it's a problem by the Quran was preserved by Allah no way anyone could tamper with the Quran it's impossible it's been 15 centuries and no one can tamper with the Quran the Quran is the Quran has never changed it will never change it's the same Quran with the same visitations several reciters with the same I hope it's preserved and intact while the hadith alkoxy or reddit nabol we have week we have fabricated we have life we have no door we have marple we have fastened we have sorry we know them we can say that these hadees shall accept it or not accepted by going into the science of hadith Quran you cannot say that well of his eye is not accepted no just mooseheart he's been preserved by Allah Georgian and as I said hadith of the Prophet Alison can be from his HD hat from his own not reasoning yeah I vaguely translated to reasoning but this is what the best of his abilities he thought of this it was right yes it's why it was wrong LOL correct him while the Quran is only delivered by gibril ok can it be delivered by allah al directly this is not the Quran this is not the Quran it is inspiration but it is not Quran so what was revealed to the prophet as salaam by why in the garage in the seventh heaven is this / on no can another angel come more the verse of the Quran and say no it should only come through jubrey because a logical path lozada be here woohoo I mean add a pelvic the gibril the spirit the trustworthy spirit has revealed it on to your heart so it can only be through jibreel peace be upon him and if someone decides a hadith qudsi in salat this would not be acceptable because we do not worship Allah with it and thus Allah so what's the difference between hadith Qudsi and the Quran beside all of this some scholars say that the hadith Qudsi the meaning is from Allah and the wording is from the Prophet is a lot to say and then you might get confusion between hadith Qudsi and hell is another week because also the hadith and never we the meaning is from Allah and the word is from the Prophet is Islam other scholars say no hadith qudsi the meaning and holdings are from Allah but it is not from the Quran it is not miraculous and it is not challenging and this might be the most appropriate definition and distinction between all of this"
