  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord when people sneeze this is normal whether it's Corona Delta Omicron or who knows what comes next may Allah preserve us and save us from all pandemics and diseases and conspiracy theories as they say so what to do sneezing is something that we hear so often upon sneezing Hadith 188 alhamdulillah foreign all praise is for Allah so this is the norm when you sneeze you say alhamdulillah it doesn't stop here the prophet says and his brother or companion or whoever hears him should say to him in reply may Allah have mercy upon you so there's an exchange alhamdulillah it doesn't stop I have to reply again to his invocation that Allah has mercy upon me by saying the prophet says and he that is the one who sneezed replies back to him by saying guide you and rectify your Affairs or your condition whoa this is only for sneezing but look at the Beautiful Exchange of Dua beautiful words that come out of people's mouths and this is when you sneeze once or twice or three times and you say alhamdulillah and I do this but if I sneeze for the fourth time then others should stop saying because after the third times this is flu this is not something that is random this is an illness and it's continuous what to say may Allah cure you that's it and you don't have to say over and over and over and over again the following chapter 78 what is said to a cafe a disbeliever when he sneezes so what's your difference well if a disbeliever sneezes we can't say why is that because he's a disbeliever we can't ask Allah to have mercy upon the disbelievers or to grant them Jannah but we can ask Allah for anything that's good and beneficial for them in this world and this is why we were taught that whenever a disbeliever sneezes foreign guide you and rectify your condition this is something in the Dunya may Allah guide you that's good rectifier condition Grant you peace and Tranquility in this Dunya nobody hates this now the disbeliever cannot object and say you're segregating you're discriminating why don't you ask Allah to admit me to Jannah you don't believe in Jannah you don't believe in Allah to begin with I apologize for saying Ahi because this is rhetorical but if you do welcome to Islam and I will pray it Allah to admit you to Jannah from now till the day of judgment but if you're not a Muslim you will not be admitted to Jannah and this is a given so you have to understand this chapter 79 supplication said to The Newlywed oh so I see someone who just got married or I'm invited to a wedding and they're making the marriage contract is there something I should say the answer is yes very beautiful Dua Lake very simple to memorize may Allah bless for you your spouse and bless you personally and may He unite both of you in goodness and this is what every spouse needs they need this Dua so that Allah would combine them and unite between them and goodness and Grant them good Offspring and righteous Offspring and healthy Offspring as well chapter 80. the groom's supplication on the wedding night or when buying an animal and I know that a lot of our sisters and daughters would feel discriminated and they would say hey why did you combine us with animals it's not how you think this Dua is said by a man who buys a right or who buys a slave or who gets married what does such a person need he needs Allah's guidance he needs Allah's protection so what does he say the Dua in the Hadith number 191. foreign a slave you should say oh Allah I ask you for the goodness within her and the goodness that you have made her inclined towards and I take refuge with you from the evil within her and the evil that you have made her inclined towards what is wrong with such a Dua this is a beautiful Dua and the prophet continues to say and if you buy a camel then you should take hold of its hump and say the same thing the same Dua nowadays none of us is going to buy a hump a camel but we will buy a car we will buy a motorcycle so we should also put our hands on the Bonnet or on this the roof or on the steering wheel whatever counts and we say the same Dua for what we need Allah's blessings over what we are buying whether it's a ride whether it's a a slave servant or whether it's a wife but this does not by any means compare a wife to a camel or to a ride or to a slave this is something that we are acquiring and buying or having in our possession and we are in deep need of Allah's guidance and protection this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you here in Manila was [Music]"
