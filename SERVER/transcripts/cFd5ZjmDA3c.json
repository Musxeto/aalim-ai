  "transcript": "he's asking about buying a an apartment from a bank and the bank this happens everywhere now he's talking about paying installments for 15th 15 years and then either paying a down payment or a final payment and then claiming and uh uh uh possessing this flat so he's asking is this permissible first of all to get into a Halal transaction first of all the bank or the financial institution should acquire and own this apartment before any commitment so I go to the bank and I say listen I'd like to buy this five room uh apartment and they say how much it costs and they go investigate they find that it is XY z uh uh Euros for example and they go and acquire it and buy it and then they call me and they say look these are the uh paperwork now it is our names we own the actual apartment we will sell it to you for an interest extra to the original price of 15% 20% 50% there's no problem because you can simply say h no that's a lot I change my mind I'm not buying Salam alaykum this can happen and the bank has no right to say listen we bought it for you so you cannot sign any paper before the company actually acquires the apartment and you can and must not pay anything as a down payment for uh seriousness for example uh before they owned apartment what happens is the following some banks when you go they give you a full list and form you fill it up you pledge and you guarantee that you're going to buy this uh flat from them and in some cases they may make you sign over checks for God knows how many months or years this is Haram this is not permissible the second possibility is that when you go and uh uh show their your interest in buying this car this vehicle or that apartment they tell you okay give us a â‚¬10,000 down payment and again this is Haram because they did not own the the uh the merchandise the product that you want to buy and this goes against the Hadith ofam may Allah be pleased with him when he said that the prophet told me do not sell what you do not own so if I do not own it then I cannot sell it if the bank goes and says listen khed I or Muhammad I have the apartment these are the credentials these are the paperwork it's in my name now let's make a transaction you make a transaction with the bank that you pay over the duration of 15 years to buy and not to lease to buy this apartment from them and you pay a monthly fixed rate of so and so so the end value of the apartment let's say it's a million this is what we agree and sign upon done whether I pay it in a month I pay it in a year 10 years or the full 15 years or even if I postpone payments and I pay it over the duration of 30 years the price does not change they have no right to say oh 15 years was the deal so now because it's 17 years will'll charge you 5% over the original price no this is riba once you sign the contract with the bank the final amount has to be fixed and it cannot be changed by increasing it can change by decreasing If instead of paying it over 15 years you pay it over 10 years the bank gives you a bonus and says listen 10% off as a gift this is okay but I hope this in makes uh the question question"
