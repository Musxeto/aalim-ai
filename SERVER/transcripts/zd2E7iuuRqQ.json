  "title": "Signs of Allah's love towards His slaves 2/2",
  "transcript": "the first sign as the prophet alayhi salatu salam is the sign of allah almighty testing and trying his slave and servant by giving him calamities and torments in this life to test his patience and test his trust in allah almighty and this sounds a little bit awkward to us but if you contemplate and if you try to recite the Quran with understanding if you try to ponder upon the verses of the Quran and at the same time contemplate on the stories of the prophets before the Prophet Isis on and in his story as well you will find a clear evidence to this the Prophet says our insalata Saran that when allah loves someone he would test him when allah loves a group of people he would test them and in Bukhari and Muslim even miss Rodney Allah be pleased with him went and visited the Prophet at his officer once when he was ill and he put his hand on the prophet's chest and he found that he was in a very high fever so he said o prophet of allah the companions and I we used to say to ourselves that the prophet of allah azza wajal gets more ill and he gets more sick than two of us normal people is this because your reward is doubled the Prophet save a little of salaam yes that is why we could sick this severe in this heart and in another narration the Prophet said I saw understand the most people in the severity of calamities that default upon them and in the test of a large organ the most people who get this are the prophets of Allah then those who are closer to them that is the righteous then those who are less and less and less the Prophet says that a man is tested according to the level of his faith and religion and if he is strong in faith Allah would increase in his destiny and if he is weak in his faith and in his commitment to his religion Allah Almighty would test him according to his faith the Prophet goes on to say so lala haria resent them and that is why calamities and testing of allah azza wajal would not be lifted from a servant of allah until he walks on earth without a single sin in his records Subhan Allah this means that due to the severity of this trials and testings that Allah would forgive all of his sins until he walks on earth without a single sin on his shoulders or in his records and we have to know that there are a lot of people who claim that Allah Almighty loves them yet they fail to prove this there are people such as the Jews and the Christians they claim as Allah tells us in the Quran that the Jews and the Christians say that we are surely the sons of Allah and his beloved servants so they claim that Allah loved them and so often we hear people saying that it is due to the fact that Allah loves me that he had granted me this and that or that he had answered my prayers and calls or he had fulfilled what I wished and hoped for so everyone claims that Allah loves him and that he is honorable to Allah the Almighty and that is why Allah is doing what he's doing for him and this is wrong I received an email a while ago from one sister who is masha'Allah righteous praise night prayers and masha'Allah she says and claims that note whenever she calls Allah Allah answered her call and whenever she makes so clear to someone who is ill even those who have cancer three or four or five of them were cured miraculously and whenever she sees a dream it comes exactly as she saw that dream and she says that she has full trust in allah azzawajal the problem is that this sister thinks highly of herself and thinks that allah is doing what he's doing for her because she is beloved by Allah so LG is favored by Allah so Allah and she has this Spach this status at the sight of allah subhanahu cara yet this is untrue because this is something know what and can claim besides this sister says and claims that because of her position at the side of Allah Allah is anger calls and when she started telling me about your problem I covered that she is not married islamically to her husband for the past 12 15 years they have married civil marriage and her husband is not even a Muslim he's following the gurus sect and he's refusing to accept Islam and he's also refusing to have a proper marriage in an Islamic court with the approval of her father and it goes on and on yet she insists that Allah loves her and that is why he's answering her calls Allah the Almighty examines those people who claim such claims by saying in a beautiful verse in the Quran Allah says all in kuntum to heaven Allah factor the owning of the become allahu wa alikum to become a la hawla wala rahim say if you truly love Allah then follow me that is the Prophet Allah so Salam then follow me and then Allah would love you and then Allah who is forgive if your sins because Allah is most forgiving and most merciful therefore one of the greatest signs of Allah's love to you you as an individual is when you find yourself following the Sunnah of the Prophet area salat wa salam following the instructions of the Prophet Allah is sort of a Salam staying away from the thing that he forbade you from doing your his Sunnah is apparent in the way you look in the way you dress in the way you treat others in your character in your moral conduct even in deep down inside of your heart which no one knows except Allah so tell if you are like this then rest assure that you are among those whom Allah loves them and by Allah whoever Allah loves them all the faculties were become easy and all of her all of his fears would turn to be security and tranquility all the clouds of darkness would go away and his heart would be filled with joy and happiness he will be among those whom he calls allah azzawajal and allah who answer their call due to his honor at the side of allah so whenever he asks allah something Allah gives him and when he ever asks Allah or six Allah's refuge from something Allah would give him this refuge because by Allah everything that is difficult becomes easy and everything that is unpaved in front of you would become paved and easy for you to walk on every one of us claim that he loves Allah as the ocean more than he loves his parents his sons and all of humanity everyone claims that Allah is loved by him more than he loves anything else but this is a claim that might be true and might be false because the love of Allah is something natural in every human being and it is only only normal that you love those who do good things to you those who honor you those who bless you inside and out so this is normal for you to claim that your Allah and it is not a big issue whether you love Allah or not the biggest issue is whether Allah loves you or not and that is why whenever we try our best to get closer to Allah by offering the mandatory things on time and then offering voluntary forms of worship to Allah Allah tells us in the Quran that as long as we be are trying our level best to get closer to Allah with these voluntary deeds Allah who love us and when Allah loves us then he would become our hearing that we hear with and our sight that we see with in our hands that we do things with and our feet that we walk with and this means that Allah Azza WA JAL would make us hear what pleases him and see what Peters him and her hands would act in the way that pleases him and we would own that pleases him so have we tried our level best to get to also to Allah with good deeds so that he would love us or we neglected the mandatory things that he obligated upon us have we tried to get closer to Allah and attain his love by being practicing Muslims with excellent characteristics and by perfecting the works that Allah loves when we do that that is the perfection we try to be kind with our families with our children and with our relatives have we found single Sunnah of the Prophet and it's awesome and every minor and major thing in our lives or have we rejected some of it because it is only superficial and it's only appearing to be a part of the Sunnah but it is not part of what is more important that is of the heart as so many people of the groups that go against the Sunnah say and believe therefore we should try our level best to get closer to allah azzawajal and to be upon those whom Allah favors and loves and we should not be deceived by this life we should not be deceived by this world the Prophet tells the salads or Sam whatever you see the slave of Allah is being given from this world what he wants while he is still committing sins be aware and be afraid because this is pulling his leg and Allah so Allah is making him do these things so that he would gain more and more sins I pray to Allah so gel that he makes us among those whom he loves and that he shows us signs showing us that He loves us and that he makes us dead that on the center of the profit aerosol artists a time until the day we die so we meet him subhanahu wa'ta'ala with pure hearts and good deeds and then we would be among those who are favored by looking at his face hands away Allah subhana WA Ta'ala in paradise I mean Allahu Alem when especially me in here Salaam"
