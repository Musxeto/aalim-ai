  "transcript": "he says he's got problems with insomnia so he doesn't sleep he took medication prozac but i think prozac is for depression but whatever and he was well for a period of time then he stopped it and this is a common mistake a lot of the people the patients do you must not quit uh uh um such medication on your own especially medication given to mental patients or by psychiatrists or psychologists or whatever you have to gradually leave them bit by bit as per the schedule set by the pharmaceutical companies and by your physician or your doctor you should not just say i'm gonna quit this is very dangerous so now he cannot sleep and he says is there anything in islam to help in this to my knowledge there isn't but also to my knowledge i know through experience and fact that usually insomnia is caused by either mental pressure things that occupy your mind or due to physical problems the physical problems are solved with medical doctors they will make their checkups and say that you have a deficiency in this or that and they will supplement it hopefully but when you have a lot of things cooking up here this is when you tend to get insomnia and one of the best cures for all of your stress depression anxiety fear is to believe in allah azzawajal and everybody says we all believe in allah we all pray and fast we all practice islam and i always ask my patients that come to me in counseling sessions and i'm shocked by the answer because one out of every 30 managed to successfully answer it i ask people after they tell me their problems do you know the six pillars of iman of course the kalima prayer fasting hajj zakat i said these are five he said um i don't know these are five pillars of islam i'm talking about the six pillars of iman and they say oh no i don't know those and i said subhan allah the essence of your religion is based on these pillars as in the hadith of jibril so you know the five pillars of islam which generally speaking everybody knows it and shares it everybody does it they're muslim but on the surface we can judge them what's deep inside is your akida is the essence of your religion the six pillars of iman to believe in allah azza the day of judgment to believe in the angels to believe in the prophets and messengers to believe in the scriptures and to believe in predestiny the divine decree whether good or bad this one we have a deficiency in if you trust allah if you believe in allah if you surrender all your your affairs to allah azzawajal knowing that everything was predestined 50 000 years before allah created the creation before allah created the universe 50 000 years before that everything was written down and done with so it's written in the preserved tablet that i assume will drop the pen at this specific date this specific hour this specific second exactly it's written if may allah preserve us the light should fall upon on my head and kill me it's written should i have anxiety saying okay i think i'm gonna move a little bit i don't know what's gonna happen no because it's gonna happen when it's gonna happen you cannot evade that you cannot avoid it you cannot escape it when you have this belief when you have this content of whatever is to happen will happen you will not have any anxieties you will not have any fears you will not have any worries or stress your risk has been registered 50 000 years before allocate the universe it's gonna come to you no one can stop it no one can increase it no one can decrease it so why worry why do you worry about your job why do you worry about the health of your child yes we're humans we grief we may be saddened we may be a bit worried but look at the prophet islam and abu bakr when they were in the cave while migrating from mecca to medina and the idol worshipers and the soldiers and the enemy forces were right on top of abu bakr them prophet of allah if one of them were to look under his feet he would see us what did the prophet say also oh you're right abu bakr what can we do no the prophet said what do you think of two their third is allah azzawajal look at this iman look at this confidence this is content this is tranquility thrown in the hearts of a believer and it's a very high level you can get there easily but you have to work you have to open your eyes you have to know your religion you have to know allah azzawajal and wallahi you will have no problems after that uh"
