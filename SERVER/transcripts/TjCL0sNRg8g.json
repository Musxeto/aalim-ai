  "transcript": "m alhamdulillah and welcome to a new episode of Mercy to the worlds now the prophet Alat wasam had set camp near hudia and negotiations were between him and the people of quray at first some of his allies from the tribe of came to him and conveyed to him what was going on he took his message he went to the people of quray and he told them that this is a very sound and logical request he's telling you and that is to have a truce and to allow him to perform om and and wait if he's victo Victorious then they can come and join him and his victory would be theirs and if he's not alhamdulillah someone else did the dir work but if they prevent him from going to mecca for omra he will kill them he will fight them until one of them die so qur was still in defiance was still arrogant did not accept what budale brought them so they sent another Envoy they sent and the minute the prophet sallallah alai wasallam saw him he told them that this man loves Allah a lot though he's a polytheist but he likes forms of worship no matter what the religion is so put forward to him the camels of sacrifice so the minute the man saw these camels he felt soft and he knew that they were coming to worship Allah they did not come to fight so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told him exactly what he told and he went back to the people of quray and he told them the same thing again the people of quray did not like this so went there to talk to the prophet wasam and he went to the prophet trying to have some logic with him in the sense that he told Muhammad have you ever heard of anyone destroying and fighting and killing his own people and his own family what will the Arabs say about you you want to come and annihilate all the people of qur and what happens if the other thing took place what happens if they fight you and they win over you I believe that you will be in great trouble and I believe that this is what's going to happen because all what I can see around you are a bunch of cowards and thugs I I don't see anyone of great interest around you and next to him was Abu Bakr sik may Allah be pleased with him and immediately after he said this he he said very bad words to him you know he he cursed him and told him do you think that we will leave Muhammad and run away and he said very bad words to him so looked at the prophet and told him who is this man saying this these bad words to me so the prophet sallam smiled and said this is Abu Bakr sik and Abu Bakr years ago did did a very big favor to and he could not recognize him because Abu Bakr it's been long and Abu Bakr was wearing the uh and so on so said Abu Bakr had it not been for the favor you did to me years ago I I would have answered you back but I will not because of your favor and the habit of Arabs whenever they speak to someone and they would like to request something of him they used to touch their beard so whenever I talk to someone and I request and I beg him for something I would just touch his beard you know please do this for me please do that for me as form of requesting and begging and whenever did this to the prophet Alat next to the prophet was a man in full armor was beyond beyond recognition no one could recognize him with all the helmets and you know the armor he was wearing and with the with with the holster of the sword whenever wanted to touch the beard of the prophet wasallam he used to hit his hand he did this once twice three times Thena was you know agitated and who's this arrogant man who's doing this Muhammad who's who's doing this so uh uh the prophet Alat wasam smiled and told him that this is your nephew is doing this to his uncle and was astonished and said M you're doing this to me had it not been yesterday that I've have covered the bad things you did and what were the bad things that Al did history tells us that Al M before before Islam before he reverted to Islam went with a group of his tribe or a faction of the tribe from bani Malik and they went to a king or a a tribesman a leader in his tribe and they visited him and there were about 14 of them with M and because of they were all from One Tribe and M was from another tribe after saying the poetry and being kind to this King and so on he gave them gifts and they requested these gifts to be only to them and they deprived Al from these gifts on their way back he gave them wine and they started drinking and singing he did not drink anything until they were fell all asleep and they were all drunk he went to the Hall of the 13 of them and chopped their heads off he killed them he took all the gifts and all the money and then went to Medina and accepted Islam telling the prophet sallallahu Ali wasallam what he did so the prophet Sall wasallam told told him as for your Islam we accept this because you're a Muslim now as for the money we cannot accept that because it was taken through treason and through betrayal the tribe of these men SL wanted to attack the tribe of Al because he killed 13 of them so his uncle came and paid the blood money for the whole of the 13 and that is why things calm down now years later when was talking to the prophet and holding his beard and Al used to hit his hand he told him now after I have covered up for you and compensated for the wrongdoings you did now you reward me in this fashion that showing up showing us how the companies were loving the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam too much of course they love the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to levels Beyond imagination and this is exactly what conveyed to the people of qur he went back to qur and he told them people you know how close I am to you I I have not uh uh uh I do not have any intention of deceiving you I've been to uh Caesar I've been to the Persian leader kisra I've been to the Aban leader and Nashi I've been all over to the Kings and princes of Arabia and elsewhere but I have never seen anyone glorifying and loving their leader as the companions of the Prophet wasallam loving Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam I've seen them with this great love to the extent that if he spit they would try that the spit fall in to their hands and they would rub it and wash their face face faces and bodies with it imagine that because the prophet was not like any other and even if someone thinks that this is gross or you know not nice look at the people who were with Jesus Christ peace be upon him they would have done something that was even more than that even those who were close to the priests and to the Saints it was reported in the books of history that they would take their sockes and wash their feet and drink the water of they've used to to wash their feet with so this is this was not abnormal this was the norm they whenever he the prophet whenever he spit it they used to try and get that spit rub it and rub their faces and bodies with it if he performed Evolution for prayer they would fight to get what the water he performed ablution with the the water that falls from his limb and they would also perform Evolution with it itself if he spoke nobody would raise his voice and no one of them would look him into the eye out of love and respect now who's describing this who who was aist so he's telling them I've seen something second to none this is not natural this is not normal the amount of love and respect they have for the prophet so I urge you to accept whatever thing he is uh uh proposing because this is your best choice now all of these envoys and ambassadors were from the Poli tide okay had the prophet did the prophet wasallam do something similar to that no yes he did he sent his uh uh son-in-law to the power of two that is because he married two of his daughters he sent his son-in-law and a beloved companion Manan and this is inshallah what we will talk about just after the break stay tuned and we will be back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman Alim each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no when shares or is compared to Allah in it and welcome back the prophet wanted to send one of his close companions to Mecca in order for him to explain the real purpose of their presence there so he sent Omar but Omar asked for an excuse and he said oh prophet of Allah if you send me I don't have any of my tribesmen to defend me if anything wrong happened so I am not the the the one to be sent but I suggest that you sendan afan because all of his tribe are there and they're all close to him so the prophet sentman was also loved by his people so the minute they saw him they asked him what are you doing so he told them that I'm here to convey the message of my messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam so they honored him and they uh uh uh respected him they gave him a fresh horse and they took him to Mecca once he reached Mecca they his cousins and his relatives asked him to go and perform om because this is what you came out of Medina to do and the Chance was there this is mecah this is the Kaa you can perform alhamdulillah and you go back safe to your people now any one of us being 6 years away from Kaa from the holy lands would have immediately said well this is something that I should not miss notman said no I cannot perform om and watching the prophet not being able to do so therefore I will only perform when the prophet s wasallam does so he conveyed the message to the dignitaries ofr qur they had a very difficult time reaching a decision so they kept aan they've honored him they hosted him they gave him food they gave him a shelter and they were discussing and and this discussion was heated and they kept on discussing And discussing not knowing that the Muslims had other thoughts and plans whenman did not come and they calculated the time and they thought that delivering a message and coming back shouldn't take more than so and so when he was delayed they thought that the people of quray must have killed him and the rumors spread among the Muslims that he was killed the prophet Alat wasam was angry because was a Muslim Muslim he was a messenger and Messengers not do not killed are not to be killed and he was his brother his son-in-law so the prophet Alat wasam gathered the Muslims under what was known as the tree of redwan and this redwan means the pleasure and satisfaction and he took the pledge from them uh the pledge of allegiance that they would fight till the death and it used to be known as the pledge of to to die and all of them shook their hands with the prophet Alam in showing their allegiance to him that they are to go into battle and no one would run away now one of the brave Soldiers of Islam Sal you know his story and how what what he did and how he salvaged uh uh the camels of Charity on his feet all that Fitness he had all that stamina he tells us may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam took his Pledge of Allegiance three times at the very beginning in the middle of it and at the very end and every time he tells him Sal where's the Pledge of Allegiance and Salam would say Prophet I gave it to you said no give it to me again and a third time which tell shows us that the prophets focus sallallahu alaihi wasallam on selected people who are known of their uh loyality and of their bravery and also the prophet wasallam shook his left hand and said that this is Forman because man was not present he was either killed or held as a prisoner in quray so he also took his pledge of Al and qur came to know of this and they were scared because they know how tough the Muslims are and they know how determined they are and they know that they are talking taking the wrong stand by preventing those who are just coming for om to perform om so they are in on the aggressor side so immediately they sent one of their men known as to negotiate with the prophet I heard that the events happen before happened before called is that true this happened what when the Propet check the hands of the compan under the tree yes is that called yes the allegiance of rwan and and the tree itself was called the tree of uh uh pleasure or satisfaction where and why was it called by this name that's where the event took place yes but why because Allah revealed a verse where he says that Allah is satisfied with those who are giving you the Pledge of Allegiance so it was mentioned that Allah was satisfied with them and this was on the on and also uh these people are among those who whose sins are forgiven in an authentic Hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says that Allah Almighty has forgiven the sins of all those who gave me the pledge of allegiance of rwan under the tree of course they all gave the Pledge of Allegiance except one hypocrite who was among them he was the only hypocrite and he did not give the pledge of allegiance to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had one Mission they told him the people of quray negotiate with him do not let him escalate the war but the most important point that you must achieve is that they cannot come to Mecca this year we do not want the Arabs to say that they've entered Mecca by force let them go and everything else is okay is is we can do that but the main thing for you to negotiate about is not to enter Mecca this year period so came and he started negotiating with the prophet Alat and it he talked a lot and they spent a lot of time negotiating a in until they reached an agreement so the prophet asked Ali to come and write the agreement and he said Ali write so Shel said I don't know what's rman this is something from your own invention who's the most merciful we don't know this we don't know the name of our God to be rman or just write in the name of Allah so the propheter said write and then he told Ali write this is what or this what has been agreed upon between and so he said hold here what do you mean by between and the messenger of Allah if we agree that you are the messenger of Allah we should have followed you but right between and Muhammad abdah this is what the prophet's name is so the prophet said by Allah you know that I am the Messenger of Allah but it's okay it's not going to harm me erased that Ali and write Muhammad abdah Ali was frustrated he said by Allah I will not erase your status as the messenger of Allah you are the messenger of Allah so the prophet s wasallam erased it himself now some Scholars say this shows that the prophet Salli wasallam could read his name though he was illiterate and this is normal you find a lot of illiterate people recognizing their own name because they've seen it so many times other narrations say no he was illiterate he could not read he asked where was it and he was directed to the messenger of Allah and he erased it himself and then went on with the treaty the agreement and that is why this uh uh Expedition military Expedition is called the agreement or the truths of hudia and it comprised of four main points the first point as requested by the people of quray that the prophet Alat wasam and his companions must go back to Medina this year they cannot enter Mecca by no means but they have the right to come the following year and perform om only to stay three days in Mecca and they should not have any form of Weaponry except their sword and after 3 days they must leave meca and this is talking about the next year the next year not this year so this was item number one the second item was that the truce should take place for 10 years and no one would attack the other or their commercial Caravans and this was their main concern the second main concern that they would resume their commercial activities afterwards because it was jeopardized for for the past six years so this was item number two the third item was now as they are two superpowers whoever wanted to join the alliance I of one side may do so from the tribes among them and around them and the minute a tribe joins the alliance of the of of one of the two parties any attack against that tribe would be considered an attack over that party itself and the fourth and final item we will come to discuss it inshallah when we meet next time until then h h"
