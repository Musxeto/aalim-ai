  "title": "How to deal with abusive non practising parents? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from macedonia says his family are not practicing and the house where he lives there's a living room and as usual the television is always on and there are lots and lots of inappropriate scenes displayed and in addition to the music so whenever he tries to leave the room his mother gets angry she might she might beat him she might even threaten him to stop him from uh pursuing islamic knowledge so he's asking what to do should i stay and pretend that i'm not heeding it but i'm hearing it yet there's a difference between hearing and listening so listening is something that you do intentionally with your own will but hearing is something that you're forced to do and you can distract yourself or at least resent it with your own heart and and not like it so he says what should i do we have a set of rules that we have to acknowledge and these are rules of engagement if you wish to say first of all it is our duty to be dutiful and obedient to our parents we must respect them at any cost and no justification allows us to do the opposite so we have to be respectful dutiful diplomatic and trying our level best not to do anything that angers them but on the other hand we have a more important ruling and that is the obedience of allah azzawajal so you tell me which one overrules the other obeying the parents while disobeying allah or obeying allah azzawajal even if this causes the parents to be angry it goes without saying that the obedience of allah is a top priority that cannot be compromised now once we get this in our heads we can act upon it with the previous rule which is that we have to be dutiful obedient uh respectful etc to our parents now you're a man you're not a child anymore so you have to be diplomatic but you have to stand your grounds and tell them that this is haram and allah has prohibited what you're watching and listening to so either you turn it off or i'm relieving you of my responsibility and going to my room if they insist on you staying you have to make a stand and you have to leave whether they like it or not because the moment you compromise your religion you give in tomorrow they will bring beer and they drink it on the table or maybe some wine the following day they would be having free mixing maybe afterwards they would bring a priest to say the prayer you never know what will happen even though if they claim to be muslims so there is a line that we have to draw while keeping in our mind that we are respectful and obedient to them"
