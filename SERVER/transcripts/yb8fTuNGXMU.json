  "transcript": "My question is um I heard an student of knowledge. He said that Issa is a sahhabi. Who? Because the prophet Isa apparently he's a sahabi because he met the prophet question. Yeah, I got a question to you. What is best a sahhabi or a messenger? What do you think? I hope you not mute yourself again. A messenger. A messenger. So what does it matter now? Just because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam met Isaat wasam in the fourth heaven or the fifth heaven on the miraculous journey. People say, \"Oh, he's a companion.\" What does that mean? Yeah. And it's an upgrade or a downgrade. It's a downgrade. The upgrade is that he's a one of the strong willed messengers, the five willed messengers. So who cares? And by their logic of this student of knowledge, we could cascade all messengers of Allah who prayed with him and say the same about them."
