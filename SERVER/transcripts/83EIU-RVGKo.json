  "title": "Is money earned from Cupping halal? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "was about cupping and what confuses what confused him is hadith where the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam tells us that the earning of a person doing copying is hadith and there is a hadith where one of the companions may allah be pleased with them all bought a slave who was a professional copper and he took his instruments that he does the cupping with and he broke them and he narrated this hadith that the dowry or the the money that a prostitute takes is hadith and the money the money that the sooth faith sare takes is hadith and also the money of person who does copy so the scholars were confused a bit because the Prophet himself performed copy and he gave the man who made copying for him a dinar and he told us a decision that the roots of curing and treatment and healing in Islam depend on three and that is a drink of honey and a slice or a slash of a cup or a person who does cup in and cuter ization or al k burning with a hot piece of metal in designated or certain places of the body now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said this and yet he told us that the earning of a copper is hadith now the word hadith is not always Muharram it's not always forbidden so with the soothsayer with a prostitute it is definitely forbidden and it is not good it's evil but when it comes to a person who does copying we have to understand it that it is not good not that it is not permissible it is not good it's like eating garlic and onions it's it has lots of benefits yet the Prophet described them Alys Ostrom by being habitat on their hadith in the sense that smell are repelling and they annoy people so you're not permitted when you eat garlic or onions to go and attend prayer in the Masjid because you would annoy others you would harm them so the word happy does not always mean that it is forbidden and so it is the same with this hadith then why did the companion break these tools simply because at the time of the Prophet Alice aksaram copying was done personally in the sense that there were no special tools Oh what he has to have is a blade he cuts or slashes the back of the neck or the shoulders and then he gets either a glass an empty glass and he lights something so he vacuums it from air and he puts it inside and it sucks the rotten blood out which is black and rotten and very heavy not as normal blood that people get when they get their wounds or and this is what was usually done he puts sort of a tube and he sucks the blood out with his mouth and there is a possibility that some would come into his mouth so this is not something that people look up to and Islam looks up at jobs that preserve the dignity of a person and at the time and until now if someone goes and sucks blood from a person and the rotten blood and may come into his mouth this is something this that's disgusting though it has good medical benefits to it and the awkward thing is that some Muslim doctors even fight this though the Prophet did it has some and he encouraged us to do it and so many studies encourage doing this yet some so-called Muslim doctors in the lands of Islam still fight it and oppose it and they close all clinics that have this beautiful Sunnah being practice yes you can govern it you can put regulations but you don't have the right to stop such a treatment therefore I hope this answers your question nowadays does that is the earning of a couple still look down at well I don't think so because the majority of those who do copying nowadays are professional doctors so everything is sterilized everything is clean and up-to-date and Allah knows better"
