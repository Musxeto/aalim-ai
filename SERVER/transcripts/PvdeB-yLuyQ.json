  "title": "Can we fast in order to make our dua answered? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible to do exra things like fasting a certain number of days to emphasize and make our Dua answered by Allah or should we just be content to ask Allah in time that du must answered fasting is not part of the things that would make your Dua stronger or be answered quickly it's not from the Sunnah however it's a good deed so if a person for example wants a particular job he went for the interview he made all the necessary tests and he's waiting for a reply and it's not coming it's not from the Sunnah for him to fast until it comes and materializes this is not from the Sunnah yes it is from the Sunnah to offer night prayer to make Dua between and at the last third of the night to give charity at asking Allah Asel for his kindness yeah this can be applicable but fasting is not however if you fast Mondays and Thursdays or voluntary days and just before you break your fast you make Dua to Allah because you know that the Dua of a person when breaking his fast is answered in this case inshallah that would be fine and Allah Knows Best"
