  "transcript": "foreign but the problem is that my salary comes in my account and my account my ATM is always with my husband so and my parents are very much needy because I'm the only source of income for them my husband gives them money but he tells everyone in front of his parents that I'm the only one who is providing them and insults me in front of his parents and abuse my parents abuses me and uh if I want him that give me some money which I can keep with me he says I am giving you everything which you need why do you need money he does not give me any spare money and and now recently I came to know that he is having a secret wife one of my best friend uh secretly they are married three or four years and now he's saying except her and you have to accept because there is no other option I I just did married to her because you are not supporting me at all and I'm doing my hundred percent whatever I can do I'm earning taking care of home cooking doing everything but he's not satisfied with me and now I just want to take pull up but I just saw a video of yours only that if a woman takes pull up without any reason she cannot enter the paradise do you have a reason Fatima is this is the reason because okay then this Hadith doesn't apply to you the Hadith and I got your question this is why I'm cutting you off so that we would utilize the time the Hadith applies for a woman whose husband is righteous practicing gut-fearing provide 100 pays the bill the rent puts food on the table he's kind he's loving he's a good father but she just applies for color why are you doing this people would kill for such a man for such a husband and she says I don't know I'm just bored I just want to explore other options I'd just like to see the world I don't want to be a housewife this Hadith applies for this woman who asks for divorce without the legitimate reason she will not find the fragrance of Jannah but for you being married to a gold digger no you have all the right to seek for divorce number one without talking go to the bank and cancel your old ATM card issue a new one and keep it with you never give it to anyone never give the PIN code to anyone number two evaluate your life with him and say to him enough is enough you're not paying the bills you're not paying um for my livelihood and the children if you have children I'm not going to pay a chip or chip in anything in the house this is your role as a man if you're a man but it's your mistake from the beginning to give your husband your ATM card and the access to it everyone every wife she is accountable she's sinful for doing this well I wouldn't say sinful but I would say she is mistaken if she trusts her husband this much and then comes in complains and and weeps that he got married again you gave him the means oh I trusted him why would you trust him Bureau obliged to obey him and be kind and do dutiful to him in the house not to entrust him with your financials I always tell spouses no matter how much you love your spouse keep your financials separate do you love your wife don't tell her how much you earn don't tell her how much you spent don't tell her how much you have loans and complain to her keep this between you and yourself and do your job as a man instead of asking her for help or expecting her empathy and if you're a woman never tell your husband about your financials your bank account how much you earn how much you're saving it's none of his business if he demands to know don't as when he demands to know your uh pin code or your password on your emails or on your mobile phone or your Instagram or whatever don't tell him it's your fault that you are being treated as a doormat because such quote unquote men would never stop until you are a concubine a Slave that they wipe their feet every time before entering and leaving the home this is not marriage marriage is based on Dignity on respect on compassion on trust or knowing your rights and obligations what you're doing is abusing this relationship what he's doing is taking advantage of the week and the vulnerable put your foot down and say enough is enough and then inshallah Allah would make a way out for you Abdullah"
