  "title": "Hadith 'When 2 meet with swords both are doomed in hell' VS Companions Battle of Camel Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "from canada the hadith of when two muslims meet with the swords with intention of killing one another both are in hellfire the murderer and the victim the victim because he was keen on killing his partner or friend before he was victimized before doing that so he says what about the incident of the camel when companions fought together we know that among them are some of the 10 heaven bound like like zubair so how is this possible the hadith is crystal clear each were keen on killing his brother that's why both of them are in hell now you tell me when the companions went and met in the incident of the camel of the jamel did any one of them thought of killing his brother or intended to harm his brother of course not do you think that sofiane or abram al-ass were keen on killing this or that or ali was keen on killing muawiyah or ali was keen on killing zubair and talhah who were on the other side of course not all of these battles that took place at the short span of time due to some confusion due to the hypocrites spreading their rumors and lies among the muslims to provoke such incidents all of the time they had nothing towards one another except love and respect and this is why when ali heard of the killing of zubair and of he cried and wept they were his brothers and likewise pleased with him when he heard of the assassination of ali he wasn't pleased he was his brother so this hadith does not apply at all in the situations that took place"
