  "transcript": "as that if I'm praying in my row and then I noticed that the row in front of me there is a gap and this gap takes a person so should I step forward two or three steps to stand in the line in front of me the answer is yes there is no problem at all and this happens all the time in Hallam so the Imam starts the Salah we all say Allahu Akbar and all of a sudden we find a gap in the line before in front of us so we walk and then there's another gap and there's another gap and we keep on walking like six or seven or ten rows while in the state of prayer and there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah because the cause is justifiable the Prophet said Ali salah salem man was allah soften wa sallahu la whoever connects and narrows a gap in a row Allah Azza WA JAL would connect him with his mercy and kindness"
