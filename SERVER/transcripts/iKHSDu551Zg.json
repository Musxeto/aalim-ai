  "transcript": "manwich says how to bury the deceased and offer condolences to his family first of all preparing the body of the deceased is a communal obligation followed by fire so if one person does it the entire Ummah is free from sin but if no one does it the entire Ummah would be sinful so when a person dies it is the responsibility of those who are in charge of him to take care of the body and how to do that well first of all o man which says what to do with the deceased once he's dead if he died all of a sudden without any warning we have to wait before preparing his corpse for burial so that we make sure that he is truly dead and not in a coma once it is proven without that doubt that he is dead then we take off his clothes while covering his private parts this is for men and he is thoroughly washed and prepared and perfumed and there's a procedure that is long what to use what kind of lot lots leave to be used etc and then after washing and cleaning and giving Woodill we shroud the deceased in three white sheets if you wish and tie him tie them in a certain way and we perfume again the shrouds he is carried to a message usually where the people the Muslims pray the funeral prayer that has no bowing and no prostration only for takbir and supplication for the deceased and then he's carried to the grave to the graveyard to the cemetery where he we dig for him a grave either doing shop which is an L type or lagged which is straight and then we bury him and put something on top of him and then put the sands over him and after burying him we makes application for 5-10 minutes and that is it we meet his family members we give them our condolences there's no party there's no gathering there is no lights or coffee or tea whatever we see them in the Masjid at the office in the market in the streets we give them our condolences by saying me Allah expand your reward and grant you patience over losing your deceased and then we may make some other supplications may Allah expand your deceased grave and fill it with light and open a window or on it or from paradise etc the whole process usually does not take more than six to ten hours depending on the permissions and the paperwork etc but it is so easy in Islam to prepare a deceased to his grave and get it over with because this is an ongoing process we treat death in a very calm and comfortable way because this is our inevitable ending this is our destination well it's not our destination or destination is general Allah but this is a transit destination and everyone has to pass through this and I hope this answers the question"
