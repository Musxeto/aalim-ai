  "title": "Why do we not say Bismillah before reciting Surah Tawbah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "why do we not say bismillah before reciting suratu tawba surah to tawba is chapter number nine in the quran and the most authentic opinion is that every single verse or a group of verses that used to be revealed to the prophet allah the prophet himself used to command the companions to put it with the following verses or in the following surah or in that place or in that other place every single ayah that was revealed it was upon the command of the prophet islam that it would be placed in a particular order now if you notice there are 114 surah or chapters in the quran 113 of them begin with bismillah only surat does not have bismillahir rahim in the beginning so ibn abbas asked us man why and in conclusion it was the prophet allah who used to tell them separate between this surah and that surah with bismillah but when it came to chapter 9 surah tawba the prophet did not order them alaizal to put it so some companions thought that it should be connected to surat al-anfal and others said that no it is not and the vast majority agreed and this was the consensus of the companions from their time till date that surat al-anfal chapter 8 is a separate chapter than chapter 9 surah tawbah and there is no bismillah rahim dividing between them why because the prophet did not tell them and this is the most authentic opinion not that it is a chapter that exposes the hypocrites not that because it's a chapter that includes a lot of punishment and torment of the hypocrites and the disbelievers these are old speculations nothing to back them up the most authentic opinion is the prophet did not say bismillahim to be placed in the beginning so it was not placed and allah knows best"
