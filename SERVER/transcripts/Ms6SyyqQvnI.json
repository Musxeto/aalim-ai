  "transcript": "so Shake I have a quick question about um The Traveler so um normally I do a lot of traveling up in the northeast of the US and whenever I'm like 60 miles away from my house I consider myself a traveler I went to a message not too long ago and um the brother said that if you're in an area where you can pray and um without shortening the prayer you have time to like combine and not shorten that you should pray the full amount of rockot and then the followup to that question is if I'm in a city and I'm considered a traveler if I'm at the mid and it's like maybe like 15 or 20 minutes before the adanos AER and I haven't prayed you know theor or aler yet should I just prayor and wait for aler to come in or can I pray theor and AER and then you know go about my travels sh first of all what your friends had said is wrong as you as long as you're traveling and coming back to your hometown and you're like 50 miles away or even 10 miles away as long as you did not reach the city limits of your own Hometown you can still combine and shorten your prayers without any problem even if I know that I'm going to arrive in 5 10 minutes but I'm still a traveler I still have the concessions of traveling without any problem inshallah"
