  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] and welcome to our 22nd class on the islamic faith explaining the book fossolon fell apart which talks about the simplified version of arpeda that each and every one of us must know and must have as a conviction so today we will talk about chapter number 14 of this book and this chapter deals with a concept that many of us may not think that it is of great importance which is the companions of the prophet and all books of apida mention a chapter about them about their virtues about how we should respect them and believe that they were the best of humans after the prophet sallallahu salaam because there were extremes among the muslim sects and cults and the most extreme as we know are those of the shia the rafale who slandered them who cursed them who talked ill about most of them therefore it is a sign of hypocrisy when you find someone speaking ill about one single companion let alone most of them it's a sign of hypocrisy when you find someone slandering the mothers of the believers the wives of the prophet and this is why it is important to know what a muslim must have a conviction of in order to have a strong islamic belief according to a sunnati the sheikh says the best of people are the prophets then prophet muhammad's companions may allah be pleased with them their high status is stated in the quran so this is something essential in our hakida allah mentioned the prophet's companions may allah be pleased with them in the quran by saying what translates to muhammad is allah's messenger and those who are with him are firm and unyielding towards the unbelievers full of mercy towards one another you can see them bowing down prostrating in prayer seeking favor with allah and his good pleasure just like some prophets are of higher standard than others the prophet's companions are of different standards so now the shaykh is showing us that the companions are different in levels the lowest ranking of profits is superior to the highest ranking companion of the prophet ali so the prophets as mentioned in the quran are levels some are more favored than others but the lowest ranking of the prophets is still higher than abu bakr may allah be pleased with him who's the highest among the companions in ranking as we all know likewise the lowest ranking companion of the prophet is superior to the highest ranking person among the following generation and that generation is the taberine but sheikh what is the definition of a companion and of a tabarine etc well scholars differed in defining who a companion is and the most authentic definition is that a companion is a man who saw the prophet alaihissalatu was salaam while in the state of islam and died as a muslim a man or a woman who saw so a person who did not see the prophet but was living at his era at his time is not a companion he must see he must have seen the prophet and met him and a disbeliever who saw the prophet saw while he was a kafir and after the death of the prophet islam he accepted islam he's not a companion because when he saw the prophet assam he was not a muslim and a muslim who saw the prophet but apost became an apostate apostatized and left islam and died as a kafir he is not a companion a tabari or a man from the taberean or a woman from the tabarine are those generation who followed the companions so they saw the companions but did not see the prophet the best of the prophet's companions were those who believed in islam during the early days of religion as we know the prophet islam stayed in mecca for 13 years three of them the very beginning was a secret da'wah and the ten afterwards were public so the then he migrated to medina so the sheikh is saying that the best of the companions were those who believed in islam during the early days of the religion the one who believed in the prophet alaihis message during the time when islam was in a position of weakness is better than those who believed during islam's time of strength and this is logical those who accepted islam when there was no reason to do so except pure amen there's there was no incentive worldly incentive they were the underdogs they were beaten they were oppressed they were prevented from practicing their own religion as they uh wish so they were oppressed big time when a person accepts islam when islam is this weak definitely he is better at the sight of allah than someone who came who who came 10 or 15 years later in medina where there were prosperity there were um money there was wealth there was an islamic state so this is definitely not the same in level of iman certainly those this is in the from the quran certainly those who believed before mecca fell to islam are better than those who believed after its fall oh this wasn't from the quran this was from the sheikh i think we've read that allah says those of you who gave and fought for allah's cause before the victory are not like the others they are higher in rank than those who gave and fought afterwards however the merits of companionship with the prophet alaihis salat is is assured to those who believed afterwards meaning that those who believed before them at the mecca period where higher in immanent level doesn't mean that those who believed afterwards are neglected no the their status is asserted and allah azzawajal would reward them for that the quranic verse goes on to say although allah has promised the ultimate good to all of them allah is well aware of all that you do allah also says as for the first to lead the way of the muhajireen of the migrants and the ansar those who supported them in medina as well as those who follow them in the way of righteousness allah is well pleased with them and well pleased are they with him so this is to set things straight they are levels but at the same time allah azzawajal would not deprive them from their good deeds even if they came afterwards the best of the earliest believers are the ten to whom the prophet gave the happy news of being in heaven so now the sheikh states their ranking the best are the 10 heavenly bound who are these now of course we have a great deficiency in knowing our history that would add value to our eman so if you ask any individual who are the 10 heavenly bound 99.9 of the people would fail to count them for you and they are to be blamed in a way because they haven't read the seerah they haven't read the contribution of the companions and this is why we lack great love when we don't have great knowledge when you ask people how do you feel about allah the strongest in their love to allah are the most knowledgeable those who know allah's beautiful names and attributes those who spend hours a day raising their hands supplicating to allah on one-to-one basis those who are always remorseful of their bad deeds and hopeful in their good deeds if you ask people about their love to the prophet you'll find that the greatest in love to the prophet are those who are greatest in knowledge so they know his seerah they know his biography you know they practice his sunna they do every little thing you find them when they eat they try to eat with three fingers instead of both hands you find them when they sleep they sleep on the right hand side and they put their hands under their chins or under their uh cheeks and all of this shows you that they're doing what they're doing because they love the prophet sasan likewise the companions if you were to read their sacrifices on what they had provided for the ummah for you and me what they have done for the prophet to protect him and to protect the religion you would not help but fall in love with them so the ten heaven bound companions are those whom the prophet allah and the last is the one speaking to you is in jannah and he is the brother in law of ammar his homer's sister's husband and he is also the cousin of umar these are the ten heaven bound and we know that they are the best and the highest of rank among the scholars among the companions the highest of these 10 are the four caliphs and so the best of the earliest believers are the ten to whom the prophet gave the happy news of being in heaven and the best of these are the four caliphs next to these ten are the prophets companions who fought in the battle of badr a handful of 300 plus some say 314 give or take these are the best among the companions after the 10 heaven bound knowing that uthman wasn't with them yet he still is better than all of them with the exception of the first two ab walker and roman and next to them are those who fought in the battle of uhud we know that but the battle of badr took place in the second year of hijrah battle of the overhead took here the following year on the third year of hijrah then come those who gave their pledges to the prophet under the tree so in what is known as bay atul ridwan [Music] and the is the tree is known as where the prophet sallallahu salaam came on the sixth year of hijrah with the companions wearing their haram to perform umrah and in an area called akhudabia which is recently or now known as shemesi it's the checking point between jiddah and mecca where non-muslims are not allowed to enter the idol worshipers came with their army to prevent the prophet isis from entering and we know all what had happened of uh the issue of the treaty etc and the rest of it uthman may allah be pleased with him was in his haram like the rest of the muslims so the prophet sent him to mecca to try and negotiate a deal with them as he had good connections with banu umayya and when he went there they asked him to go ahead and make his umrah and he refused he said no i came with the prophet i summon the muslims either we make it together or we go back together and they hosted him which delayed his return to the companions and when the companions the prophet sas thought that they might have arrested him or even killed him he instructed the muslims to give him the pledge of allegiance to die in fighting the disbelievers if anything would have had happened to ruff man so the companions came and there was a tree they all gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet allah to die in battle and one of them was who was a great warrior and and a great athlete he gave the pledge of allegiance in the beginning in the middle and the end upon the request and the demand of the prophet islam so those whom gave the pledge of allegiance are those who gave it under the tree allah says about them allah was indeed well pleased with the believers when they pledged their allegiance to you under the tree he knew what was in their hearts and so he sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with a speedy victory of course shortly afterwards earthman came back and they signed the treaty of achadevia in an authentic hadith jabber may allah be pleased with him reports that the prophet allah said to those who gave their pledge under the tree and look and look to their status and level he said you are the best of people on earth at the time there were fourteen hundred men one thousand four hundred people the prophet's companions were the trustees of allah's revelations and and they delivered islam to the people to speak ill of them is to cut their transmission of islam and to raise doubts about the sunnah of the final messenger of allah they are indeed the safeguards of the muslim community after the prophet as stated clearly in the authentic hadith my companions are safeguards for my community when they are gone my community will face what is in store for it this paragraph is extremely important why or let me rephrase that question by saying how if you were to think like a criminal if you want to destroy islam what is your course of action that you think that would be the best thing to do may allah forbid see sometimes you have to think like a criminal in order to fight crime so mostly people would say quran is this thing that binds the muslims and it is the book that is their constitution it is the book that they abide by okay can we tarnish its reputation can we cast doubts on it 99.9 said no way you can't because this book has been there for 15 centuries we've tried throughout history to discredit it to speak ill about it and the more you do that the stronger it becomes so okay what's the second stage well there is the sunnah of the prophet being this is a very important level because you cannot understand the quran fully and implement islam in its totality without adhering to the sunnah okay the sunnah sounds good what do we need to undermine the sunnah well you need to discredit those who relayed the sunnah to us who managed to transfer the hadith to us and who are those the companions so if you look around you nowadays in egypt in syria in the emirates everywhere there are people who are professionals in attacking the companions even in saudi arabia we have those who are called intellectuals academics who are given the platform to say whatever they want against islam and it is like a drop of water doesn't harm in the beginning but as it continues to drip it causes a hole in iraq and this is what they're doing they're speaking ill about the hadith in bukhari they're speaking ill about a contradiction they think it is there between a verse of the quran and between a hadith they start to speak ill and discredit ensure their disgust of a hadith or two or ten or hundred and they say that this is not logical this goes against the prophets etiquette allah or the prophet's moral conduct or this or that so the more they speak ill about the companions the more you as a muslim would doubt the sunnah and this is why we hear ignorance imbeciles all over the world how do i know that all the hadiths are authentic they came after 200 years ago later after the prophet hassan death maybe somebody lied maybe this maybe that see the process is not coming from a scholar or a true practicing righteous researcher it's coming from someone who's just recently been in a nightclub with a bottle of scotch in front of him someone who's known to have illicit relationships someone who's corrupt and is well known to have relationships with foreign embassies with rand organization with this and that paying them money to undermine islam so it is extremely important to hold an honest and pure position for all companions in our hearts and it is extremely important to be hard vicious strong against anyone who tries to speak ill about a single companion because this is a red line as it is a red line for me and you when someone speaks about our father or our mother or our honor we would not tolerate this the same has to go with the companions now the sheikh says to highlight an issue which a lot of those who counter attack our argument of loving them he says the prophet's companions were not infallible however their mistakes should never be an excuse to attack them their disagreements should not be revived except for learning from and drawing lessons therefore it should be looked into with respect and not for seeking excuses even when they disagreed the prophet's companions were better than other people even though they might be in agreement what does that mean so let's assume we my generation and yours are all in agreement the companions with their disagreement are still better than us in our agreement therefore where are we okay allah has granted them their high status because of their good companionship to the prophet allah not because of their companionship with one another and this is also important because this is why allah favored them because of their companionship to the prophet therefore their disagreement with one another was a question of choices meaning that they did their level best to reach a decision they might be right they will be rewarded twice and they might be wrong they will be rewarded once because their intention was for the sake of allah and they made their level best to reach that decision uh where are we their disagreement should not be okay we've gone through uh that even when they disagreed we've gone through that allah has granted them their high status because of their good companionship we've gone through that therefore their disagreement with one another was a question of choices when they all endeavored to be right and they are rewarded for their choices even if these were wrong to claim that they disagreed with the prophet is to be unjust to them and allah has declared or has cleared them of it so they had never ever wronged the prophet are disagreed with him and this is something that allah has made clear to us they gave the prophet allah some good companionship and through him they were better than other people and this is the reality that all muslims believe to criticize the prophet's companions may allah be pleased with them is risky now risky meaning it is sinful because this is an area that will grow wider and wider if criticism is leveled at one of them it will open the way to criticism of others hence the tabari or the taberine and their followers refrained from that meaning the generation that came right after the companions refrained from all of what had gone between the companions and also those who followed the taberine refrained from speaking ill about that um when he was asked about ali of man and the battle of the camel and the battle of saphine and what had happened during that period his answer was great now we know that there was a dispute between i'd email me please with him and some of the companions who were asking for revenge for the killing and the murdering of uthman may allah be pleased with him the third caliph and this was led by him and ali as the caliph thought that the best to do at the moment is to let things calm down and then get the perpetrators to justice there were hypocrites around who were trying to fuel the feud and there were rebels from egypt and elsewhere who were afraid of being abducted and tried and convicted and then executed for the murder of uthman so they made problems while the companions had the best of hearts towards one another there was the battle of safin there was the battle of the camel allah be pleased with him one of the scribers of the revelation of the quran and the brother-in-law of the prophet was also involved in some of that and he was backed by some companions and ali was backed with by some companions and they made the choice one of them was right and the other was wrong but he had done all what is in his capability to reach to the right choice that pleases allah azzawajal so when romar abdel aziz was asked about what had happened between the companions he replied in this beautiful statement he said these led these events led to shedding of blood and allah has spared my sword my hand from such shedding of blood i will not dip my tongue in such events so he's telling them i wasn't there to contribute to such disputes and take sides so allah saved my sword from being indulged in such a fitna now years later decades later i'm not gonna spoil and tarnish my tongue by speaking about it as long as allah has saved us i will not indulge or talk about it no one who comes after them that is us will be questioned on their disagreements on the day of judgment and this is a well known universal fact allah will not ask you nor ask me about what happened in safin or in the battle of the camel camel or what happened between ali and muawiyami allah be pleased with them or why was al-hussein killed in karbala all of these are not of our doing and it's not part of what allah would ask us about but everyone will be asked whether they recognized their merits or not everyone would be asked whether they love the companions or not you cannot simply brush it off and say who cares i follow the quran sunnah no you must love the companions and the prophet indicated allah that the believer is the one who loves the ansar and we know that ansar are below the level of al-muhajirin so if you love the ansar you must love the muhajiri if you claim that you don't have any love nor hate for them you're not a believer you must have these things in order to be a true believer and allah azzawajal knows best and i think it's time for us to take some uh questions so we have abdullah the first question how do i reconcile between the hadith where the prophet islam forbade us on decorating graves and his grave currently secondly what is the ruling on bowing prostrating swatting kneeling and nodding the head when greeting elders and ulama it seems to be tradition in nigeria in my sheikh don't explain to me where they got it please can you explain and how should i go about it without creating problems firstly it was the prophet alaihis who prohibited those who come after him from taking his grave as a reed and eight as we explained so many times before refers to time and location time we know redu etc but location is a place you visit frequently or every now and then this is called eid so the prophet prohibited the muslims from taking his grave as a aide to be visited frequently why so that people would not fall into shirk how by going to the grave and calling the prophet allah as we see them doing today they go to the grave they stand in front of the grave and they make dua some of them make dua to the prophet directly by saying o prophet of allah have allah grant me a son let allah azza will pay off my debts my child is sick i need him to be recovered so ask allah to do this for me this is ship calling the prophet ali sir in a book which has the title of the etiquettes of visiting the grave of the prophet sallam the author who happens to be from mecca from saudi arabia with a phd in hadith but he is a super sufi he says when you come to the grave of the prophet face the grave and say assalamu alaikum and these are four of allah's beautiful names and this super sufi is telling us to allocate these names to the prophet islam what more kufur do we need to prove that those who frequently go to the grave of the prophet salam and indulge in such practices would probably get out of the folder of the islam and this is why the prophet saw was trying to protect their iman and their islam by preventing from doing that mother eye says hadn't the prophet alaihis allah said that and among what he has said may allah curse the jews and the christians they had taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship she says had he not said that we would have elevated his grave from the ground but his grave was like any other grave it was this high from the ground one foot that's it it remained like this all of abu bakr's time omar uthman until the time when i think it was who decided to expand the machine so he instructed them to expand it to the south meaning in the direction of the qibla which meant that they had to include the grave of the prophet assam in the masjid what do you mean sir the grave wasn't in the masjid from the beginning of course not the prophet sawsan was buried in his home the house of mother aisha and wasn't the house of mother inside the masjid definitely not how would the prophet salaam sleep with his wives inside of the masjid when we know that a person in a major ritual impurity cannot enter the masjid all the houses of the prophet hassam were outside of the masjid so they were at this at the side of the qibla and elsewhere so when abdul marik ibn marwan did what he had done the taberine stood firm against that and he said no you cannot do this this is an innovation this is something that is not accepted in islam being the king being the ruler such people don't listen to others they don't adhere to what scholars say and this is a universal fact so that he ignored what they said and did what he instructed them to do and over the years every khalifa comes tries to add something to the chamber as part of glorifying it honoring it and when the ottomans came they did the same building this green dome etc which is all not part of islam so when you come ya abdullah and say how to reconcile there's no need to reconcile the prophet instructed us not to do this those who came afterwards did it is it the fault of quran of course not the fault of sunnah of course not the fault of those who did this of course yes so this is something that took place against the will of the prophet islam of the companions and of the tabihin as for your second question what to do with the traditions in your country where they squat kneel some of them bow some of them prostrate some of them touch the feet all of these are not practices of islam and leads to extremism in greeting and in some muslim countries unfortunately where they call their leader to be amir minim they prostrate to him actual prostration and of course you will always find a tom dick or harry claiming to be a scholar maybe he has a phd you never know and they would say yeah this is okay this is not for form of worship why did allah instruct the angels to worship to to prostrate to adam was were they worshiping him no you you idiot they were not worshipping him they were following allah's orders in our religion allah ordered us not to prostrate to anyone so it is totally being polite not smart to say and compare this to that and may who knows maybe if someone does not prostrate to his parents or to his scholars or to his ruler you would have the audacity to say that he is the devil himself he is satan because he refrained from prostrating like satan refrained from prostrating to adam you never know so these forms of greeting are un-islamic you have to avoid it and this is done basically by having the vast majority of the muslims educated enlightened we have to go around and tell them that this kind of practice though it angers the elders and it angers some of the dignitaries who are used to being respected they must be educated that it is haram i'll just give you one example the prophet said whoever loves people to stand up for him while he's sitting he should select his seat in hellfire to have everybody stand up for you out of respect as they do nowadays while you're sitting down or even if you're standing up if you resent the fact that some of them did not stand up this is a sign of arrogance that requires that you reserve your seat in hell fire and this is very terrible thing to do may allah azzawajal protect us all says whenever i pray i get whispers and get lost i get lost in thoughts this makes me depressed because i feel my salah isn't up to the mark that i would deserve paradise for it or if allah will even accept it from me please advise i can't advise you in a q a session because this requires a lecture there is a lecture i think in my youtube channel by the title of hoshur insala and basically speaking the journey to reach this level of concentration submissiveness and tranquility in salat this journey is a very long one some of the salaf says talking about himself it took me 20 years of struggling with prayer but then i've enjoyed it 20 years afterwards so in his 40 years of praying the first 20 years was all struggling thoughts being distracted shaytan utilizing this telling you that you're in hell allah will not accept this from you allah will not put you in paradise which is not true you see those who enjoy praying are rewarded those who struggle to pray yet still pray are rewarded twice rewarded for their prayer and they're rewarded for their struggling this is jihad that you're doing so keep on doing it and don't pay any attention to shaytan's whispers because this is what he does best rama al-farooq says if a person cries thinking of how sinful he is would his crying get him forgiven even if he doesn't say anything from his tongue this is in allah's hands the prophet said there are two eyes that will not be touched by fire an eye that wept out of the fear of allah so even if the guy does not ask allah for forgiveness doesn't show remorse but he cries out of the fear of allah cries out of the fear of his sin thinking of what will happen to him after death this is inshallah a sign of forgiveness however no one in his right mind would simply rely on crying without seeking allah's forgiveness without showing remorse and being regretful of what he had done so what you're asking about umar is a hypothetical question that it cannot be imagined how would a person cry out of the fear of his sin without saying oh allah forgive me this is not logical jamilah says i have shredded some paper and some has quran is it to bend this or must i burn it well if the shredding was neat where you cannot recognize the name of allah or a verse of the quran so it was shredded perfectly that the words are not recognizable you don't need to burn it you can throw it in the dustpan i've started and this is psycha i've started learning quran with tajweed since last year what should i give more priority to memorizing the quran or reading and understanding the tafseer you have to balance memorizing the quran has a great reward at the side of allah because your level in jannah will depend on the last ayah you've memorized if you memorize the full quran you'll be in the highest level half of the quran you'll be in the middle level etc but at the same time the quran was revealed to be understood and to be implemented and you cannot do that without tafsir allah azzawajal criticized the jews being like camels carrying books on their backs the camels don't know what's in the books though they are valuable books with knowledge in them so when you memorize the quran without knowing the meaning you have gained a lot of reward but knowing the meaning is the essence so that you can implement that in your life so you have to have a balance in order to have a win-win situation yes it says can i give my wife to be gold set as a answer is yes you can give your wife any maharishi accepts if you give her a mobile phone that's good if you give her books of knowledge that's good if you give her a diamond ring as a mahar and she accepts it as a maha that's great but in many countries there are different customs not related to islam but not contradicting or opposing islam at the same time so for example in india as many people say they give them the dowry in gold in in cash and they give part of the dowry in tallest of gold usually the father and mother-in-law give that and they insist that this is part of the dowry in saudi arabia the dowry is mentioned in the contract to be 30 or 40 000 reals about 10 thousand dollars but the tradition is the custom is that the man also gives in addition to that a set of gold or diamonds which is not part of the dowry this is a separate gift from a man to his wife so it depends travis says why is the and answer silent why not see we are not given the justification that fajr merib and isha the first two rakahs are loud because of this and that and the third raka of maghrib or the third and fourth of uh uh the third and fourth of asia are silent because this and that we don't have any justification so it is something that is entirely a form of worship of allah allah tells you sit down you said allah tells you to stand up you stand up you don't get the chance to ask why because this is an instruction of allah so we pray it as we pray it because allah ordered that ordered us to do so and allah was best md is it okay to serve in the judiciary of a country where sharia is not existing as the law and almost everything is secularized this depends if you're going to rule with other than allah's sharia you cannot work there and this includes being a judge but if you are a lawyer for example you studied law you have a law firm and you get people coming to you in cases that require a lawyer to defend them or to demand their rights which you know that they're telling the truth and there is no way they can get their right or defend themselves except by legislate by going to uh man-made laws and courts in this case this is permissible because it is to enforce virtue and righteousness and to prevent vice and evil but to legislate in things or to judge cases in haram laws abandoning the sharia this is totally prohibited and haram and finally sherrer says how to deal with a disobedient wife who cannot do anything but complaining her knowledge and actions in islam is nothing but zero first of all sometimes we tend to exaggerate in portraying a problem similar to yours because this is unimaginable how did you marry someone in the first place like that you should have done your due diligence you should have asked how her islamic knowledge is whether she's practicing or not you should have communicated with her before cancummating the marriage when you got the contract written a month or two before consummating the marriage to know what level of a person she is to come after all these years and complain like this usually out of experience because i do a lot of counseling sessions so i sit with couples and i know their ins and outs i know with the grace of allah because of me i am experienced allah gave me and blessed me with the experience to be able to tell when the man is lying and when the woman is lying so to come after all these years complaining that she has zero in faith and knowledge and she's always complaining this is unacceptable and if we dig a little deeper we will find that most likely you simply don't like her at the moment and this is the result of months maybe years of bickering which she is at fault while you are also at fault a woman doesn't bicker or complain unless there are reasons for that maybe you don't provide for her maybe you don't spend time with the family maybe your abusive nature calls her to defend herself by being abusive herself maybe you're prioritizing your family over her and making them use her as a doormat serving them being a humiliated person that no one cares about in the home failing to provide her with her own separate accommodation so i cannot answer you because your answer is not objective it's one-sided i need to speak to the woman and face her with the complaints you have said against her and hear her defense i need to hear from you why these things all of a sudden popped up now and not years ago and this cannot be answered in a simple email and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time which is next thursday forever"
