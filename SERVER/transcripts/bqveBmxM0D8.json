  "title": "Ruling on Women wearing high heels - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh he says can girls wear high heels and we've answered this before high heels for girls is not healthy it's medically harmful and it's endangering them as the possibility of them tripping or falling is higher than when normal when wearing normal clothes besides it highlights their body differently in public so wearing high heels for girls or women in public is not permissible for many reasons and usually it defies the purpose of hijab because when you see a woman even if she's a niqab a woman wearing high heels the sound of the heels the way she walks the way her body is is different and this is not permissible wearing it within the community of only women when segregated if it's not dangerous to her this is permissible but totally dislike because a lot of women complain of spine or back pains after doing this and it does not impact their health positively usually speaking but to do it every now and then in women community this seems permissible insha'Allah"
