  "transcript": "[Music] or to start the next prayer which then should i follow should i follow the masjid where i go this is a problematic issue because allah tells us to eat and drink until we can distinguish from the white thread from the black thread which means that we can see the brick of dawn now usually we're dependent not on visual contact rather on apps timetables or the event and we have to rely on the advan if we cannot verify it visually why because on the day of judgment the mu'adin will be held accountable as he is the guarantor for us to break our fast and to start our prayer nevertheless if the adhan is given for fajr two minutes earlier this is negligible so for you to come and challenge this because the app says so and so on the timetable so so-and-so is difficult you will not be uh questioning them on the day of judgement you will be questioning them so two minutes the adhan is given before fajr you refrain from eating and drinking but you do not pray fajr until the two minutes are over and you are certain that all of the three agree that it is time for fajr prayer and allah knows best"
