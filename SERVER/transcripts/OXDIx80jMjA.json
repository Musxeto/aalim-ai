  "title": "Fiqh - Lecture 11 Wiping on Socks Shoes Khuff Plaster (Semester 1 Zad Academy #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah we will study an important chapter that deals with purification known as the ruling on wiping over and socks what is meant by K is a footwear that is made generally of leather and this is how it used to be uh um made it's something that covers the whole foot including the ankles and linguistically this is what K is however nowadays anything that people wear on their feet that can stay by its own and it covers the whole foot including the ankles has the same ruling what do we mean by wiping over it this is regarding the issue of w when we make Evolution because in the verse dealing with Evolution Allah asael says that wash your arms to the ankles then Allah says wipe over your head heads and your feet to the ankles this wipe over your head and feet to the ankles is recited in two ways with a change of a vowel and when you change the vowel the meaning changes so one meaning which is we all read it we say and this translates to wipe over your heads and wash your feet up to the ankles and the other recitation goes as and this refers to wipe over your heads and wipe over your feet to the ankles what is the the significance the significance that in Islam in instead of washing the feet we have an alternative is to wipe over the feet when we will come to discuss the conditions of wearing such shoes or H or uh socks this is the only evidence the answer is no there are more than 40 companions or 40 hadiths that is that states that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam wiped over his which gives us the clear evidence that it is part of the Sunnah it is part of the religion so what are the conditions to wipe over your Scholars say that there are four conditions number one in order for me to be able to wipe over my socks I have to put them on when I'm in the state of Purity that is the minor ritual Purity how is that meaning that I have to be in the state of wo so if I wake up in the morning and I put on my socks I can't wipe over them because I'm not in the state of Purity I just woke up I have to perform woodo once I perform a complete w with washing the feet up to the ankles now I can wear my socks or maybe half an hour later or maybe a couple of hours later as long as I did not break my state of wo once I put them on then condition number one is fulfilled I can wipe next time I want to make W over them condition number two that these socks or shoes must be pure meaning that the material they're made of is pure I can't wipe over the skin of dead meat or pork and I cannot wipe over socks or shoes that have impurities on them such as drops of urine or the likes and the evidence is that praying in such shoes is not permissible so likewise wiping over them so that you would be in the state of impurity would not be valid number three the third condition is that wiping over these socks can only be made to uplift a minor ritual impurity if I am in the state of janaba or major ritual impurity this is not possible I have to take them off and have a full uh uhul or shower or bath and the evidence is the Hadith of safwan may Allah be pleased with him that we were ordered if we were traveling not to take off our or socks for three days and three nights meaning we can perform our W by wiping over them for three days and three nights whether we break our woodo due to defecation urinating or passing of wind but not of major ritual impurity in this case we have to take them off and have the number four the fourth condition is that the period must be honored and what is the period the prophet timed the wiping over the socks or the H for a resident to be one day and one night 24 hours and for a traveler to be three days and three nights that is 72 hours as reported by Imam Muslim now when does the period of wiping begin so how do we time this is it from the moment we put on our socks or is it from the moment we wipe the most authentic opinion is the lad so if I wake up in the morning and I perform W and I put my socks on and I go to work and I pray with the same woodoo that I the actual original woodoo that I put my socks on I pray and I don't break my w and this happens when the winter is due and night is so long or is it the opposite I don't know when I can pray all five prayers in a very short span of time and I go to bed while my having my socks on the following day I wake up for f I perform W and I wipe this is when the clock starts from the moment I wipe in my woodo so I can pray the whole day whether I break my woodoo three four times and I wipe over and over again until the third day F time if I wake up before the 24 hours are over and I perform M and I wipe then I still can pray if I do not break my w with this woodoo where I wiped over my socks now having said that it is a misconception among a lot of the Muslims who think that the time that is the day and night 24 hours if it's concluded my my woodo is broken and this is not true if the 24 hours is O are over I cannot wipe on the socks anymore but my woodo is still intacted even if it goes on for 10 hours afterwards because the wiping does not break by the end of the 24 hours what breaks it is the permissibility of wiping so you have to be careful and notice the difference between the two what can I wipe over the socks the shoes the any Footwear that covers so I can't wipe over sandals or flipflops I can wipe over anything that covers s the whole foot including the ankles and it sticks it stays by itself it doesn't fall off also I can wipe over the turbin and this head gear is not included because this is not a turbine I can take it off and put it on again what I'm wearing underneath it the small uh uh head cap also cannot be wiped over because it's very easy to take off and put up back again with the turbines that require a lot of effort and time to put on it's hard to take off and put on again it is permissible to wipe over it because the prophet sallallah Al wasallam did that and this is part of the Sunnah as well what's the ruling on wiping over a wig if a patient a cancer patient who went through chemotherapy and lost all of his or her hair and they're wearing a wig to hide such a defect if the wig is difficult to put back again which is not the case usually a wig it's very easy to take off and you can wipe over the head and put back uh on again but if there's difficulty in doing that then it is permissible to uh wipe over it what's the ruling on wiping over and this is the third category so the shoes socks and the likes the turbin the hijab of women and this is an issue of dispute some Scholars say that this is permissible like when there is fear of an illness or extreme uh uh temperatures cold weathers that would make it or introduce a lot of hardship over woman if you in Canada in the middle of winter and it's very difficult to take off this headgear that is uh keeping you warm for w theam says a woman is Exempted and she can wipe over uh that because um Sal may Allah be pleased with her used to do that as well number F uh number four uh uh surgical dressings and plastic casts if I have a broken arm in this case there's no possibility of getting the water within I can wipe over that because there is a Hadith where the Prophet sallallah alai wasallam indicated that a companion who died because of his wounds due to the wrong advice he was given by his friends when he performed he said they killed him it was sufficient for him to wipe over the dressing and no need for washing it however the plastic cast or the surgical dressings differ from the K or the socks in a number of aspects number one the way of wiping over the socks or the shoes is very simple it's symbolic so if this is my foot if I want to wipe over it with wet hands I just do this on the top from the toes to the chin I don't have to do this the whole area on and I don't do the underneath of the foot so it's just a symbolic one wipe from the toes upwards and the second um point or difference is the K is one day and night for a resident and three for a traveler while the cast or the surgical dressings are not time bound because they are done out of necessity so the first difference that the cast I have to wipe the whole area the second difference is that there's no time frame for it as long as I have the cast for a month then I can wipe over it number three unlike the I don't have to put the cast in the state of Purity because usually I put it on forced not out of will so it's not that I can go and perform W then ask them to put it no it is is it can be put in any state alhamdulillah and there are a number of issues that um Scholars talked about so one day and one night for a resident three days and three nights for a traveler what if there's a mixture between the two so if a traveler while traveling wiped over his socks so now he has three days and three nights but he arrived home on the second day so what should he do the scholars say now the period has been interrupted he's not anymore considered to be a um a traveler So It Begins the wiping of a resident that is one day and one night and likewise if if a resident wipes let's say it's time and I start to wipe and I took a flight and I traveled what should I do some Scholars say no okay because you started as a resident you should only have one day and one night and this is wrong the moment you travel then your status has changed and it is extended to 3 days and three nights and if a travel ER doubts whether he started wiping when he was a traveler or a resident he continues to wipe as a traveler and if a resident nullifies his woodoo then he performs woodoo and he starts to wipe as a traveler not as a resident he will continue as a res as as a traveler so not that because he uh um performed W and put his socks on when he was a resident he should wipe as a resident no now he traveled the status changed and Allah Knows [Music] Best for yeah"
