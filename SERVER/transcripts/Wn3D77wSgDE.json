  "title": "Was Attahiyat a conversation between Allah and Prophetï·º? & Similar messages - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother from Nigeria sent me a message and I think he sent it to all of his contacts on his mobile and it stated that do you know what is the origin of the tisha hood it is a beautiful conversation between Allah and the Prophet Allah salatu salam when the prophet said so so Allah replied so and so on and we all know that this is all baseless and has no foundation in Islam yet so many people because they have received it they considered to be authentic not only that there are those who unfortunately may fall into shirk by sending such messages and this happens when you get a message a very long message saying that the key key keeper or the key holder of the prophets chamber in the message of the Nabi in Medina sallallahu aleyhi we sellem his name is sheikh ahmed and he saw a vision where the prophet came to him and bla bla bla bla and at the end it shows a lot of nonsense but at the end it says do not hold it back send it to 10 or 15 or whatever number of your friends and you will receive great bounties and reward from allah in within 10 days a man sent it and he got a million dollars depending on the country some day say Bahraini dinar or dirham or whatever well some say Kuwaiti dinar sums depending on the country they manage to edit it and there was this person who ignored it and deleted it and he lost his daughter another one became bankrupt within one week and lost all of his money a third one died in a car accident all of this is shirk believing in it and acting upon it you know distributing it anticipating the financial reward or fearing that something harmful would happen to you doing this is chic and I remember someone brought me something like this about Sakina or Zeynep or one of these ladies who shed a drop of tear because of the illness of someone and she was cured etc and it came in a vision it and so on and he brought this to me in the message it stating to me that he knows that this is shirk and someone has been circulating it around the neighborhood putting it in over cars and under the houses and he knows that this is blatant shirk so I read it and I said son Allah and he said subhanAllah look what how people have gone down to what level so I was agreeing with him and I gave him the paper I said ok tear it or burn it and the guy gave it back to me said sure you do that and I was shocked now you were confessing that this is shirk and this is superstitions and that you could not agree more and now you're afraid he said well better safe than sorry and this is definitely the wrong way of doing it so"
