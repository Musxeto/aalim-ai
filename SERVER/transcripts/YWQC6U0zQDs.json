  "transcript": "the title of the lecture is time and time is quite essential and important in a muslim's life not only in the life of Muslims but it's also valued in the life of non-muslims as as well Allah Asel has sworn in the Quran by time he swore by he swore by which is the Early times of the morning till just before the noon he swore by the day and night and Allah devoted a whole chapter by the name of Al as you've heard in the second and as the interpreters say it is time so Allah Asel is indicating to us is illustrating to us the importance of time by swearing with time or by time because for us we are not allowed to swear with anything except Allah's names and attributes as for Allah subhana wa ta'ala he may swear with any of his creations and the majority of not people not Muslims the majority of humanity they are heedless of the importance of time and this is one of the things that they're heedless of they neglect the importance of time and that is why Allah says in the Quran they know only outside appearance of the life of the world and they are heedless of the Hereafter if you go go into your own database your personal knowledge what do you know of you find that the most things that you know of do not get you closer to Allah you may be knowledgeable in medicine engineering you may be knowledgeable in finance you may be knowledgeable in business but when it comes to the things that draw you closer to Allah Asel you would find that the majority of people are are heedless of the Hereafter they know everything of this dun and you can ask any of your friends young friends do you know the names of pop stars do you know the names of musicians singers actresses actors immediately you would find people relating to you but if you ask them about the 10 Heavenly bound of the companions may Allah be pleased with them who the prophet told us that they are in Jenna they'll give you four maximum five names if you ask them about the attributes of Allah the names of Allah they will give you maximum 5 10 20 what about the rest they don't have this knowledge and therefore when you go to the Hadith of the Prophet which is in theah a beautiful Hadith but rarely you'll find people contempla and pondering upon it what does the prophet say he says there are two blessings which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out what are these two blessings the prophet says good health and free time what is the word what is the meaning of in Arabic it is originated it is stemmed from the word we don't know the word in Arabic how do you want us to know it in English what is the meaning of there is there a Surah by this name or relating to it what is the meaning of Rin Rin is when you lose in a bargain so if I go to the market and I say to the man how much is this as in so many hotels he says 8 real said okay here is 8 real this is I gave it more than it's worth and if I sell it someone tells me how much is your watch worth and I say 10 R he said I'll take it and I sell it this is known as so the prophet is telling us there are two blessings of Allah that we are losing when we deal with them and that is health and free time and look at the prime of of your youth when you were young when you were in your 20s in your 30s Mah there are people who are less than their 20s and 30s so they have enough time inshallah they'll catch up but for us old men when we look at our youth when we were 20s and 30s we've lost all of our youth in rubbish in nothing and this is what we regret most nowadays and therefore if you look at what people are doing with their time you'll be amazed people are actually throwing their time away aren't they not only that people are killing time and what is the crime of time what did time do to you you find people wasting their time doing nothing or playing Foolish Games and spending 8 hours 10 hours of their day what are you doing he says I'm killing time why what did time du to you to kill don't you know that this time you will be questioned about on the day of judgment the prophet saysat the son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his Lord on the day of Resurrection until he's been questioned about five things so prepare an answer the prophet Alam he never tells a lie and this is an authentic Hadith you will not be dismissed from in front of your lord until you asked five questions so now answer the questions because you're going to be asked one his life and how he spent it you're 50 years old 60 70 80 how well did you utilize your life where was it and Subhan Allah my I'm I'm 50 huh when I look at my 50 years of age as if it's was an afternoon as if it was an hour or less than an hour it's gone and and the remaining by Allah is far less yeah no how long will you live another 20 another 50 years no so this is question one his life and how he spent it okay not only that to be more specific his Youth and how he used it what did you use your strength in in fighting with people in committing adultery in doing things that displeases Allah and on the contrary you don't you did not spray you did not pray with the JAMA you did not fast the mandatory pray these are are the things that your youth should be utilized in Allah would ask you about that either his wealth and how he earned it and how he disposed of it Subhan Allah a lot of us have money little or a lot depending on your income a lot of us don't care if their income is Haram or not the most important thing is to see the digits in the bank account increasing so if it's from Haram Allah will ask you you will say alhamdulillah my income is completely Halal good for you Allah will ask you where did you spend it how did you dispose of it she the earning is halal but spending it is Kam no this is not good for you because you're going to to be questioned about and then the prophet tells usat and how he acted upon what he know uh the knowledge that is how he acted upon the knowledge that he has had so even the knowledge the the acquired knowledge Allah would ask you upon because we all know a lot of the Muslims when you tell them what you're doing is Haram said I know the prophet said so and so and so you're doing it said yeah but pray for me so this knowledge Allah would hold you accountable on the day of judgment and therefore if we valued time if we knew that we will be questioned on the day of judgment about these things wall we will be very protective and we will preserve everything we can to stay away from this question Allah Asel says in the Quran did you think that we had created you in play without any purpose and that you would not be brought back to us that would have been the best thing in our lives if there was no Resurrection no accountability alhamdulillah if it's just dying life would have been a good life but the problem is after dying there is the Day of Reckoning the day of judgment judement the day of accountability of every single thing that you had done now the believer alhamdulillah will be called on the day of judgment to enter Paradise may Allah make me and you among those who are called to enter Paradise but the disbelievers will regret every single moment once they die they will regret in their graves they will regret on the day of resurrection and they would say they would even before they di give me a chance so that I may do something good they will regret it when they are displayed in front of Allah Asel they will regret it while they are in hell where they shout and ask for another chance that is why this dun this life we're living in is a place for us to work and strive but on the day on the here after on the day of judgment there is no working there is no forms of mandatory obligatory prayers or fasting it is all Paradise because this is your final destination and that is why we must suffer in this duny because you as the prophet said to one of his companions he held him by the shoulders and if I recall correctly it is Abdullah Omar and he [Music] said be in this as a stranger or a passer by what is the meaning of a stranger someone who's not from the country now a lot of the Muslims are expatriates they come here to work if I see one of the brothers coming from India from Egypt from uh uh uh anywhere to work and I see him buying the latest models of cars and the fanciest watches and the best of clothes and he eats in the most expensive restaurants and when he goes to Mak Medina he stays in or in Hilton what are you doing said I'm enjoying my life what do we say to this brother you have something wrong you an expatriate you don't come to this country to settle down and buy a big Villa and fancy cars you're working here for 5 years 10 years 20 years inshallah 30 years eventually you have to go back home so Muslims human beings are the same scenario in this life we are here for for a transitional period afterwards we're going to our final destination inshallah and it will be Jenna so so if you don't look at this dya and treat it likewise then you have a problem and the the your Capital your investment if you have an investment if you have a company what's your Capital Money what's your Capital real estate what's your Capital gold you have to have a capital type our investment on this life what is our Capital huh good deeds Good Deeds how can I do the Good Deeds I what is the title of this uh lecture for reminding me your capital is time this is what you're investing it your age your life is your time because I can have a transaction business 10,000 real and he loses it what would I say alhamdulillah I'll work hard collect another 10,000 R but if today is gone and I sleep and I wake up tomorrow can I retrieve it can I call it back I'm sorry well yesterday I didn't do anything okay I'll I'll do it again no it's gone and that is why your Capital your most essential and most important asset is time alas says oh son of Adam you are a number of days every time a day passes by some of you is gone and this is reality at the at the at the side of Allah my age is known and when did the countdown begin your countdown when did it begin since youorn since the day you were born the day you were born the clock is ticking every day is minus one day minus one year minus one uh uh uh this or that and if you look at the way that the prophet used to utilize his timeat even this the the the slightest of seconds he used to utilize the companions say when the prophet used to sit with usat we used to count Subhan subh or Subhan they used to count in a gathering 70 times and then they move to Salah move somewhere else and then they count again and again and again so even when he's sitting idle he is utilizing time I remember a cousin of mine may Allah have mercy in his soul he passed away when I was young I used to whistle a lot you know before practicing one used to hear music music here and there so we used to whistle it it's it's it's nice and my cousin used to always tell me listen Whistle the song for 5 minutes but if you say Subhan Allah for 5 minutes what do you think would be better and more feasible for you at the side of Allah and it always REM remained in the back of my my head until today huh when I went to whistle I remember what he said and said Subhan Allah Subhan Allah Subhan Allah he's in his grave and the credit is going to him every time I praise Allah instead of whistling so the prophet used to utilize his time the companions used to know how to divide their time abuur may Allah be pleased with him one of the greatest companions who narrated The Hadith he used to divide the Knight into three divisions oneir to study the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam and that is why he's the most among all companions in the number of hadiths he narrated the second third he used to sleep and the third third of the night he used to pray night prayer utilizing the time to get the balance it was also reported that he used to do the same do you know who's he the compiler of J or one of the great comp compan Scholars of Islam he was once once with his companions and he said do you have this Zelf to write the T of the Quran so they said how many pages he said 30,000 said huh 30,000 we will die before finishing it so he wrote it in 3,000 only the one we have and then he said do you have the power and energy to write the history of the Kings and the Nations since Adam peace be upon him he said how many pages he said 30,000 he said no come on we will die and he said Subhan Allah people don't have this power and energy to do things to to utilize their time during his 40 years that is if you deduct the age of childhood and the times of sleeping and the times of eating they calculated that he worked for 40 years every single day he used to write 40 pages he used to compile not transcribe he used to compile from his head when did he have time to read when did he have time to pray when did he have time to go to the gym when did he have time to his uh uh uh wives and daughters and and Sons and their time was blessed by Allah and the majority of us our time is wasted so many times you tell people fear Allah you have to repent you have to stop this sin you have to do this some of the brothers live close by to mecah and Medina and they don't even know how to reach there when was the last time you made an umra when was the last time you offered Haj when was the last time you prayed in Haram I know a brother who smokes may Allah forgive him and I spoke to him and this was a while ago when are you going to quit smoking he said Allah this Ramadan Ramadan was 2 months ago this was 15 years ago and every time I meet the brother and I say Ramadan did not come inshallah in Hajj the sisters when are you going toward the hijab in Hajj and Hajj 1432 1433 1440 is coming and going and no nothing is changing unfortunately now time how do we you where do you spend your time a lot of the youth not only the youth even the the grown-ups and and and and the elders and those who are about to die like me they spend their time in things that do not bring them value this is the problem if you told me that I'm spending my time in the workshop and I'm learning carpentry I'm want to learn how to make tables good for you if you tell me I'm spending my time under my car to fix it and to learn mechanics good for you but a lot of the Muslims waste their time in nonsense and you ask yourself don't look beside you to the next to you ask yourself when was it the last time you missed fjer prayer I asked a brother uh M Who's involved in dawa in UK he was with me in one of my trips and I said to him when was the last time you missed F prayer he said asked me when was the last time I prayed F and I said the guy's beard is like this this long and I said how what do you say he said I spend my time until 1 or 2:00 a.m. making banners and invitations and connecting masjids and Islamic centers to arrange for Islamic Gatherings and I sleep over faer all what he's doing is is in vain the most important thing in life is f prayer and if you don't pray F prayer then you have a very big question mark on top of your head is he a hypocrite or not is he maaf or not so this is something that you should fear of do you waste your time in PlayStation 3 uh uh what do you call them uh Gbox game box Xbox I I have to prostrate to prostrations for so I forget these I don't know them n Nintendos Xbox we we ah do you have this in your this is what you spend your time in do you spend your time watching movies soap operas friends 24 25th whatever numbers they have what do you spend your time in do you spend your time surfing the net W uh couple of weeks a ago I heard about a girl in high school that spends 19 hours on the net yeah 5 hours only of sleeping and eating and whatever 19 hours what do you do what do people do surfing the net reading will getting information from Wikipedia or watching or chatting or Facebook or face hell or face whatever you want to face what what do they do this is a big problem some people their ambition is in hunting or fishing and this is also a waste of time the prophet saidat whoever follows a prey will become heedless those who go for three days four days hunting some people like to off-road they go off-roading they have 4x4 they go to the desert and play what benefit does this bring to you others spend their time doing uh uh uh uh or watching if they're doing it's okay watching UFC or MMA mix martial arts um on TV and Jiu-Jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu whatever they spend all their time they love to see blood wrestling they watch wrestling I did it here I think or did it somewhere in one of my lectures I keep on forgetting I did this and everybody started laughing this and I said this is a problem this is something a brother did to me in the gym I was talking to him youngest 17 years old and he said yeah she don't you know this wrestler said no oh he fought with this wrestler said okay he said do you don't know this I don't know this Allah forgive me I don't know it and everybody knows it so you're spending your time in something that draws you closer to Allah watching wrestling what does it add to you all what it adds to you that it will make you afraid of Americans because Americans are even if it's a you know a and he's a wrestler if you see him in the street you'll start shaking why because he's American he will do this jump to you or that and he will disable you the majority of us do not understand the meaning of worshiping Allah we do not have a Target we do not have an objective in life why do you live well I until I die I don't have a reason why do you work so I can have money why do you need money so I can buy a car so I can have a house so I can get married so I can buy Xbox or PlayStation 3 so all of this as if we are living in this life forever but this is not the case we have to have the balance one would say do you mean to utilize the time I have to sit in the Masjid at the end of the Masjid and have prayer bees uh uh 1,000 of them and say subh Allah Allah Allah Allah I I had a car before I sold it last year it's a 1994 GMC you know the old gems cars and I used to say that this car is the car of the because it always REM remembers Allah when you turn it on this is how it sounds so do you want us to be like this GMC sit out by at the back of the Masid and say Allah Allah no this is not part of the Islam so what do you want us to do I want you to become a Muslim do whatever you do for Allah so even if you play football you play football for for Allah how would I play football for Allah I'll tell you how you have to have Recreation you have to have your free time so that when you go to you're fresh also you can go in playing football if you're playing with other boys you when someone of your friends say pass me the ball so when he passes the ball you say when you're running after your opponent to get the ball you say fear Allah give me the ball so you remember Allah you can do a lot of things you can remember Allah in everything but even playing football if you have a good intention Allah will reward you if you drink water if you drink tea after is night time with the intention that I would have the power to pray night prayer you're drinking the tea is a form of I feeding your wife putting the morsel in your wife's mouth this is she will bite my fingers off it's okay yeah she's not a aark or feed her this is Sunnah part of the Sunnah so the most important thing is that you know how to utilize your time either by doing good things or by doing forms of and the happiest person on Earth are those who utilize their time and the issue is how do we utilize your time I see a lot of the brothers working in business in markets in uh uh uh uh activities in Commerce and trade they say we don't have time there is no blessing in our time but I see others that Subhan Allah can do 10 things on a day with less resource than the other one why it is because Allah blessed their time does Allah bless the time yes the prophet tells usam if you like Allah to prolong your life span and to increase your income connect to the next of kin connect to your kinship you want Allah to prolong your life how is Allah going to prolong my life two interpretations one either when the angel wrote your age before you were born he wrote only the age that was written in the lower head heaven but the actual age on the seventh heaven in the preserved tablet he did not write it because he did not know it so it it was written this individual will live for 60 years and during these 60 years this man used to always visit his uncles his cousins he checks on them his aunts his brothers his uh loved ones always checking on them Allah Asel decrees that the 60 years to be changed and to be added five or 10 more years this is one interpretation the other interpretation is Allah would bless your 60 years that you will do in them much much more than other people who lived for 60 years and this is obvious I know Brothers I know sh who give a class after fa in the uh midday in afternoon they take off after ass after and after every single day crazy and at the same time his wiv not one his wives are happy he sits with them he visits them his children have a quality time to spend with him and he has time to go in the weekend to do some sports or to any off-roading or camping or whatever and he travels for his lectures where did he get this time the day is only 24 hours it's the blessing from Allah I know sisters that are married serving their husband serving their children but they pray night prayer and they fast a day and a skip a day or first Mondays and Thursdays and they work on websites and they work on Facebook and they send emails every single day about beneficial things to tens of thousands of people people from their homes now look at their reward at the side of Allah asael and look at ours what have we done in our life what have we done in our time if you go to the jungles of Africa you will find missionaries you will find 18 and 20 years a of age Christians what are they doing they are calling the people to their falsehood to the corrupt religion of Christianity but they have no problem do they take money for it no for the sake of their lord yeah don't go to the jungles of Africa stay here stay in jida stay in Saudi Arabia what will you do to get closer to Allah when was the last time you entered a Masjid the bathrooms of the Masjid and you were disgusted by the smell and the shape and the cleanliness of that Masjid when was the last time every time I don't recall entering Masjid in J that is clean it's always filthy it's always dirty when was the last time you thought of cleaning it why for the sake of Allah when was the last time you thought that well this afternoon I will clean the Masid I will hover it if you are someone who's expert in English or if you're an engineer and you're good in mathematics when was the last time you thought M next week is exams week right next week I think it's exams week when was the last time you thought okay for the Masjid Whoever has problems with English I will teach from to bring me your books bring me your subjects that you cannot understand those who do not like mathematics I will sit with them from to for for the sake of of who for the sake of Allah this these types of works for the community why don't we do it we can get closer to Allah by so many things yeah imagine I'm going give you this so I can take your reward inshallah if you say Subhan Allah 100 times Allah will forgive all of your sins so do it from here till you reach your car it's enough it takes 3 minutes maybe in four minutes Subhan allaham Subhan allaham 100 times Allah will forgive your sins and now well this is something of a dispute among Scholars is the major sins included or only the minor sins and the most authentic opinion is that only minor sins major sins need to have repentance without repentance it is not forgiven so if you have repentance and you say Subhan allahham Allah will forgive major and minor sins the prophet told us if you among the companions who among you would like to have two big beautiful camels without any trouble without any hardship he just goes out for 5 minutes and he comes back with two big huge beautiful camels and the companion said W everyone wants this camels is the most expensive and the most valued uh uh commodity so the prophet said by Allah if you come to the Masid and learn or teach two ayats of the Quran it is better for you than two camels and if you do three ayas it is three camels if you do five ayas it is five camels and a lot a lot of the Muslims nowadays if you tell them do you know ayat uh yeah I can read it but by memory no fear Allah I did this yeah survey about 17 years ago approximately in my school high school I used to teach and I did it over 300 children children meaning from 17 to 19 they in High School 17 to 19 years of age and I said who knows ay in every class of 35 I get four or five people raising their hands and when they recite it they make mistakes I ask who knows Surah Al mul what is Surah Al Mulk how many ayas are there 30 30 and the prophet told us that whoever memorizes it and recites it every night Allah will save him and protect him from the punishment in the grave so you die you go in your grave alhamdulillah no punishment and I ask my students who among you memorizes it by heart 30 ayats sorry no C do so we have a problem time is extremely important and it is your most valuable asset preserve it try to utilize it and try to analyze what did I spend my day in and am I getting closer every single day that goes by am I getting closer to Allah or am I getting further Muhammad"
