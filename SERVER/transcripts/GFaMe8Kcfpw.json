  "title": "Can I pray taraweeh in 2 different Masjids & still get reward of the entire night? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it okay to pray taraweeh in two different messages suppose I pray the first ten raka in one Masjid then the next then in another Masjid first of all Thalia what is the ruling on praying taraweeh is it mandatory the answer is no therefore if you skip it altogether you can't say is it permissible or is it okay you're not sinful and if you pray half of it and skip the other half you're not sinful if you pray half of it in one message it and the other half in another message it you are not sinful the sky is the limit but the problem is that will you be rewarded fully or partially why are we asking such a question because the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam in an authentic hadith he who prays with the imam that is taraweeh prayer until he finishes Allah would reward him as if he had prayed the whole night so this means that if I managed to pray the eleven bracha's or the twenty-three Rakas with the imam one single imam in one masjid until he offers taraweeh then Allah would reward me as if I prayed from Asia itself assure and that's a lot but if I divided if I pray ten rakahs here and thirteen rak'ahs there I will not get the same reward as mentioned in the hadith"
