  "transcript": "foreign hadith 162 in the chapter that deals with funeral rites yes brother um said we were forbidden from following the funerals but it was not insisted upon us now in this hadith be pleased with her again she is telling us that we were forbidden from following the funerals but it was not insisted upon us now scholars differed on the ruling women following funerals and they also differed in women visiting graves what would be most forbidden to follow a funeral or to go into a graveyard and visit a grave to follow the funeral to follow a funeral why because there is all meals are there and it cannot be a mixture there are more males there but the amount of grief when women enter a graveyard is far greater it is also great when they follow a funeral but they have just washed it they have shrouded it they gave their farewells to the deceased they're following it once they enter the graveyards then it is chaos and that is why the prophet salallahu salaam said may allah curse those who often visit the graveyards among the women may allah curse them so scholars differed now those who allowed women to follow a funeral took this hadith as their evidence those who forbade women from following funerals took this hadith as their evidence the same hadith how those who said it's haram they cannot follow funerals they say listen don't you know arabic um we were forbidden from following funerals what does that mean she didn't say we were told not to she didn't say it was highly recommended that we do not follow funerals she said we were forbidden not to and those who said no it is permissible for a woman to follow a funeral said okay but read what's afterwards she says but it was not insisted upon us meaning that we were forbidden but it was not so strong in don't go i said do not go so this means that it is permissible scholars said no no no the command of the prophet was the first which is it's forbidden it was not insisted upon us that was the understanding of um but that does not mean that this understanding is correct because we're instructed to follow um the prophet we instructed to follow the prophet and the prophet forbade women from following the funeral and that is why this is the most authentic opinion you know women you know how emotional they are what would a woman do if she is following her father's funeral she would keep on shouting and screaming and maybe tearing her hair as a lot of women do unconsciously they do acts that are completely forbidden that the prophet is said that whoever do these things is not considered to be part of me what is these things slapping the faces i don't know do you have it here i've seen it sometimes in the news when there are floods or tsunamis you find people weeping and they are slapping their faces not only women also men it's a sign of grief and the prophet says he is not from me and tearing the clothes and this also happens a lot when people are in grief and all of these are signs of jahiliyyah and the prophet said that who does such things are not from me and it is extremely important that you write your will before you die what to write sheikh i don't have money and i don't have any property so what to write in the will well you have to write in the will a piece of advice to your family such as that you should fear allah you should not wail on me crying is natural it's halal but wailing what's the meaning of wailing oh my husband you are the only one who used to support me who will support me after your death i am dying i'm going to die i'm going to suffer things will happen bad things would what to do after you have gone you were the only supporter you were and all of this is forbidden entirely not only that you should write in the well as well that if you have lent someone money all of us may have lent someone money and nobody knows about it he's my friend i gave him money well you should write in the well that i gave my friend so and so because this is part of the inheritance and if you borrowed something some money from someone also you should write this down so that your family would pay those people back otherwise allah azzawajal would hold your questionable in your graves the prophet said salatu salam came to me and told me when the prophet was saying he said the martyr all of his sins are forgiven and then jibril came to him and told him all of his sins are forgiven except that so how many people now buy cars in installments buy houses in installments how many people borrow money from this man or that or borrow money to finish their school all of this will not be forgiven watch out borrowing is a serious thing in islam and you should write in your will forbidding them from doing any innovation for example i spoke to my mother and to my siblings telling them that if i die i do not want any of the innovative things or procedures that we do in our country in my country in saudi arabia especially in the western region when a person dies they for three days between maghrib and isha they opened the house for guests to come and pay their condolences not only that they block the roads and they hang lights on the streets in front of the house so they do not allow people to pass by with the cars and they set up like 100 or 200 chairs and people come and sit under the light in these chairs and they usually have someone to reset the quran they pay him money to recite the quran or they have a tape recorder and there are people who make coffee and tea and they give those who are coming to pay their respects and usually they sit and they chit-chat for five ten minutes and they leave so you find them while waiting and those the relatives are in one row at front at the father and the brothers and so on the relatives they all sit on one row so they wait the people who come to pay their respects and they chat now they are in a place of grief and sorrow so did you see what uh etihad club did yesterday well uh it's a disgrace and the guy says what are you going to do tonight oh let's go to somewhere and you know play cards and spend the night and oh did you see this or that did you hear what happened and the quran is being decided and afterwards they stand up and they go the quran stops they go and say may allah reward you in your loss and and your grief and they leave this is one of the biggest biddas around the companion of the prophet said that the companions used to consider gathering for condolences and preparing the food as wailing they used to consider this a form of wailing and this is an authentic hadith what the people do these three days after resha prayer everything everybody goes they say don't go don't go why well they bring two or three sheep with rice and people eat from it every night and this is exactly what the companion warned from this is wailing yet people do it so i wrote in my will or i told my siblings and my mother if i were to die nothing of this would happen the people my family would stay in their house if someone wants to come they come into the house no coffee no tea for hospitality and not between magrib and aisha anytime of the day or the night they pay their condolences and leave no dinners nothing the prophet said that israel to his companions make food for al-jaffar when jaffar was martyred in motta his cousin he instructed his companions to make food for them not for the guests why he justified this by saying because now they're preoccupied where this calamity so they will not have time to cook food for themselves you prepare food and give it to them and never ever the relatives and the friends and people fly over from different cities to pay their respects and give their condolences never ever it was reported that they gathered and do what these people do therefore following the funeral for a women is not permissible because we follow the instruction of the prophet salam and this is clear inshallah and visiting the grave is not permissible as well for women although it's an issue of dispute sheikh nassar dean albany says it's permissible for women to visit the graves chairman say it is completely prohibited and this is what the majority of our scholars say because the disadvantages far exceed the advantages what women do not because their deficiency but because of their emotional character and we have to care for women's emotions and that is why they should not go and visit graveyards we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll assalamu alaykum and welcome back the last hadith with us today well actually it is not the last hadith but it's in regard of the funeral rites and afterwards we begin inshallah with the funeral prayer so this last hadith is hadith number 162 and the brother up there will read it for us reported allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi sallam as saying make haste at a funeral if the dead person was good it is a good state to which you are sending him on but if he was otherwise it is an evil of which you are reading yourselves in this hadith the prophet salallahu salaam is telling us how to carry the funeral and carrying the funeral also means that we have to prepare the funeral as quick as possible but this usually refers to carrying it however one may ask what's the ruling on delaying the washing of the deceased until his family arrive scholars say that if it's a short time this is okay half a day maybe maybe a day okay maybe but if it's more than that no even if it's his son even if it's his father you have to hasten with preparation of the funeral why because the body will decay the body will start to decompose and it would start to smell and change and that is why something i did not mention when washing the funeral in warm areas some scholars say that it is advisable to put a heavy thing on the stomach of the deceased so that it would not start to grow because of the gases and of all of these things but sheikh rahman says that even if you put whatever you put it has to be extremely heavy with might cave in so the best thing nowadays is only to turn on the air conditions or as in some hospitals they put them in the coolers so it is highly advisable to quickly get it over with the funeral and not to postpone it so long having said that once you wash and shroud and offer the prayer how do i carry it in some countries muslim countries they walk bit by bit very short strides and as if they themselves are dying they do it very very slow in where i come from usually they shout they say meaning proclaim and announce the oneness of allah so when they hear this they say the and all of this is innovation one should not follow the funeral with shouting or raising the voices all of this is haram it should not be followed or preceded by fire even to put perfume or incense this is also not permissible and some people run literally while carrying it and they run this is not permissible because there is a possibility that you will trip and make the deceased fall on the ground so what to do the thing is the proper thing is to walk but to walk in a fast pace why this is the justification if you're carrying your brother or your father who's dead and you know that inshallah he's going to paradise would you take him slowly if he was awake what would he say come on what are you postponing me for what are you delaying me for so as long as he's a righteous person you try your best to make it quick so that you would give him this gift he is awaiting and if he's an evil person and if he's a person with bad deeds then you would like to relieve yourself from carrying this thing on your shoulder and throw him in his hole so that he would go to the punishment he deserves so both ways you would like to make it as quick as possible can we follow the funerals riding cars yes you can but the scholars say that the cars have to be in front not in the back why some schools of thought say that those who ride should be at the back says that this is not the right thing to do because if you're carrying the funeral and there are cars behind you you're afraid all the time that they're gonna run me over so you'll not be walking nicely the best thing for them is to walk in front of you this would mean that they would open the road for you and you would be able to walk in comfort is it for those who walk behind the funeral they should walk behind it or beside it or in front of it all is permissible so if you walk behind it or in front of it or on the side this is permissible and so many times we walk in front of it so that we would take a good position at the grave before they bury the deceased what else one would ask should we say as the people say what do you believe or what do you think of the man who's dead and people say we believe that he's a righteous person he's a practicing muslim is this part of the sunnah no it is not raising the voice and doing this is not considered to be part of the sunnah and once he's buried and we put well we did not discuss the type of graves there is the light and there is the there are two types of graves in islam which is an l-type so you actually dig the grave and then you make an opening and then the grave goes on so you put the deceased in the opening and you put bricks or you put stones and then you put the soil back again and why is this so that this would be more protected from animals finding the smell or trying to dig it out the second type and by the way this is the way that the prophet was buried in lahad the second type is the shock which goes completely down the burial is taking place and then we put on top of him these stones or these big plates and we bury him as stated before how do we put the seeds in the grave we put him head first from the feet of the grave so if this is the qibla this is the feet of the grave and this is the head of the grave we put him head down and then lying uh him on his right hand side facing the qibla do we reveal his face when we put him in the grave no we only untie the knot that is it but the face the whole body is covered after we bury him the sunnah is that each one throws three handful of soil in the grave after burial we face the qibla we raise our hands if we wish and we seek allah's forgiveness for him and that allah makes him steadfast when he's asked because the prophet said is forgiveness for your brother and ask allah to grant him steadfast because now he's being interrogated he's being asked and we know who will interrogate him the two angels who would come and make him sit in the grave and ask him who is your lord what is your religion and who is your messenger what did you do how did you respond to him yani i believe that this is what is needed to be known next time we meet inshallah we will talk about the funeral of prayer and how the imam stands from the body do we have any questions is it allowed to do postmortem since we're not allowed to break the bones and stuff like that postpartum is it allowed to have a body cut off after death they're doing autopsy or something like that if there is a true and real need for that yes for example if there is a doubt that he might have been poisoned or killed and we need to investigate yes but in normal cases no if a person dies naturally one would say yes he died naturally but i want to know was it because of heart attack or high cholesterol levels or high blood pressure no this is not permissible to know the cause of death not due to a legitimate reason just for the sake of it this is completely prohibited not even to cut a short or small wound in him however some countries so they tell me it is mandatory to do this for everyone whether he dies peacefully or in an accident or in a crime they do this for everyone unfortunately if you cannot stop them and this is by law they not may allah forgive us but if no you have the choice you must stop all proceedings and say nope no one touches my deceased or the dead person that is related to me i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time allah"
