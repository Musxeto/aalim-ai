  "transcript": "what are the known wisdoms behind male circumcision cleanliness is well known what about reducing sexual desire is there any known relation to my knowledge no there isn't any known relation to sexual desire for men for women as you know that circumcision is not mandatory it is recommended but it is not mandatory and the scholars say that circumcision for women is beneficial for some uh uh women because it reduces their sexual uh desire and exceeding the limit in circumcision this would make her desire zero which is very bad and the prophet Alam forbade from that so what uh should be circumcised is a very small bit of it and not uh a lot as for men I do not know any um anyone that said that it reduces the sexual desire for men I don't think that this is the case but it is part of Nature and that is why uh um the prophet Alam uh obligated it it is mandatory for men to C to be circumcised and that is what prophet ibraim did and the narration say that he did that when he was 80 years of age and of course cleanliness Purity and uh also I posted in my Facebook about a couple of months ago that I think in Zimbabwe the president and the Parliament are encouraging people after a study published by the United Nations stating that circum circumcised people are less to be uh inflicted with AIDS so now it there is a campaign in the uh Parliament everyone members of the parliament are uh undergoing circumcision in this old age of theirs though they're not Muslim simply because the study uh uh says that being circumcised protects greatly from uh catching a HIV uh positive or or the AIDS alhamdulillah Al no"
