  "title": "Ruling on Zakat on gold of all the females in the house - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his third question was regarding the gold that they use not him of course because the gold is haram for men men are not allowed to wear gold they are not allowed to keep golden pens or watches or whatever they use gold is haram for men to use but his daughters his wife they have gold and he said that the family has and this is wrong each individual in the family has his own possession you cannot say that well my family has half a kilo of gold because I have like daughters and wives and auntie's living with me so we collect the whole gold and give zakat no this is not correct your wife has her own possession so if you gave her as a gift if you gave her as a maja if her parents gave her as a wedding gift she at the end of the year has to calculate how much money she has in the sense that if she has over or 85 grams or over then she has to pay zakat every year after the first year so by saying 85 grams of gold we are talking about a pure gold 24 karat gold so if it's 16 carat or 18 karat she has to go to the jeweler shop and he would the Goldsmith would tell her that this 100 grams of 16 carat is equivalent to maybe 70 maybe 80 grams of pure gold and then this means that there is no zakah so we have to calculate your wives gold individually if it's 85 grams of pure gold or more she has to pay 2.5% then we go to each one of your daughters so this one fatima for example has 17 grams of gold there's no saccade Aisha has 80 grams of gold there is no zakat and your wife may be having 80 grams of gold that is no zakat it is wrong to collect all of this and that we have to give the cat 2.5% not only that the issue of wearing the gold or intending to sell it does not change the verdict the most authentic opinion of scholars is that if a person has gold in his possession whether she is wearing it or she is lending it or she is saving it she has to pay 2.5% every single year for it"
