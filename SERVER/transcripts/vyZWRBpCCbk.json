  "transcript": "uh she so suppose a woman she takes she blindf follows you in Islamic verdicts and she um she puts uh nutmeg in uh you know her um dish without knowing it and then afterwards she comes to find out uh does she throw this dish away or does she uh again this issue has has been ongoing the issue of not Meg and whether it's intoxicant or not is an issue of dispute among Scholars they all agree that it is an intoxicant but they differ whether using a very small portion of it is permissible or not and I bet though betting is Haram but this is a figure of speech don't quote me those who slunder me and speak about uh me drinking alcohol-free beer which was like 15 years ago before I became diabetic and I stopped and they say the Sheikh drinks beer he gets uh wasted he does this he does that and they make videos out of it I I so shocked by the amount of haters that I have it's all good for business I'm getting lots of good deeds from them alhamdulillah keep up the good work you're not going to get under my skin I'm not going to be affected by that because I'm not saying to please you or others I'm I'm saying what I'm saying to to please Allah this is what I believe so these people who keep on slandering me and and and and saying bad things and awful things about me they themselves consume not make without any problem and Subhan Allah how they weigh with two different scales anyhow my inclination is that it's not permissible though here in Saudi Arabia and a lot of the uh um standing committees of IFA say that if it's a NE negligible amount it's permissible and this is why it is sold within food and is permitted here in Saudi Arabia and this is a respected opinion so if you tend to follow this especially in times of necessity when you've already cooked food and you don't want to throw it in the garbage and it's very negligible and it's does not intoxicate you you may follow that opinion uh uh though you're blindly following me and I don't know why would anybody blindly follow me you should follow great Scholars of Islam rather than follow what I say I'm just a teacher who conveys to you what the great Scholars of Islam had said so I hope this answers your question and Allah Knows Best"
