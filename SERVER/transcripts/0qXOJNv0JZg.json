  "title": "Hanafi masjids near me pray Friday prayer & Dhuhr at Asr time, should I pray home? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "check in my locality the door and Juma prayer in all of the hanasti masts started the assert time instead of the time and I read in Islam QA that the majority opinion is Juma ends with the start of a certain time so can I leave jumu and pray to her at home until I find a mosque where it's played on time and what is the ruling on someone's prayer who still prays Juma even though knowing that Juma starts at Usher time first of all those who pray according to the hanafi madhub if they don't know any better and they are blind followers of their school of thought and of their Scholars there is no sin on them because they are laymen and they can't figure out which is right from wrong those who are a bit learned and they have the evidences in front of them and the hadiths of the Prophet Allah stating that the time of the ends when the time of azer begins and this is when the shade of an erected object is equal in length to the erected object and this is the opinion of the vast majority of schools of thought so the chafee the Maliki and the hembeli school of thought agree on this because Hadith is crystal clear so if you have a little bit of knowledge you should know that I cannot pray at the time of Assad intentionally and willingly and I have to pray at the allocated time providing that this hanafi Masjid prays actually when the Asar time begins he prays when the asatan begins therefore if you're certain that they pray jumwa at the actual time of Asar you cannot pray with them you have to leave them and pray on your own and definitely if you look around with the grace of Allah even in Bangladesh you will find that there are masjids that follow the authentic opinions of the schools of thought and the Sunnah whether it's Hadith or other Masjid Allah Knows Best Muhammad"
