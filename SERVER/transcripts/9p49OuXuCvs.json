  "transcript": "it is one of the 72 sects that the prophet hassam warned us from dividing into they follow the hawari but they are a softer copy of the hardcore and this what called imam ibn tamiya may allah have mercy and a soul to describe them as being the gay part of the khawarij they're so gay compared to the khawariju gives the fear and they do have bloodshed they are close in the attributes of allah azzawajal to them are tesla so they deny a lot of allah's attributes they have their own misinterpretation when it comes to the scale and to the surat and the things related to uh yom qiyama the day of judgment they also believe that those who commit major sins are kafir like the hawari but they it is permissible to marry them so they believe who are not from the ibadiyas like us they can marry from us and they can inherit from us but we are we will be in hell fire forever and they have so many weird things they believe that the quran is created and it's not one of allah's attributes they believe that it is impossible to see allah in paradise so it's a deviant cult and a lot of the scholars say that you must not pray behind them as the prayer would not be accepted allah knows best"
