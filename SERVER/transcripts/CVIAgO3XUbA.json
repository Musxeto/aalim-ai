  "transcript": "Yes sir. Thank you very much sir. Um I have a very huge problem because it happens all the time like my religion to to me now it's I have a whisperings that makes me feel as if it is a competition like I notice each times a brother or a sister do something rewardable or praiseable the whisperings we give will not give me the feelings of or it's going to give me the the the whisperings of jealousy, hatred towards the their hers and it's really really disturbing me. I'm trying to suppress these whisperings but I feel ashamed because it happens all the time and is my religious towards me now is not is not like a competition towards others and not like a gift from Allah subhana wa ta'ala sir. This is a curse from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. When a person is affected by it, this means that Allah is angry with them and they have to immediately remove such feeling of envy and hatred. Because there is a difference between competing and wanting to be in their level and exceed them maybe while getting to closer to Allah and between the feelings of jealousy of wanting them to lose such a blessing and to be stripped out of such a gift from Allah. This is this is evil. This is hatred which Allah does not uh love. So if you have this, you have to fix yourself and remove it by buying them a gift, by wishing them well, by making dua to them so that Allah would remove this ill feeling from your heart."
