  "title": "What is Al Wala Wal Bara (concise explanation) #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what is Al in a concise manner like just a general explanation in a concise manner Al is to have the feeling of Allegiance and belonging to Islam and to the Muslims whether they're sinful or righteous my allegiance is wholeheartedly given to the Muslim umah and to My Religion to Islam regardless of nationality of race or of any other aspect my first priority is to serve Allah and to serve Islam and the Muslims this is Al Al is to disassociate myself with anything that is not associated with Islam so I disass associate myself to disbelieving Nations to ideologies that don't relate to Islam to sinful people committing sins that go against Shar whether they're Muslims or non-muslims so I could have both feelings of Al and to a specific individual he's a Muslim so he has my allegiance as a Muslim but he's sinful he's committing major sins so he has my disloyalty as a sinful openly sinful Muslim I could love and hate the same individual depending on the goodness and the Badness in him so this concept is mentioned clearly in the Quran as in when Allah tells us about our role model in ibraim and his people and there are many many places in the Quran and the Sunnah that uh State this and Allah Knows Best"
