  "title": "Who inherits a woman after her death? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "koala belly I hope the name is right a friend of mine has an elder sister of his mother meaning an aunt she's a wealthy woman who has no children this wealthy woman is married to a man who has another wife and he has children from this wife the question is who is of the two sides that is my friend or the other children of the second wife of the man has more right to the inheritance the question is a little bit awkward because if a woman dies those who inherit her heir as are as follows 1 the husband to the parents 3 her offspring if there are no parents no offspring then it's the husband and her siblings if she has no siblings then her uncle's paternal uncles if not then paternal cousins now her husband's second wife and their children are totally not related to this woman therefore they are not entitled for a single penny only the husband would get half of her wealth and property because she has no children and the other half goes to her siblings if she has no parents I hope this answers the question"
