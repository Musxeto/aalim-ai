  "title": "Difference between a Prophet & a Messenger - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sad from qatar says i heard that was the first messenger so what is the difference between a prophet and a messenger there are many definitions the most authentic is that a messenger is someone who is sent with a new law and scriptures while a prophet is sent to follow and verify the law of the messenger before him that's why we have few messengers for bani israel while they have hundreds if not thousands of prophets and some of them were killed so for example john the baptist peace be upon him was a prophet and not a messenger while isa his cousin was a prophet and a messenger and allah knows best"
