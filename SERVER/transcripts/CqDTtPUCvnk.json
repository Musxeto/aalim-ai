  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim wa salatu was-salam ala rasulillah and Kareem and hamdulillah and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we will be discussing child rearing his benefit is virtues and in many ways in which we can return the matter of child rearing back to the Quran and the Sunnah of varna be so Aloha they were salam to help us with these endeavors we have chicken Assam and Hakim who's a teacher at that Academy a teacher at KIU and he has been an imam and a teacher for over 30 years so insha'Allah Allah would like to invite our guest I said I'm not like one after LA welcome to LA he was looking for having me I'm you know ecologic we know that the purpose father is Adam said in authentic hadith Mella era ham layer ham men men men layer Hamlet ham correct so whoever doesn't show mercy Allah Spanish I will not show mercy to them so we like to discuss how does showing mercy and having mercy upon your children and playing with them how did the power I saw them show us this in his daily endeavors she's never men ever Haman hamdulillah what salatu was-salam ala rasoolillah he was early he was happy he won many today be hood yeah I'm a bard oh it goes without saying and this is not only in Islam only also it is in other cultures and religions that once you set the foundation you can build a strong building children are the foundation of this society and we have to look into how we bring them up you can teach and treat your child with harshness with toughness he might grow up to become a fighter a warrior or someone who's abusive but this is not what Islam is looking for Islam is the religion of balance so yes we would like him to become a strong man or a woman when he grows up but we also want to instill in him a lot of compassion and love and mercy and our role model is the prophet sallallaahu are you selling no one can say any negative comment about his bravery about his manhood about his cavalieri sallallahu alehiwassallaam he's the ultimate in all yet when his child died he wept and the companion said o prophet of Allah you are the Messenger of Allah and you're weeping he said this is mercy from allah azza wajal and Allah puts it in the people's hearts so we have to understand how to up bring our children in a balanced way now the Prophet himself ra his salat wa sallam used to love children and there's so many many many hadith about how he treated his grandchildren about how he treated the children of the Ansar about how he treated children in general and it all shows compassion the Prophet was one sorry sort of Saran with one of his grand sons whether it Hassan or al-hussein the sons of Adam never thought of his cousin and of his daughter Fatima and by the way a lot of the people nowadays are so influenced by the media they think that marrying a cousin is haram so they always say how do you want me to marry my cousins and my sister my cousin sister she's a sister and they would consider this to be incest in America and elsewhere and this is totally bogus the Prophet I said I'm married his own cousin Zainab ajosh and he gave his own cousin Ali bin Abi Talib his own daughter so there is nothing wrong in that so the Prophet was once al Islam playing with one of his grandsons and pushing them and kissing them and hugging them this is what we do with our grandchildren we show them love and compassion and play with them wrestle with them with love and and care and in his presence was at a claw even Havis and he was from the tribesmen he was a leader and he looked at the Prophet Allah saw some and said you do this as if he's looking down at the Prophet it's a sign of weakness he says I have ten sons have never kissed any one of them so the Prophet said that a salat wa sallam said that hadith Malaya ham layer ham he who does not have mercy over others Allah will not have mercy upon him and in another narration the Prophet looked back at him and said is it within my powers that Allah snatched and took away mercy from your heart I can't I cannot help you so some people think that they're tough some people think that wow man this is the man he's my dog why because he doesn't have any mercy he's really rigid he could see his son die in front of his eyes and not even blink out of Allah this is rudeness not toughness this is something that is not related to Islam the Prophet Isis arms history is filled with stories of love compassion and care and this is a crucial point because many times there are men who have warped ideas of what masculinity is it means to be tough it means to be rigid it means to be emotionless to show no mercy ever to not even cry and we know the Parthenon was the example as a lispenard I said of what a man what a human being is supposed to be so how do we send sort of undo these ideas of what masculinity means and sort of redirect people back to the prophesy said I'm and in the way he taught in the way he was with his family I think is crucial to do this like how do we sort of undo these sort of things that first first of all it is not something that is related to your whims and desires I remember maybe like 10 12 years ago I made the lecture and it's called the Islamic spectacles mm-hmm glasses what what what is the Islamic one where can we buy it from it is what you put on your eyes to see through and I gave an example of someone who is and it's not a someone who hates Islam who's an enemy of Islam and all of a sudden unlike guides him to accepting Islam and he reverts to Islam when you interview him he sets up an online yesterday if I were able to kill all the Muslims I would have done that today man I love Muslims I love Islam what changed what has changed it's the way you look at things and we can make a lot of examples but I'm not going to do this going and check the lecture it has so many examples here is one of where we need such classes when we want to deal with children our role model is the Prophet as I said I'm so when was the last time you put your child on your lap kissed and hugged him when was the last time you tucked him into bed or read him ayatul kursi or a story from the serie when was the last time you made him laugh if you go through the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you will find many examples examples even in places where nowadays if you were to do them people would look in a weird way so what are you doing here my following the synonym for example oh mama one of the granddaughters of the Prophet I saw Sarah her father was I will assume that idea may Allah be pleased with him and he was married to the daughter of the prophetess zina and there were cousins and the Prophet used to carry oh mama who was a child like a year and a half two years of age when leading the prayer of the Mossville of the Muslims Muslims are praying behind him so he used to carry her and recite the Quran whenever he wanted to do record sujood he would place her gently on the ground he would do so George and Recor and when he ever got up he carried her back again now if I would have done this they would kick me out of the Masjid guys what are you doing should know what what is this this is this disrespecting the Salah disrespecting the Masjid subhanAllah you're more Roman than the Romans the Prophet used to do this is awesome and you dare to say that this is not appropriate not only that once it was reported in hadith that he was leading the prayer and he went into sujood so everybody went to stitute to prostration and the muslims started worrying the Prophet has prolonged the salute way way longer than usual so one of the companions said to himself okay either he died or there's something wrong so he raised his head up and as he did he saw the Prophet was in prostration so he went back again seeking Allah's forgiveness and continued after the prayer was concluded the Companions said o prophet of Allah we were worried we thought either you died or you were being revealed to Allah is giving you away so know neither one of course it was my grandson and Hasson who when I was prostrating rode me like his wrists right he thought I was a horse and playing with him so he took me as his right and I did not want to startle him or to you know make him come down I just waited until he got fed up and moved what compassion remember what love a prophet Elisha has to his grandchildren and to the children in general and if there's time I can give you more and more examples of this yeah Charlotte Allah we're gonna pause for a break this is a beautiful story and a beautiful lesson a reminder they say reminder benefits that believe in Charlotte Allah so viewers please stay tuned as we come back for our second segment I've liked the Dorman's what we're talking about having fun with your children playing with them and showing to the mercy of Charlotte Allah come back very soon assalamu alaikum wa rahamtullah a briquette I said I'm an economist hola hell better care to and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments we were talking about child rearing specifically having fun with your children and playing with them I remember when there was a young man that was at the match that he always comes with his father for all five daily prayers and this young man had to be maybe six or seven years old and he will stand and sell out with the greatest for sure I ever seen in my life he didn't smile he didn't joke he didn't laugh and I would think to myself this is a very good boy but later on when I was going home I was thinking like when does he ever play like this is abnormal for a kid not to play so while on one end this is very good I thought to myself is he allowed to express the size of a child to see a lot to play or is it always seriousness so how do you find balance as parents of our children usually speak usually when we take our children to the Masjid we have to make sure that they respect the Masjid they do not annoy the worshippers now we have to have a balance because one would say there's a hadith that states that prevent your children and your insane from being admitted to the message from entering the Masjid and this is not an authentic hadith yet the elders who usually don't have knowledge in the Masjid would make a fuzz of it so many times we see children who are in there eight or nine years of age not reach the age of puberty yet but they are as if described masha'Allah praying better than a lot of the adults and they come in the first straw early reading the Quran and when the Akama is given we find some of the elders who came late pulling them back this is totally Haram they are more worthy of that spot then you late comer not just because of your age you want to deprive even if they were behind the email as long as they know how to pray whoever comes early first-come first-served now when we come to the issue of balance sometimes we get people getting their children who are 3 or 4 years of age and they turn the message into a war zone you know hanging on the chandeliers and are like Tara's on moving from one chandelier to the other poking this may be breaking a person's glasses which were on the floor singing maybe sometimes confusing the Imam so many times the Imam is reading al-fatiha and the child sing right he's going with him and people laugh people do this is not appropriate so what do you mean by balance balance means that if this was the norm it has to be stopped these are irresponsible children the Prophet said elitism order your children to pray when they're 7 so why do you bring your child when his four said he loves it said no it's best psychologically to tell him no Habibi stay home nothing not yet not you're not old enough so he's so eager to go to the Masjid and you are charging him five years of age six years of aged seven yes next week you'll be seven let's go to the Masjid Hollis is ready but when you take him up from an early age and you force him in a in a sense after a few months he's bored he wants to play he wants to watch the TV and he said no no let's go and pray then when it's seven years of age to pray then he doesn't want to go anymore he's not interested in the in the pseudonym look at the compassion the Prophet was leading the prayer rallies a lot to say and all of a sudden he hears the crying of a child of an infant so immediately he wrapped up the prayer in a quick fashion normal not normal a little bit quicker but the prayer was valid everything was into consideration so after he concluded the prayer look at what he had said the bright the prophet said Alice Auslan I was leading you in prayer and then I heard an infant crying so I wrapped up my salat quickly because I was afraid for his mother's heart you know the mom is spraying and her child is crying and she's you know she doesn't know what to do her heart is with her child but her brain is with the salat and and she can't go out of salat look at the compassion the Prophet Isis and perhaps up the prayer the point is that he did not even reprimand or say anything negative to the mother why because this is a one-shot it's not something that's happening every salat and this means that we as Muslims must be considered I remember in one of my prayers in my Masjid years ago I was leading Asia prayer and during the Asia prayer I heard a child like three years four years of age crying you know when you miss your father you don't know when he is you think you're lost so she was really crying so I conclude I followed the Sunnah I concluded my prayer in a quick fashion everybody was able to notice this and it was a plus for me because what am i doing I'm not showing off I'm just following my religion after the prayer was over immediately a man from these elders you know the grumpy grandfathers said you know stood up and started shouting with his voice in the Masjid subhanAllah you're making a worse example than what the girl did we're making this be what are you doing so I said fear Allah is talking to a father what you're doing is wrong keep them home white bring them to the Masjid and if the man was so embarrassed remember he picked his two girls and left her the machine I immediately got out of my own entrance and went out to meet him to apologize so I could have of course spoken in the Masjid to the elder and made a fight but this is not wise because he would not have stopped he would have turned his guns on me so I went outside I met the man he had this four year old and a six or seven year old girls beautiful young girls so I said okay my friend don't ya need be saddened by what had happened the brother is a good brother but he was impulsive and he said the wrong things don't worry about that the guy started to weep and I was shocked I was emotionally moved he's a no grown-up man he said well la here share their mother left them to me four months ago and is she's filing for divorce she left the house she threw the kids on me I don't have a mother to take care of them I don't have a sister to take care of them I have a job that I'm almost going to lose because no one is taking care of them so I was so desperate for praying in the Masjid of carnauba in these four months I just thought let me go and pray to my lord in a Masjid and this what had happened well I didn't I could not leave them in the car what can I do it broke my heart so the lesson to be learned aji be considerate don't judge the book by its cover open it read some of what's in it then you can base it we don't say like the guys in the West say don't be judgmental no no we are judgmental providing our judgment is based on facts this is what our religion says but we can't be judgmental without looking into the facts and having evidences to back and to prove it the Prophet did not tell the mother fear Allah don't bring your child next time rather he just addressed the issue and moved on so to be balanced to have the children when they are seven years of age or over this is a duty is a must to have them when they are below that if they don't make any disturbance there's no problem it's a lot it's permissible but if they do make a disturbance to the worshipers then we should prevent them from coming to the message we know that many cultures there's still this stigma around having girl children you know for boys is still a shot officer honor but and many times you find people less happy if they have a they have girl children I know there's a narration with the Prophet Solomon fatima zahra whenever she would come in he would stand up and place her in the seat that he was sitting in as a show of honour and respect so how can we return back to this one of the parks where Saddam when it comes to specifically showing love and mercy and kindness and have an honor for the girl children well the narration you've stated earlier is authentic the hadith states narrated by Aisha if I'm not mistaken that whenever I felt him I came in you could not miss the way she walks because it's identical to her father's walk and whenever the Prophet SAW Fatima coming in he would stand up from his seat kiss her between her eyes and put her in his place and she would do the same to him whenever he comes in a place what do we learn from this we learn that it is an essential part and duty of a Muslim father to give respect and wallah he we would not waste time if we devote many episodes on respect what we lack between us Muslims is respect what causes the majority of fights between the spouses that ends usually in divorce is the lack of respect if the father did not respect his son or daughter and they were brought up in an abusive environment definitely they will not respect him they will not be dutiful to him if you didn't don't respect others people won't respect you your colleagues your subordinates your bosses and and superiors they would not respect you the more we learn about respect things would differ the Prophet Isis Sam used to treat children in respect whenever he saw the women and the children of the Ansar walking coming approaching he would say by Allah you are the most beloved people to my heart and he makes dua for them when he sees children playing he goes and gives them Salam and he wipes over their cheeks and they say wow the smell is so beautiful of the hands of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam he used to wipe over the heads of the children showing them compassion rather than going in and said what are you doing were you saying there what are you playing did you pray did you do this this this is not the military you have to treat children in a way that puts respect in their hearts you have to trust them even if they are children you see I don't think there is enough time but we can talk about being honest with the children we can talk about entrusting them like the Prophet used to do we can talk about joking with the children and playing with them even at a young age all of this makes a child grow in a balanced way that he has mercy he has courage he has self-respect he has confidence but when we don't and when we fail maybe we can talk about this later on when we fail in doing this we get psychos and this is something we're trying to avoid barakallahu this is a very dense topic we can definitely go further and Charlotte we will but this is unfortunately the end of the program Charlotte Ajala thank you so much for your immense knowledge and sharing with us you're the Hickman that you have on a collage viewers until next time Michelle da da da stay tuned we hope that you benefited greatly from our program today we look forward to seeing you again assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu [Music] [Music]"
