  "transcript": "hardy asks which part of a child's sin is burdened on the parent now we know that the prophet alaihi salatu told us that a person would not be accountable for his action until he reaches the age of puberty so the pen that registers the sins is uplifted upon a child until he reaches the age of puberty so hard is asking which part of the child's sin is burdened on the parent all sins that the parent have control on yet they allow the child to do it the child is not sinful yet the parents are for example if a four-year-old boy wears gold whether it's a necklace or a bracelet or anything on his clothes he's not sinful he's a child yet those who are sinful are the the parents who allowed him to do this if he listens to music if he watches something inappropriate or sinful he's not held accountable because he's a child yet the parents who allow such acts the relatives who allow such acts are sinful and you can cascade this to all the acts that the child does so my children in my house if they listen to music i turn it down and tell them this is haram this is not appropriate if uh um a boy for example who's 10 years old not yet reaching the age of puberty wants to smoke or wants to drink alcohol this is not permissible and it's my response responsibility to prevent such a thing"
