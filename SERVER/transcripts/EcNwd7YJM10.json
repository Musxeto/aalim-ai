  "transcript": "Ronnie says um can I civer my ties of kinship with my non-muslim relatives and am I obliged to help them when they are in need what about your own family like parents and siblings Islam promotes maintaining and observing ties of kinship and this is highly recommended if not obligatory when they are Muslims but even the non-muslims we ordered to be kind to them asak may Allah be pleased with her said that I came to the prophet wasam and said oh prophet of Allah my mother came to visit me and she's a disbeliever so should I be dutiful and kind and respectful to her the prophet said yes so if you have a non-muslim uncle or a cousin cering their kinship ties would not add any value neither to them nor to you maybe it would relieve you from some sort of headache in ttention but if you look at the long-term impact you'll find that they might be guided they might convert and revert to Islam because of your way of dealing with them and trying to be kind and connecting to them so yes this is not permissible you have to do your level best to um observe your uh ties of kinship uh"
