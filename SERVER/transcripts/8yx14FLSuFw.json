  "title": "Women's prayer better in her home and Dhuhr is better than Friday prayer for her - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "says ISO and QA it is more profitable for women to pray inside her room than in the Masjid according to the manhaj of salaf how it became or it becomes acceptable because the wives of the Prophet I saw salaam did salah and ehtekaf in his masjid after his death Allah knows the best for women is lower more reward will than salatul juma so Muhammad's Ana's question is straightforward and simple he says we know in Q&A I think he's referring to my website or maybe Islam Q&A dot n fo that it is more reward for a woman to pray in her room rather than to pray in the masjid but the confusion he has is that the Prophet is a lot of Psalms wives after his death used to pray in the masjid and used to do air Attica Attica is seclusion which is done in the last 10 nights of ramadan well Mohammedanism well mohammed honest the news is that the prophet's wives Allah is Allah and Allah may Allah be pleased with them used to pray in his life with him in the Masjid and they used to make ehtekaf with him during his lifetime so this does not contradict or go against that praying in your room is more profitable or reward this shows you that there are two levels of reward to pray in the room for a female is more reward Abul than praying in the message of the Prophet Isis and this is what the Prophet said sallallahu Salim when a woman came to him and said I want to pray with you in the Masjid and women used to pray in the masjid the Prophet told her is awesome about her house that praying in your house is better than in my machine and praying inside your house in like the hole is better than praying in your house that includes the backyard and and the garden or whatever and praying inside for example the living room is better than praying in the hole and praying in your own bedroom is better than praying in the living room so the more a woman is far away from people being able to see her this is better than praying in the message of the Prophet Isis around and compare this with what we see from women mixing with men without any shame working together going to mixed schools and universities and chatting and socializing yet the Prophet tells the believing women be far as as far as possible from men be with your moms be your loved ones but none mahomes strangers be as far as possible from them so this is the best and highest level now the woman says no I'd like to pray in the masjid it's your right you can do that the Prophet said is awesome do not prevent women from entering the message or going to the Masjid so this is the right of a woman she has a choice you want great a you want to go to five star accommodation or two three stars accommodation it's up to you the Prophet has advised you salah salem that praying in the masjid is far greater and far better for you praying in your home in the room is far better and greater for you than praying in the Masjid and Mohammed Ana says that praying in praying for prayer is it more reward will than praying Friday for a woman in the message and Asus definitely yes for a woman to pray longer in her home is more rewarding than for her to leave her home and go to the Masjid and listen to the hot body the sermon and pray with the Muslims go back again to her home this has a no doubt in it because this is what the prophet sallallaahu Shalem has recommended"
