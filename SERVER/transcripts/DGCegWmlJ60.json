  "transcript": "your neighbor and to honor your neighbor means a lot of things it means that you do not harm him you do not annoy him and that you are generous with him and that you do as much as possible to be kind and helpful to him and this is not something recommended it is mandatory to honor your neighbor and the neighbors are three types as scholars say a neighbor who has three rights over you he is your neighbor he is your next of kin and he is a muslim so such a neighbor has three rights over you the second type of neighbors are those who are muslim and there are your neighbors but they're not related to you the third type is a neighbor who is not muslim so even if i have a non-muslim neighbor he has rights over me and the answer is yes so he's not muslim regardless he's not muslim but he has rights over you because he is your neighbor and part of your iman part of your islam is to honor your neighbor and this is exactly what the prophet did himself he had a jew a young jew who used to serve him and he fell sick the prophet did not say because he's a jew let him go to hell he went to him and he was lying on his bed in his house and the prophet assam gave him dawa and he asked that young jew to accept islam and the young jew looked at his father who was a jew by default and the father said obey abel qasim obey the prophet yes accept islam and the boy accepted islam and the prophet came out with his face sparkling when he's happy and he's saying alhamdulillah who saved this boy from hell because of me also in the hadith and if i'm not mistaken may allah be pleased with him the prophet told him that when you cook food try to make the soup a lot so that you can give to your neighbors you're not going to give them from the food you're cooking but give them from the soup that you make which is nothing and the prophet told us by allah he is not a believer who sleeps with a full stomach while his neighbor is hungry imagine how many nights have we slept with a full stomach every single night how many nights have our neighbors gone to bed with empty stomachs and the answer is allah knows so it is your duty it is your responsibility to take care and look after your neighbors and this is not impossible but it shows you that in islam the community is like a wall a brick wall and we are a brick so we have to take care of the bricks surrounding us we have to be united and that is why they say that you choose your neighbor before you choose your house so many of us when they want to move into a new house they look at the house the size the rooms the looks and then they move in what's more appropriate is before looking at the house look at those living around you and then you will find that there is a big difference whether to move in or to stay out the prophet says four things are considered to be means of happiness the prophet says a righteous woman a big house a good neighbor and a comfortable ride four things if you have these things you've got it made a good wife which also can be a good spouse so a good husband to a woman is the same as a righteous woman to a man and the prophet says that and four things are considered to constitute misery on earth one a bad woman an evil wife two a bad neighbor three a bad ride for a tight house so the prophet is telling us allah how to be happy on earth by selecting and choosing a neighborhood that has good neighbors and the prophet also says in the hadith if you ponder upon it you find that being a good neighbor is one of the means of making allah love you you want allah to love you well select or be a good neighbor and select your good neighbors as well the prophet says allah if you wish that allah and his messenger would love you and who doesn't wish that if you want allah and his messenger to love you the prophet says fulfill the things you've entrusted with speak the truth and be kind to your neighbors be kind to your neighbors and allah would love you for that now this is the second branch of iman in this hadith whoever believes in allah and the last day should speak good or be silent whoever believes in allah and the last day should honor his neighbor and the third one is to honor your guest now being hospitable being generous to your guest is not something that is highly recommended it is mandatory it is part of the branches of iman those who are miser or stingy they are not among the believers their belief that iman is reduced to very negligible the more you are generous the more allah loves you and one would only wonder how beautiful this religion is it's not enough to be good with allah azzawajal this is mandatory you pray you fast you give zakat you also have to be good with the community you have to specifically be good with your guests and the prophet says that the rights of your guest over you imagine three days and nights these are the rights of the guest who comes and stays with you for three days and nights and he doesn't have to be a relative anyone who comes into your house he's your guest he's entitled to stay there for three days and three nights you serving him bringing him food and honoring him nowadays people when they knock on their neighbors or in their friend's doors they see from the door secret eye or whatever they call it they look into it from the hole and when they see that they are strangers or guests coming they pretend that they're not in the house and they claim to be believers this is not the actions of believers the minute you have friends or guests coming open the door and receive them and honor them allah tells us in surat that ibrahim when he had the three angels coming in the form of humans and he did not recognize them he had three coming to him as guests within minutes he got this cooked cow he brought it it was cooked they didn't have any microwaves no stoves electrical stoves the scholars say that every single night he would slaughter a cow or a sheep and cook it prepare it and put it on fire so that hoping a guest would come and he would honor that guest every single night so the minute they sat down he brought the food to them this is the generosity of the prophets and messengers our prophet allah was the most generous he never said no to anyone asking him anything and the companions were as such and that is why three days and nights these are the rights of a guest if he wants to extend a little bit then he has to seek permission from his host and this shows you that islam promotes things that honor others so don't harm them by saying what is not appropriate honor your neighbor be kind to him and never harm him by doing bad things to him and also honor your guest even if you don't know your guest because if he's a relative of yours definitely going to honor him by default but if he's a stranger then this is what expresses and exposes your true iman when you honor that person or when you don't and if you do then you have fulfilled these three branches of iman and you still have a long way to complete all 60 plus of them this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] a oh every human

oriented in dava next on peace tv [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] today we will study with the grace of allah azzawajal hadith number 15 and this hadith was narrated by abu hurairah allah be pleased with him the prophet said sallallahu alaihi wasallam whoever believes in allah and the last day should speak good or keep silent and whoever believes in allah and the last day should honor his neighbor and whoever believes in allah and the last day should honor his guest this hadith was reported by bukhari and muslim in the sahih and again you remember that we've stated that good ethics and moral conduct in islam revolve around four hadiths this is one of them so this is a pillar in adam the prophet tells us to be mindful of what we say and whatever comes from your mouth it's either completely good so you should say it and you have all the right to speak it out and sometimes it becomes mandatory so if you see something evil you say that this is evil don't do this what's coming out of your mouth is good if you see someone needs to be taught and you teach him what comes out of your mouth is good keep on doing it it also can be pure evil so it is forbidden for you to talk about it so if you want to encourage someone to sin then shut your mouth if you want to blame someone for going for prayer if you want to blame a woman for wearing her hijab in this case this is sinful it is best for you not to talk however in between there is something that is not sinful but it is not rewardable as well this is normal talk i'd like to talk to you about our passion for cars so this car has this and that and we talk now this is not sinful and it's also not rewardable so should i do it or not scholars say that you should have your limit and if you don't talk regarding such issues it's even better because talking in permissible things would eventually lead into bad things without you knowing it and that is why um pleased with him the great companion of the prophet susan said whoever talks a lot makes mistakes a lot and whoever makes mistakes a lot will make a lot of sense and whoever makes a lot of sense then hellfire is more worthy of him and therefore one should be careful of what he says and subhanallah it is one of the smallest organs in the human body yet it has the greatest danger the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever guarantees to me that he observes and protects what's between his jaws and what's between his legs i'll guarantee for him janna so if you're mindful of what you say and you make and take great precautions before you speak the prophet guarantees paradise for you in arabia we have a colloquial saying we say that talk there's no taxation there is no customs charge for it if you bring a car if you bring some goods the customs will charge you taxation which is haram but when you speak nobody can charge you and this is wrong allah azzawajal told us that no matter what a person utters there is a vigilant watcher recording it so there is someone who would not leave a single letter or a single word escape him he will record it and everything that comes out of your mouth will be recorded and that is why allah azzawajal told us about the idol worshipers who claim that the angels are females allah says that they witness the creation of the angels so that they can speak freely and say that the angels are females by allah their testimony what they have said will be noted down it would be recorded and on the day of judgment allah will hold them accountable for that anything you say will be recorded and you will be held accountable for that and this is scary because we talk without giving any attention to what we say abu bakr may allah be pleased with him the great companion of the prophet used to hold his tongue with his fingers and say this is what threw me in places that i fear and that may destroy me my tongue is what made me fall in so many troubles and problems and um along with so many righteous predecessors they did not speak a lot because they were not able to do so on the contrary they were the most knowledgeable they were the most eloquent people when they speak however they feared the consequences of what they say says that nothing prevents me from talking a lot except that i'm afraid of boasting about it meaning that i know what comes from my mouth is so beautiful and so eloquent but i fear what shaytaan may throw in my heart by speaking and thinking that i can boast about my eloquent speech if we look at our gatherings we will find that we sit for long and long and long hours chit-chatting slandering people back biting joking everything that is talked about can be permissible but in a lot of incidents you would find it to be sinful we talk about real estate about wealth about stocks about women about children about jobs and positions and we don't hesitate from cracking jokes imitating people making fun of people and the longer we sit the bigger the portion of shaytaan in our discussions and in our gatherings even righteous people even those who claim to be practicing they themselves have their own shortcomings they sit for long hours but shaytan comes to them and tells them let's discuss others who are not on our way who are not following our path so they backbite scholars dies they make fun of them of how they speak and thinking that they are on the right path alone they're making fun of muslims and they're labeling muslims this man is so and so he follows the group of so and so and they start making a lot of fun of them may allah have mercy on her soul said by allah it is not permissible for you to harm a pig or a dog these are animals filthy animals he says by allah it is not permissible for you to harm them to torture them so how is it possible for you to harm your muslim brother by talking in his reputation by slandering him by making fun i know a lot of people that considered to be righteous and practicing and maybe students of knowledge when they sit together they say oh they die so and so his arcadia is this and that and he does this and that and they make fun of him and they ridicule him and they talk negatively about him and they consider this that this is permissible backbiting and wallahi it is not they're not warning anyone from a deviant person they're making fun of a muslim in this way and the prophet told us that a man may say a word that he is heedless off he doesn't give any attention to it this word that comes out from his mouth throws him in hell for 70 years until he reaches its bottom and in a narration it throws him in hell as far as the east from the west one word that he said heedlessly he was not paying any attention to it so try to cross-examine and see how many times you make fun of people you ridicule people you imitate people simply to make others laugh or to have a good time the prophet says woe to those who speak to others and lie just to make them laugh woe to them woe to them so how many times do we make lies to make others laugh this is what the prophet says whoever believes in allah and the last day should say good or speak good or be silent and that is why it is safest to most of us to be silent unless we talk in what pleases allah the almighty also these three things mentioned in the hadith by the prophet alaihim whoever believes in allah and the last day meaning that these things increase the iman of a person and he cannot be a proper believer he cannot be a complete min unless he fulfills these three things and you remember that we've stated that the hadith says that iman is 60 plus branches or 70 plus branches two narrations if a man is 60 plus branches you cannot be a full-fledged min a complete movement until you fulfill these branches and one of them is to say or speak good or be silent the other two are also part of the branches of iman but we will discuss them inshaallah after the break so stay tuned the value of money in the hereafter
