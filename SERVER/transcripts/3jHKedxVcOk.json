  "transcript": "[Music] alaykum peace be with you welcome to another episode of let's talk I'm your moderator Omar Dunlap and we have with us she aam Alim alaykum allum and we have with us our wonderful studio audience alaykum uh and today on let's talk we're discussing the issue of giving Islam our absolute best uh our best efforts not leaving our leftovers uh for Islam what we can just throw something no giving it our absolute best whether uh in propagating it or uh in our worship ourselves and our relationship with Allah subhana wa ta'ala uh and and so on because these days uh many Muslims we get so wrapped up in in dya uh you know in making sure we have the best house and the the most expensive car and the best degree and so we felt that it was an an important topic uh to to discuss this issue so without going too much into it I'm going to give the the mic over here to uham and let us let him give us his reflection it goes without saying that as Muslims we have the most honorable task and Mission any person could have Allah asael says in the Quran that there is no one better than who calls for Allah and performs or does righteous deeds and says I am among the Muslims I am a musl Muslim so it's something to be proud of that you are a Muslim and Allah tells us that it is the best thing and there's no one better than this person now when I reflect on giving Islam our very best and our efforts this gives me the idea that there are people who think that Islam is a separate entity and it's different than our lives and I do beg to differ because Islam is total submission to Allah and I always give this example that Islam is like a frame and our lives is like a photograph the proper thing for a Muslim to do if he is a practicing true Muslim is to bring this Frame which is Islam and place it over his life and cut the edges so that Islam would fit completely to your life and nothing goes out what the majority of people are doing nowadays they're doing this process but instead of cutting the edges they're trying to WIP in the angles of the frame a bit and maybe uh uh get a scotch tape and tape it here and put couple of nails here at the end of the day you'll have a distorted Islam and this is the majority of the people what they're embracing is is a distorted Islam I see no difference between our lives and Islam Allah the almighty tells us that I have not created the heavens and the Earth uh I have not created the gin and the human beings except to worship me so this is the sole purpose of our creation yet one would argue and say but there are millions and millions of people who are not worshiping Allah asael yes because they're not fulfilling Allah's will and that's why they they're going to be punished for that but as a Muslim I am created I know that I'm created to worship Allah but again one would argue does this mean I have to stay in the Masjid for 24 hours and I have to fast all day long and I have to do this and I have to do that no and this is the focal point there is no difference between our lives and Islam as practicing true Muslims and that is why our whole program program and schedule of the day should be manifesting worshiping Allah and how is that well simple if you look at the way that the prophet livedam you would see that portrayed in front of you all of his tasks all of the things that he does during the day and night are forms of worship even talking to someone even when he plays with his wives even when he raises AA may Allah be pleas with her the mother of the Believers he raised her twice now if you come to one of us uh those who claim to be students of knowledge or Scholars when was the last time you raised with your wife you crazy I race with my wife I may wrestle with her but race with her no way they think that this is degrading well the prophet did not think of it this way when someone who is lower than us comes to talk to us we may look down at them and say listen send someone who's older someone who is richer someone who is more influential uh uh with influence than you to come and talk to me I don't talk like to people like you while the prophet Alam a young girl of seven or eight years old used to come and say oh Prophet I have a problem and she used to take his hand and the prophet walks with her she walks in the streets of Medina telling him uh uh her problems and he would listen so this is also another form of worship this means that we have to utilize our time for the benefit of Islam and by utilizing your time this does not mean you have to limit your efforts and work only to dawa only to prayers but you have to widen the Spectrum a bit and to include that even your work at the office should be for the sake of Allah what is your intention when you work 9 to5 to get money what for I don't know I I need a a bigger plasma screen in the house I need a new set of stereo I need a new car I'd like to change the rims of my car my my my car or my ride and have it loow rims and Etc I need to this I need that well you have a problem but those who are practicing would say I need the money so that I could put food on the table so that my family my kids would not need to beg they have everything that's sufficient for them I need money so I personally would have something to pay for sodak for charity I need money so that I could secure some of the needs of my family and my loved ones and my relatives I need the job because it gives me a chance to meet others to call them to Islam it so this is one aspect which is your job if you go to your Recreation the same thing goes on why are you working out in the gym to become stronger why do you want to become stronger so that anyone who cuts in me while I'm driving I can easily stop him and beat the hell out of him well this is UN Islamic why do you want to get stronger I don't know I want to impress women again this is the no no wrong answer why do you want to be stronger so that I can pray night prayer without being tired so quickly so that I can fight in the cause of Allah whenever there's need to defend my country whenever there's need to defend my wealth whenever there's need to defend my honor if someone wants to attack my family I have to be there and it gives me a good shape shape and people would look at me and say mashallah Islam doesn't tell you to be weak and vulnerable and and and and so on but at the same time it tells you not to be uh uh someone who is over the edge and and beating people and so on so islamically a person should give all of his time and this depends on the intention all of his time time all of his effort all of what he knows to for the sake of Allah why because by this you would be fulfilling Allah's will in worshiping him but if you segregate you say well this is what's for Caesar and this is what's for me this is God forbids what is for Allah Allah Allah wants me to pray five times a day and the rest I do everything else in my mind this would not be giving Islam your very best very good in reviewing it I think another question has has come to my mind that I think maybe we need to to address uh when we say as is the topic of this episode that Muslims should work harder at their religion and being good Muslims and spreading the correct uh message of of Islam are we also are we saying that we should also put our doing our best at work and at home and in school on the back burner or are we not saying that well if we looked at the title of this segment probably we would yeah but the prophet gave us the answer to this question by saying that Allah the almighty loves when some of you is doing a task that he perfects it and this goes all over so it goes with propagation of Islam it goes with your performing forms of worship and it goes with your daily job with your studying in in in University or at school it is a concept that all Muslims must perfect that whenever you do something do it in the best fashion possible and that is why this one of the brothers who was asked he justified the early Muslims by saying that they gave all what they had to modernize the science and develop and improve what they had at the time and this is the the the the the technology that we're enjoying nowadays is the result of their studies and their hard work yet we have to be careful when we generalize and say that these scientists were Muslims because some of them had corrupt ideology and they had only Islam by the name nevertheless we have proper practicing Muslim Muslims who were scientists who um added a lot to uh science and and Technology without compromising their own religion and this is the balance that we have to have it is almost impossible to say that what are you doing you're doing more to Islam or you're doing more to science or your school or your family or as I said in the very beginning it is you're putting everything in a blender and at the end of the day you are doing what Allah wants you to do because you're practicing uh uh you're a practicing Muslim and your Islam tells you to perfect everything that you do so to be clear you would say that the message is nothing should be done half-heartedly right we if we're going to do it whether it's school or being Muslim we should do both of them 100% to the best of our ability this is what Allah says in the Quran Allah says in the Quran prepare whatever you can of force to fight the enemies whatever you can so in order to prepare this you need to have rocket science scientists you have to have people who know technology who know engineering who know medicine who know uh n nanosciences and Technologies everything in all aspects but this would not inter interfere with your worship of Allah because this is part of your worship of Allah but if someone comes and says listen I have to work in the lab I can't pray couple of prayers so I'm going to skip it because I'm working for Allah no this goes beyond the red lines that we're not supposed to well what if someone isn't going that far let's say he's not missing his Salah but he gets so wrapped up in his work that maybe he isn't spending as much time with his family as he should or maybe he's not missing his Salah but he delays it to the the last minute and he's not really focusing cuz he's thinking about what's going on in his school or his lab or something something like that would you say that that's like a warning sign that he needs to sort of rep prioritize definitely he has a problem with priorities because there are no NOS there are red lines that you should not cross at all and among these things are your prayers you cannnot uh uh delay them or not pray them with congregation because these are your priorities now the family you have to have someone to take care of them if there's no one except you and you're focusing on something else then you have a problem because you are choosing something that is not the appropriate thing and I give you an example in forms of worship a lot of people may understand this if you are in the last 10 nights of Ramadan and let's assume you are on the 27th of Ramadan and the Imam is praying Twi prayer or night prayer which is the most preferred prayers to Allah at that time and you instead of praying with them say to yourself no I'm going to make ta around the Kaa and make and this is rewardable by Allah It Is rewardable by Allah but at this particular moment the best thing you can do is to pray with the congregation and supplicate to Allah and you can delay this later on so you have to prioritize in order to reach what Allah wants from you very good okay I think at this point we're going to go to our audience and see if they have any questions Alum go ahead yes I would like to ask that if you see a friend for instance at a university doing something wrong for instance talking to a girl should you pull him to the side and say this is wrong or should you uh leave it for later or or ask him for a double date tell him at all well definitely it is not to pull him and put yourself in a situation that is is not something to be praised for what you should do is whenever you see something that is wrong you have to tell people educate people and you have to change this Vice as the prophet said whenever you see Vice you should change it with your hand if you have authority with your tongue if you don't have authority but you can advise and with your heart if you are hope uh helpless and the only thing you could do is just you know uh try to change it with your heart by by moving out by leaving the place so if you see someone like this you should advise him but you should pick the right moment if you advise him in front of his girlfriend he's going to feel insulted and he would like to PR to prove his manhood in front of her so probably he would say bad things to you and maybe curse Islam and maybe commit something that would make him an apostate God forbid so you should keep this in mind once you see him you can write him an email you can send him a letter you can talk to him in the evening and not straightforward you know just give it like five six minutes and then go into the subject but this is the proper Muslim who is not impersonating something he's not but he who is actually believing in changing the whole world to what pleases Allah within his capacity so whenever I see something that is not in accordance to what Allah wants I try my best and my best has limitations I try my best to change this but I would not allow Satan to execute my heart I would not allow myself to have a dead heart whenever I see bad things happening I just look at them give it a smile and move move away I have to have this in myself to be able to give all of me for the sake of Islam and give Islam my best efforts I have to comment on something you said because it's so perfect to something I witnessed with my own eyes you're saying don't correct him in front of his girlfriend he'll feel like he needs to say something and maybe he'll say something against Islam just in anger I saw this exact thing happen where I was with a Muslim friend of mine who's very outspoken but he's good Muslim alhamdulillah and we were walking in the street and he saw a guy and a girl way closer than they should have been and it was very obvious you know they weren't married or anything and he just my friend just told him fear Allah you know he said it very tough like that and they got in this argument which ended with the the guy with the girlfriend the brother with a girlfriend he said okay fine I'm a c and he's not you know but he was angry so I just think it's amazing that you told this and I've seen this happen with my own eyes believe me it is the best way of calling people to Islam by just smiling at them so many times those who do wrong know that they're doing wrong but they don't need you to come and tell them because they wish that you're doing the same thing that they're doing in so many cases I drive by people by young young guys with their windows down in their cars and they're putting m& or uh uh 50 cents or 25 cents or whatever and they're blowing their speakers out I I I bet you they don't betting is Haram I challenge you that they know nothing of what these guys are saying but they just you know cruising and doing this and being who I am I just simply drive next to them and sayum with a very big smile the first thing they do is they turn it off and I say may Allah forgive us all on the day of judgment and make us with the prophet and they say may Allah do that for us thank you sheh I didn't do anything I just gave a smile and a Salam and it had it effect if everyone does this people will change unfortunately we're very passive we're very negative we don't want to contribute and Satan comes and intimidate us with so many things and at the end of the day we end up putting oursel in a shell and isolating ourselves from the others and claiming to be Allah's chosen people I know we've gotten a little off topic where now we're talking about how to correct people so maybe if you have a question more towards uh giving Islam our best effort go ahead okay bah as a matter of fact I'm an English instructor uh so I try to use my English as much as I can to reveal the best image or the most favorite image of Islam uh this is not because I am an instructor this is um the place where I send an invitation to everybody doctors Engineers students even the guys who spend their time surfing the internet uh on unuseless things or useless things or unnecessary things why don't you try to use the internet to uh create websites uh to um give the best image of Islam because you know we are image of the Islam so if foreigners or tourists here in Egypt or whatever or whatever so was doing something wrong as myself I had an experience a personal experience I was riding a car with my friend he uh is from the United States of America we were drinking soft drinks when I finished mine I threw it out of the window of the car he stoed the car and said aan get it again and I get it and put it in a recycled pen I was so embarrassed but from this this happened two years ago since then I haven't done something like that and tried to to tell my friends not to do something like that because we are images for Islam how can we see that Allah says cleanliness is Next to Godliness and at the same time you don't do something like that that's all thank you very much okay as for the Hadith it's not a Hadith so cleanliness is is next to good uh godliness a proverb it's a proverb um it it is true we have to do what we preach it's it's not enough only to preach and the best form of making da is to actually be a practicing Muslim now there are people who go the extra mile now most of Muslims know what is halal and what is Haram but they find it difficult to go the extra mile in propagating because they are not themselves performing so you cannot propagate something that you're not doing so I believe that it is true that we have to give the role model to the people but before we do that we ourselves have to be practicing what we preach and this American friend of yours he told you to go and pick it up because this is what he believes and regardless whether he's Muslim or not but okay he's not a Muslim this is what he believes now if you look at the other religions you feel that they have more commit M to their religions than we do and this is unfortunate because of their conviction and because of our weak belief in our beliefs though we have the ultimate truth is Islam no muslim would doubt this but yet we fail to go and call people to Islam because we are ourselves lazy we're not putting enough effort to this very what role do parents play and helping the children correctly prioritize you know between you know life and Islam and and all this sort of thing and the bonus question are we doing our job as parents those of us who are parents well I'll I'll answer the bonus question answer is no unfortunately if we were doing our jobs as we're supposed to be we would not be in the situation we were in MH we have a cultural Gap and and the kids are grow seeing their parents doing something and learning it at school and learning at the Masjid that they should be doing something else and Islam there is no separation M Islam work entertainment they all are put in a Melting Pot and you get one substance that is one not so many if you go back to the Sunnah you would find that the family used to make the children grow up thinking that Islam is their life and to serve only Islam for example um may Allah be pleased with her she's the mother of anas anas was 10 years old when she brought him to the prophet Alam when he first came to Medina and she said oh prophet of Allah anas is a learned child let him be with you serve you and learn from you the prophet didn't need that Alam but he would not return this woman with a broken heart so he accepted The Boy The Boy lived with the prophet Alat wasam and his family for 10 years stating that I've never seen the prophet Alat wasam reprimand me for something that I did by saying why did you do this or for something I did not do shouldn't you have done so and so he would not say this to himam in one incident um saw her child anas walking the streets of Medina the prophet entrusted him with a secret and he told him do this thing don't tell anyone about it so he met his mother on the road and she said where are you going he said um the prophet asked me to do something she said what did he ask you to do now the boy is 10 years old the first thing any 10 years old would do is to say the secret and the first thing that comes into mind if he doesn't the mother's going to spank him so Anna said I can't tell you it's a secret what did the mother mother do the mother showed him the role model she said don't ever say the secret of the Prophet to any Soul she didn't go on the offensive she she approved what he did now this shows you that it goes side by side he is there to serve the prophet Alat and this is world this is worldly things but he's not there simply for the worldly things he's there to learn religion and by not separating this is the result that we get an as subaric one of the great Scholars of Islam likewise this Cascades all over when I go to do some shopping and my child comes and says oh father let me come with you and I say well I'm going to take an injection at the hospital and the child says oops okay go may Allah be with you I'm not giving the role model which means that whenever I'm going to talk about Islam he's not going to pay any attention because I'm not practicing what I preach this is very interesting uh what you said because uh I knew a sister that worked in an Islamic school and she saw frequently how the parents were interacting with the children and uh she told me one day she said that it's so bizarre she's aner americ and she said you know convert to Islam she said it's it's so amazing to me that they will tell their children who's asking for some more like sweets there aren't any more sweets like lie to them rather than tell them no you can't have it and I'm the parent and you don't need anymore and the child knows that the parent is lying because just saw the Suites on the counter you know but they you know the parent isn't thinking about what sort of psychological aspect this will this will have on the child so I mean is this a common phenomenon or it it is unfortunately everyone of us know unfortunately in the houses that we do not consider them to be practicing Muslims that if someone calls by phone and the child answers and he says Okay one minute father it's so and so and the father says tell him I'm not here and my father says you're not here this is common because people are not practicing it's not the culture M it's the absence of religion and likewise those who do not lie for example and this is this is one of the the beautiful attributes in the west though they're Christians though they're disbelievers to us but they do not lie and why is that is it because of their religion no this is how they're brought up they would do anything they would sin they would drink intoxicated fornicate but they don't lie they would say the truth unfortunately us Muslims we're compelled by religion not to say a lie the prophet saw a woman once telling her child come come take this because you know when we want to grab our children we just pretend that we want to give them something now I got you well the prophet saw her and said what do you want to give him she opened her hand and said a date oh prophet of Allah and there was a date said by Allah if there wasn't anything in your hand it would have been recorded as a lie at Allah's side now imagine how many lies do we say not to our children to our bosses to our subordinates to our neighbors at work to the police and it it it becomes like a habit people lying to their wives this shows you the split is there and no one thinks of Islam as a priority it's always at the back ta seat if not in the trunk like 2 minutes and I wanted to bring this specific topic up what about what we call an America I don't know if they have it in the Muslim world but I think they do we call them Ramadan Muslims you know in Ramadan we go to the Masjid and pray and we see these faces we've not seen our whole life where did they come from you know suddenly for the days of aid for example the misid is pouring out into the streets these people that you've never seen them seen them before uh and I mean we're talking about giving Islam our absolute best what do you have to say about them about that situation unfortunately we do have a lot of those seasonal worshippers and we have to be a little bit careful because we don't want them to abandon worshiping Allah for good they said okay you don't want to see me in Ramadan I'm not going to come in Ramadan as well no we would like we have to draw the line here now most of the Muslims are worship shipping Allah by tradition not by belief that's why lots of the reverts are stronger in belief and commitment to Islam than the actual born Muslims unfortunately for example um there are lots of Muslims who are women who are wearing the hijab covering up from head to toe but they're not doing it for the sake of Allah and the evidence behind this or that backs this up is that the minute they uh uh get on a plane traveling to the west to to England to Europe after 5 or 10 minutes of takeoff they go to the restrooms and they come back you know what is this yeah old trousers and blouses and makeup you you know for sure that these are not practicing Muslims and they are closer to be sinful if not Hypocrites in Islam it's not this way at all you find a Muslim in Mecca the same attitude as the brother said the same behavior the same uh commitment to Islam if he's in Siberia or in Alaska or in in the US it's the same thing he would not for example compromise we have a problem in compromising a lot of our beliefs because they we are we do not have commitment or we're not simply True Believers we're just it's it's our fathers and and forefather 's practice so I think you've managed to get to the heart of the problem then when we're looking at Muslims not putting the best foot forward for Islam it's because of this issue of compromise and maybe we're just following a tradition and we're not really thinking about what we believe does that seem to be the the consensus most probably yes okay very good to our studio audience now and see if they have any questions for our two guests go ahead brother I'd like to ask the the Sheik a question you at the very beginning said that every one of us in the society have a rule to give Islam his best uh and you said also uh you should do this rule perfectly the question is is how can we do this rule perfectly thank you did I say that you said it okay okay well you have to perfect whatever you do and regardless of what you're doing if you're a janitor you have to clean the floor pretty well and don't look down at janitors because it's an honest job if you're a CEO of a company you have to make sure that everything goes as scheduled and as Clockwork perfect now for us as Muslims we as well have to perfect our tasks whether it is forms of worship so when you pray you don't pray in couple of minutes instead you you give the prayer it's due you have to pray on time you don't pray at home you pray in the Masjid When you pray you don't wear the worst clothes you have you put perfumes so you have to perfect your prayer when you make Daw you have to propagate Islam in the best fashion because as brother Omar said to that man who looked at the man and the woman and said fear Allah now he gave a good advice but was it the perfect advice it wasn't because it caused the man to backfire and commit a major sin if not nullifying his Islam so by saying that you have to perfect whatever you do meaning you have to put your heart into it Islam if you give it some of you it will give you nothing if you give it all of of you it will give you something Islam is in is not in need of us you have to be very careful now Islam doesn't need us it's the religion of Allah when whenever you look around you and you see that calamities befall uh upon our brothers in the Muslim World they are oppressed they are being executed killed their lands is being confiscated and taken uh unjustly from them you think that why is this happening well it's not because we have to work for the sake of the people we have to work for our sake so Islam doesn't need us Allah will have this religion prevailing overall and this is mentioned in black and white in the Quran you have to firmly believe this but now where is my role would I be part of this change part of this effort or would would I be with The Spectator just watching M nice show no Islam wants you to be part of it you Islam wants you to make the difference and to give everything within your capability to support this cause very good do we have another question of course we do go ahead every one of us uh wants to give Islam his best but the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that our hearts got our hearts Got U rusted just like steel and iron how can we get rid of this rusty Hearts and refresh our faith well if you continue the Hadith the prophet gave us the remedy he said that the the the the hearts rust then you have to remember Allah so the prophet is giving us the answer so if you want to remove this trust and if you'd like to revive your heart you have to remember Allah and remembering Allah is is not simply saying Subhan Allah alhamdulillah allahar by the Tongue while your heart is singing a song it it has to go you know uh uh heart and soul with this and this includes all types of of would that include for example Salah and reciting the Quran and saying Good Deeds giving advice and what we're doing now this is also because we're remembering Allah and it's all for the sake of Allah so it's it's it's a wide uh perspective very good go ahead I want to know the qualities of the ideal Coler to Islam of the ideal caller or to Islam caller to Islam wow not me definitely well see again people differ if you are a caller to Islam does this mean that you have to have a a bachelor degree does it have does it mean you have to have a certain certificate in training does it mean you have to look in a certain way or dress in a certain way no a perfect caller to Islam is one a person who's practicing I could have the best orator coming and talking eloquent words about Islam and the Muslims but he's not practicing he's not doing what he's preaching so would he be a great caller no he would be a great radio station probably but not a great caller to Islam a a person who calls others to Islam he has to be practicing he has to be knowledgeable and he has to be sincere so whatever he does he doesn't do it for the money he doesn't do it for the fame he doesn't do it so that people would shake hands with say mashallah you you did a a very good lecture or I like your speech or programs a great caller to Islam is the one who's sincere knowledgeable and at the same time he looks at himself as a humble and and humilated servant of Allah say that he should be knowledgeable okay then uh any person many many persons are not knowledgeable then he can say that I'm not a knowledgeable person so so I have I Haven to to call to Islam there are many knowledgeable persons who can do or perform my role do you recite do you recite an Ayah of the Quran do you know by heart one Ayah of the Quran yes or more more more the prophet said convey on my behalf even one Ayah so by conveying one Ayah you're a caller to Islam brother you don't have to be uh uh one of the great great great great great Scholars of Islam to be a to be a caller to Islam if you teach the children how to reite fa chapter number one you're a caller to Islam if you teach your old Grand mother how to say the after theah Subhan alhamdulillah 33 times to finish the 100 you are a caller to Islam if you invite your brothers or your friends at school to go and pray with you in the Masjid you're a caller to Islam if you give someone a leaflet or a booklet or a cassette all of these things are considered to be call to Islam you don't have to make a lecture or to uh interpret a ver of the Quran or to give a commentary over hundreds of Hadith to be a caller to Islam so it is the must upon each one of us to call to Islam definitely it is a must to call to Islam all within our capability and reach whatever your fa this yes very good well that's all the time we have for today's episode I would like to thank our shik awesome for being with us today and I would like to thank you brother kareim as well and of course thank our studio audience uh but like I said that's all the time we've got for today's show so we hope to see you next time inshah tal until then I'm Omar Dunlap wishing you peace assalam [Music] Al"
