  "title": "Listening to songs of kufr or sitting with someone who mocks Islam makes person kafir? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "CD from Germany he says if a person listens to songs that contain kufur will he be a cfir the answer is no kufur is a belief so if he listens to it and does not believe what's in it he's definitely Comm committing a sinful act but he doesn't leave the fold of Islam until he believes in it now this may cause a problem with verse 140 in chapter 4ah where Allah says that he has revealed in the Quran that whenever you hear that the verses of Allah is being mocked and it's being disbelieved in that you should not sit with them until they speak about something else otherwise you will be with them or among them so does this mean that they are cfir for that if they have the content and they refuse to leave when they're able to leave and they're content with that what what they're saying of Blas Blasphemous things and mock in the verses of Allah than they are this is not like someone listening to a song that may have a word or two about kufur and he's not content with it if he's happy and content not loving the song content with the Blasphemous content of that song he's happy he's content with the contents with the sh with the kufur and yeah he said there's another God oh this this said this that and he's happy with that this is kufur and Allah Knows Best"
