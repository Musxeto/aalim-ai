  "transcript": "yes sir I have this um recently I have this problem like I just observe that I that some things and some situation are getting very worse so for example ambushment of past sins by some people which is not leading to my insecurities in the city I am living presently but have been reassuring myself that it is not what like is given me that matters it is the Improvement in my religion that matters seeking Knowledge from you and learning Arabic language and so on Sir so please I would like to have more to be able to be more focused in the year after rather than this Jun year or what people are doing to me or the haish of my pasts by some people which is not leading to my insecurities in this city so and for and and this is this is too long Hala this is something is not related to questions and answers this is related to a session related to a lecture but in a nutshell everyone on Earth and I've said this 100 times to you is being tested whether by bully or whether by relatives who remind them of their past and their previous sins or whether by neighbors and colleagues who keep on taunting them this is a test from Allah you cannot leave everything and focus on acquiring knowledge in Arabic because you have to make a living and when you don't have people to support you your father is not supporting you and your siblings are demanding things from you it's next to impossible to to devote yourself to such a mission so you have to strike the right balance where you can secure your financial needs and be financially independent to the minimum but at the same time devote some time to acquiring Knowledge Learning Arabic improving yourself and making a lot of Dua and suud that Allah takes care of you and protects you and guide you this is the only way forward Asel"
