  "transcript": "her last question was about the recommended or atiba voluntary prayer that is highly recommended before the her we are ordered to pray for her house she says according to the hanafi madhhab which is the dominant school of thought in Pakistan and Bangladesh we were told to pray for rockets like the whole like a sir but now I come to know that the Sunnah is to pray 2 rakaats offer Salam then pray 2 rakaats so what should I do this is the verdict of the majority that you split them with Salam and this is the safest opinion however sheikh al albani has authenticated the hadith that makes it 4 with one Salam at the end so I personally am inclined to go with the majority why because even if you pray 2 rakaats offer still on tour across offer Salam the Hanafi school the scholars of the Hanafi school would not say you have done wrong and your prayer is invalid but if you do the opposite if you pray for records with one Salam the majority of scholars would say what you have done is wrong and you should not do that"
