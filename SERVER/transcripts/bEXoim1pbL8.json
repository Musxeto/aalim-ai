  "transcript": "man over hey 100 in the Hillenburg alameen wa sallahu wa salamu alikom attendant al-amin maybe you know how many in father and he was like eh my mother the brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and may allah azza accept all our prayers and fasting during the month of ramadan and me alonso Jamaica's steadfast on worshiping him as it pleases him after the month of ramadan this is our 45th lesson of Chuck and we have stopped for about 10 days but hungry learn and we shall resume studying this beautiful book that teaches us in a beautiful way our beautiful religion how to know the flip to understand and comprehend Islamic sharia law you can find this book on WWWE clip net and as usual you can follow our classes on Facebook page the Islamic film today we are about to study a quite an important chapter of FIP which a lot of the Muslims need and asked about and this deals with marriage the rulings of it what governs it what makes it valid or invalid and what follows marriage such as divorce custody allowance etc it and so on so this is quite an important topic that a lot of the Muslim often asked about any sha Allah we will try our level best to explain it and make it easy for Muslims to understand so the Islamic terminology is known as Nika and Nika means a marriage contract and in the Quran wherever this terminology is used it is referring to the marriage contract except in one location it refers to intercourse and the marriage or the contract means for the DECA means a contract that permits an intimate sexual relationship between the man and wife in a legitimate way so all contracts usually have something that they permit a trade contract or a selling contract allows me to utilize the item that I had bought and to use it in means that are allowed for me to do so a leasing contract when I let a house or an apartment it allows me to utilize the benefits of that property so what is the marriage contract all about it's a very thick and strong bond as Allah described in the Quran between a man and a woman which entitles both of them to enjoy one another in an intimate way that it is not possible except through marriage and with it comes a lot of obligations responsibilities and rates such as inheritance for example so one would inherit one another without this marriage contract there won't be such a right among other things now the the usual way of studying such a thing and the norm among the jurors and the scholars is that when we they mention a topic they tell you that this topic was based upon the Quran the Sunnah the consensus of scholars and logic this is the usual so when ever they would like to for example talk about prayers so they they say the prayers were mentioned in the Quran Allah says so-and-so and in the authentic hadith a determiner may Allah be pleased with and the Prophet said assume that Islam was based or built on five pillars among them is to establish salat and the consensus of scholars as well and logic sometimes there are things that we can justify through logic and sometimes we can't but these are the trend this is the norm that jurors use when they speak about such issues and marriage is not anything different than that so in the Quran the marriage was mentioned and Allah says in the Quran then marry those that please you of other women two or three or four but if you fear that you will not be just then marry only one and almost it also says marry the single from among you as well as such of your male and female slaves are as our virtuous so allah azza jealous in crete is encouraging the muslims to get married if they're single and even if they have slaves women are men they should also get them married because this is a natural human treat that men and women as human beings they need to fulfill their sexual desires in a halal way the Prophet also mentioned this allah√≠s alot rosula in a very famous hadith when he said adding his salat wa salam young men whoever of you can afford marriage should get married so this is an instruction from the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam he then goes to say it helps you lower your gaze and maintain your chastity and these are the benefits of marriage those of you who cannot afford it may resort to voluntary fasting for fasting serves as protection from sin so the hadith is crystal clear and also the Prophet said in another hadith Allah has thought was Salam marry a woman who is loving and can give you children I shall be taking pride in your numbers on the day of judgment so this is one of the reasons why marriage is recommended so that people would have offspring which would allow the Prophet Allah so to salam on the day of judgment to boast other messengers of the number of followers he has and we sha Allah would be the vast majority of the population on in paradise with the grace of allah azza wajal as for the consensus all Muslim scholars agree that marriage is lawful and that it is a part of the religion which Allah has encouraged us to follow and pursue now the author of the book compiled a number of reasons that are logical that proves that marriage is lawful so through logic you can tell and this does not only restrict to the Muslims but even the non-muslims would agree with that for example marriage maintains one's chastity so people who do not have a wife they are usually usually susceptible to the whispers of Shaitaan encouraging them to do hard things to fall into Haram relationships and this not necessarily taking place immediately rather the steps of Shaitaan are well known so a photograph a video clip a song that softens his heart to sin feelings of depression and loneliness having a strong sexual drive encouraging the person to mix with the opposite gender to chitchat to flex his ability to be charming or to be flirty and likewise with women this is how Shaitaan works so by getting married you would have deprived Shaitaan from a main source of sin because a bachelor a person who's unmarried is more inclined to sin by 80% than a married person because the mattad person is usually satisfied maybe there is this 20% evil in him that encourages him to look for something else but this usually fades away with a number of factors such as feeling a la social the environment the society the fear of being exposed and due to the fact that he has something halal within his reach that would save him from Hellfire number 2 the establishment of congenial relationship between man and wife that gives them both comfort and a settled home and this is mentioned clearly in the Quran Allah mentions that among his signs that he had created from our own selves meaning from Adam as we know that hawa or Eve was created from Adam's rib so whenever you see that women are created from men this is not referring to all women created from us rather it is referring to Eve or hawa being created from the rib of Adam so Allah says that among his science that he created from our own self spouses so that we would be inclined to we would have tranquility towards them and he made among them affection and compassion and mercy so this is indeed one of the blessings of Allah upon mankind life is lowly as it is and without a spouse it is a prison cell once a person is married as in the authentic hadith he has fulfilled half of his email he should fear Allah in the second half so it is a fulfillment of religion to be married and you would have satisfaction if not all the time the majority of the time and don't always be pessimistic saying that oh I've seen so many married couple having fights and having this thought this is all nonsense the vast majority of married couple are happy look at your parents look at your uncles and aunts look at your siblings look at your neighbors rarely you will find someone complaining or divorcing or having a fight as the norm is that people live together and cope with one another number three maintaining pull a proper lineage between parents and offspring and close relationships with relatives and in-laws and indeed Allah mentioned in surah al-hajj alot that Allah has made us from a man and a woman from a male and a female and he made us nations and tribes so that we would know one another marriage is one of the means of having in-laws which is a great benefit especially to those who are married and know that their in-laws become means of support for him and this is the norm unlike those who do not protect their lineage like so many celebrities in the non-muslim world where they have three or four children from their partner without ever being properly married and they claim that they are their children but we don't know only the mother can said that this is my child because she gives she gave birth to it but who was the father it could have been him could have been someone else because there is no limitation to the amount of cheating they can do and they're not men and wife so one day he's mad with her he leaves the house for a week no strings attached he does whatever he wants to do and she thinks well he's not my husband I can do whatever I want to do and so Paulo they become like animals and this is where they have the terminology a one-night stand and then after a week they get back together and they live together nine months later she has a child is it his no one knows but who cares they don't have any respect or regard to religion this is why they are living in fornication not feeling Allah not caring about their children Islam is a beautiful religion that prevents all of such nonsense now before the continuity of the human race and the steady increase of the Muslim population so that they may advocate the divine faith and this is a well-known fact that alhamdulillah marriage is means of continuation of the human race we've seen many countries in Europe suffering because they don't have any children and the rate of youth is far far less than the rate of the elders so it's becoming nations of the elders and this is why they're now opening the door for immigration they need those people from the third-world countries whom they used to fight their coat and coat occupation of their lands in the past years now they are urging them to come so that they can maintain the power of their countries or let us say rebuild what's need to be rebuilding we've seen how many European countries open the doors for the Syrian refugees who cross the Mediterranean not because they love humanity or the Syrians but because their population is becoming less and less and all that might power industry economy would go down the drain if you don't have workers to execute your strategies and plans and finally safeguarding morality so that people do not sink into adulterous relationships and by far this is one of the greatest benefits of marriage and we see how people tend to sink down the drain when it comes to morality moralities when it comes to ethics and moral conduct in the United States it is very normal to find a 13 old girl a 13 old girl pregnant and the boyfriend it does not want anything to do with it they're having illicit relationships from a very early age because there is no marriage Constitution when you tell the boy or the girl to only marry after reaching 18 this is a deficiency in human intellect because such couple reach puberty way earlier than that and with the media the movies the music the billboards the nudity that you see in front of you you can't expect people to not fall into sin the only Escape is the marriage the Constitution of marriage you get them married and you will find that the crime rate that the depression rate that birth out of wedlock and all of these hideous things have diminished if not evaporated into thin air but this is what happens when you go against an out of the Sharia of Allah so the law of Allah when you act according to human laws and regulations this is the natural resort so how to get married let's get to the serious stuff I'm interested in marrying a woman how would I go about doing it the most famous way of doing it in other countries is dating so this is what happens in the modernized world you see a girl you like her she might be in your school in your college she might be a co-worker she might be working in a shop and you start to flirt and you start to make a pass it's like fishing nine out of ten times the fish will get the bait and run away leaving you without anything but there's this one time that it will catch the bait and the hook so this is what's happening in non-muslim countries and unfortunately also in some Muslim countries where Muslims are not real Muslims but only Muslims buy an ID card in Islam free mixing is prohibited looking at a girl without lowering your gaze is prohibited chit chatting is prohibited segregation is mandatory so the means of falling into sin are very limited if any at all and therefore chastity is preserved and usually the normal way of getting in contact to establish a marriage would be the traditional way which a lot of the societies looked down upon traditional way why they want to allow themselves and their friends and brothers the option of getting a test drive and to humilate a woman and to use her and dump her this is why they don't like the traditional way this is why they promote mixing and free mixing and mingling in schools and universities and in office offices and workplace it why because this is what shaitaan wants and people are often blinded by the light they don't see it in others right in front of them and usually they don't see it when it's related to them so I get so many questions chef can I have a friend from the opposite gender nothing sexual but we chitchat we talk sometimes we hold hands and we like one another so is that permissible someone goes the extra mile and says that she comes in and this happens a lot in countries like Africa and I get questions from there a girl comes to my home she cleans and she cooks for me and we spend nights together we're not married and some of them say we're not even interested in getting married but this relationship is convenient for both of us subhanAllah what religion is this so they are interested in a test drive I met or I had a friend 20 years ago his Christian and we used to work out in the gym so I used to give him dower try to a little bit by bit and once I asked him I said brick what are you gonna get married and he's like in his mid 30s yeah almost he said no stiller too early for me I'm still looking for the right woman this is vanilla and you haven't find that fire you have found her yet said no so I said okay how many women did you look into so if I were to say where's your black book we have all the names and dates and he laughed and he said there's so many of them I don't know so I said and do you think after trying all these women that you will ever find a woman that would satisfy you this is impossible therefore Islam puts us on a leash it controls our desires especially when they are wild it governs our desires it is not like other religions that prevent you from even desiring and prohibits something that is natural such as marriage and tells you know you want to become pure you must become celibate and not get married at all it's not it's not like that and it's also not like being a dog that Wiggles his tails running from one place to the other in some sense that you get the chance to get married so as a Muslim there are a number of things that you should follow one of them is engagement so what is engagement in other religions engagement is come of lodging zina so if a person is engaged to a woman he can be engaged to her for six seven years they go out they live together they sleep together and everyone knows that they're engaged this can go for years this can go for a week or two and then they broke their engagement now this is zina this is not Islamic engagement l thetaba or the proper engagement is to propose to the family you're interested in getting married now I know how people think just if I don't know the girl how can I propose to her knowing her through dating is Hallam knowing her through a couple of weeks of chit chatting on the phone is haram because we have to protect both men and women from temptations of Shaitaan so the proper way the traditional way is that your sister comes to you and says listen if you're interested in getting married I have a friend or I know a cousin or there is this girl I saw that fits your qualifications and fits your desires he says I don't like tall women I wanted to be four eight I don't like women with blond hair or I want a woman with a blonde hair I don't want her to be a PhD holder The Bachelor degree would do I want this and I want that she has to love the things that I love I don't like her to be so open without wearing any job mixing with her cousins and at the same time I don't want her to be this or that so you give your specifications your sister your mother your aunt comes one of the Omaha says we found a girl and they tell her tell you about her you like what you hear now you want to ask so you ask around and you get positive vibes for hamdulillah you go and propose usually in so many countries they first dispatched the mother and the sister so I would send my mother and sister to meet the girl and her parent and and her mother and they go and they meet and they see first hand they asked they chitchat for an hour to maybe have a small meal they get to know their first impression of about the girl they come back and tell me well as she said this she said that the way she laughs is she's so kind she is so hospitable generalize etc and this adds to your liking and they have no problem in you proposing so you get you'll give together and you go to meet her father and father meets you sits with you interviews you asks you asks around your work place your neighborhood you message it and everything is positive he designates a certain day you go and you meet him again but this time the girl comes into the interview and she sits with you and with her father for an hour or two you look at her whether she's wearing the hijab or not but you take a good look at her face at her body at her height of course she's not gonna strip for you she's not gonna wear any makeup and she looks at you and she sees how tall and handsome ugly you are and you guys exchange a dialogue and you talk and you get to get know one another's personality from this first impression after everything is done you ask her everything you wanted to ask she asked you who are the shakes you are listening to so that she could identify your Manhattan and knows Europe either and knows how committed you are to Islam or not at all then you depart in the evening usually the mother takes the okay from you she calls her mother and she says a lot hamdulillah we liked what we had seen and we hope to hear something from you and the girl thinks it over presses Tahara checks it with her parents with her siblings and if she's okay and comfortable with it she gives the green light and the mother calls her your mother saying that the hamdulillah we liked what we seen you guys agree on an engagement date an engagement takes place segregated men with the men women with the women she's not your wife yet so she's a nun mom to you no communication no mixing or seeing one another this is called engagement so when a proposal is accepted number one no other man may make a proposal so now it is official she is engaged to me but she's not my Mohamed not her maja which means that no one else can come and and propose to this girl knowing that I have proposed to her and they have accepted this is totally prohibited the Prophet as a salam prohibited selling over ones transaction me and I met I sold him my pen and he bought it another person comes and says why did you sell it for this much I would have bought it from much higher price so now he's cutting in this is how long likewise if he comes and proposes to the girl's family knowing that I have already proposed they have accepted my proposal so this is totally Harlem the Prophet says a son let no man make a proposal when his brother has made one until the first one has either married the woman or abandoned his proposal so you cannot make a move until I get married then this is an ended issue or they reject my proposal or I reject that number two it is forbidden to make a direct expression of one's desire to a widowed woman so engagement though it is not a contract when a woman is a widow and she's in her waiting period of 4 months and 10 days I cannot propose sure her husband is dead yes but she's mourning him for 4 months and 10 days where she's not allowed to wear any makeup wear anything glamorous in terms of dresses or putting perfume or beautifying yourself an enemy's for this whole 4 months and 10 days so to go it directly proposes totally prohibited allah azzawajal says in the quran you will incur no sin if you give a hint of marriage offered to a widowed woman so hinting is ok directly approaching a window saying that I'm interested in getting married to you the moment you finish her it is totally prohibited so what is meant by hinting it says that for example I hope that Allah facilitates for me a marriage to a good woman this is a hint this is not a direct attempt to propose so hinting to a widow is permissible but if a woman was divorced the first or the second divorce and she is in her at the period which is marked by three monthly cycles so I know that this woman had a fight with her husband he divorced her for the first time and he left the house my mother goes to her and says listen what is your idea period over from this divorce she says after a month and a half so my mom says okay listen if it's over and your husband does not reconcile with you will propose to your parents for my son this is totally prohibited whether it's direct or a hint because throughout the EDA period she is still classified as the wife of that person who divorced her and if any one of them dies he will inherit he or he we she will be inherited by the other one because they are in the idea period and they still the lawful spouse number three we've mentioned so many times and we stated that such an engagement is not a marriage so just because you're engaged does not mean that you can have an engagement party and you put the ring into your future wife's hand or touch her or mix with her in some Muslim countries unfortunately and I've seen this myself a woman is engaged to her fiance for a year they go out together they even go to the movies together and Allah knows when she's 3-4 hours out of the house with her fiance how chaste they will be no one knows if they went to a hotel room or to the movies and after a year the break up the woman is devastated because what had happened had happened the man is just a dog moves to another you know what so Islam protects the society the community the Muslims from any such filth so that everything goes according to Allah plan I think we will stop here and take your questions and we have many of them but we will see what happens in sha allah a harlot says our message it is opened alhamdulillah a week ago but the procedure is to space two meters and I don't feel comfortable praying so and we don't know up to when only Allah knows the situation we'll be back to pray all next to each other am i sinning for praying at home well i harlot this is an issue of great confusion on one hand we know that the medical professionals recommend this and we know that this is trying to save the community from the outbreak of such a vicious virus unfortunately this is not always the case because we see that in malls in shops and restaurants in the soup everywhere else you find that people are not committed to that social distancing as they call it but only in the messages Subhan Allah and in the beginning I kept on repeating that as long as there are no fat West's from the unified a unified fatwa from the major scholars then this is an issue of dispute I personally don't like this I tried it for one day and found that with the mask and with the meters apart from the worshipers and with the obligation of getting your own prayer mat and not staying after the salat except for five minutes in the Masjid I found that this to me was very irritating even with the mask I'm unable to recite silently because something I'm not used to it so I can't deal and those who are comfortable in going to the Masjid and find that the pros are far greater than the cons and attending the prayer in the Masjid they may do so and they have great scholars who approve such a format in prayer such as a chef's a free turkey a flan abdulkareem aware also of anub arak and others those who do not feel good about it and they are too distracted I'm not talking about people who are afraid of getting this providers I'm talking about people who believe that this is an innovation this is not how it should be done especially that the risk is not that serious it's not a pandemic such as the plague or something that is deadly like I think they call it smallpox is it I don't know something that was eradicated a long ago but still has influence and it's it's fatal it guilt this is not like that so this is up to you and Allah knows best a boon or Hannah during salat lassitude either fault or Sunnah is it permissible to make duaa institute in my own language after saying subhana subhanaka rabbee and Allah subhanAllah banana / Hamdi please advise that's a yes Institute whether it is the last jute or the first tree dude it doesn't make any difference because there is no preference to the last tribute it's the same like any other station so if you do throughout the whole prayer whether Ferguson throughout the whole suits whether the first of the last you make your own door this is permissible providing you do not know how to say it in Arabic so for example if I want to say or Allah cure my ill patients allahumma stream al banna I don't have to say it in Arabic so I have to say it in Arabic but if I were to ask Allah to guide my wife to becoming a full hijab' practising woman and I don't know how to say that in my in Arabic so there's no problem saying it in English at all and Allah knows best his second question a boon or Hannah upon completing reading the Quran is there a particular standard or there is not a standard prescribed or after reciting the Quran so you don't say summa kalla who are they and you don't supplicate long to us you just simply finish reciting it and move on lemon Barrow says it's not permissible to pray in a Masjid where there's a grave please could you tell us how our beloved prophets grave solve the law a solemn king part of the message the we this incident took place way after the four righteous colors it took place on the year of I think 88 Hitler which is about nine decades after Hydra and it was introduced to the Masjid by the caliph at the time Al Waleed in Abdul Malik and we know that he wanted to expand the Masjid so he instructed the Emir of medina at the time surprisingly was roma divina abdul aziz the great caliph to become a caliphate iran he instructed him to demolish the houses of the wives of the Prophet Aslam and to expand the Masjid further south and Umar who was a scholar himself was shocked so he summoned all the tabi rain and the scholars of Medina and he asked him about the recommendation and all of them unanimous anonymously said no this is not permissible Salaam and the Prophet is awesome prohibited from doing this because this is the doing of the Jews and the Christians and he cursed the Jews and the Christians for taking the graves of their prophets and messengers as places of worship and he said that then the most evil of people on earth so Rama wrote back to Al Waleed Nidal Malik telling him that this is not possible and this is not permissible and all the scholars of Islam said so only to be surprised that will it sent him a direct instruction and order do as I say Rama was helpless he could not do anything but execute the instruction of the halifa and the house of Aisha was included in the machine why do I emphasize the house of a nation because the Prophet Alice of Sam was buried in Isis house so for the for about 70 plus years the Masjid was separated from the house of Aisha which had the grave of the Prophet as a son and then the gave of Abu Bakr and then the grave of Rama all together in the house of Aisha and the Masjid was something else therefore when they expanded the Masjid they included the house not the graves so the graves were never intended they just wanted to include the house not thinking of the consequences and after that no one dared to demolish the area of the Masjid and have the house outside as it used to be why because every ruler who came afterwards was afraid was afraid because they knew that any such act would provoke the ignorant Muslims worldwide and it would have negative and bad consequences in Islam we judge things by their consequences and this is why it was never done even the Prophet as some had done something similar to that when he sallallahu alehiwassallaam was talking to mother Aisha telling her had it not been your people we're so close just recently Idol worshipers had it not been for this fact I would have demolished the Kaaba and I would have rebuilt it on the foundations of Ibraheem because the Kaaba at the moment is not built on the foundations of Ibraheem and this might be a surprise to some of you you see the cab at the black structure next to it there's something like an arc arc maybe is not the right word an arch and this is called a zero is married people go around the Kaaba and this arch though there's an opening inside nobody goes from inside because this is part of the Kaaba and when the camera was demolished due to some floods and the Arabs tried to rebuild it they got short of funds so they built only this structure leaving out that area so the Prophet said as I said to mother I had not your people been so recent to a word I drink worshipping idols I would have demolished the Kaaba rebuilt it on the foundations of the brahim and had two doors to it one for people to enter from and the other for people to exit from why didn't the Prophet do this is Islam because he feared that Shaitaan would manipulate people's heads and get them to leave Islam and go back to idle worshipping decades later I'm the liveness Zubair may Allah be pleased with a man with his father took rule of Mecca Medina and he doesn't in total so he's by the way the son of a sovereign now WA one of the ten heaven bound his mother is a small bit and Ibaka so you know how close he is to the prophetess Sam and to the Muslims when he drained over Mecca he demolished the camera and rebuilt it as the Prophet wanted to do that that is awesome and they remained having it like this for some time until he was killed may Allah be pleased with him and then had judged the beliefs of Safavieh and when Omega demolished the Kaaba once again and they built it as it used to be which is as it is today few years later one of the caliphs wanted to be built it as of the wish of the Prophet as them and as as the lamas read did but I think it was Anna Magnani cinematic or someone else who said please don't so he said why wasn't this the wish of the Prophet as a cell and this scholar said yes it was but I'm afraid that people would take camber as a form of a game they demolish it when they want and they rebuild it when ever they want so every time a new king or a new Haditha comes he does what the opposite the opposite took of what the his predecessor had had done and this is the grading of the camera so it was left till date so this is why we have the grave of the Prophet of Sam included in the boundaries of the Masjid because it wasn't the message then and the grave of the Prophet s term was not a particular or an individual grave it was buried or he was buried early so Sam in his house the house of Ayesha analogical knows best so tazreen says since the condition for a trade being this the person being an adult what about children buying from stores this is an issue of dispute among scholars the vast majority say that it is prohibited for children to buy and sell and some of them say if the child is rational and knows then this is permissible providing his guardian allows it so if I tell my son take five reals and go buy some bread for me this is permissible because I authorized them other scholars said what how would the seller know that this child was authorized so again it's an issue of confusion however scholars say that the majority of them say that as long as what is being purchased is negligible like candies like soft drink like some bread then there is no problem in doing that but to fill up a shopping cart with groceries of 200 or 300 dollars no this is not permissible at all jameelah says if you live in the West is it to take a mortgage cause it's only way to buy your own place also people say it's okay to have mortgage if you live in the house and it's the only one mortgage is a RIBA based loan it is an interest-based loan so actually they are lending you an X amount of money where you are you are obliged to pay them eczema a Y amount of interest Reba this is totally prohibited now people try to justify it by saying that this is a non-muslim country so you are actually dealing with Catherine and this is not a legitimate justification it's like saying Oh going on a date with a Catholic woman is okay because she's covered so even if we have intimacy that's okay no it's not okay it's a major sin it's Xena and Reba is the same thing whether the person you're borrowing or lending is a believer or a non-believer it doesn't make any difference at all transgression is there you can easily rent oh yes chef but this would be wasting a lot of money when we pay rent after 20 years we could have bought the house it's true but you didn't have the money yeah so we bought it through mortgage so in order to justify buying in Reba is that you don't want to pay rent for 20 years this is not logical at the sight of Allah it is best for you to pay rent for the rest of your life rather than to pay one penny in daiba renting is holid Reba is totally prohibited in Islam and Allah knows best the Cabal Ahmed says can we pray Allah holding the Koran on hand and reciting the surah well the scholars say that this is permissible in voluntary prayers so if you hold the Koran in Holloway in 200 and you read from it there's no problem in that at all but when it comes to follow prayer the five daily prayers they prevent this and they say that it includes movement that is uncalled for why would I eat it from the Mossad I can read any short surah from my own head and that would be more than sufficient and Allah Allah knows best Fatih says if a woman has irregular periods must she maintained this - a man must she mentioned this to a man who's proposing to marry her dances yes scholars say that any defect any thing that is negative in a potential spouse that may repel or cause the resentment of the spouse to the other one must be revealed so sometimes I may have an issue which is not that repelling I have a birthmark on my hand do I have to tell people about it no I don't have to because this is not something that would cause a potential spouse to resent but if a person has an odor in his mouth that is so repulsive so bad but he tries to hide it and it's chronic if you're proposing it is mandatory upon you to disclose this because most people would not sit next to you let alone get married to you so this is something you have to say disclose if a girl had I don't know what's called a name is dice up dice up to me maybe she cannot bear children nobody knows when a potential shooter proposes her guardian must tell him that there's no possibility of her bearing children likewise if a girl has a regular period known as its Tehama so this is continuous bleeding though she can pray and fast and he may have intimacy with the vast majority of men would not like this so this would be a sort of cheating not telling him so her guardian has to tell him this providing that this is chronic and uncurable but if it is something that is normal all doctors say that if you take this medication it will stop in like a couple of months so it's a normal thing that can be treated in this case there is no need to tell him because by the time the marriage takes place they would have been cured banila he as would you so this is all the time we have until we meet you next Thursday inshallah I'll leave you for many laughs stay safe well Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
