  "transcript": "says in my country a mobile phone provider offers to their clients such a service when you have no money on your phone you can borrow the money from the provider and the next time you refill a phone balance they will automatically charge this money from you but they will also add some extra money for this service for example if you borrow $5 they will charge you six for providing this service is this RIBA or is it just paying for the service they provide now first of all RIBA is a major sin and it is in essence borrowing money and paying it back with interest and there is or there are two types of riba ribble fuddle which deals in the same thing but something more than one the other and riba and nasiha which deals with time so it's time bound and there is also Reba Hart which is dealing with the interest one gets on borrowing something and it's different than selling and buying because when you sell a commodity you actually benefit and those who make it benefit and the one who buys it benefits as well while in RIBA it is money versus money and this is Haram and there are six types of things that the Prophet told us the artery balance auto salon and they are divided into two categories things to do with gold and silver silver and whatever falls under them such as a banknotes dollars euros reals and things that deal with eatable items that can be weighed or can be measured by signs and these are wheat barley dates and salt so these are the six types that the Prophet array so sunset now I'm not going to get into details of RIBA you can ya inshallah get more information on thank you a dot info and you can get more information from our series on um the telecom inshallah but the questioner put his question in a way or her question I shall put a question in a way that might mislead someone to saying ah they are lending you five dollars and then they're charging six dollars this is Reba this is correct if this is what's happening if they're lending you five dollars and getting six in return this is totally prohibited however what the company is doing is totally not related to lending they are selling you a service so your contract with them me that tells or says or states that they charge for every minute ten cents this is the norm but when you are out of balance and you don't have money and you need to make phone calls and you need to buy the service from them so they're selling it to you instead of ten cents they are selling selling it to you for 15 cents and they're not taking their money now they're taking it later on when you refill or recharge your balance so this is totally permissible insha'Allah who as they are"
