  "title": "Is it compulsory to have a Sutra in front of you while praying alone? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "now Satan says can you please illustrate the usage of Sutra for a person who prays at home where he or she is alone is it mr. hub or wajib to use Sutra when one knows nobody will come in front of him in his salat and what must be the length of Sutra the majority of scholars say that Sutra is recommended but not mandatory Sutra is a foot high object or more that you pray in the direction so that it would be a visor or a screen between your prayer and those who pass beyond it so it's a mark in front of you telling everybody else that I'm praying and this is my zone this is my privacy you should not invade that area so whatever someone wants to come they come from beyond it not between me and it and if someone wanted to come between me and it while praying I have to prevent them stop them if they insist to come I may push them and fight them as in the hadith of say abou sorry the houdry and the Prophet told us to fight them because the one who is insisting to pass between my standing position and my Sutra is a Shaitaan he's a devil so this is something serious the Prophet said Alice loves lamp if the passerby between a man praying and his Sutra we're to know the gravity of his sin he would have stood there for forty without crossing so they asked a beret forty what forty hours forty days forty years and he would not comment he said just fourteen meaning that this is a serious thing now having said that the majority commented the majority of scholars commented in the hadith of the Prophet Alice a lot o Sam when one of you is to pray he should pray to a sutra that this is a recommendation because the Prophet had offered prayer in Mecca when the people were doing powerf without having a visor in front of him or a screen or a citta and therefore if you pray in the masjid your prayer is valid without a sutra and definitely if you pray home when there is no one in your home and you don't fear anyone crossing in front of you you can also pray not to a sutra but having a sutra in front of you is highly recommended not just only to notify people not to cross in front of you but also due to the fact that it increases the amount of submissiveness and kosher in your salat when you have something that limits your eyesight from being distracted because it's in front of you and you keep on looking at your spot of prostration without being distracted while if you don't have something in front of you you may gaze here and there then definitely it is better to have to have this in front of you where you want to pray you"
