  "transcript": "question is what is the view of they mean regarding the excuse of ignorance this is a big issue of dispute and may Allah have mercy on his soul is one of the late contemporary Scholars of the Great Scholars of all and his writings and his ideas and the way he explained things befits only an excellent teacher which he was may Allah have mercy on his soul he explains that ignorance is a legitimate excuse and if it was not an excuse Allah would not have sent The Messengers this is the purpose of sending the messengers to uplift this ignorance and to educate people and to make them know and he says there is no difference between ignorance in related materials to Akida or to practical issues so whether it's in Akita or in fact it's the same thing as long as a person is ignorant then he is Exempted and excused and there is no difference in matters or issues that are apparent to some but hidden from others so when Scholars say that this is also apparent no whoever does this even if he's ignorant he's a cafe as long as the ignorance is there this is a legitimate excuse who knows whether this person is ignorant or not Allah so he's the one who judges him in this Dunya we judge with what we see but it's Allah azzawajal who judges people on the day of judgment now to nullify a person's Islam this can be done by conviction by action by rhetoric and in all these things we have no problem in saying that this is an act or a statement or a belief of kuffer the problem is when you want to implement this ruling on a specific individual this is where we have to draw the line and say wait a minute are the conditions fulfilled are there any obstacles that prevent us from labeling this individual as a cafe if yes then we have to judge accordingly because the Hadith which is in the sahih of a man who ordered his children to criminate cremate him after his death and then spreading and throwing his ashes on the top of the hills and the bottom of the valleys and the over the oceans and justifying this by saying for if Allah was able to resurrect me he would have tormented me severely this is a statement of kufur if you think that Allah is unable to do that so the prophet tells us that Allah ordered the hills and the valleys and the oceans to gather this man's remains and he stood in front of him and Allah asked him oh my servant why have you done what you've done and he said because I was afraid of you oh Allah so this man was ignorant and Allah said I have forgiven your sins if he was a mushrik if he was a kafir Allah would not have forgiven him we know that for a rule and in fact but Allah excused him and pardoned him because of his of his ignorance or of his misinterpretation and understanding of the rulings or because of his excessive fear and this is in the hands of Allah so this is what sheikhim thinks among other things that Allah Knows Best"
