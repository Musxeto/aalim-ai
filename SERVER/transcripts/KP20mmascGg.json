  "transcript": "Villa alemana raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen soul allah wa sallim wa barik arab deceiver Rasul al-amin nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in nevado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we are still discussing the hadith and the concept of the prostration of salu the prostration of forgetfulness and this is part of the things that we must master and learn because this happens in our daily lives so many times and usually one of the funny things that I usually use is this when someone starts to speak to me about what is permitted and what's not permitted in Islam and about that this is barbaric or this is so and so among among the Muslims so I see a fee do you know when to prostrate before Salaam or after Salaam he says No subhanAllah you don't have the basics of knowledge and you're talking about things and issues if it were on the time of remark he would have collected may Allah be pleased with him those who have attended budget battle to consult them and you're just out of the tip of your head you say it's halal is Haram no this is not permissible hadeeth number 105 Abdullah even abou Hina reported knows you're low on the messenger of allah so allah wa sallim break zohar prayer and that got up in the first two raka and did not sit and the people stood up along with him when he finished the prayer and we expected him to pronounce the Salam he said Allahu Akbar while sitting and made two prostrations before salon and then pronounce the final salaam okay very well the hadith of the love Mahina is in regard to an incident where the Prophet our son did not sit for the first shot and they all followed the prophet alayhi salatu salam he offered the forgetfulness prostration before salam so now we have this issue and we have that and as I stated for we have hadith of abu saeed al houdry may allah be pleased with him where the Prophet says if some of you pray and is unable to determine what he prayed he should cast away the doubt and follow what is certain and then prostrate for forgetfulness after the Salam so adding to that the hadith of Abdullah ibn Masud when the Prophet prayed five records offered the prostration of forgetfulness after Salam from these hadith the scholars have came up with when to pray or to offer to Judah who before Salam and went to offer them after Salam if you master these if you know them and understand them you will find it very easy inshallah to know when to do that remember we said that the prostration of Shahu of forgetfulness is done either if you subtract you miss something or you add or you are in doubt and when you are in doubt this is divided into two parts a doubt that you're completely blinded I do not know if it's two or three like I said afraid don't you have a gut feeling well I'm not at all in me I'm completely blinded I don't know I don't remember nothing that reminds you nothing so this is one section of doubt the other section is when my doubt has a hint I don't know if I prayed two or three most likely it's two or most likely it's three I don't know if I prostrate it the second prostration in the first rocker most likely I did most likely I didn't so this is a form of doubt that has determining factors the first one is a doubt that has no determining factors at all and I'm blinded so now we have four cases two of them we prostrate before Salah and two of them we prostrate after Salah so let us look at prostration before Salaam scholars say if you forgot to pray something that is mandatory then this is a deduction you took something out of prayer which means that you must offer the prostration of forgetfulness before Salaam example please the hadith of Abdullah heaven behind for laka prayers the Prophet forgot a mandatory act in prayer which is the first shot instead of sitting for the jihad he stood up to the third record subhanAllah subhanAllah he did not go back and before concluding his prayer with Salam after to jihad he offered to sujood of sehun can you give us other examples I'll give you other examples a person bout did not say to partner BRD just somehow a lot of hammer hit his forehead I forgot to say some hand regarding what to do do I go back you can't because you move to other following pillar how do you leave a pillar to go back to something that's mandatory what you do Hollis is gone you have to prostrate to prostration before Salam so this is number one what is it when you leave out something that is mandatory number two of the section of praying or offering through the cell before Salam is when I am in complete blindness as in the hadith of Abu Zubaydah Qadri I do not know whether I prayed two or three in this case the Prophet tells you at a his salat WA Salam throw out the doubt now what is the doubt I pray 2 rakaats my problem is with the second record with the third Torah cos are certain I'm sure that a pray 2 rakaats my problems were the third what should I do with this doubt cast it away consider yourself did not pray and pray to maracas and offer prostration of Sahu before Salam can you give us another example I'll give you another example I am in my suit after I said Allahu Akbar was this my first or my second I'm no I have no idea at all I told I don't know I'm lost what should I do cast the doubt what is the doubt is this my first or second definitely first is certain second is doubt cast it out and offers to Judah and offer prostration of forgetfulness before syrup soda these are the two cases when I leave something that I cannot go back to man the three acts and when I am in doubt and I cannot determine whether this doubt is probable or not no it's doubt we move on to the third and fourth case where we offer to you the Sahu after the first one which is the further the first case is when I add to my prayer sure what do you mean add to your prayer a key in for prayers laka how many times I make record for how many times I make sujood eight how many times I make salaam once right so Americans last time I come to lunch once if I add anything to the prayer which you know now this means that I have to offer frustration after the jihad example share for rock as I stood up for the 15 and I finished my fifth and I sit sad for the tashahud then I remembered what to do I don't have any razor I can't raise it then I offer Salaam offer to prostration of forgetfulness and offer Salaam once again another example shake I'll give you another example for free the hadith of Abu Hurairah the height of Dooley attained the Prophet that Islam frustrated after the serum why why do you think anybody has an answer you don't have an answer I'll tell you apparently the hadith the Prophet should have prostrated before Salam why because he left two rakahs but actually at the conclusion you will find that the Prophet prayed the four workers when he was reminded yet he added a Salam in the first two Rakas and this is what the error was after he finished the second Locker he thought that he may finish the ceremony come to LA stomach and went when they told him he came down prayed the two Rakas offered to jihad offer Salam what did he add the first two salams and that is why he must offer the frustration of forgetfulness after the Salam but share what happens if I leave and drop a pillar while I'm praying and I remember during my prayer I'll give you an example I prayed the first record bowed lifted my head made one sister and stood up for the second record finished the third drucker finished the fourth raka in the fourth record I said oops the first raha there is one search the left what to do the most authentic opinion without going into details with you they would consider that because I have passed the location of the second prostration the first Raqqa is be void and my second and third would be my first and second and the third Rock I'm in which is the fourth now would be considered my third so I pray one raka offered to Shahada Salam prostrate and offer Salam again confusing yes it is we have a break and I'll inshallah go through it once again after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back to the confusion of SuJu the south no confusion at all the first two parts is before Salam we've mentioned if you subtract something and you cannot go back to it like the mandatory things you cannot go back to it Haris is done or you are in confusion blind confusion blind doubt you do not know whether you did or you did not you cast the doubt away the third case which is after the Salam is when you add something and we said that whenever you add something to the prayer that is not considered to be from it you have to prostrate after Salam as in the case if someone offers Salam after the first record or second raka or third raka like a prayer is not concluded so he has to finish his prayer and offer the prostration of forgetfulness after the Salam why because he added to it if a person prostrates for the third time in the first record and then this is an extra what should I do continue your prayer offered the salute of prostration after the surrender now I left something in the first raka one suit I only offered once to Jude the second one I didn't I stood up immediately scholars say if I remember before reaching the second stitute of the second record the following raka I should immediately sit down I'll give an example I made once enjoyed I stood up for the second raka while in the second raka I remember oops oopsy-daisy I made a mistake what to do immediately I fall on my knees for the first sitting between the two frustrations because this is something I left right after the first day's prostration I stood up which means that I left sitting between the prostrations the second prostration so when I remembered in the second raka I immediately went to it and I continued my prayer normally if I did not remember except after finishing the second record with two sujood in it scholars say the first one is void and I consider the one that I completed which is the second to be my first and I continue praying like this example a man forgot to prostrate the second prostration in the first raka and only remembered before Salaam what to do what do you think what to do yes microphone so the is for Sarika is invalid and he has to complete that recurrent performance at this who because he has before the sleep meaning that he has to go and stand up and pray one more raka the man prayed for rock eyes and he's in the tesha hot position but he remembered where in his jihad position that the second frustration of the first raka was not performed so what to do now his first is invalid it's void so the second third and fourth are his first three he's in that the Shahada position we tell him stand up pray the force offer tisha hood / Salam offer to prostration of forgetfulness and offer Salam again understood inshallah no confusion okay we come to the fourth category which is if I am in doubt but I have a hint I have things to help me determine so I am in my third your law is this the second or third no most likely it is the third how do you know because I usually give frustration in the second raka and I say oh Allah pay off my debts for example and I remember saying this so this means that this is my third record I have a hint in this case the scholars say you have to work on your hint and complete your prayer as you have been able to determine and offer the sujood after the Salam so the doubt here I am able to find the hint the doubt in case number two I'm blinded I have no hint at all I don't know Allah two or three I have no idea at all in this case I cast a doubt here no I work with what is mostly most likely to have happen these are the four types of sujood or the two types of Sushil but the four cases where you divide things all together now there are a lot and a lot and a lot of questions and therefore I'll open the floor for questions regarding through the say who only yes what if you are behind the Imam and the Imam does not makes a mistake but I feel that I have missed one such that for example I understand it I missed one such - yeah so now what should I do should I do the step of Imam or should I make them such this first of all it is almost impossible for you to lose a sister if you're praying with the Imam but I will hypothetically say what happens if I forgot a man there did a thing I did not say subhanAllah BL Allah or I added in the and this happens a lot and when the people in the prostration position and the Imam says Allahu Akbar in the second raka a lot of people stand to the thinking that is the third when everybody else is sitting so they are standing and then they open their eyes whoops everybody is sitting they come down they manage something to pray scholars say that you are one of two if you've started the prayer with the Imam meaning that you don't have to complete after Salam you've played the foe records with the Imam fully then whatever mistakes you do your prayer is valid with the exception of missing al-fatiha in one of the lockers because this means that a pillar is gone you have to complete it after the Salah but if you missed one or two or more records and you made a mistake you have to rectify this mistake by offering to do the Sahu not only that imagine that if I came in in the third raka and the Imam had done a mistake before and after he offered Salaam I cannot offer Salaam I have to stand up so I stand up and he says Allah ho Akbar and prostrate I continue my prayer it's not my business I continue my prayer but after I conclude my prayer and offer Salah my offer to sujood I can make a mistake but scholars say because I must follow my Imam so I hope this answers your question Sheikh question is that if I do not take into consideration these classifications that which have just done and I do it either before the Salam or after the Salam is it valid some scholars say that whenever you do it it's valid others like shaker slamming taymiyah say community mean they all say that the Prophet Ison did not do it before and after just for the heck of it and he felt like doing it before and then he did it after just he didn't have anything best better to do a stock for Allah Allah so definitely whatever the Prophet did was for a purpose for a legitimate reason and that is why we have to pray like he prayed and this classification was put to you by shakiness a min before him jettison taymiyah and all the great scholars of Islam and Mohammed before stating that before and after has a legitimate reason however the majority of scholars say if you do it before Salam it's valid yes are you shake what if I say Allah Akbar twice in the ring and the second question is if I am praying towards not towards the Qibla and then I realized after the Salah that that is not the Qibla supposing this is the direction of the Qibla what do I do in that case regarding saying Allahu Akbar twice this is an increase you think you have increased something so you have to offer salutation Salaam and then offer your forgetfulness prostration regarding the diversion of the Qibla if it is within 30 degrees this is applicable if the table is there and I pray this way it's okay if I pray this way it's okay but if I pray 90 degrees or more or to the back then I would have to check why did I do this if it was done completely by mistake it's different than if it was done due to the fact that I was lazy to ask a lot of the Muslims go and praying in different countries lazy they don't go ask the reception where is the East they don't ask the Islamic Center where is the Qibla they just say yeah this looks like a good direction and they pray to it this is wrong so he has to pray the prayer again yes brother some people offered us to do this a who just before that the route in the attire with Salam on right only is that varied or not I'm talking of Humphrey school of thought I don't know about this I know that the position to offer SuJu the cell is after at the Hyatt and after a Salah Islah Brahimi just before Salam and we do not call it do route because dude is not an Arabic word its salat o to childhood a solid Navy are in salat to syrup so you offer it after you finish all of this before Salam so you offer it and then you offer I said I am twice to the right and to the left if the imam falters and he remembers then you should go back to this route after standing up but the muscle you are in the second floor the third floor how do they control it the Imam has changed the position they know by observing in front of them no but the floor is totally different the floor is totally different well this is their problem the scholars say that it is essential that those rain elsewhere are able to see the rows in front of them or to see the rows who are able to see the Imam so that the prayer would be connected and they would be in congregation and if they are in a different row and they do not know what the mm is doing they will know after maybe one locker this happens a lot in prayer halls of women when the imam is reciting surah and then he offers prostration of visitation and majority of women don't know that this is saluted till hour so they bow and the Imam when she goes allahu akbar it stands to continue this is the hotbar and she said I said that somehow Hamidah they realized that they have done something wrong and all your anythings are mixed up and chaos takes place and that is why it is essential that people see those in front of them those who can see the Imam so that they could follow suit unfortunately this is all the time we have however I believe that you may think of other questions about the SuJu the cell or the prostration of forgetfulness until we meet next time I'll leave you fear Manila or Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
