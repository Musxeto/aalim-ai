  "transcript": "in Salah I accidentally said which is usually with which is with I said it as with yah when rising up from the ru I real I did realize it in prayer after I rose up from ru but since it was a mistake in recitation I did not perform s and I did not know if I should repeat the Salah for it so does it invalidate my Salah and do I have to repeat it saying is one of the obligatory acts of Salat it's like saying to move from one pillar to the other and is the movement phrase said when we're rising from if you mispronounced it and said instead of deliberately while you're capable of saying it you should have rectified it the moment you stood up and you realized it's strong you said should have said it again because you did not do so and you continued you should have compensated such a mistake by offering to to before Salam if you concluded the prayer altoe because you did not know the ruling I pray that the prayer is valid but next time do not do such a thing and Allah Knows Best"
