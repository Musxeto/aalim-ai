  "title": "Why have some scholars said taraweeh is 20 rakahs? Where did the number come from? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] now we those who pray a dragon we still have a Hadith backing it up like so my question is Sheikh why is there why is there scholarly consensus on 20 where this uh this number 20 came from first of all when you say consensus it means that there is no one else who said something different but this is not the case you just said that Imam Malik says it's 36 and not 20 rakas so there's no consensus and we cannot have consensus when we have a Hadith and the prophets Hadith according to mother is pleased with her that the prophet Allah did not pray neither in Ramadan nor out of Ramadan more than 11 raqqa however this Hadith is challenged by another Hadith where it stated that he used to pray 13 rakas as per IBN Abbas and also Aisha may Allah be peace with them all so why did The Scholar say that it's okay to pray 20 because there is nothing limiting it where did they come from where did they come with this number this is the doing of Muslims since Allah knows when and it is not an issue where we should waste time disputing and arguing and fighting and pointing at one another that this is an innovator or this one is so extreme in his views Etc it's a very easy topic you want to pray 11. be my guest what's your evidence my evidence is that the prophet has some never exceeded 11 raqqa according to the authentic Hadith in the sahih by mother when she was asked okay good for you you want to pray 20 yes what's your evidence that Omar may Allah be pleased with him and the majority of the companions used to pray 20 rakas good for you you want to pray more serious it's okay there's nothing limiting it and if the people in the neighborhood are uh old geezers like myself and they don't have the energy to pray except seven rakas good for you there's nothing that compels us to pray a specific number let alone to fight and point fingers at one another and accuse one another of being an innovator and not loving the Sunnah Etc all of this is from shaytan Islam is an easygoing religion you do what you like and if someone goes against your opinion that is not a crucial issue is not a uh a life or death matter alhamdulillah we have room in our religion to accept such differences Knows Best"
