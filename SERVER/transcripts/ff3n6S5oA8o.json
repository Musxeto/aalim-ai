  "transcript": "a person is going to follow the way of his friend so you have to be careful the most important thing in raising our kids is not following our opinions or other opinions one of the qualities you have to look in the man that he will look after you and the girl has to pay them this is exactly what happens with religious commitment is that a lot of the muslims nowadays don't this is when you type it in um welcome again to another episode i'm your host ismail buluk and you're watching peace tv the solution for humanity again we have with us today mccarthy and last but not least now today we're going to talk about the islamic household or the islamic home so i'll start today with the man in the middle shaykh you can start us off on this topic inshaallah alhamdulillah no doubt the family is the as we know it is that building block or unit for the society because society or community consists of families and islam pays a lot of attention to this the building up of this family because that is the cornerstone and if you want to build strong family this family has to be established upon the dean from day one if you want to be successful in your marital life and this starts from the moment you decide to choose your wife to be your future partner and you need to keep in mind there is a role model i should try to mimic i should try to imitate my best and that is our beloved prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi so islam tells you from day one that you have to choose the right a righteous partner who will be backing you up through life because life is full of ups and downs life is not honey and milk life is a test for both and obligations towards each other so if we start our household and our building this family from the beginning on a strong foundation then this relationship will be healthy will be lasting and will be happy from the beginning the choice was wrong then this household would not be a man full of love or dissipating love and it will be missing many things a key word here to really elaborate on the topic is building building a muslim household if you're going to build a house and a lot of us or any of us who have built a house especially if you're building it by yourself that's famous in a lot of countries like where you're from in saudi arabia where they actually build his own house where maybe in the west it's already built and the person who actually builds or if you're buying a house that's built you're going to look at how it was built so when you when she accident mentions the issue of it starts from the beginning when you choose the spouse and we go back to issue of the building you're going to see the best quality of building how to build it how not to build it what's going to make it strong what could make it my dream house get ruined what's going to make it last throughout the years how is this house going to make me happy how could it make me sad this happens to it also we're building in the islamic household we need to focus like this as well and as i mentioned it starts with the pious wife because what happens why the pious wife and the pious husband obviously as well when you have the quran sunnah as your foundation it's going to help you get through the hard times no doubt that any household is going to face difficulties and the prophet saw is he's the role model and he's the best of all mankind he faced difficulties household but obviously when you have believing women and his wives and him being the strong belief he was isaiah he was able to deal with those difficulties when he came so we built a strong foundation we focus on building a house that is pious a house that is built on the quran sunnah and subhanallah i remember reading that the salaf the early muslims they used to get married after ramadan so why they'd like to get married after ramadan because both of the spouses will be coming out of acts of obedience they have this iman rush during ramadan as all muslims do right with the quran the fasting the prayer the remembrance of allah not doing bad deeds so that's still fresh in their actions when they get married boom after ramadan you'll see that i have effect inshallah on how the marriage starts inshallah tabarak the way i see it is that when focusing on a muslim home or a muslim house we're not actually focusing on a physical house in the sense that you could be living in a tent in the desert you could be living in a hut in the jungles you could be living in a mansion a 15 room mansion all of this does not have any difference when these places are inhabited by true practicing muslims because their homes would be an islamic home and when we understand this it doesn't matter if you have electricity or not air conditioning or not tv refrigerator and kitchen or not what matters is what goes inside that house so when i want to build a muslim home i have to look at what compiles a muslim home the father the mother and the children so what goes inside there how is it that i have to or i want to have this home first of all the spouses and shersalin also told us that you should pick the best around in terms of religious commitment in terms of moral conduct and behavior once you do this then allah would bless you with offspring with children now how do i treat my wife and how does my wife treat me how do i treat my children and how do my children treat me this is what makes a muslim house is it only how we teach each other or are there ingredients in the house itself that prevents it from being rendered or labeled as a muslim house what i think is i wanted to go back to abraham actually because he started off with that point about the first is choosing the spouse and we know there's a hadith that says that the woman is married for four qualities so i thought it would be very suitable now to mention those four qualities and maybe explain this hadith in the hadith of the process he mentioned the four qualities he said you marry a woman either for her beauty her tribe lineage where she comes from her money or her religion and if there's something and we mentioned these four when you get married it's not just like custom you do actually you want to get something in return like something in life when you're looking for that spouse you're looking for something the person i sent him he mentioned these four because the most for important things you'll find these four will return to you with some type of benefit and whether it's her beauty and this makes you happy the fact that she's very rich and she lets you retire at a young age it makes you happy or the fact she's from an important family high status that helps you out in society but he said to focus on the fourth one which is the most important and that is that's deen that is the one who is the religious one the pious one once again as i mentioned why because how it's going to what have the effect on you and her as a i also mentioned how does she treat you how do you treat her how the children treat later because that's going to be built on how you treat each other so when it's built on being pious you know now when you leave you have a pious woman you never hear any stories about a pious woman who for example who goes astray or a pious man when it comes to adultery because what stops them not the desire but when now what makes them not fall into that which is haram and cause problems in the household it's the taqwa the fear of allah it's the day of judgment why don't for example they raise their voices on one another why doesn't the man hit the woman and put her in line straighten her up why because he fears allah you know he shouldn't be doing that as a muslim being a woman it's not something a muslim man it's not the characteristic of a muslim man to be the woman it's not the character is to scream at one another it doesn't solve problems how do we solve the problems let's look how the prophet solved his problems with his wives let's fear allah and how we treat one another and i was mentioning i was talking the other night and the divorce is usually not a good thing i was showing the beauty of islam when it comes to divorce and two beautiful ayahs in the quran when allah subhanahu wa ta'ala he said that two way things you can do if it comes to a stage where you think it should be a divorce im second you keep her as your wife whatever that which is is good that which is known to be something acceptable not with that which is wrong ortiz that in a nice polite beautiful gentle kind way you let her go and you divorce her and then allah remind us and the other verse don't forget the father between you and the good you had because even though were some bad days and maybe the bad might have been a little bit more towards the end you guys got divorced but don't forget those good days there's a lot of good that you had as spouses as well so any marriage is built on this and a lot of the problems happen even in divorce when the kids are left they don't have the taqwa because the two who are lovebirds at one time now have become great enemies and you'll see the one your mother she this and this and then he goes to the mother to visit with the mother and she said oh your father and this is the thing but when the tuck was there you only see the jameel de san the goodness in and how they treat one another the first time i did it i came with like 40 different points and then obviously it continued to grow after that mashaallah so it shows you how ramadan is training once you mention for the example of the class it's the only act of worship that only allah knows it's teaching you the pure class i teach you how to control your anger how not in islam if somebody curses at you not to reply it's renewing your relationship with the quran with the salah with the night prayer all of these things it's helping you also the issue of the fast we talk about the wisdoms and it's something that was found in new research that was done we talked about it it's difficult for you and it harms you and some people say we really feel for you know sorry you know it's wrong i'm sorry is what the non-muslims say but the reality is is that a new research in the west from the non-muslims they found that one of the cures for alzheimer's disease is fasting two days a week which is the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammed that he used to fast mondays and thursdays and fast other times during the month and they said not just the fastest refrain from or like drink water like some fasting there's another religion you can drink water and not eat but they say not eating or drinking anything from like morning or from dawn until dusk like the faster the muslims yeah they're really promoting it now in the west it's a very popular and proving obvious like you said proving to be very successful therapy many it's a therapy that many people are turning to this whole fasting thing the fasting makes those the rich to feel how the pool the suffering of the poor i am rich i've never tasted hunger i've never had that experience so allah says no you have to taste it so that's why when ramadan comes everyone the ruler will will stop eating those who are well off the rich so that they feel oh so that's what the food they go through so there's a divine wisdom behind it and not only about behind fasting all the teachings of islam because they come from the all wise the all knower so everything there is a divine wisdom behind it and it is for the benefit of mankind allah is not a need of anyone of us but the one who reaps the the benefit it is the believer himself the prophet tells us clearly that those who do not refrain from false testimony or lying or having dispute and fighting with others then their hunger and thirst does not benefit anyone not even the person doing it and they have not fulfilled allah's commandments to abstain from drinking and eating for the sake of not drinking and eating it's an act of worship and a lot of the non-muslims would look at it and say why are you doing this to yourselves and they're feeling that they're merciful to us come on we want to help you not knowing that we do this for the sake of allah and that is where we get our strength from i remember that all of my children with the grace of allah when they were seven or eight years of age they used to fast the whole day we do not force our children by the way muslims do not force the children to fast they encourage and if they fulfill that and they manage to fast half a day we give them presents to encourage them but never ever threaten them or fight them or reprimand them this is not islamic so my children used to fast when they're eight seven eight some of them nine complete ramadan and they feel proud of doing this in their children and the beauty of fasting is that it is an act of sincerity see prayer everyone sees me pray giving zakat everyone sees the impact on my income or wealth but fasting though you don't see any act of going against fasting i could go to the bathroom and drink water a child in his thirst while performing water he could drink water a woman in her kitchen cooking taste the food and eat no one knows about this and that is why in the hadith allah says all the deeds of bani adam are the sons of adam is for him except fasting this is for me and i reward abundantly accordingly so when you look at fasting it is not simply refraining from food and drink it is something that shoots higher because when you stop from lawful things eating up an apple i'm not eating pork apple is halal you're fasting stop drinking water is not like drinking whiskey water is halal you're fasting stop so if allah tells us to stop from halal things during this holy month of ramadan by default refraining from things that are forbidden would be much much easier because they are forbidden we know the harms of it not only that islam is taking you away from being addicted even to halal things not just that i mean even the uh the gemma the gathering all those people kind of makes one think to some extent what it will be like on yom kiyama when you're all gathered you know the same clothes as well nobody's different and then you see it's upon like the day of judgment what i wanted to ask you is that what is the story behind hajj why do we do it why what are these rituals that the towards around the kaaba the running between the mounting of suffolk what is this is it something many people think that maybe this is some old pagan thing that was brought in by the muslims so what exactly is it we can give as many interpretations as we wish we can go to the books of history and find the origin of each and every thing but this is not of a great concern to us as muslims and we have to know that not everything in islam we are requested to justify and find the wisdom behind it our religion is a religion of submission and to follow the prophet allah who himself said to us in black and white take your rituals of hajj from me from me so we follow the prophet now we can say that standing at mount arafa or next to mount arafa is because as people say adam met eve when they descended from heaven and they got lost and they met in arafah so this is why they at a rafu and they got to know each other it's been called a mount arava and the funny thing this is a foot note i saw a clip for one of those so-called imams or scholars of nowadays he's saying that everything in islam is justifiable even mawlid mawlid is part of the sunnah and then he says even the five daily prayers you know why the five daily prayers like this and he starts giving something out of this universe yeah and he's making up stories that are so funny and the people around allah what are you doing he's playing with you he said why is that this is because when prophet adam was ordered to descend on to earth allah forgave his sins he prayed two rakaats and i say what did he pray for no no two records of gratitude okay it's up to you what about the photographs of lord was he present what the sheikh was present then we go to her prayer why is it for raqqa for is because this is the time that the ship or the ark of noah descended on the judy and the water was drained and he prayed four records of gratitude and i was thinking turk after adam foreign okay up to you what about the answer prayer he said and then the sacrifice came so they all both congregation okay what about i'll tell you this is when prophet ayoub may allah peace and blessing upon him was cured from the 18 years of illness then he wanted to pray gratitude to allah azza on the third rakah he was weak so he sat down and finished it and i was wondering why did he pray turkas then and isha prayed what kind of religion is these people innovating and the masses they take this as well this is completely baseless we can say in hajj it had originated from the time of ibrahim peace and blessing be upon him but we do not attribute this because uh the mother of ismail hajjar went between safa and warupa looking for water this is true and we know the story of zamzam but we make say because the prophet instructed us to do this we also throw the pebbles with general kubra the the medium jamerra and the small jambaram that people now it is called shaytan we do this because the prophet did this not because the shaytan stood to ibrahim peace be upon him so he threw him seven and seven and seven we do this because it's part of the rituals that the prophet alaihis saw instructed us and that is why we go to muslim and spend the night in muzdalifa and we go from arafah after sunset not before that not like the pagans used to do hajj is a great manifestation of unity of the muslims when you look at those four millions coming from all over the world you know we hear about the segregation about the racism about the blacks and the whites in islam we have nothing like this we have the blacks the white the red the yellow all kind of technicolor around you and they wear the same garments so if i look at the king or a peasant it would be the same it's only two garments okay one say yeah but the king has small royalties no he can't even wear underwears he cannot put perfume he smells only for these four days not necessarily smelling meaning that he is not in his prestige that he used to be and subhanallah one of the greatest signs of unity is that if you gather a hundred thousand person in one place and you ask him to do something this would probably take a half an hour an hour for them to execute in islam the muad then makes the quran in less than a minute just before he finishes all the 3 million the 2 million the 4 million are standing in the same row shoulder to shoulder foot to foot no one is picky saying i don't want you next to me i want someone from my own country they standing in submissiveness facing the same place same direction making the same moves all of this is portrayed in and hajj and the grace of allah that now the rituals of hajj is being broadcasted worldwide so people non-muslims when they look at this they feel that they are part of it they want to be part of it they feel ah even he's another muslim he feels like this is surreal this is nice i wish i was part of it and i give you the invitation you want to be part of it all what you have to do is just say the kalima and that is it well we've come again to the end of a another interesting episode and to you the viewers today obviously we mentioned the final two pillars the pillar of the fasting ramadan we mentioned the main purpose behind ramadan is this creating this awareness of allah knowing that allah is always watching us and we mention that it's one of the most sincere acts of worship because it's something that you cannot fake or do in front of other people and we ended on the hajj and the how that hajj is a very good act and we mentioned some various points about the hajj being the obedience of following the prophet saw sallam and how it reminds us that we are all equal many people from different nationalities and colors and that also reminds us of that day when we will all stand before allah all equal in the sense and we will all be judged by allah and we've come in this episode to the conclusion of the five pillars please join us in our next episode where we talk about iman and essan so please make sure you stay tuned and until then assalamu alaikum uh uh welcome again to another episode i'm your host this is tv the solution for humanity again we have with us today mccarthy and last but not least so we really want to go on from there and since abdul rahim is in such a chirpy mood he can start off today we need to remind ourselves i think at the beginning of this episode the command of allah when he said to us protect yourself and your families from the hell fire and put this ayah this verse into action in our household what are the things in our household that could lead us all our children to the hellfire and unfortunately in the days we live in there are a lot of them so we need to focus on these we talked the last episode a little bit about things that are haram in the household pictures statues which is becoming widespread we're talking some other episodes about the dangers for example of the internet of the television and we're not saying that we don't have these things in our house because the television itself it might not be haram but what you put on it is haram the internet itself is not harambe what you put on it can be hard so we need to be careful about these things these things that pull us all to the hell fire to protect ourselves and to protect our families from these things and i think we'll start the internship today about different things that we need to make sure we get out of our household or that we filter in our household the things that are there is we'll just give some practical tips inshaallah for the muslim families and what i recommend or what i advise is actually the prophet sallam recommended that if you have a spacious home and by the way to have a spacious home is one from the signs of happiness or that the things that bring happiness to the household if you have a room where you can allocate and make it a masjid inside your house where the family the women they play in that room and they can even break taraweeh in that room etc and there is a library also on this masjid so this brings more hair and good into the household also if we conduct a study circle on a daily basis daily basis even if it is just for 10 minutes and i recommend that every family should obtain a copy of the abu saleh by imam nowy so you get the family all together and let the children so you make them like it to read one hadith and no need for explanation because most of them they're self-explanatory and you will see the hair that comes to your home and you at the same time you try to get rid of the things that chase away the angels of mercy as the messiah mentioned and i appeal and i request every family muslim family if they want to get closer to allah to get rid of the television because what is there and i don't believe if anyone's saying i'm controlling unless it is a special decoder that only receives these good channels okay so get rid of the television if you want to bring up your children islamically and because the television is not going to help you to draw near to allah it's not going to help you to get closer to allah or bring up your children the way that pleases allah subhanahu wa unless of course you're watching the peace tv no he said this is what i said i said islamic and you you have any special receivers okay you have special receivers that only bring islamic channels i mean it might not be available in all parts of the world but at least in the i mean even if you use if it's not available you can have a general satellite and you as the parent you can delete the channels exactly and you can select i mean that's what i did with my satellite you have to be practical rather than pragmatic okay so we have to be practical and face the reality the reality they are muslim homes they browse and they watch all this different channel and just one scene will destroy everything i'll tell you a story that one of the du auto brothers and he said you know sometimes people might be a little extreme and i would say that he brought this up he might be extreme he said you know really be a big deal for example now we want to focus on art folks on things if we brought a woman in front of us and she's naked and she comes with a man and he's naked and he really be a big deal is it that so the people that were shocked to hear this like how can you be saying this extremely so then he reeled him in to get them thinking about it and he said because this is what a lot of you do all the time he said these movies you watch this is what they're seeing you're sitting there right in front of your children and you're watching this these movies that are in the house and this is what it's doing basically you're having naked men and women and maybe in some of the arab countries they cut out some of the scenes that are too hot so they cut them out but then you have also these new channels that come in that are not cut and this is what they're seeing and so now what is the message we're sending to our children as we're sitting there watching these movies with them now any non-muslim when the times get rough or get tough what do they do what do they turn to they turn that bottle and they drink it and they keep seeing the drinking and drinking so what is this putting into his mind alcohol is not really okay it's haram it's not that big of a deal right dating premarital sex fornication it's so this is programming it's really not that big of a deal everybody's doing it so and we're destroying our household from within so this guy he said just as you would not allow this to happen don't allow it to happen if it's on the screen because it's basically you're just sitting there watching you'll say no cover your eyes don't watch but now you let them watch these movies so it's not much of a difference and he said the extremism is you the ones who allow this you're the extreme ones that's another form of extremism which is as extreme corruption where you're corrupting your own house the television just like the internet it's a two-edged sword you can be doing like what we're doing now here on peace tv which inshallah is good for us and it's good for the um and you can also be doing a lot of other things and that unfortunately most of the people who watch tv they watch that which is harmful they might watch a little bit here and there of what is good but the majority of what they watch is harmful and not only this i mean it is affecting i mean the moral values of the family if a couple are sitting watching such movies dirty movies not necessarily pornography and you find them that the husband is focusing not on the man he's focusing the woman and the woman is focusing on the man exactly okay so they are everyone in another world so what happened to that intimacy what happened to that love and the marital relationship it is just disintegrating so you are destroying your own home with your own hands even today i mean this is not a news story but i even read it today subhanallah and somebody posted on facebook actually how that very famous turkish it was a couple of years ago this famous turkish cereal that even in saudi many muslim countries it had caused big divorce rates because the woman become fascinated by this man a lot of it was the women actually a lot of men end up divorcing their wives because she became fascinated with this and she started to say i wanted to call my next son mohammed it became and there was lots of like you're saying lots of divorces and lots of marital problems because people were falling in love with these characters what happens is the characters they choose obviously like for example you'll see even they do like these detective shows these csi and stuff like this and what they'll bring they bring like these you know really good-looking model ladies have you ever seen any cops really they look like that honestly so they're what they were trying to destroy to distract you so what happens is the man he's looking then he's looking over his wife she's had a few kids you know with ages got a little bit older and she's getting a little weight he's looking like oh it's gross you know and he's looking at this model in front of him who spends night and day preparing herself to corrupt you and then she's looking at this star with his six pack and he's looking at him with his look at this guy his one pack a one pack yeah they start to look at one another like this and it makes their hearts drift apart and greater than that before uh i'm about to cut him off real quick greater than that we always focus on the we're corrupting the manners and things of our children what's worse than that actually is the atheida the turkey which is being corrupted and we mentioned when we talk about what a muslim believes in that episode we were talking about how it affects with the qatar when they say why me and all this and also every time they sit down when they have a problem what immediately they say they make shirk immediately jesus jesus christ and i recall student who sat down he watched so many movies he said that was a very difficult exam i opened up he said jesus christ like this he's a muslim family right so i said you know what you've done is an active shirt can have a kufr i say don't forget to make your hustle and re-enter islam when you come home and he was like this i said you have to be you took this opportunity to teach the kids this is what you is being corrupt in your aqita the cross all of them were in the cross you know even like a talk show it's good oprah and this hamdulillah she's gone now but the thing is now she's got this big cross calling to you it's a form of dawah it's a form they're calling you to the even if you don't accept their falsehood at least it makes it okay it makes it acceptable the issue of the cross and worship in the cross now sheikh asam what have you got to you know add to this well actually we went through a lot of it when we commented on the shahada the we're saying that there is no god worthy of being worshiped other than allah azzawajal so the existence of allah azza is something that humans are programmed to believe and there isn't a lot of evidences addressing the issue of atheism because they did not exist except recently when they went against the church usually people believed in a god or gods so you would not find people coming saying that there is no god except for the exception of pharaoh who thought that he was god himself and everyone around him knew that he was a liar a god does not go to the bathroom a god does not need to be taken care of when getting sick a god is not created so rather not go into more detail because it is a so vast of a subject that we muslims could talk about for ages about allah's beauty allah's names allah's attributes about allah's actions it goes endless but as he mentioned earlier this is the top of the list when it comes to the pillars of iman and we all know that the pillars of his man are six they believe in allah his angels his prophets his books divine books and in the hereafter or the day of judgment and finally in the divine decree whether it is good or a bad as it may seem to us so i believe that we should then move on if you allow me sure to the second pillar which is the belief in allah's angels now what is the difference between islam and iman so people say why are there five pillars of islam and six pillars of iman isn't it all part of the same religion and the answer as scholars say without prolonging the answer in a nutshell they say that when they are mentioned alone they mean the same so when we say islam and we talk about it it's the same thing is included when i'm i speak about iman islam is also included but when we address them together like in the case of the poor and the needy when they're separate they all mean the same when they're together this has a meaning and the other one has a different meaning so islam and iman when combined together islam means the things that appear we don't know about what's in your heart and iman means the things that you are believing your conviction we cannot know it then this is allah's knowledge as our judgment outward actions and the inward when they're together yes when they are together and that is why we find verses in the quran and the nomads say that we believe allah say to them do not say we believe say we have accepted islam because the belief has to yet to be manifested the iman or the belief in the angels what are the angels angels are creatures of allah azza have you seen them no have any of us seen them no so the atheist those who do not believe they say then they do not exist and this is not logical because i haven't seen electricity no one has seen electricity we've seen the traces of electricity no one has seen our souls and just because i cannot see something that does not mean it doesn't exist no one has seen love no one have seen your brains so i cannot go to someone who's an atheist and say listen you have no brains why i haven't seen them so to believe in the angels is to believe in the unseen and this is something that the muslims are highly proud of because allah complimented them of believing in the unseen but what are the angels the angels are all creatures of allah as shaykh salem pointed out before they are created from light the jinn are created from fire and the humans are carried from clay so they are created from light they have different levels and their number is unknown to anyone no one can count them the prophet tells us allah that on the seventh heaven there is a house called al-baytel it's like the kaaba on earth and pilgrims of the angels come to it every single day they come 70 000 of them and that was from the creation of all creation until the end of time so you can imagine that allah azzawajal has so many angels not only that the prophet said allah in the seven heavens there isn't a place of a han spam without you finding an angel either standing in prayer or bowing or prostrating there isn't any it's packed with angels and the features of these angels that they do not sin and they obey whatever allah azzawajal orders them to do and the head of these angels are the greatest three jibril mikhail and israel and these three are responsible for giving life subhanallah archangel jibril he is responsible for the revelation which is the life of the hearts the angel mikhail he is responsible for ascending the rain down which gives life to the whole of earth and israel is the angel who is responsible for blowing in the trumpet where all the dead would be resurrected for the day of judgment and be given life of course i mean even we have the angels on uh obviously recording on our shoulders that certain angels have certain names that we know allah has told us other ones we don't know they have certain duties as he mentioned jibril the greatest of the angel his duty was to bring the most important form of life which is the life of the hearts of the kulu which is to with the revelation from allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and jibril is the one who brought the revelation to all of the prophets and obviously makail is in charge of the reign in israel is in charge of the blowing in the horn the trumpet on the day of judgment that will it will kill the who was ever on the land and then the second time to bring back to life those who are the dead to bring the dead back to life to be held accountable for what they did in this life on the day of judgment and as you mentioned we have the ones who are with us on the right and left ones who are writing down our good and bad deeds so on the day of judgment you have no excuse and allah subhanahu wa he doesn't oppress anybody and you will see on the day of judgment everything has written down the biggest and smallest sins that you have done in this dunya and also we have the ones who are responsible for example who's in charge of the hellfire medic and we have for example the ones who hold up of the jedi as well and the one and we have also the ones who hold the ar the throne of the rahman subhana wa ta'ala and there's many descriptions to the angels and some one of the greatest descriptions allah subhanahu wa ta'ala when he mentions the angels in the quran there's a difference between the angels and the humankind is that they do not sin they do not do mistakes they are constantly in obedience of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and never go against his command and here i just want to point out something very early i always like to focus when we talk about issues of iman and belief issues in islam in general what do we gain from this because it's not just something we have information about but what do we gain from it i'll give two examples the first example is what we just mentioned the fact they do not disobey allah and that which they are commanded to do and this is an encouragement to the human being to also be like that to try to we have the expression where they say he's like an angel he doesn't do anything wrong i mean obviously you might all of us have mistakes as the prophet said made it very clear that all of the children of adam they make mistakes and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent from them so we're going to make mistakes we're not going to be angels but it's still it's an encouragement to encourage you to try to do as best as you can as a believer and secondly the fact that everything is being written down subhanallah when you think about that iman because you get weak and you're iman all of us do and the fact that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is a rafal rahim he's any very compassionate very merciful all forgiving subhanallah it kind of makes us sometimes still follow up take advantage of that and fall into sin into error but we remind yourself also you have two angels with you who are writing everything down that kind of you know it helps you as well to strive to do good deeds and the fact that when you were talking about the belief in allah that there's proofs and he would say you can't see but there's proofs of the existence the sahaba they saw the actions of them when it came to for some of the battles when they were battling allah subhanahu watana sent his angels because also some of the duties of the angels is to protect the human beings there's aims just for protecting you and these angels were sent as an extra protection i guess extra backup to say for protecting the believers to help them victory of you be victorious in this battle and they would see the effect of the angels there on the battlefield with them and the angels have been seen by the way it's important we point out but they not seen in their original form the only ones who ever saw them in their original form was the prophet muhammad saw suddenly saw gabriel when he had 600 wings that covered up as far as you could see in the horizon and he obviously needed something very massive and sound something normal for the human being to see but he did used to come in the form of humans as well and they were seen in that form but not in his original form so they have been seen and we see uh one of the battles i can't remember if it's uh bad the the quraysh they said they saw men on horseback who were fighting with the muslims and they and they said that they would actually be coming behind them with their sword and they would see that the head go without even seeing anybody as well so i mean obviously they were clearly there on the battlefield in general we go back to this belief and it's not difficult to believe in this once you believe in the basic which is the belief in allah subhanahu wa time you've seen his signs you're going to believe in the angels and everything that he has revealed to you to believe in what's i think an interesting point is we've obviously heard however angels they never sin and they never disobey allah and i remember when we did some studies of and they were talking about this point about the belief in angels and they said that some of the scholars had said that the righteous human is considered to be of a higher status than the angel because the angel cannot sin he's not tested whereas we have that thing where we can choose right or wrong so the one who is human is very righteous and stays away from all the temptation he can be raised in his status even to that above the angels and we've got about one minute left so i should ask him if you'd like to end any particular points on this topic there are so many angels that are there to protect us and this gives you extreme love to allah azzawajal who created all of this perfection for us there is an angel his work is to blow the soul in the fetus and to write whether he is happy or doomed in hell whether what is his provision how long he would live there are angels that are protectors of us there are angels that come into our houses only to pray to allah and seek forgiveness for us and that is why the prophet tells us take out of your house these things that prevent the angels from coming such as statues portraits pictures dogs all of these prevent the angels that seek forgiveness for us at the side of allah from coming into the house and so many people are deprived from these angels and when the angels are not there the devils take their places at the end of the just to point out really quick also obviously which we didn't mention when i try to mention everything i was just a quick reminder of what muslim believes also the angel of death and you see the angel of death when he comes to yank out the soul and you see how the human body reacts to him coming and the human being when the soul is about to get pulled out you see how the eye is going how the body reacts it also shows you that present of that angel which also once again proves to you and it reminds you to be ready for that that thing to be at the best of states as a muslim but when that does come to you as it will come to all of us well again we've come to the end of this episode for the viewers inshallah we've discussed today and recapped really on our previous episodes on the belief in allah and we heard some logical and rational proofs of hell that has to be created and then we went on to discuss the belief in angels and the various information that they are created from light and that they have different tasks one of the most noble beings who bringing down the revelation so please tune in again in our next episode as we continue talking about the pillars of iman and until next time ah"
