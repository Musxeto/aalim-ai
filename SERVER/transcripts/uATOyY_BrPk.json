  "transcript": "foreign hmm mercy to the world's sallallahu alaihi wa'alahi wasallam sent another message to al-mundir even sawye and he was the ruler of bahrain and bahrain is not the country that we know of the small island in the arabian gulf bahrain at the time of the prophet was the whole eastern province of arabia so whatever was east of the center of arabia used to be called bahrain and he sent to him his messenger al-allah ibn hamrami who also introduced islam to him and ask him to accept islam another companion of may allah be pleased with him was sent to houda ibn ali and he was the leader leader of yamama and hauda accepted in a sense islam but not because of islam he wanted to share the prophet salla sallam's kingdom and the prophet sallam he rejected his request because this was not a kingdom owned by the prophet salla sallam he was not a ruler or an empire or an emperor of an empire he was simply the messenger and the servant of allah so he had a meditation he had he had worldly intention and in in islam as we know from the hadith of um all deeds depend on the intentions so if you accept islam and your intention is not for the sake of allah your islam is not accepted and a person would die on disbelief if this is the case and that is why all hypocrites are not muslims they claim to be muslims but their intentions are not sincere and pure and that is why it is not accepted from them and the prophet alaihis al-assam also told us that from yamama there will be someone who claims that he is a prophet and of course we know that is a liar who at first pretended to be a messenger and he said funny words claiming that these are revelations from allah and he named himself and rahman of course is one of the names of allah almighty when we know the fierce battles that took place after immediately after the death of the prophet between the muslims and between this great and big liar also the prophet sent to al-harif sa and he was the ruler of damascus and the regions around them he sent to him the companion and when this ruler sold the letter of the prophet he was outraged again it's arrogance all over and he was astonished he said that this man wants me to give him my kingdom who does he think he is and he started to gather his army to go and invade medina but being a follower of the ruler of the romans at the time he sent for him asking him for his permission and what do you think that the answer came the answer was negative you are not to go to this man because himself almost accepted islam and he knew that he was the messenger of allah so he did not allow him allow him to go to medina and he said really strong things about the issue which made this man made him twist in his attitude he brought shija may allah be pleased with him he honored him he gave him gifts he told him nice things because at the very first when he attended his court the the moment he saw the letter he threw it and was frustrated and was agitated he wanted to go and invade medina immediately but after the reply came from the leader of the romans he calmed down and he came back to his senses and he honored the messenger and the message of the prophet i heard that was about to accept islam but the people around him convinced him to reject islam is that true no no this is not true he was about to accept islam they did not convince him they did not accept this matter from the very start so when he showed them and told them about islam they all started to shout and tremble and they wanted to attack him so he had a choice either to accept islam and migrate to medina and leave all this wealth and kingdom behind him or to stay as he is rejecting islam and this is what he decided and that is why in one of the narrations the prophet saw sallam said that he was in a sense holding to his throne rather than holding to islam he would not give away his kingdom to or for the sake of islam another companion of the prophet alaihistalat and this is a bit funny and strange this companion was sent to the head of the kingdom of roman and her man as we know is to the south of arabia and a man at the time meant that it was a man and had ramot the southern part of yemen this was all called oman and it was ruled by uh a man called jaiphar and his brother abd both of them but the king was jay for himself and the prophet sent them a companion of his who stayed there for a while convincing them of accepting the prophet's call and accepting islam some narrations said say that they accepted islam after long trials the man that the prophet sallam sent as a messenger of his was amras and the funny thing is that himself was sent to a najashi in abyssinia long ago but for a complete different mission his his mission about 10 or or 12 or 14 years ago about 10 years ago that is was to convince a najashi of abyssinia to send the muslims back with amram alas back to back to mecca because at the time amras was apollophis was a pagan so he went there he bribed the courtsmen of a najashi gave them gifts and convinced them to stand by his side when he was allowed to speak in the presence of nanajashi he told him that these are youngsters and they are from our people and we know what's wrong with them they said bad things about our gods and we are requesting you to send them back with us and the courtsmen backed him up and told the najashi that he's saying something that is reasonable the ministers the prime ministers and so on they all backed amr's allegation and they requested the najashi to dispose of these people and to send them back to their people because they know them best najashi would not accept this until he heard from the other side and this is a very important thing whenever one comes to you and com plaint do not listen to him without listening to the other party and so many times we get calls from brothers who are complaining from their wives and from sisters who are complaining from their husbands if you listen to one party and not listen to the other you would say that the right is always with the one who you listen to but if you listen to the sister you would say that the husband has to be hanged if if what she's saying is true the brother has to be hanged and if you listen to the husband you say well i changed my mind the sister should be chopped off the her head should be chopped off and when you put them together and listen to them both talking you find that 50 is true and 50 here is true and the rest is all false and najashi did what any just and fair ruler would do he said that i would not reject those who came to me and sought asylum in my country until i listen to what they say jafar nabitalib came presented islam to them and and najashi was pleased with what he heard and so no threat to the security of his country so he allowed them to stay the following day said that i came up with an idea that would annihilate them from abyssinian and he went to the najashi and told him that these people that you are supporting they think badly about jesus christ the son of mary ask them what they say about him and jaffram did not say anything except was that was mentioned in the quran he told him that we believe in the miraculous birth of jesus christ and that he is among the top five messengers of allah azim the the the messengers of power and strength and that he was miraculously born to maryam without a father but we do not believe that he is a god or a son of a god he is a human being and the najashi said that this is what the bible had said and this is exactly what jesus christ is i believe we have a short break stay tuned insha'allah we will be back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings end this life and his mercy in this life and in the here after as well each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it 10 years ago he was a pagan with a polytheist attacking islam trying his best to undermine the efforts of muslims to practice their religion without any fear or oppression and now he is the ambassador of the prophet salallahu to the king of roman asking him to come into islam subhanallah how people change to the positive and to the their own welfare with the grace of allah the almighty and there were other messengers and other companions of the prophet sallam sent elsewhere all of this was an attempt from the from the prophet alaihis salah to call these dignitaries to islam and also to relieve himself from the responsibility because it is every individual's responsibility to call others to islam now you can call them straight ahead and present them with a straightforward request like the prophet sallam did because everyone heard about islam it was almost 20 years old in arabia at that time so they all had information about islam there are other ways that people can call others to islam you can call islam through your behavior you can call islam through giving handouts tape cassettes you can call people to islam through dialogue not necessarily debates so should that mean we would be asked about the people who lived in europe and america and this view no allah azza will not ask you about every individual person tom dick or harry why didn't you deliver the message to them but allah the almighty will ask you about those who were next to you it is a shame that a lot of us know non-muslims and not putting the effort just to call them once to islam the prophet salallahu salaam gave us the best example he had a young jew neighbor and also sometimes he used to serve the prophet the prophet he is a young boy the prophet sasalam once heard that the boy was ill now the head of state the messenger of allah himself went to visit this jew this child this boy and he went there he visited him as a pay as a sick person and then took the opportunity to call him to islam so our prophet salallahu introduced islam to the boy asking him to accept islam the boy looked at his father asking him for permission because he's a young boy so the father the jew himself is one of the prophet sallam's name nicknames and abu means the father so the father one of his sons was al-qasim so he said al-qasim and the boy accepted islam the prophet salallahu sallam went out of the house happy and he said that all praise be to allah the almighty who salvaged and saved this man this boy from hell because of my call to him to islam this means that we have to try our best to call non-muslims to islam but again this depends on the situation some people would not accept being directly invited to islam and others may accept islam through analyzing your own conduct and behavior what about if i don't have the ability to give dawah to them the information about christianity and islam as well it's quite wrong to try and acquire all the knowledge and then afterwards preach islam or call people to islam the prophet sallam said once may allah put youth and beauty in the face of a person who delivers only one verse of the quran only one verse so no matter what level your knowledge is your ability to deliver monetism to deliver the testimony is by itself enough and never underestimate your knowledge and ability to call people to islam because if this is one of the steps of satan that we are prevented from following he would always come to you and say well you don't have enough knowledge in this area what about if they ask you about this so let's wait five or six months more so that you can acquire the knowledge and then he goes on to tafsir the commenter of the quran you don't know every single verse of the quran and then he goes to the hadith you don't know the hadiths of the prophet how authentic they are or how weak and what is the meaning of each one of them and he goes on and on and on you would find people like this student of knowledge and i know few of them who would be put into isolation of their own choice reading researching writing acquiring knowledge without benefiting others and they live in time of away from the reality of the people yes and and they're among us and you'd find people studying for five or ten years masha allah they have much knowledge but when you ask them what have you done with this knowledge nothing and at the same time you would probably find people who have far less knowledge than the other one the other person yet they are roaming the countries calling these to dawah calling these to islam showing people what they know though they don't have much knowledge now both are not that correct in the sense that you should have a certain level or or amount of knowledge to be able to call people to islam and once you have this knowledge it's different calling people to islam than gaining verdicts giving verdicts and fatwa and teaching it's a different stage so you can be a person who calls others to islam by giving handouts by giving cassettes by giving a vidiq videotapes or by giving even cds and and this is peanuts and it's it's for free almost but you never realize the effect and impact it has on others doing this does not mean that you have become a scholar or a person that can deliver fatwa and different verdicts on different islamic issues the prophet sallam did his best to call everyone to islam so that on the day of judgment no one would have an excuse no one would come before allah the almighty and say that i didn't know that there was a messenger of islam i didn't know that islam existed i didn't know that you wanted us to follow the quran by the prophet sallam spreading his messengers all over the country this left no excuse to anyone and the authentic hadith states that the prophet saws said by allah whom my soul is in his hands no jew or christian hears about me and my message and does not believe in me by allah he will be thrown into hell and this is a severe warning and a prophecy from a prophet to all those jews and christians if you hear about the message of the prophet you have to cross examine it because you will be questioned on the day of judgment for not following it and it's easier for the christians to accept islam than it is for the jews and the christians themselves can evaluate the situation and understand our position as muslims because when jesus christ came he was met by the jews as the christians met our prophets and that that was rejection the jews did not accept jesus christ and the christians do not accept prophet muhammad the jews did not accept the new testament the gospel the injil and the christians did not accept the quran so they can appreciate our position and they can evaluate the situation much better than the jews they have to be unbiased they have to be objective in studying islam and they will find that 99 percent of what islam preaches and teaches goes along fine and well with their nature one percent most likely that they would not be easy with simply because they either could not understand the background of the of this one percent or because they themselves are indulged and engaged with sins that are against christianity and against islam so they're not willing to let go of it because of their own evil desires but if they were objective they would definitely accept islam having gone through all this the prophet was salaam had one front secured and that was the front of the polytheist of quraysh so he had two fronts left the front of the tribes of nesht ratafa and so on and the remaining jews in the peninsula and they were all gathered in their stronghold of khaibar and haibar was a village about a hundred plus kilometers to the northwest of medina the prophet sallallahu alaihi on the seventh year of hijrah decided to go and launch his offensive against the village of khaibar the jews were in khaibar and it was a very strong place because it had so many fortresses and the jews had all their weaponry all their goods all their uh uh wealth in these village and in these fortresses and it had a lot of farms so it was a rich village what were the events that took place this is all inshallah what we will find next time we meet until then allah hmm hmm um"
