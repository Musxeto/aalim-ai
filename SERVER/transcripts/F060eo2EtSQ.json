  "transcript": "says in Salah in I say subh three times and then subh two times total of five and likewise I do that in is what I'm doing a or we can pray like this now this is a common mistake that Muslims do when they do not learn their religion so subh this is glorifying Allah Asel in a very beautiful fashion however it has a place to say it in and it is not to be said in suud because in R you are ordered to say sub and you may say there's no problem in that either one while in you must say subh or subh now the minimum is three in or in and the sky is the limit so if you want to say 10 if you want to say it 15 if you want to say it 100 as long as you're bowing or prostrating to Allah Asel you can say as many as you wish but if an individual says subh in instead of saying subh he had made a mistake and he must if done intentionally he must repeat his his prayer because he has abandoned something that is Wag that is mandatory it is mandatory for you to say subh in if you forgot and said subh this means that you have done an error and this if done intentionally and you know that it's wrong but you still do it this invalidates your prayer if you done it due to forgetfulness you forgot or you made a mistake then you have to rectify this by offering to of of forgetfulness and this does the job inshallah now is it a to say it no it is not a b to say it uh in the sense that this is inshallah part of thear of the prayer however dividing it into three and two this is baseless so stick to one of them which is the complete and say it five times seven times in odd numbers as many as you wish and inshallah this is acceptable we have aam"
