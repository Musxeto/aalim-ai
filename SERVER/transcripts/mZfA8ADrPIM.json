  "transcript": "oh [Music] [Music] assalam alikum and welcome to in the company of Scholars in the studio today we have two guests Amar Al Manet and my brother aim alakim both of the scholars today will be speaking on the subject of marriage and we're sure it will be interesting because marriage is something that many of us have to face and so we need to have advice from the scholars before we get into something like that today we have U many websites and interaction with people on cell phones and other media where they seem to uh speak with the opposite sex quite a bit now what is the how do we go in the 21st century as far as communication is concerned with the opposite sex via these media is it permissible for us to use the Internet is it permissible for us to use the cell phone chat rooms and things things like that what is the The View on the scholars on on that specific subject first of all I believe that it is important to emphasize the fact and correct me if I'm wrong that Islam promotes and encourages pre-arranged marriages in the sense that it forbids relationships before marriage marage simply because the cons are far greater than the pros when you have a relationship before marriage and that is why pre-arranged marriages mean that you have to and this is a misconception that a lot of the non-muslims may think of pre-arranged marriage they think that this means that a woman is married against her will without knowing her future spouse to be without having any say in that and all of this is not the case in Islam we need two permissions to get the marriage going and that is the consent of the woman the girl to be married and the consent of her guardian her who's usually the father so there isn't any forced marriage no one no girl can be forced to get married she simply says no that's it but if she were to choose someone she likes and she would like to get married to this cannot be without the approval of her guardian so that it would balance the emotions in exchange to the benefits or whatever it can be measured so if we look at it from this perspective then we can talk more about the chat rooms about the websites that conduct marriages and arranges marriages so what you're saying is with these websites people send their profile and they send a picture and they tell a little bit about themselves and they hope to find somebody of the opposite sex that they can hook up with or marry or get to know how should it be done first of all is it permissible and secondly if you wanted to join How would you do it well what is the right way that you should I believe I believe that you cannot have a one size that fits all so we cannot generalize and say it's permissible and we cannot say it's not you have to look at each and every process individually and separately if the Islamic conditions and the things that Islam forbids were avoided the precautions were there then alhamdulillah it's okay for example I've heard about a number of websites in the state where it became like a dating service so the guy goes in he serves the net and he goes to this website he looks at the photograph of the girl he gets her email he gets her mobile and he claims to be interested in getting married he gets her contacts he contacts her and they Exchange you know conversations chatting maybe pictures and maybe they meet they go to the extent of meeting in some place just you know with the intention of getting married this is what Shan wants and this is completely is out of the question no one allows his daughter or sister to do such a thing or engage in such a thing because eventually it will lead to Haram to something that's not permissible but if a person posts his or her profile and you have a committee of trustworthy people looking after such proposals and profiles and they match profiles together and once there is an agreement or Primary in a sense consent they follow it from there with the Guardians of the girl and he meets the man and it becomes a normal engagement this is in permissible brother what came up in the in the topic was that we still have to follow Traditional Values we still have to follow the values that are spoken about in the sunah and Quran but today we have a lot of people modernizing wanting to modernize Islam and they wanting to say well we need to look at the Modern approach to marriage for example in the USA versus South Asia you have different concepts of marriage how marriage should be entered into what should we do in America should we use the same Traditional Values as we would in South Asia how would you get that across alhamdulillah it's very difficult to know what people mean when they say Traditional Values and first of all I would say that marriage is a fundamental necessity in Islam and so it has a high priority over many many practices that have been instituted to help people be married so we find in the reality in the Muslim world today anywhere you go many so-called traditional practices are actually barriers preventing people from doing their Islamic Duty so that people delay marriage till midlife far beyond the age in which it is a necessity for them to be married and so many traditional practices actually open the doors for Shayan that people have to find something some path outside of marriage to solve their natural desires that are part of human nature and so so I'm afraid of that that word tradition what we have today for example example in the west are millions of Muslims who live very often as individuals who don't have a support system from family and relatives and community and so they're looking for marriage for an Islamic reason as Muslims they're free in the society to go out and do anything they want the reason that these Islamic websites and such have been established whether they're perfect or not I mean obviously one would have to look at the details of each particular particular site but they've been there to meet an Islamic fundamental need which is a human need and people want to find Islamic solutions for their problems that's the only reason they're going there because of course if they were only going there to look for something wrong they could do that elsewhere but as the Sheikh pointed out there are Temptations and dangers inherent there and so Islam advises that if two people are looking for uh marriage they don't meet unless they under supervision or chaperone of an elder hopefully relative of the Bride or somebody appointed by her family or leader appointed by the community to chaperone that process and so in the Muslim Community today we try to provide people depending on their particular situation solutions that will fit them so they're people who have a strong family and they're part of a a cultural group that has related cultural group it's easy for them to as you said arrange marriages which basically in Islam to clarify what that means it means arranging meetings between the young man and young woman so they can see whether they are compatible with each other under supervision of the family so somebody comes for example from South Asia and they're in a community where there are many many hundreds of families from the same area and they have the same cultural background that's very easy but there are also many Muslims who do not have that so they have to find some other alternative and I used to be very suspicious and I still have a lot of reservation about these the internet websites but I know that many very good people with the right intention have been successfully married on those sites and so I don't believe that the primary reason they exist is to undermine the teachings of Islam but to find a way of living as a Muslim under circumstances that may be not ideal well when we come back from the break we're going to carry on looking at the the subject of marriage and we're going to look at the doy system and how it affects Muslim [Music] today asalam alaykum and welcome back we are discussing marriage today we have been looking at different aspects of marriage and we're going to now talk about something that is well known in in Asia and Africa and that is the DI system um paying money or paying in cows or paying in cattle for the person that you want to marry now how does that fit into Islam so we're going to look at this and speak to our our Scholars here and see what they have to say on this specific subject should someone be forced to pay for example in Africa they have to pay 40 cows for the wife that they want to marry 40 cows is a lot first of all we're looking at the topic marriage we're not looking into marriage none of us is interested not anymore for God's sake but I believe brother Amar he was just talking about the definition of Dai I know Dai in Arabic so we know that the Dow is mAh or as mentioned in the Quran s which is something that is mainly or usually physical given to the bride to be and in Islam this is the trend now I believe that other countries have it the other way around doy is actually a word that refers to uh money that must be paid by the family of the Bride to the husband this is an unlam practice it it was practiced formerly in Europe still practice today in Asia and Africa where the husband is doing a favor for the woman by taking her off the hands of her family and now she comes and lives in his household among his family so basically the woman goes from being the servant to her father and her parents becoming the servant to her in-laws and if the proper dowy is not paid paid and if they ask for more diary and are not given it then she can be abused she can be even sometimes killed because she is considered basically worthless and she is not a proper daughter-in-law she's not serving the family property and in Islam what you call Mahar or sad is actually how the husband demonstrates his capability of caring for and supporting his wife and his seriousness in taking her as a wife with the intention of being married to her for life and so he gives her a monetary gift something of value money gold silver it could be anything depending on the culture most of us don't have room for cows in our at my house they don't allow us to have cows unfortunately not to mention what the husband has to pay in forms of furniture renting the house and the whole nine yards it's not only the Mahar is it yeah the Muslim husband is required to support the wife and he's required to provide housing food clothing according to the custom of the society on a level that is expected of a normal person of his culture and by giving Mahar he is showing his seriousness of purpose that he's not there on a date but he's there committed and so it shows respect to the family and his commitment to the marriage and so it's much different than the do system and it's a positive system now it can be abused and I think in some Muslim countries it is so high it is set so high that it's almost impossible for most young men to get married without a lot of assistance and maybe you could tell us more about that I believe that this is a fact in a lot of where I come from in the Arab countries they seem to boast about it and they brag about it that I've paid this much of uh a a diary to my wife or it's the opposite way around the Father of the Bride to be says I demand that I get much so and so in money and it is way beyond the capability of the young man interested in getting married and this unfortunately deters a lot from getting married and one thing that I'd like to point out which is in Islam it's a religion of simp liity in the sense the more people need something Allah the almighty makes it easy for them for example everyone needs to breathe so air is free everyone needs to drink but not as they need to breathe so water is available but it's not as easy as air everyone dies and we're talking about marriage but it's there's no similation none whatsoever I love my wife so don't get me wrong but if you look at death it's inevitable everybody's going to die that's why death in Islam is easy to prepare a dead person wash him perfume him wrap him in his sheets pray funeral prayer take him to the grave in a matter of an hour or two it's over we can't die in America till we can afford the taxes for death then when we get the money together for the tax then we can die not before that so it's not quite so easy but the thing that you pointed out was that marriage is a necessity and people are physically and emotionally ready to get married at a very young age if you put Financial obstacles what you're doing is preventing people from doing what God Almighty has made them to desire and it is a physical and mental necessity for them and so people are putting off marriage until they're in their 30s when they're physically to get married at 18 or whatever age yeah bearing in mind that Islam promotes to make the wedding as simple as possible and not to have any expenses and that's why the prophet said the best blessed marriages are those the easiest so that it would not become a deterrent to youngsters I've seen a lot of the young men not being able to marry until they're 26 or 27 years of age and they have wealthy parents and when I talk to the father he says I'd like him to depend on on himself until he gets a job he's able to support himself on his own and this is I believe that this is wrong because he could be 19 years old or 18 years old he can be dependent upon reliable person but he cannot afford to get married so why deprive him from this right we feed him we clothe him we shelter him but we don't allow him to get married which is something that is natural and it's a driving force that could take him into wrong places today we have a World Without Borders uh we all communicate with with each other we have people from all different countries living in each other's countries is no longer just Americans in America or just South Africans in South Africa or just Saudis in Saudi Arabia the world is is becoming a universal Global Village InterContinental relationship sh and marriages becoming um becoming modern in today's world and people are marrying from one continent to the other how successful do you think those type of relationships or marriages will be if say if you're marrying someone from America and you're from China you know Mah there there's a lot of obstacles and a lot of those marriages are not successful and there's a higher percentage of divorce among people who are married from between cultures and Nations that's because part of the marriage is not simply the sincerity of the couple but they have their cultural baggage they have their expectations what is the role of the husband what is the role of the wife the role of the relatives the extended family what role do they play in the marriage very often the in-laws are directly involved in many cultures in the daily life and decisions of the couple many of us want to be totally independent when we're married and not take orders from our parents or our in-laws and so a couple who get married and have not discussed these things in detail in advance of the marriage and decided in advance how they're going to do how they're going to make decisions they are often in trouble so it's very important today that they get counseling and advice from people with experience so they can be prepared for the possibility of a conflict arising in their marriage it it's bound to happen it's not there's not really a question but Allah knows these things are extremely common if I may add I believe this has nothing to do with Islam it is a cultural thing because even if two to get married and they are the best of D and Scholars in their knowledge the woman comes from the East the man comes from the West if they live somewhere it has nothing to do with Islam the woman feels homesick she's away from her parents from her loved ones relatives friends she's in a new environment Community City she loves her husband greatly but she has 24 hours a day and she only sees him for like six or seven hours and the rest of the day she doesn't know what to do so it I don't think it's an Islamic issue but it's more of a cultural or social issue that should be tackled even if you get counseling before marriage we can all sign on contract papers and agreeing and pren knobs and so on but when it at the end of the day it's the four walls I'm stuck in and if you don't have something to occupy me and take the load of my thinking the pressure then they're bound to be a problem unless Allah chooses otherwise we have people migrate all over the world so they are living in the same place and that's their home but they come from some other place originally or their family came from somewhere else and so when you're a young person obviously you're not married when you get married usually you have an an idea of marriage which you receive from your parents and your relatives and that can be very different from one place to another even among Muslims and your family also for example they some cultures as I said the bride is expected to be very obedient and submissive to her in-laws and so they can be very demanding and expect that she will spend all of her free time for example with her mother-in-law perhaps every single day and uh things like that arise from time to time and so Muslims often think that since we're all Muslims we're not going to have these problems but that's not true you have to talk about them and you know be aware of them in advance and decide how you're going to deal with things and so it's not just about homesickness but the fact that our idea of home is a different idea but I think that if this is the case if they all are all from the same home that is let's say the states they all migrated to the US and now this is home for them then the cultural differences I think it will eventually evolve they'll be both of them they'll be conditioned to each other what I was referring to if you're having someone move into your culture or your country this is a topic that needs a lot of discussion and we need to go into it in more depth in in the future inshah uh as we see that basically give an overview website dating website online marriages we need to to look very carefully at what sites we choose um traditional versus modern arranged marriages need to be uh consulted with uh people respected people in our community before we just go ahead with them and arranged marriages especially intercon InterContinental arranged marriages we need to make sure that we also speak to Elders about these things so next time we come back and we can continue on the subject and inshallah we can go into more detail I thank my two guests that have been with us today um thank you for being with us and we look forward to seeing you again inshallah assalam alaykum"
