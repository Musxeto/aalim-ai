  "transcript": "some people have the misconception to believe that worshipping allah azzawajal is to go into one message it sit there 24 hours seven days a week and do a thicker and this is not worshiping allah azza wajal because you need someone to feed you you need someone to take care of your children and family you need someone to take care of the community so what's your role in that I'm worshiping Allah so JAL no you're not you are a beggar we call it an Arabic sha hat you waiting the message for people to put their hands in their pockets and give you money and you say alhamdulillah you have this 1,000 long prayer beat 1000 is a little bit too much see I'm making too much thicker who are you counting it for are you counting it for Allah Allah knows everything he will not miss one count are you telling yourself about it then you're crazy you don't know what you're doing this is showing off subhanAllah subhanAllah you don't need to count do it without any numbers but when you do it like this you're showing off that listen look at me I have this 1000 prayer long beads and this is for making dhikr I'm a righteous person what is worship then how can we worship Allah okay in order to know and understand what worship means it is a word that includes everything that Allah loves anything that Allah loves and is pleased with both of words rhetoric and deeds both open and hidden this is considered to be robada by this definition when you go with your spouse take her out for dinner intending to please allah azzawajal this is a form of worship when you drink a cup of coffee or tea when it's 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. so that you become stronger to pray 200 drinking coffee or tea is a form of a bada when you are kind to someone who's lost and you guide them for the sake of Allah this is a form of a bada so being positive in your community is a form of a bada helping others is a form of rebirth not only limited to prayer fasting and giving zakat which is or which are one of the pillars of Islam but rather expand this a little bit further"
