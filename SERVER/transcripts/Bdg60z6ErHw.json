  "transcript": "first question is about some investment she says my husband's going to put some investment into a business where he's going to be she quotes a sleeping partner that's somebody who actually doesn't do the work but collects some of the profits she says he actually is going to receive a certain fixed amount of profit whether there's a loss in the business or not she wants to know is this kind of investment allowed well uh a sleeping partner reminds me of sleeping sales and I I don't like this this uh terminology but uh um in Islam it's one form of dealing and it's called in Arabic mud and mud is when a person provides the money and the other person or his partner provides the work this is permissible in Islam providing that they are equal in the sense of loss and gain so if I put 100,000 and he is actually taking the money and working with it if the project loses I lose the money and he loses his effort but if the project wins then I get my percentage which which is something that we've agreed upon uh previously which let's assume it's a 70 30% or 802 depending MH and this is acceptable but whenever the profit is fixed with with with guarantees that it would never lose then this becomes RBA this becomes usury because it's like me lending him the money and saying to him that I need 20% fixed uh uh profit not interest fixed profit so whether he works or he buys a house or he does whatever he wants all what I care about is my 20% and there isn't a project that is not uh acceptable uh susceptible for loss all projects are susceptible for gain and loss so this is unacceptable it has to be uh variable there is a possibility of losing and there is a possibility of winning okay so let me give you another angle today say somebody says you have to you see these projects where you can invest money into a housing complex and they say they'll guarantee you they're going to give you rental for a year which is a fixed amount of rental you sign the Doty line you give the money and every year the rental comes it does this work in the same situation is it like an investment this again if they guarantee mhm no this is unacceptable because then they're guaranteeing that someone is going to rent it what what happen if somebody does not rent rent you would go and say well I need my rent they'll tell you we don't have anyone to rent it well I have my contract you promise that you give me 20,000 uh uh per year and I want that no this is again it goes back to square one regardless of the different names they give it okay the second question from the sister is regarding the she says I pray the night prayer sometimes and I doubt uh with myself what's the best time to pray and she says I get a 1 hour before the fud prayer pray and I pray and I do my she said is this the best time that one hour before the well it depends from person to the other our Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam as narrated by may Allah be pleased with her told us that the prophet wasam prayed at the very beginning of the night which means after Isa prayer and he prayed in the middle of the night and he prayed at the very end of the night so it depends it varies from a person to the other Abu for example he told us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam advised him and instructed him not to sleep before performing W wit prayer which means that Abu H used to pray at the very beginning of the night so it it's all"
