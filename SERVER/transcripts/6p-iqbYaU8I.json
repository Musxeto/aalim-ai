  "transcript": "foreign contraceptive pills how Menses started to be more than usual so the first month she got like more than 15 days and the second month she started to call the doctor and the doctor gave her more pills to cure her overflowing of Menses but then it just went worse and we don't know what exactly is a month for her to decide like this is 15 days in a month and now she's she keeps getting discharges and I've advised her that once the discharge starts to look like more like a period then that's her period and when it starts to go back to the original light discharge then her period has ended and she doesn't know exactly the day it is to come in a month because it keeps on coming in 28 days and that means two days earlier than the last period and but she knows that it's six days it used to be six days but that's how now she's praying but we relax some advice as long as she does not know when the fixed date in the lunar month where her period usually starts then she should go to the second level or type of distinguishing her period through the characteristics that are accompanied so when she gets the cramps and the color and the smell of the uh the discharge the blood is similar to her usual Menses then she should stop praying and fasting the moment it stops as you've stated is six days usually so if it's six or seven days and it stops she takes social and she resumes to pray and fast and act normally doing this that is cleaning herself and Performing Guru for each and every prayer once that time is due and once the time is over and the new time of the prayer is uh due she has to clean herself and perform mudu and pray until she sees the change of characteristics of such blood uh resembling her Menses then she should stop and Allah Knows Best"
