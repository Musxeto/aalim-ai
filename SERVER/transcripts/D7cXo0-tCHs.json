  "transcript": "for knobhead now we have okay let me go through that again this name says when reading the route illiberal him which is mean a solitary brahimi I doubt if I read Allah Allah Allah Muhammad so after I read allahumma barik ala muhammad i go back to reading allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad again this is due to me doubting if i read it properly do I need to repeat my prayers I don't remember all the prayers I did this in what should I do the issue of assalatu Ibrahimi we have the shoud adhere to lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat and then we have oscillatory Brahimi allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammadin a long vertical muhammad nur muhammad today the ruling of a solitary Brahimi is an issue of dispute some scholars make it a pillar others say that it is a Sunnah and others take the middle path and say it is mandatory if you forgot it then you offer through the Sahu if it was deliberately done then you have to repeat the Salah but if it was out of forgetfulness and you remembered after like an hour or two your prayer is valid and no problem on you but there are scholars that said it is Sunnah even if you don't recite it then your prayer is valid and she recognized I mean it's one of those therefore the rule is that if you repeat something in the salat you've added to it and the repetition that requires you prostrate for forgetfulness accordingly after saddam is when you add something that is mandatory or something that is a pillar so instead of offering to sujood in the first tracker I offered three sujood and only remembered after I stood up so I said I gave myself dope slap slap and I said what is this I forgot completely about it then what to do continue my salat as normal offer Salam at the end of it then offer to attitude of salute to forgetfulness prostration some sometimes I may add something that is mandatory so I say subhanAllah billahi min record and I add to it subhana rabbi o Allah now this this B is mandatory but it's in sujood not in record so for adding something that is mandatory in this case I have to offer salute or forgetfulness after Salam scholars say that if you add something that is neither a pillar nor mandatory that is Sunnah then there is no suits our own you example I want to go for the record and say Allahu Akbar and I raise my hand again or a third time three times out of forgetfulness out of ignorance out of whatever the same salat is intact I do not offer any SuJu the circle for that which brings us back to the question of this name when you repeat allahumma salli ala muhammad whether you said it or not and then you say again allahumma barik alaa muhammad which you had already said according to the scholars who say it's a sunnah then your prayer is valid and there's nothing on you inshallah and you can continue to pray without forgetfulness sujood especially if you have this reoccurring every salat so this is from Shaytan and it is OCD ish state and Allah knows best"
