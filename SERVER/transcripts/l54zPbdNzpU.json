  "title": "Ruling on backbiting a non muslim - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sent us a question and she says if I back bite a non-muslim and they hear me do I have to ask for their forgiveness or is it enough to just repent I feel as if we are okay with each other and there is no hate first of all what is the ruling on back biting the consensus of Muslims that back biting another Muslim is a major sin it is prohibited it is like eating the flesh of your own brother while he's dead so this is not our topic or issue the issue of backbiting non-muslims so if you ask Muslims probably they would say non-muslims it's okay for them or for us to do whatever we want because they're not Muslims they deserve it and this is a big mistake first of all in Islam it is prohibited to transgress it is prohibited to oppress the non-muslims so it is not befitting for a Muslim to use vulgar language to use bad words whether to a Muslim or to a non-muslim so backbiting them if it was related to their physical appearance his fat his thin his short his ugly his this his complexion is like that his hair is this or that this is prohibited because you are making fun of unlost creation who created him like this Allah he has nothing to do with it so are you making fun of Allah's creation this is Haram one says he's a kafir they said even though Allah created him so you're not allowed to do this secondly if it is not something related to his physical appearance something to his actions something to his character it's not at all befitting for a Muslim to be indulged in such cheap talk a Muslim has to utilize his time in what is beneficial we could spend all day long making fun of enemies of Islam or of kafirs but what's the benefit of it and unfortunately if you look at the social media or the things that people read so commonly in their day time you will find that it is filled with Haram most of the time so they are reading circulating and spreading things that do not be fit Muslims therefore backbiting a non-muslim is not permissible however if a person fell in such a mistake is it advisable for him to go and seek forgiveness the answer is no do not go because seeking forgiveness in such a fashion would be humiliating a Muslim yes if you took his money you have to give it back and seek forgiveness if you transgressed physically yes you have to be punished for that and he has to get even but in backbiting this is because of it's an issue of dispute among scholars I believe that it is not befitting for you to go and apologize simply try to rectify this by giving him a gift being kind but do not apologize and to be in a better situation do not even go down that line or that road do not indulge in backbiting or chit chatting even if it was about non-muslims because this is not the character of a true Muslim"
