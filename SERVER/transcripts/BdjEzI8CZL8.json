  "transcript": "as a friend borrowed money which i knew he could not return back due to his financial condition so in my heart i for i forgave it but did not tell him if he comes in a position to return it can i accept it can i take this money back first of all forgiving something that you had lent to someone who's in need is a great deed in islam and you'll be highly rewarded for it when you drop off a debt upon someone who is unable to pay it off allah azzawajal will highly reward you for that secondly gifts in islam are not mandated until the one that you give him that gift possesses it and has it in his control to do whatever he wants so a promise is not binding if i go to a person and say to him oh your wedding is next month well i'll buy you a refrigerator for your kitchen and he says oh zak allah that's very kind of you and i changed my mind and he says where is my fridge said i'm i'm not going to buy it sorry he doesn't have the right to say this is my fridge even if i bought the fridge and it's in my home waiting for me to give it to him because he did not possess it so any gift that does not change hands and becomes in the possession of the one given to is not binding i give my son i give my brother ten thousand dollars as a gift and i show him the money i show him the check i'll show him the gold but i do not give it to him in his hand he does not possess it yet and then i change my mind i have the right to take these 10k and sell it throw it buy things with it and he has no right in demanding it because the gift was not finalized thirdly if i did not verbally say it rather it's in my heart so he took a thousand euros from me and in my heart i said i'm not gonna take it a month later he comes and brings the thousand to me i didn't speak about it it's just an intention there's no problem in taking the money and putting it in my wallet or using it or spending it there's no problem because i did not say anything that was an intention only fourthly if i were to tell him so a month later i told him listen bro the thousand euros you borrowed from me by the way it's a gift from me i uh dropped off this loan and it's yours you don't have to return it can i change my mind a week or a month later and ask for it the majority of scholars say no this is prohibited on the basis of the prophet alaihis salatu saying we muslims don't have the a bad example we have the highest and the best of all examples a person who retracts his gift is like a dog vomiting than eating its vomit and this is disgusting and gross but this shows you how bad it is for someone to retract his gift now the majority said that you cannot retract it after notifying him that you dropped your right in this loan why because he already has it in his hand in his possession so by declaring that you've dropped it then the gift has been delivered and this is the most authentic opinion and allah azzawajal knows best so again we got we're confused what is it that you want to say if it's an intention you did not tell him about it if he returns it you can accept it it's best that you as long as you made it for the sake of allah to give it to someone else who's in need or giving in charity but if you don't it's your money without any problem"
