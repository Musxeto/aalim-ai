  "title": "If I don't pray sunnah prayers but decide to pray them after fard, is it permissible assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sure my question is um can I pray Sunnah prayers which are before part after part when I for example first just want to pray for it and I have to pray for I think to myself why didn't I pray the Sunnah before if you missed the Sunnah before the fart let's assume it's the prayer and you prayed directly and afterwards you said to yourself why didn't I pray the four raka before that I should have done that and you made it up afterwards inshallah this is permissible because whenever someone misses the Sunnah he is allowed to make it up as mentioned in a number of hadiths and the prophet himself made some of these sunnahs after the father himself so I hope that this is permissible inshallah"
