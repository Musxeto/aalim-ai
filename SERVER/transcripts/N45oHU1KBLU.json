  "title": "Marriage after commiting Zina - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "amatulla says that a sister committed zina may Allah protect us all and then she repented now can she marry a Muslim man and is she obliged to tell him then clarify her past with him the answer is it is totally prohibited for her to expose her sin that Allah had concealed so she must not tell a soul not her father not her mother cos it's gone it's done the damage has been inflicted Allah as usual is the most forgiving she seeks his forgiveness and keeps it between him and her and Allah is most forgiving but she is not entitled to tell potential spouse at the potential suitor or a friend or a relative no matter how close or how far this is a sin that has to be buried till her death and she is not considered to be lying and the biggest mistake that a lot of the Muslims do is that even after they get married they feel remorseful to the extent that they tell their spouse about their past and all hell breaks loose this is a big sin not only that it affects your marriage as well so only with all due respect idiots do this keep what is in the past in the past and Allah is most forgiving"
