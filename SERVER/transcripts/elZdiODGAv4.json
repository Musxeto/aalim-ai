  "transcript": "uh i have a question regarding investment in business okay so um we have uh we are planning to invest in a gold jewelry shop so the their scheme is you invest some amount of money will be giving you fixed amount of money every month okay and and at the year end they will calculate whether their business has made a loss or profit and accordingly i just uh like giving them back or giving us more so at the year end they will give the net statement and based on that they may take us the more profit they have given us every month or give us more if they have made more profit than what they have given us totally this is totally prohibited it is totally out of the question to give an investment regardless whether it's gold or not but the scheme you're talking about involves also which you did not mention giving you a portion of the gold that you've invested in according to the prices of that day and this is totally prohibited but let's assume it's not in gold we are investing in selling pens and you give us a thousand dollars and every month we give you a hundred dollars and at the end of the year we gave you twelve hundred dollars we'll calculate the ins and outs and how much profit we made and how much losses and then we make the check and balance this is not permissible this is more equivalent to because people usually say whether in writing or they insinuated that the thousand dollars i'm giving you as an investment this is not uh susceptible to loss meaning this is my capital you invest it you give me profit and if there are losses you return my capital intact as it is i'm not losing a penny over that and this is crystal clear because the thousand dollars is a loan whatever profit you're making is interest and the capital is intact and this is totally prohibited if you add to that that we will give you a portion of the gold this is also haram because you're buying gold in installments and not in in presence simultaneously and this is also haram"
