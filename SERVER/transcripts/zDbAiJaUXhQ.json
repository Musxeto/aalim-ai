  "transcript": "my question is about the hadith uh of going to jumuah early and walking there and sitting beside the imam et cetera my question is um how early do we have to go before the football in order to receive the reward of you know getting fasting one year for every step there isn't anything specific mentioned in the hadith indicating that it should be half an hour an hour four hours six hours some scholars like ibm may allah have mercy on his soul in fat mentioned when he spoke about the hadith where it says whoever goes in the first hour as if he sacrificed a camel second hour as if he sacrificed a cow third hour as if he sacrificed a sheep as if he sacrificed a chicken as if he sacrificed an egg so these are five hours so scholars differed are these hours hour hours of the day and it seems that these hours are divided right after sunrise till the time of the jumu'ah so it's actually between seven and twelve about give or take five hours so a real hour now in the hadith mentioned the the prophet isalam five things in the beginning he said whoever goes early and takes proper russell how early he did not mention so we cannot prejudge this and say oh you have to go five hours before the khutba four hours three hours two hours one half i cannot say but all what i can say is you have to go as early as possible so if you go like half an hour before the khutba and half of the masjid is full you would not fall under the same category as the first person who came and opened the masjid maybe at 11 o'clock maybe at 10 30 maybe at 10. so you won't be in the same reward so this is left open from allah azzawajal according to your ability to your circumstances and allah will reward you for that don't use an auditing firm to say you have this much hassanat you have this much bad deeds it doesn't work like this you try your level best and allah azzawajal is the most forgiving the most merciful"
