  "transcript": "izner says i have whispers and part of my whispers are evil maybe things about shirk maybe about kufur maybe mocking islam and i don't know why but lots of muslims are getting these whispers well actually i do know why but a lot of the muslims who consult me get these whispers and with the grace of allah azzawajal it's very easy to counter it the prophet said in an authentic hadith allah for my sake has forgiven my ummah my nation my followers for whatever crosses their minds as long as they do not talk about it or act upon it so allah azzawajal has forgiven these whispers and thoughts are you blocking them are you fighting them he says yes are you happy and content with them this no no no never then you have nothing to worry about but sheikh i got these whispers i got this evil thought of shirk and i smiled while i'm asking you did you smile because you're content and happy with that thought if the answer is yes then this is kufur if the answer is no shaykh wallahi i would never smile but this is an impulsive reaction that happens unintentionally i said you have nothing to worry about this is from shaytan i saw a brother once in my neighborhood when he prays he always does this he smiled i hope they don't make a meme out of this these guys are crazy so he's smiling like that in the salat and i noticed that this happens only in salat and that the poor brother is not even aware of it so these unintentional movement has uh have no impact on your prayer or on your islam ali from you"
