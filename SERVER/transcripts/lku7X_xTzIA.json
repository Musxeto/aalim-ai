  "title": "Poor financial conditions, can he take riba interest based loan to pay off his debts assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "do for you if my question is uh like if someone uh Financial condition is very bad and there is no good amount of business and in few days he has to pay debts like loan credit card bills Etc it took that loans and great cards uh before because uh due to very bad financial conditions and still he the conditions are very bad and he took the previous loans by intending that intending that uh like he will be returning back and not doing or not like taking the loans again but say now he has repenting back to alarm will accept it and says uh the question is again the financial conditions is same as before now in this case we like if it did not clear the depths then there will be serious issues and there are no one to give him money so Sheikh in this situation is it permissible to go into loans which contest riba this is no matter what it is like quicksand you're already up to your knees in it so you said no I'm gonna try to shake myself out you're gonna think more so it's not logical if you have ten thousand dollars in debts that are interest-based and Haram in order to save yourself from some consequences of it you're willing to take five thousand dollars on interest again to pay some of it but you still be dealing with riba and paying riba and instead of paying for ten thousand you're going to be paying for 13 or 14 000 or 15 000. this is not logical and it's not permissible look for another alternative and may Allah make things easy for you"
