  "transcript": "the next question is is it permissible to pray at home there are only two mosques in my area I believe them to be innovators and they threatened me because I'm following Salaf Malaya if there is a threat upon you as in the case where some deviant sects follow a particular method and this is up to them they can follow the method they wish but when it comes to controlling others so don't say I mean loudly don't raise your hand what is this this is my prayer doing allah azza wajal it's none of your business if I raise my hands or say I mean or if I move my finger into jihad or if I do the things that you don't believe that are part of the spinner it's not as a business but if they are so controlling so aggressive to the stage where I feel for my safety or it would cause more harm you have two options if they are innovators meaning they have corruption in the r√°pida don't pray there go cry somewhere else there isn't any some anywhere else share well lie this is something up to your HT height if their corruption in our tidak is severe such as those who say that allah azza wajal has given the Prophet Muhammad as you Sam the knowledge of the right the Prophet is awesome controls the earth as if he sees or the universe as if he sees the palm of his hand a prophet our Sun is Howser NASA and he sees everything and he controls everything this is these people you cannot pray behind an imam who believes like this totally those who say that the Prophet was created from a lodge nor not from clay not from Adam this is good for blasphemous so you don't pray there pray home and said but if their innovation is something limited to themselves which is not covered but it is a major sin such as believing in the Mawlid such as making congregational dua after salat this is something between them and a large sojourn you can pray your normal prayer because that Muslims and leave them immediately and Allah knows best"
