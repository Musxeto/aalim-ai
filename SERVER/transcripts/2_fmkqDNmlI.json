  "title": "If something seperates me & my friend when walking POLE TREE Is it sunnah 2 say Salam when V reunite",
  "transcript": "I saw this interesting video that a couple of Brothers made a while back if you're walking with a friend of yours on a path and if a tree or a pole gets in between and separates you and your friend momentarily is it part of theah to greet your friend with when you reunite with him again immediately after the split up so what brother Muhammad is asking about is something that was known to be done by The Companions and by the salaf which shows us the greatness of spreading the word of Peace one of the most beautiful greeting phrases that you can greet your Muslim Brothers with unfortunately some of the Muslims quote unquote or Hypocrites if you want find resentment to it it and if you keep on saying alayum they express their resentment say enough enough is enough we don't want to every time reply to your Salam don't do this and this shows weakness of Iman and a characteristics a a characteristic of hypocrisy it is part of the Sunnah to spread the word or the phrase of Salam as the prophet said that this would lead usat to Paradise whenever you spread it because you love one another and when you love one another you will enter Paradise so yes this is a confirmed Sunnah that the Salah used to do but I don't know any Hadith that is attributed to the prophet Alam confirming it the companions used to do it the sah used to do it and this is widely known and Allah Knows Best"
