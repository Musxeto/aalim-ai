  "transcript": "my question is I live with my parents and in my room there's a portrait of me that is my portrait I I realized it was Haram so I took it down uh the problem is my parents reaction wasn't good so my mom yield at me and she spit on me she she slapped herself and most of the time when I refused to do something Haram she uh she does something that is kuur so my question is so what I did was I put the portrait back to reduce the evil is what I did correct uh and how to deal with such parents first of all it is not logical what you're saying the way that your mother behaved means that she has mental issues or you have driven her to the verge of insanity with your behavior now I'm taking a word for what you're saying but if I were to speak to her she would have probably said that this guy is too extreme that he's driving us crazy that he has uh fanatic views and we we're afraid that he will join NIS and blow up places I don't know so you have to first of all look into how you're talking and dealing with them I trust that if you were to be diplomatic and kind and obedient and you know how to approach them they wouldn't behave in such a fashion nevertheless putting the portrait back again if it was to reduce the backfire and to prevent more evil from happening I hope that this is permissible but whenever you want to pray try to cover it without them seeing you and Allah Knows Best"
