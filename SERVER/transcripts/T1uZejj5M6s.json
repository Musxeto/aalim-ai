  "transcript": "can the jins see the angels can the Jin see the angels in Surah Alan chapter 8 Allah tells us that Satan saw the Angels when they came in the Battle of bad and he retreated and fled and Satan is from the Jin so it seems that they can see the angels in some cases but I have no knowledge whether they can see it normally as they see one another or not and Allah Knows Best"
