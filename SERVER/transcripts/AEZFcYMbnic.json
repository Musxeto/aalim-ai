  "transcript": "times and a person who says it a thousand times is more in Iman because the more you say it the more closer to Allah you get the more you pray the more closer you Allah to Allah you get the more you are enthusiastic to go to the first thr in the Masjid your Iman is greater than this person who usually catches one raak at the end of the Salah and he's happy I'm a Muslim I prayed in the Masjid well you have a lot in front of you and a lot of Muslims who preceded you you should try to be there good deeds and among the highest thing that would boost your Iman would be stay away from sin the prophet saidat wasam to one of his companions meaning avoid forbidden things you become the most righteous person of all he did not command him to pray night prayer fast do Good Deeds no no just avoid sin and it is it is a sufficient sin for you to look at something that is Haram that's enough it's enough to listen to something that is Haram so many Muslims putting their headphones and listening for six seven hours for what I don't know if the is doing something that makes them do this all the time what are they doing they're listening to Haram if you utilize this time you get closer to Allah by listening to two or three lectures a day W you'll be a scholar if you listen to three or four lectures a day W you will be a scholar but who can tolerate this who has the patience to sit and listen for three lectures or four lectures a day I guarantee you in 6 months time you will become one of the best dies this is a guarantee do you want me to bet betting is Haram you can bet from one side say okay I bet you sh I give you 10,000 rupees if I don't make it if I make it yeah okay I accept this but these things boost your Iman greatly avoid sin because once you avoid it why are you avoiding it because Allah doesn't approve it Allah increases your IM he gives you a boost in your IM and belief in Allah knows best four qualities mentioned in the Surah ass are there are four different groups or all four qualities in one group please CL it is one group that has all these four qualities otherwise if a group comes and says we are the Believers but we don't do righteous Deeds this is our lecture down the drain then we should not have done the all these four are in one group but if a group has Iman righteous deeds and they recommend each other in truth but they fail to be patient their Iman is less and they're not part of the group because so many times you have righteous and practicing people with Iman with good practicing deeds and they recommend each other for the truth but the minute they are tested there is a Calamity that befalls upon them that affects their health affects their wealth affects their position in their company Islam or my position well I'll take my position Islam will live with all the other practicing Muslims and maybe next year or following decade I will reconcile and ask Allah for forgiveness and nothing would happen so this shows you that it is possible but the group that will be saved from loss is the one that has all these four in it Prophet Sall wasallam said you mentioned some couple of Hadith uh in your lecture so whoever cheat is not one of us for example so does this mean he's not a Muslim for a short period of time or that is not a characteristic of a Muslim did I not mention the answer I think I did and the the brothers acknowledg by nodding their head either because they're listening to the headsets or they're approving of what I said and I think it's the latter I did answer this and I said when he the prophet says does not mean he nullified Islam and I specifically said he did not mean he NFI Islam he simply meant that his IM is not full and that is why when the prophet says he would not believe until he loves to his brother what he loves to himself of Good Deeds of of of good things we said that if I don't I'm a selfish person I don't love for himas what I love for myself I don't want to give him my my the things that I love does this make me a cafir no it makes me a lesser Muslim a lesser believer and this is why the prophet said that Iman is a number in 70 or a number in 60 branches which means that if you fulfill these branches you're a Believer you're a full-fledged believer but if you don't then your belief is missing and you're still a Believer but not a full uh uh believer and that is why it is in branches does following the law other than what Allah has revealed affect our Iman well it depends if it does not go against your belief against your Islam following it does not affect your Iman but uh uh but if it goes against Islam and and uh what you believe following it does affect your I'll give you an example we have traffic laws well I suppose in India you have traffic laws I haven't seen any but I'm inshallah I'm hoping for the best we're supposed to have traffic CLS red light you stop green light you go so does this go against my Islam I'm I'm I'm I'm practicing Muslim red light stop no I'm not stopping I'm a committed practicing Muslim I'll show you who's the Muslim and I go ahead is there no so stopping when the light is red this doesn't go against my Islam and it doesn't affect my Iman on the contrary it may add to my Iman because this is good for the goodness of humanity for my fellow citizen for the Muslims and the non-muslims at large following the uh the laws that do not go against my Islam makes this a civilized place to live in feeling that I'm a Muslim I am Rambo I can do whatever I wish makes this a jungle this is not how a Muslim should behave but if the laws are against my religion they go against my religion I must not follow them unless there is harm not probable but definite and sure that will be inflicted upon me for not following them in this case I can follow them as long as my heart hates it may Allah be pleased with him and with his with his father came to the prophet weeping crying and the prophet calmed him down what's wrong what's happened he said oh prophet of Allah they tortured me and tortured me until I had to to say bad things about you they were torching me to say bad things about you to insult you and the prophet simply said how did you find your heart Amar and he said while crying oh prophet of Allah my heart is calm with Iman I said what I have said but my heart is calm with IM I believe in you I I love you so the prophet told him if they go back to torturing you and asking you to do it go back to insulting me no problem as Allah mentioned in the Quran so if the law tells you that you should for example do this or that that is against Islam I don't know about your laws but anything that is against Islam bluntly clearly you should not obey it if you are if they tell you to shave your beard it's Haram I cannot don't don't obey them if they tell you well if you you don't shave your bead we're going to uh uh give you a fine give me a fine we're going to put you in jail this is not logical you're not serious said yes I'm serious look at the 100,000 Muslims there make hij leave but this is not a cause for disobeying Allah because it is not a a case of necessity and each one of us is different from one individual to the other the definition of necessity once is is necessary to do this thing otherwise it's life-threatening or hazardous there is uh uh room for compromise alhamdulillah and I hope this answers it Deeds without knowledge of the dean become plain rituals for example Salat without understanding any Surah do these still increase Iman do these still increase Iman yes of course they do increase Iman if you do things part of the customs you pray why do you pray everybody's praying I'm praying so do I come to you say ah if this is the case don't pray because you don't have the knowledge sit home a year or two when you get the knowledge inshallah come and pray is this logical it's like the question that people usually ask a person who does not pray is his fast during Ramadan accepted the answer is no but we don't say no so don't fast save your time go enjoy yourself you're a come on enjoy yourself don't do what we doing no we say fast but try to pray is it going to be beneficial for him in the Hereafter no he's going going to get zero credit because he's not praying but it will increase his IM in the sense it will encourage him to pray maybe after a week or two a year or two or uh uh more therefore those who do things out of custom out of practice a woman who covered her head or maybe covers their face why because all the people in the Saudia do this well women up till now uh do this so she's doing it so should we tell her are you convinced she no no if you come to my daugh one of my daughters probably if you ask her are you convinced of the of no but my father tells me to do it I want to please him so should I sell her n shame on you take it off until you believe it's okay no this is not logical they they have to go with the community with the understanding and the belief of the community it would add value to them inshallah eventually but it is not logical to ask them to do otherwise and Allah knows rest can we backbite a Muslim who spreads innovation backbiting has conditions backbiting generally speaking is Haram it's a major sin it's not a minor sin that you can say I I'll say and Allah will forgive me it's a major sin but there are conditions that it is possible and permitted for you to back bite because of the intention among these conditions or situations for example giving advice if someone comes to you and say and says yeah what is the ruling ongoing to she so and so I want to learn from him I want to read a book uh uh to him and you know that he's an innovator you should tell him you should not go go to him he's not following the Sunnah and he's an innovator this is not backbiting this is an advice you're warning someone for example someone comes to you and says so and so propose to my daughter or to to my sister what do you think of him and you know that he is drunker and he fornicates and he gambles and you say mashall Mash Allah he's a rich man and he's a rich man he comes from a very good family and he does come from a good good family but you did not expose the other shortcomings that would prevent him from marrying his daughter or sister to that man because you say you're saying yeah we all have shortcomings maybe Allah will forgive him yeah maybe Allah will not how would you know if he proposes to your daughter would you give him no how how dare you ask us a question he's filth of the Earth how can I give him my daughter okay why don't you advise the other and warn him so this is per permitted if a man or a woman goes to a Muti or to a judge and the man wants to complain about this man who broke into his house and stole his money but then he says this is backbiting I will not no you have to you have to go if a woman has a problem with her husband and she is afraid of backbiting and she Liv in Misery the rest of her life this is not permitted fa may Allah be pleased with her went to the prophet and she said oh prophet of Allah AB sufyan proposed to me in marriage and Abu J also proposed to me in marriage both of them proposed to marry me which one should I take the prophet did not say w I cannot back bite no he said the truth he told her mu sufyan is broke he's not a good man he doesn't have any money at all and Abu Jah is a man who does not leave the stick it's always on his shoulder meaning whatever you do he he hits you but I'll give you another advice marry he's better for you and she married him she was happily married to him alhamdulillah so this is not backbiting among the things that you're allowed to say as and not considered as backbiting describing people for this is not our topic but describing people in order to give them a sign so that people would know them for example m is telling me uh have you seen Muhammad Hassan says who's Muhammad Hassan say mam Hass the fat man now this this back bitey no it's a description or the one who has he limps or he has uh whatever four eyes or whatever all of this is not backbiting because the intention was not backbiting rather it was to describe him as in the of ab may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet prayed two raat instead of four a man as in the Hadith says named they his description is the man with the two hands so we have all have two hands no they is known as two hands because his arms are a little bit long not a gorilla but it's a little bit long so he was known as zul this was not backbiting the prophet himself said what does say he described him as this and the man is in front of him so this is and there other examples but I think this is enough in which is the Dua you would recommend to get consistency in Iman this is not a shopping mall we don't have something from the prophet saying choose this this is best this one is okay in Winter and this one is good in summer you ask Allah and this is aith an authentic Hadith ask Allah to new IM in your hearts so you ask Allah to increase in IM General there is not a specific word that I I can recall now maybe there is but I don't know it to increase your IM but the prophet is saying ask Allah to renew IM in your heart because it wears off as the clothes were off off so it it goes old it goes Rusty it goes you know thin ask Allah always to increase your Iman and recite the this increases your IM when you ask Allah to uh uh hold steadfast your heart on the right path by saying make my heart steadfast on your religion all of these inshallah are good and Allah knows best we know the list of all that are Haram things we do we can easily find out if we are doing am or not for example I know that I don't drink alcohol I know that I don't do adultery but there are sins of Heart Like Pride jealousy we know it's Haram but how do I evaluate myself whether I have pride in my heart or I am jealous of someone the prophet saidat that the man who has an atom weight of arrogance or an ant weight of arrogance in his heart will not be permitted it in Paradise a man stood up and said oh prophet of Allah a man of us would like his dress to be beautiful and his shoes to be beautiful so is this part of arrogance the prophet said no Allah is beautiful and he loves Beauty subhah arrogance is rejecting the truth and uh and looking down at people so this is arrogance the definition of the the prophet Alam rejecting the truth when somebody says to me she this is wrong you have to do this do you know more than I do you have more knowledge where are you what's your uh education who do you know from the shaks this is arrogance I'm rejecting the truth and humilating or looking down at people when someone comes to talk to me I'm a Saudi what are you Indian I'm Saudi so this is arrogance and this means that I will not go to paradise the prophet says the weight of an ant or an atom of arrogance so this what was the question I forgot how how do I evaluate myself yes how do you evaluate yourself you should know yourself yeah look and I always tell my brothers look in the mirror and when you look in the mirror don't admire your Beauty your charm because you need to change your glasses look into the depth of your heart no one knows you except yourself when you look in the the miror when people praise you mallah you are a very generous person mashallah you're very kind person you are good in administration you are good in what you do you are smart you are witty you are when you go and look in the mirror and everybody's saying that you're human humorous you're funny mashallah it's nice to be with you look deep down is your wife saying the same or is your wife complaining why everybody is happy when they're around you but when you are in our house you're always gloomy and and angry as if doomsday is tomorrow why is it this way why do you enjoy the company of your friends and you hate the company of your children then when you look in the mirror you see your shortcomings but if you're fooled you manag to fool everybody else and mallah you also fooled yourself you look in the mirror and say mashallah the prophet if he saw you he would love you mashallah then you are in a very very big problem because fooling yourself is the worst thing that happens you can fool everybody else but you fool yourself as well this is the Doom this is the disaster that was mentioned inah at the very end shall we tell you about the greatest Losers of all it is those who went astray thinking that they are on the right path so if you look in the mirror and you think that you are on the right path though you are actually filled with hatred filled with Envy Envy filled with arrogance filled with liking yourself and thinking that you're better than everybody else then this is the greatest disaster that anyone could have and may Allah protect us all how to differentiate the expression of happiness and getting pride in doing things differentiating between expression of happiness and pride I there's a big difference when you do something you're happy and you're proud of it but there is a difference between pride that reflects upon others and this is known as K arrogance and there is a difference between pride that does not come out only it's inside and this is and both of them are not good is liking what I do when I sit by myself in my room and I say Mah very beautiful lecture I gave tonight and everybody thought thought that I am a modest person and I'm down to earth and yeah I know I know I managed to fool them all but I know myself I'm good I know I'm good this feeling itself destroys the inner uh uh belief of a Muslim because he thinks he's more important and he whatever he does Allah accepted it for granted this is different from the pride that is accepted which is when I do om and I come back and people say mashallah you did om I did om for Allah but when people praise what I did for Allah it makes me feel good so this is okay the prophet was approached by his companions and said oh prophet of Allah one of us does good deeds and then he hears the praise of people and he's happy for that now our feeling of Happiness made us think twice is this for Allah or not for Allah it is for Allah but should I feel happy when people praise me for something good that I have done or should I weep and cry so they're asking the prophet is this okay the prophet said this is in advance the Glad Tidings of Allah which means that feeling proud of what you have done when people praise you for it providing that you have done it for the sake of Allah and solely for Allah not for their praise this is inshallah accepted believing in black magic or not believing does it affect our Iman how important is not believing in black magic may nullify your IM you have to You Must Believe In Black Magic because one it is mentioned in the Quran when Allah says they're doing black magic they are the witches who come and make knots and they BW in these knots they blew in knots also Allah mentioned in a number of stories where he talks about MSA peace be upon him and the sorcerers when they threw their sticks and ropes and it turned into snakes did it turn to a snake no Allah says it's imagination from their magic that it is moving who is he m m is imagining that they are moving and that why that is why he felt a bit intimidated and Allah told him don't be you are with us so you have no reason to worry throw your uhop yeah whatever you know and it turned into a real snake what happened to the sorcerers uh this this is not our doing this is real we know our stuff and so they immediately prostrated and believed in Allah so even M was affected by their black magic not only that the prophet inkari and Muslim was a Jew and he came to the prophet he managed to get some of his hair and he made a spell on it and he put it in some uh parts of the tree of of a palm tree and he hid it in a well and for a period of time the prophet was under his spell but was he under his spell meaning under his control he said Quran that was not Quran he said Hadith that was not Hadith no it is specifically in one aspect of the life of the Prophet that he would imagine that he went to his wives and had intercourse with while he didn't so he used to go to the home and sit with his wives and everything he leaves thinking that he had intimate relationship while the wives are wondering why why is he not as usual with us did we do something wrong and it stayed for a period of time some say six months some say three some say a week some it's a period of time and Allah sent jiel and Mika peace be upon them and they gave him the Rya one sat on his stood on his legs and the other stood on his head while he was sleeping and they started communicating he was listening to them and this is why was revealed some say again some say for the first time so even the prophet was affected by black magic it is there but it is an influence that happens to an individual that can easily be removed by having dependence uh on Allah and always maintaining and observing the r and thear in the morning and the evening and Allah Knows Best when a person fornicates Iman leaves him what if the person died in that state did he die as a disbeliever we have to know that there are three stages there is Islam e andan so the cloud the IM that leaves a fornicator is waiting anticipating until he he abandons what he's doing and and and and U uh leaves what he's doing but if he dies as he is he's still a Muslim and we have to know no matter what you do as a sinner you are still a Muslim as long as you do not nullify your Islam so if I have performed wo I am in the state of woodo and I eat apples do I nullify my woodo why not because I did not commit one of the things that nullify wo and they are a handful if I smoke God forbids do I nullify my woodo the brother says yes what is is the rule did I commit one of the things that nullify wo by smoking no it's a sin yes if someone eats pork in the state of woodoo does it nullify woodoo no because it's not one of the"
