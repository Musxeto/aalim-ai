  "title": "Father died without saying the Shahadah, will he not enter Jannah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "singapore he says in a long story that his father who was pious who used to pray and give zakat and was a practicing muslim passed away last year maybe and he was not attended by any of the muslims he knew only non-muslim doctors so he says can he go to jannah without uttering the shahada first of all how would you know that he did not utter the shahada you have no evidence secondly why do you think negatively of your father it's a rule of thumb that whoever lives on something dies on it as long as your father lived as a righteous practicing muslim praying doing his athkar giving zakat fasting ramadan you should not worry at all that he did not say the shahada because saying the shahada is a plus when we hear it not hearing it is not a minus it could have been between him and allah azza he could have said it between uh in in front of the non-muslim doctors and they did not know what they had heard and even if he did not say it at all what counts is his work this extra whoever concludes his life with allah would enter jannah this is a bonus but so many righteous practicing muslims and companions died on their in their sleep so were they deprived from saying it will will they not enter the general no of course not so think positive of your father and more than that think positive of allah allah is most merciful lies most forgiving he would never cancel your father's good deeds just because of an incident in your head it's not in reality either it's in your head that he didn't say it how would you know he could have said it multiple times and this is something between him and allah says"
