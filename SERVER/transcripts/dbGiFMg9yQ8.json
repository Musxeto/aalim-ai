  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in last time we met we talked about the chapter that deals with which is obligatory or the total bath that is compulsory for a Muslim to take or to have after doing certain things or before doing certain worships and we talked about the different types when it's recommended and when it's obligatory and I believe that we have one last Hadith in this chapter before we move on to the following one so Hadith number 108 narrated Abu Allah's Messenger s wasam said there is sexual impurity under every hair so wash the hair and cleanse the skin uh this Hadith tells us that there's sexual impurity under every hair when a person uh ejaculates or uh has intercourse but the Hadith itself is not authentic it's a weak Hadith so there is no great need to elaborate on it as the the the the correct way of dealing with not non-authentic hadiths uh uh is not to elaborate on them see some schools think that it is highly recommended to apply the weak Hadith the non-authentic hadiths as though they are not authentic yet as long as it's a Hadith then we can apply it in certain uh uh virtues or in in the The Good Deeds not with and you can apply it with but this is not authentic the correct and authentic uh uh verdict of Scholars is that as long as the Hadith is not authentic this means that Allah did not re reveal it to the prophet Alat and therefore it's not a must on us to work with it we have alhamdulillah the Quran and we have the authentic Sunnah and this is enough this is Islam that was revealed to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam anything that is in doubt or not authentic we have no need to look into it so this Hadith is not authentic but it means that when a person performs uh uh the total bath obligatory bath the he must do it thoroughly it's not just only washing your body you have to wash it thoroughly and ensure that the water reaches every single centimeter or inch of your body we move on to the following chapter which uh uh is andum means that some Scholars call it dry ablution and some call it purification by the soil and tum we do it when we don't have water or we when we have something that prevents us from using water such as illness and throughout the the chapter inallah we will try and get more and more information Hadith number 109 was narrated by jabber abdah who will read this for us me narrated by Ja Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said I have been given five things which were not different to anyone else before me Allah made me Victorious by o of threatening my enemies for a distant of one month's Journey the Earth has been made for me and my followers as place for praying and mean of purifications is meaning uh by performing tum therefore anyone of my followers must pray wherever the time of prayer becomes do okay now this Hadith Hadith of jab the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that he has been given five things that no one else before him what does he mean by no one else mean prophets yes prophets no prophets before him were given these five things how many things Mustafa is mentioned here are mentioned here three things or five things five things well no read how many five things you didn't read the five things here three five things here he no read only two the prophet was made Victorious sallallahu alaih Al wasallam by o and fear so Allah will throw the fear and O of him in the hearts of his enemies before he travels to them uh uh the Journey of a one month Journey and the second thing is that Allah has made the Earth for him and for his followers to be a place of prayer and purification so these are only two things and the compiler of the book did not mention the other three as they are irrelevant to the subject which is so if we uh read through the Hadith then the prophet says s the third thing the booty or loot had been made lawful for me and my nation which was forbidden to those before me the booty or loot that is when you have a you have wars and then uh uh the defeated Army floods and you can collect whatever they left over from treasures and and booty and so on before before the prophet Salli wasallam they used to be ordered to put it in one place and then fire from the from the heavens from the SK comes and burns it all Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam our prophet and his followers this was not anymore this was obligated so it's okay for us to use the booty and to use the loot and it's a gift from Allah so this is number three number four the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says and I was I was granted the intercession and uh the intercession the intercession is is called in Arabic does anybody know it so the prophet s wasallam was given the right to intercedes and means that he would ask Allah to either forgive a person who has sins or to increase and Elevate his level in paradise and so on and there are five or six types of intercession that the prophet sallam is given and among all the biggest intercession is on the day of judgment when all the people and when we say all the people imagine from Adam to the day of judgment how many people are there and billions billions of billions all the people on the day of judgment they are afraid they're terrified they don't know what's going to happen to them and as the prophet says am the sun draws closer from humans at on the day of judgment so it it's on the of a distance of a mile and in Arabic mile could mean the distance itself one mile 1.6 kilometer or the thing that is used for makeup for for women and and they put they put this stuff on their eyelashes with it's also called a mile so it could be this close if we assume it's the 1.6 kilomet is still it's too close the prophet tells us Sall alhi wasallam on that day people sweat and they sweat a lot but they are individually and their own sweat according to what they have done in this world according to their deeds so those who are excellent those who are Pious persons and they were following the book to the letter they will be shaded in Allah shade Allah subhana wa tala will not have them see the Sun or be inflicted to to this burning Sun and burning heat but then you have people with good deeds but not that good so they will sweat and the sweat will reach their heels and the prophet tells us that that there are people that will sweat and the sweat will reach their knees and there are people that will sweat and their sweat will reach their uh uh Wast and there there will there will be people that sweat and their sweat will reach their mouths and no noses and they will not be able to speak so it's an individual case depending on your good deeds and your bad Deeds on that horrific day when everybody sees everything and there are no uh there's nothing hiding the prophet Prophet tells us sallallahu alaihi wasallam that the people are gathered in one open area and they're all n as if they were just born yesterday or just born a minute ago SOA the wife of the Prophet Alam you know wondered said to the prophet is this possible men and female in the same place and nude she she didn't see that it was logical because then by Nature he human nature one will look at each other so the prophet saidat on that day there's so much that engages people they don't even have the time to look at these things no one has the time to look at the people in front of them or beside them they are so horrified they are so terrified they cannot do this and it's exactly God forbids if you are in the middle of a highway and an 18wheeler coming towards you doing 120 mil hour and you're definitely dead and there's this gorgeous girl next to you and and she is calling you is there any possibility that you say yes honey no no she's got the the the truck is coming full speed at you and you're dead so the your your your focus is just to save yourself on the that very day all the prophets of Allah are there so the people go to each and every Prophet they first go to Adam and they say his attributes Adam Allah has created you with his own hands and he gave you life and he did this to you and he put you in paradise and did that and that don't you see what we're suffering can't you go and ask Allah can't you intercede so he says no no no I ate from the forbidden fruit I sinned I didn't obey my my Lord's instructions it's not me go to Noah Noah is the the the the the messenger of Allah go to him he so they go to Noah and they say Noah you are the messenger of Allah Allah had sent you to your people for 950 years you stayed in calling Da and you did this and you did that so inter seed so he says well I had a supplication a dawa but I made I put it in the wrong place I I I asked Allah to destroy my people and he destroyed my people he FL made the flood come and and cover the whole earth it's not me look for someone else go to Abraham he's the father of the prophets and Messengers because they are of his descendant and we have a short break please stay tuned inshallah after after the break we will continue with Abraham may Allah peace and blessing be upon him you live and ask all your questions please would like to um comment on that and to give me how can I answer listening to thean and repeating after the MU is similar a highly recommended act of worship so how does she reply to her this is what we call it an invalid analogy uh because simply there is no comparison between answering four out of five in any exam and skipping a such as or a pillar such as the prayer no one is exempt from praying except women during the menes sister also wants to know if a woman has to cover her feet when she's praying the full the greatest representatives of the schools are in agreement it is Haram and welcome back just before the break we're talking about what's the subject we're talking about n uh factual with we talking we are talking about tum but but then I think we went astray a bit but it's still within uh uh the topic in still within Islam we're still talking about Islam in general so coming back to the Hadith which was nared by jab abdah the prophet wasallam was given five things we talked about him being Victorious uh we didn't talk about it but we we jumped to uh the intercession and there are five we talked about uh being Victorious with OE and fear G thrown into the enemy's uh Hearts his enemy hearts and we talked about uh the the the Earth being a place of prayer and means of purification and we will go back to this inshallah again we also talked about the booty and loot that were per being permissible uh and obligated to his followers to him and his followers sallallahu alaihi wasallam and we talked about the intercession and there is a fifth thing which is that the prophet Sall wasallam was sent to all mankind uh previous uh Messengers were sent to their people so going back to intercession the people go to Abraham and say to Abraham that you are you are the chosen one Allah has CH chosen you and has Preferred you and he did this and that to you so uh uh can you go and intercede he says well I cannot I made three lies and I cannot go and intercede to Allah and all the three lies he did was in the side of Allah when the uh uh this Nam wanted to take his wife he told her so that he this king or Tyrant would not kill them both he told her if anybody asks you say that you're my sister because you are my sister in in Islam and this is not considered to be a lie because you're defending yourself yeah and the second one when they asked him his people when he destroyed all the idols that they used to worship they asked him did you do this said no no no the biggest one of them did it ask him just to prove to them that if they can't talk if they can't defend themselves then they're not worthy of being worshiped and uh uh uh the third uh lie he said to be lie when he proved to his people that the stars are not Gods because then he told them that okay I'm going to worship this planet but when the planet uh faded away he said well I don't like things that fade away my God doesn't fade away because if he Fades away then who will control the the the universe then he saw the moon and said this is my God this is bigger and then he he when it faded and when it went away he said the sun is my God it's bigger and when the sun set he said well this is not acceptable my God is Allah so all of these lies are not lies actually but it it is was so critical for him that he thought that they might resemble a sin or so so it's it's not me I'm I'm not to the into the position so where should we go go to Moses Allah spoke to Moses and he talk to him without any intermediates so they go to Moses and they say you are so and so you're the messenger of Allah you're the prophet of Allah Allah gave you tablets and Ten Commandments and did this and did that can you intercede please can't you see what what's happening to us and he says no I cannot I killed a man and he didn't kill him intentionally he was defending the guy and then the guy died he's so powerful he just pushed the guy and he died so what should we do he says go to Jesus Christ may peace and blessing be upon him and upon all the messengers of Allah so they go to Jesus and they say you are the word you are the chosen one you did this you did that so can you intercede he said no I cannot and he does not mention the prophet says he does not not mention any sin he did not mention any wrongdoing and he simply says it's not my place it's not my position go to Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam so they go to the prophet sallallah alai wasam and he says I am the one I'll go I'll do it so he goes and ask permission to enter to the presence of Allah and permission is given and the minute he enters he uh uh perform frustration and Subhan Allah Allah opens his hearts and he says that I start to praise Allah and thank Allah and so and say so many things I never had any knowledge of but it's from Allah until Allah subhana is satisfied and he says oh Muhammad raise your head stand up and ask you will be given and intercede your intercession will be accepted this is the greatest of all and this is the greatest honor and and and and and credit any messenger could get and it is only for the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam again this is not our subject but it's interesting to know something you know every now and then so that you would have this love for the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam he will intercede for us on the day of judgment but do not mix this with what some of them you know weird people weird Muslims do by saying oh Muhammad intercede they're calling the prophet Sall wasallam and he they're asking for his intercession now can the prophet Sall wasallam hear us he cannot he's dead he's in his grave he is in a life that is called bar between life and death life and the Hereafter and he lives in this state or in this uh world but he's not alive like we are doing now so he does not hear us he does not know he doesn't know what's what we're doing so you ask intercession from Allah and I don't want to go into more details because this is going to take ages but intercession it is not something that a person has due to his own power it is something that is bestowed upon him from the almighty so the prophet cannot intercede to anyone which means that it's not within his hands to intercede it's not within his powers so the prophet cannot intercede to non-muslims to enter Heaven this is over it's finished the prophet cannot intercede to those who were mush to go to heaven his uncle the most beloved person to his heart who defended him for so many years AB Talib he cannot intercede for him to go to paradise he's in hell and that is why the companions asked the prophet sallallah Alam they told him Abu Talib your uncle he defended you he did this and that for you now he's dead what good did you do for him he said I interceded only to make him less in punishment in Hell how is that the prophet says and and you have to always remember this before you make a sin he said that the least person to be punished on the day of judgment is Abu Talib and what is his punishment a a burning Stone that's it put in his sandals the heat of this Burning Stone makes his brain boils so he's not in actually in hell in the sense that he doesn't have any Flames coming from all the sides it's only this Burning sewn in his sandals and he is the least being punished on the day of judgment now imagine if Allah forget forgives a person's fornication if he forgives him drinking booze or uh uh doing this or gambling or stealing or killing or whatever if he forgives everything Allah but on the day of judgment he comes to you and say you did not pray F on time this morning and you will be punished for that what would you imagine the punishment to be the minimum is a burning Stone in your sandals so if it if it were if it were to be the maximum God forbids you could you cannot even imagine it and man when you say it's hell man it is hell but yeah the prophet Sall wasallam was with his companions once and he heard a a sound of a falling object boom so he told the companions do you know what that sound is she said Allah and his messenger know best he told them that this is a stone that was thrown from the top of hell and it's just 70 years ago 70 years ago it's just reached the bottom today so it takes you you do the math what the velocity the gravity it took them seven this this Stone 70 years to reach the bottom of hell so punishment in hell is unimaginable may Allah Asel protect us from uh uh from it yes nor uh I listen from someone who said that everybody will go to the hell because nobody perfect nobody always do sins so so is it right no it's not right at all the verse in means that each and everyone will pass over it and this is what we call a and it is as thin as a a hair and as sharp as a sword's edge and it's a bridge on top of hell everyone Muslims and hypocrites those who are to be from the Islamic Nation followers of prophets they are considered to be Muslims providing they have not changed anything they will all pass on this bridge now now non-muslims we believe that they don't have the chance to pass they were they are taken immediately from the day of judgment to hell though who used to those who used to worship cows those who used to worship idols B Buddhists hind all those who worship other gods only Muslims and the Hypocrites and the Sinners would go on this bridge those who are mashallah good Muslims it will be like a flash so they've passed over hell but did they see anything no and the prophet tells us there are there are people that are like a storming wind they pass on it so they don't feel anything and there are people that are you know riding a horse and as fast as possible and there there are people that are walk jogging there are people are walking there are people that crawling on their hands and feet so it it's it's different uh uh here there but in the sense that everyone is going to be punished that's wrong because if I'm going to be punished so what the hell let me do everything that I'm going to be punished for and then Allah is most forgiving no the prophet told us that there are 70,000 of his followers will enter Jenna Paradise without any questioning without any punishment and there's another Hadith that Allah says with that the prophet Sall wasam says that Allah has granted us with everyone of the seven ,000 another 70,000 and you do the math that's a lot of it unfortunately this is all the time we have for today's program we haven't gone through what we wanted to do at the very beginning which is but I promise you inshallah that next time we meet we will go through it and until then a oh"
