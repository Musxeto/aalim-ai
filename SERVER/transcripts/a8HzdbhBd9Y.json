  "transcript": "okay all right Abdullah from Nigeria asked a question about working in Bank the salary from there um is it considered Halal and what kind of work in a bank as well possible I don't know I I couldn't hear the question well but I thought he was asking about working in legitimate areas in the government or in companies but receiving their his salary from Banks well I'll ask I'll answer both if a person Works in a bank and this Bank deals with interest with Rah then his salary is not Halal he should look for another job because he is part of this institution that is fighting Allah and fighting the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam by dealing in riba having said that of course no one tells you to resign today and then beg for the F for the next year no you have time but you have to work from today and spreading your resumes here and there trying to uh uh uh locate a better job that it has permissible uh uh salary now for those who work in the government as teachers and and so on it's okay for them to work there and to take their money from the banks because they're not working for the banks MH it's the government and it's the management that is paying them from these Banks so their work as it is is permissible because they're not helping the banks they're helping the company or the government they're working for and they're getting their money for for the work they've offered so inshallah their salaries are are halal"
