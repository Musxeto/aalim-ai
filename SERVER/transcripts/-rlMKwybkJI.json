  "transcript": "and then she says what's the ruling on posting videos and pictures on social media pictures of women are not permitted it permitted because this defines the hijab when you post your picture on your Facebook or Instagram and anyone can see that then what's the ruling I wear hijab and if you say that this is only exclusive to private group so only my moms can see it we know that it's easy to hack these places and you can't trust everyone else from taking a picture or a snapchat shot and then posting it to someone else and all of a sudden your picture is all over the news so this is not befitting of a woman at all it is permissible for men and children providing that they are decently they're decent in what they are wearing"
