  "title": "How to obtain good manners? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "hamed from jordan asks a very important question and unfortunately this is a Q&A program otherwise I would have spent and taken the rest of the program to talk about this important issue having good manners or what we know in Arabic as a lock the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam that a man on the day of judgment would reach the highest elevation of jannah that only those who are martyred in the cause of Allah and those who pray all night long and fast all day long would reach by having good manners so pan allah and the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said that the closest to me on the day of judgment in paradise from among you are those who have good manners now what do we define by when we say good manners is it when I enter a room and a lady wants to come in I opened the door and says ladies first and she's not a Muharram this is not good manners because she's not a Muharram you should not gaze and look and talk and do all of these things it's Una's Lamech you go on your way she goes her way is it good manners to hold the fork with the left and the knife with the right and cut the meat and eat with your left this is Una's llama cut up what do we mean by good manners good manners is to be forgiving to be kind to be generous to be courageous to be polite not to use abusive words not to slander people to observe what comes out of your mouth to learn how to smile when you meet people of course from the same they're not from the opposite gender and so on so good manners is a lot of things that all fall under the umbrella of Islam now the 1 million euro question or shall I say that 1 million Kuwaiti dinar question is how can we attain this beautiful characteristic throughout our lives because we noticed that when we when we were young we were a bit rude impolite disrespectful and then at a certain time of our lives we started learning the pub diplomacy being polite being kind it gives us a lot of credit but when when we grow old and our hair turns white we come or we become grumpy most grandparents are a bit grumpy they're unable to tolerate the children when they play and they start to shout and scream and become angry and so how can we attain this through our lives till we die Mohammed this is a beautiful question and if you spend your life working on it what life is not a waste the first thing is that you look into your beloved prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam 's biography read his serie read the books of a Shama l for a German for a Tirmidhi or even a suit will do any Shama l that is authentic and try to impersonate him sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and everything that he used to do how he treated them a beautiful book by Cheryl Minaj it and this book shows you how the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to treat his wives his children his servants the nun Muslims the newly reverted Muslims his companions his neighbors those who were openly sinners those who were secretly sinners all types of people around you if we managed to adopt this in our lives and implement it then you will be among those who will be close to the prophet alayhi salatu salam may Allah so she'll make me and you among them and Allah knows best you"
