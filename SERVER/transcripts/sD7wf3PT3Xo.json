  "title": "Can I buy a car on finance with 0% interest & down payment, pay rest on monthly basis Assim al hakee",
  "transcript": "my first what my first question is it permissible to engage in sorry in the West we have this buying a car offer financing however you know Muslims who are conscious of RIBA they defined 0% interest so the dealer they give that so like people who with good credit who can put a large number of money down as downpayment that says 0% interest that could paid off on a monthly basis is it permissible to engage in that coalition if so let's say if they one way to die that person does have enough money saved up and the family understand okay you hold this much if I die paid off immediately they understand that if all that is taken care of is that kind of transaction promised a buffet price from the US you can buy a car in installments from the dealer from the owner providing a very important condition and that is that the final price is fixed so we agree that this is gonna cost me thirty five thousand dollars net nothing else so if the inflation rate goes up the interest rate goes down thirty five thousand remains that if five thousand whether they take a huge down payment or little down payment what counts is the final price whether you pay it alive or dead no problem but even if they say you have to pay it within four years zero interest however if you're one month late from these four years we will add to it interest this is totally Haram"
