  "transcript": "he says should we wash the bottom of our arms and feet or only the top and adam i sincerely advise you to watch videos on how to perform mudu because allah says in the quran in chapter 5 verse uh six if i'm not mistaken or you who believe whenever you want to pray wash your face and arms till the elbows so if i wash this area i'm washing my arm but i if i neglected this area would i have be described or considered to have washed my arms definitely not so the arm starts from your fingertips and it moves on to your elbow and this is your elbow included so this whole area top and bottom must be washed likewise if you knew your foot i'm not that athletic i can't bring my foot here but you get the point in sha allah"
