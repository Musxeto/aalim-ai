  "transcript": "and part of the question again that due to financial restraints her husband sometimes sends her back to their home country without a Maham now this is totally prohibited if he cannot accompany you and you don't have a Mah to travel with you you don't have to travel I haven't seen my mother in 10 years even if you haven't seen her for 50 years disobeying Allah and going against his law is a sin and not going to see her is not a sin because you don't have the means to it if Allah the almighty had dropped one of the five pillars of Islam which is Haj on a woman who does not have a Maham do you think that going to see your mom or just to spend a month with the family back home every year is more important than Hajj definitely not"
