  "transcript": "some people came to a may Allah be pleas with her and asked some non-muslims are giving food in their festivals should we eat she replied don't eat anything except fruits but you said it is permissible can you explain I don't know of any such Hadith that you referred to how could people come to AA may Allah be pleased with her and ask her about Diwali or the likes there were no such things at the time and in order for us to understand the ruling of something of similar Hadith we have to have the Hadith in Arabic we have to verify it we have to see the circumstances our religion is not based on hearsay oh I heard something or I read somewhere who did you hear it from I don't know some she with a white beard coming on TV or I read something on website which website I don't know no this is Islam Muhammad s may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great said this knowledge is religion so the knowledge we learn from Scholars like the Hadith of the this is religion so look who you're taking your religion from you can't just go and learn tap from Tom and Dick and Harry just because he's famous or he's articulate no you have to know which did he get this knowledge from is he qualified does he have Scholars to learn from is his AA sound so this is cascaded to all forms and types of knowledge you just cannot come and say I heard something that AA was ask blah blah blah it has to be authentic now when I say that if things are given to you in festivals as long as it's Halal you can eat it I back this up from the Quran from the Sunnah from the doing of uh uh Al may Allah be pleased with him and from the scholars who spoke about this so I think I rest my case"
