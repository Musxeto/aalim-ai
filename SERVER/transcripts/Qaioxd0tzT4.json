  "title": "Can we follow congregational prayer at home if masjid is near & we can hear the imam?- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "fasal Musa says if I stay near a Masjid and in that message it there is no section for females and from home it's clearly heard the whole Salah so can the sisters at home follow that congregational prayer from home and get its reward this is a question that a lot of the Muslims ask especially those who are in Mecca for example when they are in their hotel rooms and they can see in the distance the harem and they hear the salat loud and clear so the sisters say can we pray in our rooms the answer is no question why if I may ask you sure you can ask the answer is that it is called congregational prayer it is a prayer of Jamar and you when you are at your home or at your hotel room you're not with the congregation you praying alone so even if you hear the prayer you're not in the message it you're not connected to the rows of the Masjid and hence this is not permissible it is like someone sitting at the comfort of his home in front of a 50 inch screen LCD or whatever and this is live broadcasting the prayer from Mecca and we live in the region so it's the same timezone so I said to myself what am i doing let me join the Imam in prayer I can see the Kaaba I'm in the direction of the Kaaba I can hear the Imam I can see everything as if I'm there so it's my prayer valid answer of course no no one says it's about it likewise praying in your house is not valid but share what about those who pray the open area outside of the Masjid in Harlem for example their prayer is valid because all the rows in the harem are connected until outside of the fence over the walls it is connected so they are in the congregation they take the same ruling because the rows are connected but those living up in their rooms they're not connected with it and Allah knows best"
