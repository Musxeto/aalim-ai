  "transcript": "shake my question is that okay if a woman's husband has passed away so is her father-in-law still her a lot of people in my family said he isn't so what is the ruling on that there is no dispute among any of the Muslims that the father-in-law is the Maham of his daughter-in-law of his his son's wife forever whether the son is alive or dead he is her Maham forever until they die they can never get married they can never have any uh um it's like your own father so whatever your family is telling you it is totally bogus and baseless and they have no knowledge of Islam none whatsoever don't ever listen to them"
