  "transcript": "who are the relatives we must keep ties with okay the relatives that you must observe your kinship and connect to them are anyone related to you from your mother's side or your father's side this includes your siblings your uncles and aunts your cousins and your second cousins and your third cousins so all of those are related to you and they're your blood relatives now having said that in extended families it would be quite difficult if not impossible to connect to all of this if I have like 200 relatives therefore we begin with the priorities your siblings then your uncles and aunts then your cousins what extends further maybe meeting them in weddings or giving them a call every blue moon or seeing them at occasions would be sufficient because it is not logical nor feasible to go and visit all of those and spend like five minutes with them that would not be also feasible therefore you have to prioritize but are they my kinship of course they are even your third or fourth cousin and so on"
