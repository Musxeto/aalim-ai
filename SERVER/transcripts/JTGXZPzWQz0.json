  "transcript": "we thank Allah subhana waala for giving us this opportunity to meet once again in his [Music] house and to increase our knowledge and to increase our IM and to become closer as Community as brothers and sisters and we have a coach and the she and the guide today with us she he just did an hour with the youth and it was beautiful and now we have the parents as well and some of the youth have not have also had question to ask so inshah we give priority to ERS and then to the youth inshah sh it's your so then if you want to say something or we St okay this is a question which I received last night yesterday from so I'll start with it what [Music] is proper age of a person or a boy to get married interesting question question what are the characteristics he should look into his bride means if someone looking for 10 things in a girl and getting four or five things four or five or six things as he wants no one is perfect in all aspect except Allah that's the first question second one second part of SC say if a man gets married after his death his first wife uh and living property for his children is the child B with a second wife also gets a share in his property what is the ruling on drinking with your left hand some of you are drinking with their left hand on drinking with the left hand is permissible huh it is prohibited the prophet said when you eat eat with your right hand and when you drink drink with your right hand and when you give give with your right hand and when you take take with your right hand hand because Shan eats and drinks gives and takes with his left so you have to be aware when you drink I'm talking about the youngsters in the front row in the front row because you are negligent you don't intend to do it with your left but sometimes we forget so when you forget you need your brother to tell you and remind you so always make this a habit your left hand never goes to your mouth ever imagine you don't have it and always use your right hand in Bon it I said this so I would Dodge the question and move on to the second question the question that the brother has posted requires a lecture and I did this Workshop in chenai India and it was called half de HD high definition but it's half de and they called it's I think it's on my YouTube it's about uh 16 hours workshop on how to select the spouse husband or or wife why marriages are not happening why are they difficult what are the conditions what are to be required how to sustain a happy life what to avoid and and it's interesting serly I enjoyed itd um but to answer in a nutshell marriage requires a number of conditions for a boy or a girl to be married Scholars have differed some required attaining the age of puberty and some say no even my handed maned but nowadays it's not practical maybe in the past it was accepted especially when there was a potential that one was so afraid that it will go away so I want this boy or this girl to be for my boy or my girl and I'm afraid that if I don't make an early reservation that this would not materialize people change and conditions change and the consent of both boy and girl is required you cannot marry someone who's one year old and say you're married her consent is or his concern consent is essential it's a long uh topic this is not the right time to discuss it but a boy when he is old enough when he has reached the age of puberty and he can assume responsibility then he may get married and it differs from one person to the other sometimes a person who is a boy who is 22 years of age is irresponsible and should not be married and sometimes he can be as young as 15 and get married and lead a happy and successful uh uh marriage so it it differs from one person to the other what's the other question the other question if a man gets of course we talk about the age and the characteristics characteristics are mentioned in the Hadith but you have to expand a little bit more the prophet says in the characteristics of a potential boy whoever comes to you and you are accepting his religious commitment and his moral conduct then you should give him in marriage and for the girl the prophet said a woman is married for her lineage for her wealth for her beauty so get married to the one with religious commitment otherwise your hands will be dusted and there are so many other factors but this is the main thing that comes to mind say if a man gets married and uh after the death after his death uh after well he's married to two wives uh and his property his wealth goes to his children and then the second child from his the F child from his second wife yeah does he get also a share in the property this is not logical if a man has children from one two three or four wives they are all his children so they get a property but maybe the question was a man married a woman and he has children from her then he married a second woman who has children from a different husband so they are his step children not his real children they are the children of his second wife his new wife and he dies do these stepchild inherit him definitely not but if their mother dies and she had a share in her husband's property they would inherit her sh not the man himself so I hope this makes sense to you it's very easy but you're confusing yourself with kill them all and then we will think inah in the future what happens this is your joke don't call anybody people get this on fanatic he's killing people this is a joke like when he said ask about mice in Islam and he said mice is Haram and so big him mous we should kill him and they made a problem out of that oh is talking about killing [Music] mous can I request all the boys to give up those please dring them on the back once you finish you can come back for please otherwise we have here a question by a mother uh what is best to persuade the child not to go astray from our religion apart from Dua of course they seem to have a strong mind of their own see there are things that we can compromise there are things that are permissible for them to take their own choices they don't want to eat vegetables it's up to them I'm not going to shove it up down their throats they don't want to wear certain clothes that they don't feel comfortable with and they would like a a different choice this is their choice they don't want to go with us to places or they have their own choices but there is a red line that we cannot tolerate so we cannot as parents tolerate them doing Haram watching Haram listening to Haram speaking Haram being disrespectful using bad words associating with bad company that is beyond doubt that they are bad influence to them we have to throw the line but we must not put them in confinement and a prison everything that has to go through me Simon says you have you have to eat your Apple Simon says you have to go to bed at this time you have to wake at this time you have to exercise no this is a prison so we have a saying in Arabic if you want to be obeyed ask for what can be implemented can be done if I ask my child to fly he won't be able to do then I will say disobey me but at the same time I must not open the door the Pandora box for my child and then expect Medicals and that he becomes a of the Quran and righteous person yeah with all du respect our children we spoil them when we give them these stupid devices they call them smartphones it has nothing to do with smart it is it is something that takes them straight to hell children even if they go to high school they must not have these devices there's nothing more effective than a [Music] noia call and hang up that's it but when you give them YouTube when you give them face help on Facebook when you give them Twitter and they spend their time like Idol worshippers all our children now are working like walking like this even in normal cases their necks are like this I would suspect in 10 years time even the newborn will evolve like the Darwin Theory into being this this is wrong when you give them iPads when you give them free access to the internet they will watch Tom and Jerry you know what they watch so you have to live an Islamic life if you in your home have OC OS n and you watch movies and you watch video clips and then you tell him we have the Saturday what happen he comes here that goes back into his sinful life into his free mixing mom sits with Brothers in-laws and uncles that are not related to her father sits with strange women and chats with co-workers and have business dinners and and then you want an Islamic environment and you want your childh to go astray I you are planning for him to go astray you don't have a choice either you go 100% Islamic or expect the unexpected it cannot be in between and this is why Allah says in the Quran Embrace and enter into Islam wholeheartedly don't be selective I like beards and long beards because when I go into a a government office they say oh sh come please they give me preference in the RO because I have a long beard but I don't select to be good with my wife or with my children because it doesn't pay off I have to be rude I have to be this and that so in you have to live the real Islamic life make a lot of Dua give example by you being a role model and inshallah things will happen to the best of the question following since you mentioned Mickey Mouse what is the ruling of cartoons and poems in Islam especially when we see that it involved background music can we send our children to play groups so the first one is viewing uh cartoons and poems with background music okay poems with back anything with background music is har so if you watch a cartoon that has good content good messages Islamic messages and you you the music no problem there's no problem watching something that has good content even if it was animated so one says uh Finding Nemo it's a fish is there any free mixing in it no I don't think so there's no they music yes there is music so turn the music off and watch the movie no problem but if it's has bad content mixing between boys and girls love affairs and the music is 24/7 you cannot hear it you can not hear it you have to just how poems it's the same thing poems pleased with him said it depends on the lyrics if it's good then it's good if it's bad then it's bad music is totally prohibited in the background in the front ground in the backyard is totally prohibited even if it is accompanied by Quran and I've seen this people reciting Quran with a symphony symphony playing music all and and the music is playing behind him in some weak countries what is this this is C making fun of of Allah but they think that this is Hal out of ignorance it's the ruling to Allah third question was about can we send our children to playr what is playr nurs and yeah yeah okay if the nurseries or the kindergartens a preix they can't freix no problem but the problem is that if they feed them pork as in UK or Europe or America they have lunch meals they feed them pork this is not if they have music 247 all the time they play and dance and this is not permissible if they celebrate Christmas and they give gifts to the children on Christmas is not permissible so we have to look at the whole situation and see the details and if it's Hal there is no problem uh I have one another question I think I need to take some is there anybody has question you can okay you hear the mic onam I have a question on uh the concept of uh passive income uh passive income is the the work that you apply to whatever you're doing is small in proportion to the money that you want I'll give you an example uh you have uh um an apartment for rent you recover your original investment and then uh anything you get after that is your profit so that's one uh example of passive vome uh another one would be uh a franchise so you get royalty from the business uh by people using your name a third one which is a little bit more controversial as far as I'm concerned is where you have uh something like a pyramid scheme so you have uh a business that pays you commission uh or a referral commission based on the products and services that another company is offering so this commission is being earned from you as an individual and to somebody else so at the end of the day the man on top with the person sitting on top of the organization gets a share of a commission where he's not working but the people below him are working so that's another example of passive income so I just if you can just shed some light on the concept of facet income with related to these three examples I have no knowledge of this facet income in my life but to answer your questions according my voice sounds nice why because it's different okay um so to answer your first example you bought a property you paid for the property and now you're getting rent this is not passive income this is income there's nothing as passive in Islam so these new terminologies do not relate to Islam you look at each Case by case and get the verdict renting there's a big chapter of called whether it's physical personal renting meaning I'm renting myself to do service for you or I'm renting property Vehicles Etc so this is nothing as if this you're renting your property second was example was what franch franchising I have a brand name and this is a recent issue given to the uh the community and Scholars looked in it brands have a value and this is why the most valuable and expensive brand in the world [Music] is Apple so we know that Apple has a brand name even if they do not sell their property their merchandise they just sell the brand itself it cost billions so brand do have a value you have the right to not be violated through people taking your bride uh brand without your permission you have the right to frenchise and this is also falling under the category of renting now pyramid scheme is a different issue Al together because the essence of the business of multi-layer marketing or pyramid schemes Ponzi schemes is and the scholars have said that this is Haram why they say that the origin of the business is not on selling and buying it is on getting Commission so the bottom layer of the pyramid we have a gazillion people and they are all interested so that they can have another layer underneath them giving them money and those give money to those on the top and the top and the top and the top all pyramid scheme companies such as gold quest uh business and they have gilian names they come to you and say listen we have a product and this products actual value in the market is one real 100 F and we will sell it to you for four qu din but when you buy it you're entitled to Market it and if you Market it to two we will give you a percentage of course you will Market it to two who will buy it for 4 KDs and will Market it to other two too so the company has in essence are making money of Haram of it's a Cony scheme I got a person coming to me to explain and convince me that it is Hal and he's wasted so much of my time and I tried to be you know polite and gentle after that I had to take off my gloves I said listen what did you buy he said I bought a golden pen and he said how much you paid he said I paid 1,800 R 1,800 R for it and it's one of a kind that there is only 100 pens like it in the world between you and me did you take it to the jeweler's shop and the guy looked at the floor said yes and I said how much did the Jeweler told you that it is worth he said he said 150 the gold in it is does not even Mount to 10% so actually they're selling you nothing no we have software we will send sell you a bundle of software and programs and they have so many schemes it is har and it's for so the passive income I don't have knowledge of it but we look at each and every scenario and judge accordingly I hope this answers your question any other question I give you the mic the questions regarding Islamic banking uh if we have excess money we putting in the bank as a deposit uh and we are getting a return or we are taking a loan against a home and the minor question is when I go home you know I'm out of Pakistan 20 years I should I pray kaser or full pray in know in in an Islamic Bank or outside Islamic Bank okay the brother is asking about Islamic banking this is a very vast topic however you must understand that there is a difference between Islamic Banking and conventional banking the brother said during his question that what's the ruling on taking loans of an Islamic Bank a fact Islamic Banks don't give loans you have to understand this to know the difference between Islamic banking what is Islamic banking Islamic banking is a form of transactions that allow you to get money through what is known as which is actually buying products and the seller is the bank himself and he would sell you a product that the market value is 1 KD he will sell it to you in installments in for 1.5k isn't this F no see if I have a pen bom BL very expensive I'm a rich man it's a gift by the way don't don't get me wrong I don't buy this stuff it's all gifts but I'm not so comes and says sh sell me your pen I said okay I'll sell it to you for 3,000 for 30 KD and one of the boys come and says sh can you sell me the pen I said yes I'll sell it for you for one KD does he have the right to say why are you selling it for me or or to me for 30 and sending it for him for one why not be equal he doesn't have to right because it's my P in I give it to him for free it's not even business you want to buy buy you don't want to buy the door is open likewise in installments he said this is my 30 KD it's yours he says W I don't have money he said okay I'll sell it to you over the duration of 5 years for 50 KD and you pay installments okay we signed a contract stating that I want from him only 50kd no matter what happens if he defaulted if he's delayed if he's late I cannot ask for more than 50 KD because this is the agreement this is now Islamic banking is an elastic terminology so now anything you want it to sell you attach to it Islamic so we have Islamic food Islamic banking now we have Islamic dancing B dancing how's that oh she's wearing hij we have the bini what is the bini it's a B plus bikini this is new in in in France so the woman wears this and goes to and this is we have weird ideas because of ignorance not going back to the Quran andah Islamic banking has to follow the Islamic Sharia what is happening nowadays is UN Islamic meaning I can sell you my device and you buy it and you go sell it somewhere else no problem Hal I sell it with the price I called I possess it it's like my pain I sell it to you in any price you agree alhamdulillah what's happening at the moment is that under Islamic Bank man wants to wants money he comes to me he says I need a th000 dins I say okay I will sell you something I will sell you air conditions I will sell you copper in bahin I will sell you uh uh giraffes in Nairobi Kenya says okay can I see it no I don't have it at the moment but here's the contract sign that you're willing to buy it for 12,000 KS and you will pay it over the span of 2 years okay sealed approved and delivered then I go either to a financing company or anywhere I have money I'm a bank I buy the product and I deliver it to him he says no no no no no Del what would I do with the giraffe I don't need giraffe meat what would I do with the 100 air conditions air conditioners I would not do it so what do you do nowadays what they do is as follows he wants money sign the contract that you bought from me 100 air conditioners sign okay signed another contract that you authorize me to sell them with a lower price he said okay here you go in 5 minutes I put in his account the money he wanted he did not see the product he did not acquire acquire it and possess it and he did not sell it so it's all a trick on re clear and blunt R so this is not Islam unfortunately 90% of the banks So-Cal Islamic deal in such a fashion of course there are other this is personal loans now when it comes to corporate loans W you're talking about Millions so we're talking about shares in companies or maybe in oil fields or oil tanks and Etc in this tankers there is much bigger fish to fry and percentage is higher and the involvement in Haram is much much bigger so unfortunately a lot of the Islamic Bings are not actually Islamic how do I verify and no by looking into the Shar are they real Scholars or not or they just doctor so and so doctor so never heard of him and and at the end you find that he is a doctor but veteran is not even a medical do no and secondly which is more more important that this Shar board has a department that audits so many fatwas are written and they're bid fatwas from The Shard but the banking transactions is not implemented so whenever you come and this is so and so so and so doct so and so good people okay who's supervising you nobody and you will find a lot of these transactions and Islamic so of this answers your call as for your question an exp either has migrated and is not coming back to live so I am from Pakistan I leave laor and I go to Canada and I get the citizenship I have a house my children are living there every single year I go for a month to visit my family my loved ones and I go back to Canada where are you residing Canada are you ever going to go and live in Lor again said never this is my home Canada in this case short but if the next fact is here for 60 years in Kuwait and his final goal is to go and die in his hometown and his house is there no he is residing in qu he completes he's residing in Islam Abad he completes in the way or on the way he shortens and combines but once he reaches even cities he is a settler and he has to this written written question can a person do of his child with a Deb should a girl's head be shaped on the seventh day is an issue of dispute among Scholars whether it is mandatory or it is highly recommended and the most authentic opinion is that it is highly commended it is a so if a man is blessed with a boy or a girl child the Sunnah is to slaughter two Rams two sheep Two Goats not all six and he them of these selection for a boy or a a sheep or a Ram or a goat for the girl it is recommended if he doesn't there is no sin on him however he will not get the chance of intercession of the child on the day of judgment because gives the child the right to intercede for his parents as the prophet said as for the Shaving of the head the prophet said remove the harm or the filth from his head so so the majority of Scholars say that shaving is only for the boy I personally shave the heads of my girls as well because the ad or the harm is mutual for boys and girls it's not only for the newborn boy because the same uh uh um material substances on the skull of a girl is the same with the boy so by shaving it you free the the skull from such substances and would help the hair to grow naturally and not affect the child but as I said the majority say that this is only for the boys if the father of a girl does not want to do it he's not sinful for that inshallah the Sunnah is to weigh the hair in silver and give it to charity so if someone say I'm not going to take the hair to the jeweler's shop and maybe it comes only one two GRS I'm going to give uh uh one full and it's much much much less than this is it okay is it soon to raise the hands for Dua after obligatory prayers or when now in order to say yes or no we have to have evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah am I right or wrong so if someone says is it to raise the hands after the obligatory prayer we said hold on pause and let me look into the books ofah I read the books [Music] of I don't find any authentic Hadith that whenever and the prophet prayed for 10 years in Medina not a single report said that when the prophet finished the prayer he used to raise his hand and make Dua and the congregation would say nothing if the prophet didn't do it and it was not related to us and the companions did not do it and the did not do it what do we classify this as so it's not permissible okay end the story okay on doing it on my own not in congregation we say let's again read the books I just read it so did you find anywhere that the prophet used to every single F raise his hands and make Dua no at all no then you know the answer but I found a Hadith stating that the best of Dua is at at the middle of the night and at the end of f prayers so this is a valid reason for me to make after prayers no the says and D everything is from it so when I say the front of this bottle and the back of this bottle it is something of the bottle itself and we know that there is a Hadith from the prophet who told us that after you finish offering salutation to the prophet what you call D you choose and select whatever Dua you want before Salam so the time what do you why are you making Dua after F prayer what is the objective Thanksgiving you want Allah to give you something you making Dua you want something no one makes Dua they said I'm just making du for the follow I want you to forgive me I want you to pay off my debts I want you to guide my children so you're asking something if you want Allah to answer you the prophet has told you that the closest you are to Allah when you are in the prophet says so ask Allah whatever you want so the prophet is directing me make suud in Sal not outside Salat like the that people do now we find people after f after after they fall to make hey come what are you doing he said I'm making why said I want to make Dua this is innovation you want to make Dua and do it inside the Salah not innovate a s from out of the blue and say I want to make Dua this is innovation also the prophet told us after salutation ask Allah whatever you want So before after I finish the before I can sit for 5 minutes and make Dua as much as I want do I raise my hands definitely not you're in Salah your hands should be on your thighs and knees until you finish do I begin it with alhamd no because this is during or during you do not inate it or open it with praising and salutation this is within so I hope this ANW question please this Dua within the within the Salah in or before Salam is it in your own native language or in sorry is it in your own native language or in no I'm telling that Dua praying Dua within the Salah that is in sud or before Salam that is can be done in any language or it should be he knew your question before you completed not because I J or I know I get this question 50 times a day and the answer is well know it's an issue of dispute so if you're following if you find some of the totally prohibited to do it Arab but this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion and this is a choice of and other Scholars is that Allah is the Lord of Arabs and un Arabs so if I don't know Arabic so I'm not going to make Dua no Scholars say in whether or nothing if you want to make Dua if you know how to make it in Arabic you must so for example I want Allah to forgive me I say oh Allah forgive me Allah forgive me hey can you say I know always say it then this is not principle but if you want to say oh Allah guide my wife not to nag and to make problems for me I don't even know how to say it in Arabic myself in this case no say it in your native language Allah accepts it and your prayer is to of course this goes for the girls for the women oh Allah make my husband trim his big belly and brush his teeth because his smell else stinks this is also Val it goes both ways okay any other question I have question sorry okay okay we have a question here a non-muslim asked Allah said the Quran is made easy for those uh for for those to understand yet for non Arabs uh this have to make much effort to learn the language to understand how should we how should Muslims respond to this Allah said in various places of Surah Allah has made it easy for those who want to get a reminder out of it and to get preaching out of it to do so so it is easy for us Arabs we read it we understand it it is read for non Arabs when they read the translation it's not something like mathematics or riddles it's clear because the transl translation is clear so there is no contradiction it is not multilanguage in the sense that anyone just can hold the Quran and it's in German or it's in Romanian or it's not possible it's in Arabic was revealed in Arabic it is understood to the Arabs but also those who do not speak the language alhamdulillah Allah facilitated for them the translation of the meaning not the translation of the Quran the translation of the meaning because those who translate translate the meaning not the actual Quran which cannot be translated it is so profound and deep that it cannot be translated into exact meaning meaning of it but at least what cannot be attained 100% you can attain 90% out of it insh okay yes uh let's give parents because give [Music] mamum I have one question regarding zaka uh some lady she's earning the zaka gold uh from the uh uh gift of the wedding and she's it is her regular use gold okay and she doesn't have any extra income so what is the system or what is the yeah if she cross the gold for what is the system of giving Z she doesn't have any personal income thank you you're welcome now zakat is Allah's right over the wealth you have so this is something that is Allah's right which means if I have an orphan a nephew and his father my brother died leaving him 1 million qu din he is an orphan he's 2 years old do I pay zakat over this 1 million KD or not he's not reached the age of puberty in a different situation if I have someone who's insane I have a brother a relative who inherited or who was a businessman and he has real estates and companies that still generating 1 million dollar uh per week he's wealthy million but he got insane he lost so he doesn't know who he is he urinates on himself he doesn't know how to eat he's insane do I give zakat on it or not the answer is that zakat is obligatory upon the wealth not upon the individual so the wealth is Allah's wealth having said that we come to the jewel uh the jewels and and uh uh the jewelry that a woman has do we pay zakat for that or not first of all there is no zakat on jewelry the the zakat is on gold and silver that a person possesses whether jewelry that is stored and kept safekeeping or jewelry that she wears or jewelry that she gives to others or a man who has gold and silver he's got blocks and and kilogram of gold Mah in his house under the mattress do he does he pay zakat for that answer is yes because zakat is mentioned in inah chapter n that those who hoard and keep gold the silver and do not spend it in the cause of Allah it will be under Fire In Hell Fire and there will be burnt with it in their backs and their foreheads and their sides and this includes anyone who possesses gold silver or currency that falls underneath dollars Dinars Dirhams real it has the same rule coming back to your question do the scholars say that gold and silver of women are zable or not it's an issue of dispute mother may Allah pleas with her used to say that there is no zakat other companions say no there is zakat so it's an issue of dispute and whenever we have a dispute we have to go back to the Quran and to the Sunnah and the clear directive we get from the Quran and from the sunah without not going into details that it is a must to give zakat on gold or silver possessed by women and of course men as well the question is a woman who is a housewife regardless this TOA was given to her by her father or by her father-in-law or by her husband as a gift as something bought it doesn't matter she possesses gold and she does not have an income and after one year the the the money now is zable she has to give zakat so she looks in her Pockets there's no money how does she pay Z she can go to her husband makes a good plate of bani masah and Tred to Ador herself and then said why did you give the zakat this year and he gives it voluntarily this does the job he is not liking her food and she doesn't look that attracted to him after so many years of marriage unfortunately or his eyesight is not that good so is it no I'm not going to give you Zak what do she to do we say we you sell a small portion of your gold and pay for the Z because the Islamic economy revolves on on this gold and the poor are in need for income so if each one owes a lot of gold and or a little and does not give zakat the economy is hindered and some of the sisters once a sister called me and she said uh I think it was on live TV because I don't make such jokes privately when a sister calls it's it's dead serious because this is f but if it's an an an open platform with with others and or on live TV I may throw a joke here or there so she said that I I don't have a source of income and I can't May pay zakat and so and so she wanted me to say there's no zakat so I asked her how much coal do you have she said 5 kg I said are you married with 5 K that's potential for me are you crazy 5 kg you're talking about almost close to a million close to a million and you are stingy of paying zakat this is ridiculous no you have to sell because this is Allah's right this is the right of the poor and Allah will put blessing in it now if a woman thinks positively it says huh in about 10 15 years time I'll be losing a lot of zakat and the gold will diminish yes so what you do invest it do instead of just sitting in your safe invest it put it in something that is Hal it grows you get richer you buy more gold and you benefit the Muslim um rather than being passive income rather than being passive with no income as well amount of"
