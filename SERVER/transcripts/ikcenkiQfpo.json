  "transcript": "ABI from Indonesia he says can we repeat Dua like we do with Vick and this is a little bit different because thck can be repeated throughout the day so you say Subhan Allah Subhan Allah Subhan Allah and repeat it and work and do Dua has to be a little bit higher status because Hadith of the Prophet says that Allah does not respond to a heart that is absent minded so you can make Dua while doing your Shores while working out but you're not paying any attention so this Dua has no value and and Dua both of them do not require that you face the they do not require that you are in the state of VO so you can do them whether you are in W or not or facing the or not but the what counts with Dua is that you have it wholeheart ly with your heart uh present"
