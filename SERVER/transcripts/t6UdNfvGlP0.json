  "title": "Zakat on my Investment which is stuck up and I cannot retrieve it at the moment - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Saima she says share we invested in a Muslim firm and had monthly benefits profits or loss sharing and we used to pay the cat on the main principle amount now since five months the company's owner is in prison due to a case in our money nor benefits have come do we need to pay there's a cat on the principle amount for this year first of all we have to be really careful where we invest our money so many times we trust people and we trust them blindly so we give them the money only to end up finding that they've missed used it abused it and now they say that the money is lost it is our problem we did not do our due diligence and we just trusted people because they looked Islamic in their appearance and the way they talk so first of all you have to make sure that the person who's investing it is legit there is a big famous company for the past few years that was collecting money from investors claiming to deal in gold and giving back a lot of profits and people would invest a lot only to find out that this was a pyramid scheme this was a Ponzi scheme and I spoke to some of the people who worked there and they said to me that this is the fact how do you know should no no no we know the owner we know this and that and they deal in gold and the profit is astronomical subhanAllah we know what's happening in the gold market and how high it goes and how low it drops well he cannot generate such profits so this is a networking scheme or a pyramid scheme but people keep on investing so it's your problem secondly zakat is due when the money is within your grasp and you have control over it if my wealth is in a foreign country and they overthrew the government and the new government confiscated my wealth do I pay zakat on my investments there no because I'm unable to retrieve it if I give a hundred thousand as a loan to a person and he's rich and every time I ask for it he declines is the cat obligated upon me no because I cannot get hold of it likewise with your investment and I'm not going to go into the types of investments because sometimes investments do not have the cat so if I'm investing my money in a limo service all my wealth I bought 10 limousines and hired drivers and I have an office with a fax machine and a computer and a receptionist and an accountant I invested a million euros in it at the end of the year do I pay zakat no because there isn't anything is equitable except if it generated prophet and the Prophet is in my bank account and a whole lunar year past then yes I give zakat on that I may invest in building a high riser or a residential building 10 storeys high maybe 40 flats apartments there's no zakat on that the zakat is only on the rent so I'm not going to go into this and talk about it Saima but I'm gonna that basically speaking if your investment has been confiscated or has been blocked and you cannot reach it then there is no zakat until it gets back to you until the owner comes out and he starts paying people off then in this case yes whatever you receive immediately give 2.5 percent of it as a cat"
