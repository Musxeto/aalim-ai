  "title": "Is it permissible not to wake up for fajr prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so the question is is it permissible not to wake up for fajr waking up for fajr is a choice i have the choice to wake up or not to wake up if you take the necessary measurements to wake up and you do not wake up allah would not hold you accountable for that because this is not within your grasp for reach so if you for example go back to go to bed early like 10 or 11 and set your alarm clocks and drink a lot of water before going to bed this would help you wake up for fajr when it's three or three thirty but if you go to bed late like twelve or one am and you know that you're not gonna make it for fajr even if you put cannons and and and tens of alarm clocks around you in this case you're sinful the prophet said allah lays it free to fill yakawa being negligent is not while being asleep this is something that you can't have control of over the negligence is when you are awake so if you take your precautions go to bed early and drink a lot of water and set the alarm clocks if you wake up alhamdulillah allah has blessed you and favored you if you don't wake up you're not sinful because it's beyond your control but if you go to bed late and you don't wake up you're definitely sinful and allah azzawajal knows best"
