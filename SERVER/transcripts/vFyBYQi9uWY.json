  "title": "Ruling on making New Year's Resolution & Celebrating New Year in Islam - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "do Isis Salam alaikum o Allah I understand that celebrating the new year or even making a special dua or prayer is forbidden does that mean making a new year resolution is also forbidden the essence of this story is that in Islam we are only allowed to celebrate two festivals two reads this is the Eid of Al Fatah and idul adha these are the two events that Muslims are allowed to celebrate any other feast or festivals fall under the category of imitating the Kafar the disbelievers or and innovation in Islam therefore celebrating the 10th of Muharram which is known as a schwa we Muslims fast it others may celebrate and commemorate the death of Al Hussein may Allah be pleased with him and this is an innovation clear innovation celebrating birthdays the National Day Mother's Day Halloween Easter Thanksgiving Christmas New Year's any of these things for us as Muslims such celebrations are totally prohibited and to engage or to assist or cooperate is also prohibited to congratulate to send postcards is also prohibited because these are false festivals and celebrations that we Muslims would not approve of having said that when do I say is what's running on making a resolution we usually look at the intention why is it that you are specifically making that or taking that resolution on New Year's Eve if the answer is because it's a blessed night because it is something to celebrate is something that everybody's doing so we might as well be with them the answer would be no this is prohibited anything that imitates the disbelievers in their habits in their religion and their customs becomes prohibited for us as Muslims Abdullah Allah Allah be pleased with him said the Prophet said in a long hadith allosaurus Salam woman tashabbaha be a common for women home whoever imitates a people then he is one of them now one would say as usual those keyboard nights or those who just argue without any knowledge and we feel sorry for them but nevertheless we have to cater for their ignorance they say why are you wearing the watch chair and your clothes are made abroad what listen listen good when we say that it is prohibited to imitate them in what is part of their customs that religion their habits this is this means that whatever they are known to do and no one else does that riding cars taking airplanes using technology using the computer having electricity this is shared by everyone and no one does it because the Christians did it or the Jews invented it this is something that everyone does it regardless of their ethnicity or religion we're talking about a celebration whether it's Christmas or Heinicke or whatever they may call these feasts and celebrations and the Muslims are like monkeys they do whatever they see people doing they imitate them celebrating Christmas I've been to some of the Muslim countries recently in the past couple of weeks and I was shocked like a country that has 90 million almost of Muslims and maybe four or five Christians but you enter the hotel hotels and the shopping malls and youth you see in fine Christmas trees like three weeks or four weeks before even Christmas is due this is preposterous this is outrageous never ever you would go to Washington or to London or to Paris and you'd find them celebrating Riedl footer or slaughtering sheep on the 10th day of the ledger for idul adha and trying to share with the muslims their festivals this is never the case and if someone tells you that George and his wife Jeanette and their sons David and Tracy we're getting ready because tomorrow is idul adha and they went to the market and bought a big Ram to slaughter it and after offering salat Allah heed they went and slaughtered it and they divided the meat into three sections and gave one as charity and one as gift and they consumed the third but then they were late for their church sermon so they had to go because it was Sunday anyone who hears this said this is crazy George and Jeanette crazy and David are the Muslims to celebrate Radle Hajj or are there Christians to go and attend the sermon or the service at the church this is exactly what's happening to the Muslims you have abdullah muhammad ali ahmed and the wise fatima Khadija Aisha Sophia have sahaja but they look as Muslims yet they celebrate and pretend to be Christians this cannot be in the religion of Islam this kind of split identity dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde this is unacceptable in Islam the identity of a Muslim is crystal clear inside outside is the same that's why those who let's say are not Muslims especially the politicians and the people of authority they fight Islam they don't want the Muslims in their countries to be real Muslims they want to dilute them they want them to be dissolved in the melting pot so they make preserve the name Ahmed or Mohammed Mohammed you may call him mo not Mohammed because this is embarrassing for them they call themselves mo and they may have these names but they celebrate Christmas they may go to parties they may sit with people drinking intoxicants they may even drink a toast they're not heavy drinkers but this is a social a drink of champagne or something just for the occasion so this kind of split personality is rooted through implementing their strategy over the past years most of the Muslim communities most of the Muslim countries without any exception have been colonized mentally when they watch on their national channels that alone the satellite channels when they watch wrestling's movies American Hollywood movies soap operas TV series we used to get them in English now they are dubbed in Arabic we have Mexican soap operas dubbed into Arabic Turkish now Korean tomorrow maybe they'll bring some from maybe Zimbabwe or from whatever what is this the Muslims have their own identity to preserve to protect not to dilute it and dissolve it as we see nowadays coming back to the question and I think I took too long in answering and diverting but there are no callers so who cares I have questions and I have you and probably I have like two or three viewers for hamdullah for everything taking a resolution on the New Year's Eve with that intention is Harlem but if someone says listen I don't celebrate New Year's I have nothing to do with the New Year's but it is something to remember so that I can audit it after a year from today and see how much progress I had made or how less progress there was it it's just a day in this case this is permissible like what a lot of the merchants and traders and businessmen do when they come to the closing year and they audit and they look into whatever they have in their stores and try to know the profit and the loss etc gave their financial statements this is not related to religion or to customs but rather it is a date of the year Animas origin knows best"
