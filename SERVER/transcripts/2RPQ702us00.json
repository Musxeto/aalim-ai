  "transcript": "this says what's the ruling on watching the Turkish Drama Series Eartha 'grill this has taken the whole Muslim world by storm and Muslims are watching it and they also tell others to watch it and tell people that this is filled with Islamic values spirituality etc first of all claiming that Muslims are all watching it is an exaggeration there are Muslims who still abide by the Koran in the Sunnah the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said in an authentic hadith islam started as something that is strange and it will revert at the end of times to being strange so give the glad tidings to the strangers in the beginning when Islam started it was the Prophet himself is also him and all others around him we're idol worshippers then few years down the line the whole community the whole region almost a great chunk of this world are Muslims and they abide by Islam will Allah Hill hamd there will come a time where they will shrink in number not necessarily in their labeling as muslims but rather in their quality as true muslims as true strangers and this question illustrates this fact now this drama called error total it's a Turkish drama where there is a Turkish Egyptian Syrian Moroccan it doesn't matter as Muslims we don't look at the quantity Oh 100 million people watched it oh this person has 200 million followers on social media it doesn't make any difference or any it doesn't have any value what counts is what is recommended and preferred by allah azza wajal and what is not therefore we come to this drama I personally praise Allah as usual I have not seen a single clip out of it so I don't even know it but I have heard it from so many Muslims unfortunately saying that it's good it's this it's that now the basic questions for Muslims I'm not talking about non-muslims I'm talking about practicing Muslims who ask to know whether it's halal or Haram so we look at it from a perspective of whether it's halal or Haram now does it have music they say oh definitely it has lots of music okay does it have free mixing between men and women they say or is it only men they say no there are few women here and there but they're decently dressed yet that there so this renders it immediately to be Haram now I know a lot of the people would say oh sure this is too extreme he who determines whether it's extreme or not is it me is it the scholars or is it the Quran and the Sunna with the understanding of the three favourite generations dr. berry in the Companions Sahaba in interpreting so if it has music in it and if it has free mixing Aslam tells you that this is Haram even if they're teaching Islam let alone that they may also teach innovation because some of the brothers and I don't remember whether this came to me through a question or someone was telling it to me face-to-face that in these series they have innovations in their vicar in Theravada they have also maybe some sort of more than such innovations if it's related to visiting the graves and seeking help and refuge in such graved people look they call olya and we know that this originated nowadays when we go to such countries we find this ship in front of us we find these innovations right in front of us giving the earth car before the Adhan reciting call who Allahu Ahad whole world heard or been asked and doing the congregational draft and the vicar after the Salah all of these innovations started from when from this 200 years ago 300 years ago which is not related to the Sunnah at all and they that is their leaders hate the Sunnah and fight the Sunnah because it opposes what they're teaching to the people therefore I would say that if you are interested in abiding by the Quran the Sunnah you should stick to the Quran and to the Sunnah and don't be fooled by the number of people talking positively about such things they talked before it about the series of remark and maybe tomorrow if they make a film about our prophet Isaiah and they depict him they would probably go with the flow and this is not how we Muslims think and believe in Allah knows bed"
