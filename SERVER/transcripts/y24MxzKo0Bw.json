  "transcript": "funeral prayer of those who are absent except if there was no muslim to offer such a prayer over them and from here it is one of the innovations that we might inshallah if we have time read in in some schools of thought in some countries that is every single night before you go to bed it is part of their Sunnah to offer funeral prayer to any deceased Muslim every single night this is what they believe why they say that it will it's a good reward and we pray for the dead people what do we consider this to be a Innovation it has no uh Source uh of it 61 can we ask for forgiveness or to offer Salat janaza to non-muslims what is the uh evidence the prophet Alam was denied this right in the Quran by saying do not ever pray for any of them that dies that is of the uh maaf of the Hypocrites openly Hypocrites and of the disbelievers and also in the authentic Hadith when the prophet is Muslim the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam cried once so they asked him oh prophet of Allah why do you cry and this is authentic in Muslim he said I requested my Lord I requested Allah to seek forgiveness for my mother and he forbade me from doing this and I requested him to visit her grave so he granted me the permission what do we learn from this Hadith that it is permissible to visit the graves of non-muslims for for what for asking forgiveness no just to remember the to remember that this is uh uh what we will where will we will be and we learn from it that the mother of the Prophet is not a Muslim and she is in hell wow this is difficult yes it is difficult but this is what's in Muslim a man came to the prophet am and he said oh prophet of Allah where is my father the prophet said your father is in hell so man the man was a little bit taken away and saddened and the prophet said listen your father and my father are in hell so this means that the parents of the Prophet Alam are not Muslims and they are in Hell one would say how dare you say such a thing I say I didn't say it if it were for me I would sacrifice my father and mother so that the father and mother of the Prophet Alam would become Muslim and they would join the prophet alham because I love what the prophet loves but this is not to me and am I being disrespectful this is what the prophet told us do I bring something from my own pocket okay what about the narrations that Allah revived Abdullah the father the mother and Abu Talib and they accepted Islam to the prophet if this is authentic I would be more than happy to accept it but it is baseless it has no authenticity at all we all love the prophet more than we love our children and more than we love our parents and more than we love anyone else on Earth so don't try to take take advantage of this if it was authentic I would 100% support you but I cannot and this is what the prophet said okay sheh weren't they among the people of fatra weren't they among the people where there were no messenger and we know that those who do not have Messengers will be questioned on the day of judgment the answer is yes but we also know that the religion of Jesus Christ was there the original religion of ibraim was there in Mecca and there were people who were monist would not worship anyone else but Allah such as uh the father of s one of the 10 heavenbound he would come and buy the women or the girls to be executed when they're young and whenever they bring him a she sheep slaughtered to their Idols he said I do not eat something like this Allah gave us the rain which grew the crops which this sheep ate why do you sacrifice it to someone else than him so he was among the monists and the prophet told us that he before the prophet was a messenger he met him and he said that he will be resurrected on the day of judgment alone as an umah as an individual because he was a Mony he he believed in Allah so Scholars say that the parents of the Prophet had the but they did not accept it and therefore they were classified as disbelievers so again do not become emotional this is black and white this is the Muslim if you falsify it you might as well falsify everything else in the Sharia because it doesn't suit your brains and what difference does it make if the father of a messenger is in hell to us can you give me a father of a messenger in hell in the Quran azer who's azer the father of ibraim it's mentioned in the Quran you want to falsify the Quran as well so you have a problem and you have to solve this problem inshallah number 62 can we pray congregational uh uh funeral prayer prayer uh Alone albani says you cannot you have to do it in congregation but we've stated before that you can do it if I go and I miss the congregation prayer I can do it alone in the uh graveyard and there is nothing wrong in that inshallah or if the congregation prays over the funeral uh over the deceased who's there and be and I was is late and before they take it away I can offer prayer on my own this is permissible inshallah he goes on to mention the minimum number of uh congregation uh three and this is reported in an authentic Hadith where the Prophet Alat prayed as an IM he had Abu behind him one man and he had um a third uh uh uh person behind them so if you're praying Cong uh um janaza with another person does he stand next to you does he oh look to your right and look to your left and tell me what you see you see nothing okay that's good in normal prayer if I'm praying next to my friend where does he stand exactly next to me not a little bit behind me in funeral prayer if we are too praying he stands behind me completely and this is wrong where you find in masjids when they're praying funeral prayer everybody comes to stand next to the Imam no the Imam has to always be UPF front Okay the more people pray the better it is for the deceased the prophet saidat wasam if 100 person pray funeral prayer for the deceased they will intercede Allah will allow them to intercede for him not only that even if 40 people who are Muslims uh pray Allah would allow and accept their intercession for because what is funeral prayer what is it it is intercession it is praying for the deceased so you're not there to benefit yourself and that is why you devote all your prayers to the deceased so 40 people Allah will accept their intercession and if they are 40 or whatever they have to be in rows and the minimum number of rows is three so even if they're seven people then they should be 3 2 two so that it would be three rows okay who is to lead the funeral prayer who's the best one to lead the funeral prayer the relative some say the one whom he had written in his will I'd like Mr Abdullah to to lead the prayer but the Hadith where Al Hussein uh Al Hussein Ali says in in the Hadith I witnessed the day on which Al Hussein Ali died I saw Al Hussein Ali may Allah be pleased with him saying to uh one of the rulers his name is go forward had it not been the Sunnah I'd not have asked you to proceed and there was he was the governor of Medina so the scholars say in congregation all always who is the first one to lead the Amir the leader okay if it's in my house the owner of the house and that is why the prophet said it is not permissible for someone to lead an AM to to lead a congregation in the presence of the Amir or to lead a prayer in the house in the presence of the owner except with his permission so if there was no Amir then we go back to basics the prophet said the most learned person in Quran should lead the prayer if they are equal then the knowledgeable then the first one to migrate then the uh eldest so we go step by step and uh may Allah be pleased with him he was a young boy below the age of puberty and he used to lead them in prayer normal and also in their funeral prayers as well because he was the most learned person of them all if we have a number of funerals what to do we put them all in a row okay children first women and men or any order no the Imam has to have first of all the men and then the children and then the women to the the furthest and where do we where the man stands the Imam stands if it's a man he stands near the head and if it's a woman I'm the Imam I stay near the middle of the woman so that I would cover with my body the areas that usually are exposed and this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat and you have the evidences there do I offer one janaza prayer for like seven or 10 as the case inam if you go to Haram you say or do I offer one for each individual it can be both you can offer for all of them one prayer and you can offer for each one alone do we pray in the Masjid or elsewhere at the time of the Prophet alham there was a designated place to pray over the funerals which was not in the Masjid it was close to the graveyard but there are hadiths that he prayed once inside the Masjid so this makes it permissible and the majority of funerals nowadays are prayed upon where in the Masjid because it's greater in the reward people would like to gather as many people to pray on their loved ones okay we go on and on to the description of the funeral prayer the description is there are many hadiths and let us see now do we have to go through all of this uh no why don't we go all of this sheh because it's too long and we run to number 14 which is the burial and the related issues okay what about the prayer okay I'm going to make it difficult for those who are shooting what is this ah yes nice how do I pray the funeral prayer we stated that you have to be standing up you have to have the intention I have the funeral in front of of me if this is a man this is his head I stand up here if it's a woman I stand up here now is it relevant the head should be on my right or on my left no if the head is here I stand here so it's not an importance that it has to be on my right what do I do to pray funeral prayer I offer the majority of people say for T so I say say allahar raising the hand in the first T is agreed upon all Scholars put my right over the left over my chest I'm talking about the most authentic one would say I put it under my navl it's up to you I'm talking about the most authentic opinion from the scholars from the Hadith not from the scholars themselves from the Hadith where it says may Allah be pleased with him the prophet used to put the right hand over the left on the chest this is your chest cavity choose okay she I'll put it here don't laugh there there are schools of thought that say put it here why they said because this is closer to the heart if you have a deformity in your heart is on your right what would you do no and and a lot of the brothers from Sudan use this do this and this is wrong you have to put it on the chest on the middle so that you will be balanced now the Sunnah in normal prayer you know of course either to put it on here not here this is not permissible this is not permissible a lot of the Muslims do this so either you put it here or you grab your wrist these are two forms having it in between is not part of the Sunnah some grab with three fingers and put the other two fingers like this no you either put it this way or you grab it's up to you first what do I do say recite second is an issue of of of dispute among may Allah have mercy on his soul say that you do not raise your hands the majority of Scholars say you do raise your hands and there are different of Hadith backing this up so we follow uh uh this by saying allahar what do I do after the second I I do the I don't know where they got this from we do wasallam is not an Arabic word so we either you say it in English or say it in Arabic and say how many types of Salah I can do I can do the short one and the best is and depend on the length of the the the the pause that the IM gives me then I make the third allahar now I'm praying a prayer of for there is a lot of supplications you have in the book try to memorize them by by by heart in Arabic I start to make supplication to the deceased there is a general supplication what do you mean by General supplication she I'm not talking about this individual so I say oh Allah forgive our deceased whether young or old whether male or female if he's present or or he's somewhere else so this is general and then there is another specific and then I go on and explain to explain this I need a whole day you can go on do I have to follow the Sunnah it's most recommended can I add something from my own yes you can because what you're doing is you're interceding you're asking Allah to accept your intercession for him and you go on according to what the IM allows you the fourth tbar he makes a pause before it and the Salam so what do we do do we say nothing Scholars say no as long as there is a pose whatever pose there is there's nothing in prayer where you just say every place not only funeral prayer even the normal prayer every place you have to occupy it with Z with Quran with you there isn't any place in the and prayer is waiting yes when is it no you have to say something so what do I say the Scholars say the normal Dua and it's also mentioned here what is the meaning of do not deprive us from his reward how do Allah deprives us from his reward if you're patient when you lose someone Allah will reward you so I'm asking Allah make me patient and for supplicating again you will be rewarded so Allah would give you guidance to supplicate for him and so on and there are many different number of Hadith I highly recommend that you keep them uh and and memorize them by heart chapter 14 the burial and related issues it is a must that we excuse me oh I didn't I didn't conclude the prayer Subhan Allah okay after the fourth T how what do I do I offer Salam the sheh says the Salam should be silent and he narrates and he reports a Hadith but Scholars say it cannot be silent because if you're leading a prayer how would the people know that you've concluded okay what do I do with this Hadith it should be silent if you're praying next to one person or two who can see you so if I'm praying next behind me someone is praying and I say Allah abbar then I do this will he know he's behind me he's one yes he knows but if I have three rows they would not know so Scholars say that it has to be loud in a sense that people would know that I've concluded the prayer one or two both are from the Sunnah Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him he said nowadays I don't see you do something the prophet used to do at funeral prayer and that is offering Salam as he offers in the normal prayer which means that saying alayam is acceptable but if the people praying behind you don't know the Sunnah and you do this twice what would they do to you if you were the Imam probably they would kick you what are you doing and that is why a lot of the enthusiastic brother when they learn a new Sunnah they want to apply it in their Masid wait teach the people some of the brothers came in M prayer and he recited which is one of the longest suras in the Quran in after he finished the people almost you know killed him why are you doing he's young he said I'm I'm teaching the people Sunnah and this is the only Sunnah you could teach them did you prepare them some of the sh in in in Riyad announced it for two weeks that on this particular day after two weeks in we're going to recite beware don't come and say I did not warn you two weeks so when those who came they're very few but those who came they knew what they're up to so don't be selective the brother goes and marries another wife why do you take a second wife you don't have a beard this is more important closer to the Sunnah your th is you know cleaning the floor where is this don't be selective so this is part of the Sunnah if the IM after the fourth T says allahar what would you do no we've said this huh it can be four it can be five it can be up till nine so it's all part of the Sunnah the majority of the Muslims pray it with four but if a if a person prays it five this is also part of the authentic Sunnah the prophet did it so can you stand and say this is not not that good you should only make it four why the prophet did it yeah I know but uh we're not accustomed to that it's recommended that he teaches and he shows the people what to do the burial and related issues a cafir or a Muslim they all have to be yes brother I did not hear that and the fifth now if the man or the IM says the fifth T I continue to make supplication but the scholars say if I know for sure he's going to make uh five T usually usually those who make five recite the fa make Salat on the prophet make General Dua not for the deceased general which is and then he gives Allah abbar so I know oh okay because this was short then this means that the fourth between the fourth and and the fifth is going to be the individual which is a very very very long Dua for a specific person or for the children what do we say for the children and this is something I forgot as well if a child did not reach age of puberty do I say oh Allah forgive him and uh have mercy on him he did not do any sins so the prophet told us that you offer prayer for a miscarriage or for an infant or for a child who did not reach the age of puberty but you make Dua for his parents so you say among the things you say oh Allah make him precede them to paradise and lead them inside oh Allah substitute them someone better than the one you have taken from them and Etc non-muslims should be buried do we give them a respectful barrier no we do not wash them we do not shroud them we just put them in a ditch and we cover them if we were the only one of course they have family they have relatives depend on the country so they take care of them I'm not going to take care of them when the this Believers of mushin who were fighting the prophet Alam were killed in bad what did the prophet do with them he tossed them in one of the wells and he buried them that's it but but if a a person has a relative who is not Muslim and you're the Muslim what to do first option you have nothing to do with him ask his non-muslim brother or his non-muslim relatives to take care of him if there's no one except you and he's your father he's your brother he's your cousin no one to take care of him except you then you have to give him the minimal accepted barrier accepted barrier in Islam not in his religion because his religion you have to buy a coffin you have to buy a place you have to uh wash him maybe put certain things on him give him a tuxedo no no this is not acceptable in your case as a Muslim you just get rid of the body by burying it anywhere any place no problem for us can we bury cafir with Muslims Muslims have to be buried in Muslim graveyards cafir should be buried in cafir graveyards it is not permissible to have them mixed okay number 90 um the Sunnah is to be buried in a graveyard because this is the doing of the Prophet Alat however a person can be buried elsewhere right not necessarily a graveyard it depends on the place but definitely not to be buried in a in a Masjid this is completely out of the question and as an evidence that it is not a must to be buried in a graveyard where was Abu Bakr and Omar buried in the no they were not buried in the Masid of the Prophet where is the prophet buried in his house so make a clear distinction you have to be very care careful because people of innovation would come to you say what's wrong in having my w my Scholars grave in the Masjid what's wrong with that the prophet is buried in the Masjid is he buried in the Masjid no he's buried in the house OFA Anda continued to live there for a number of years but the houses of the Prophet were outside the border of the Masjid like now the IM of the Masjid here most likely lives adjacent to the Masjid in the same building but it's out of the Masjid so Abu Bakr and Omar all were buried in the room 60 or 70 years after the death of the Prophet Alam one of the Cals of Thea Emperor EMP Empire came and decided to expand the Masjid the the scholars told him expanded but not to the direction of the east of uh North which is in the in the don't include the houses make it anywhere else he insisted and he was the ruler who can't stand up against the ruler and he did what he wanted and that is why the Muslims protected the grave of the Prophet Alam if you come to the grave of the Prophet Alam this is the this grave is not something you can face because it is made a triangle so there are three walls in the direction of the doing this and the third wall is here so if you want to face the grave you have to either face it this way this way or give your back to the and face it this way but while praying you cannot face the the the grave of the Prophet alai this is the the only thing they could do how are there times that we uh must not bury our uh funerals yes when the sun is coming up and when the Sun is setting down and when the sun is in the middle of the sky this is about five minutes 5 minutes time so the these are forbidden for us to uh bury our dead it's permissible to bury the dead in in at night time uh the Sunnah is to make the grave very deep there are two types of Graves and the is to do is to to to dig the grave and then make an opening in the direction of the so when we bring the disease we put him inside and we put bricks and we put some mud to close it and then we hail the uh or or put the uh uh soil back in the other way of doing it is to give the gray this is called Shak to dig the grave and when we reach the bottom we dig another place for the body we put the body we put the bricks on top and then we put uh the soil what was the prophet's grave Oru alaih wasam okay we can bury two or three"
