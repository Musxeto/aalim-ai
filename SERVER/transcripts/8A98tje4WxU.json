  "title": "Corruption due to Social Media, Western Ideology & Atheism âš› #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so there's three major things I think that cause a lot of corruption uh we have major issues because of these things uh correct me if I'm wrong I want to you know get your opinion on this uh social media Western ideologies uh and then not also having uh a religion uh being Godless not understanding our purpose um can you elaborate on that those three points is there something you can say that is this uh something that is causing majority of the issues or is it a longer topic this the these are okay someone comes to you and says I have a severe headache yes you say to him no problem take two pills of Tylenol I think Tylenol is a prevailing so it works like magic for six hours and then he comes back you give him another two two pills yes and he do this for a whole week did you help the man no not not long term why because he keeps getting the headache and he keeps getting the headache what is the headache it's a symptom so you're curing the symptom not the real illness so the topics you're giving are symptoms okay she my wife doesn't abide by the hijab my son doesn't pray on time she my husband washes porn and masturbates and this is weird yes yeah you have a wife why would you go and Mur it but this is another topic it this ch is rated what no I mean it's good it's good whatever you feel okay so go to the core problem so all these symptoms would go away when I find the youth having issues these are symptoms I have to address this it's even among those who are pretending to be practicing right they have a Dr jaal Mr High personality in the morning there's something in the evening there's something else the sheh wears jeans and t-shirts and he's buff and now he looks like a preacher from Mecca what is this this is what you have to focus on once you do this all of these would disappear yes okay so at the root of the problem not too much on the symptoms correct that we're having because at the end of the day there's a void in our hearts yes and whenever these hearts are not filled with the love of Allah the knowledge of Allah ask any Muslim you know any Muslim how many names does Allah have 99 that's not limited to 99 but the Hadith said it's 99 100 minus one whoever meaning knows the meaning REM memorizes them and Implement them into his life will enter Jenna okay good for you here's an A4 paper how many names can you list the best of them would list probably 20 good for you out of these 20 how many can you give me the meaning of it yes the best of them will give you five then what and who are you praying to you don't know Allah so someone who masturbates watches porn what is the meaning of and I get lots of counseling sessions paid yes uh um from guys who complain and I said okay do you know said yeah all hearing all seeing so what does it mean they don't even know the meaning because they know what it the translation is but the implication they don't have it because if you know that Allah is watching you at this moment would you do what you're doing no would you watch the filth no so you have Allah awareness you're afraid of Allah you know that Allah is watching you we have a huge void in knowing who Allah is yes if we we to know then and I think that's where religion lacks a lot this is what's wrong with um some of us today is we don't know enough of Allah we don't know enough of right and for that it's it's it's a relationship with Allah is going to be really really weak the knowledge we have is only theoretical not practical so we know of lordship of worship of the names and beautiful names and attributes of Allah let's put it to work yeah I know all of these things but I had a man come to my Masjid once on Thursday so a day before Friday saying sheh look at this paper and on this paper was a famous well-known story of Sakina the daughter of so and so that she saw in Her Dream what's happening in the Muslim world and that she cried and The Tear went down her eyes and uh she gave some form of preaching and the person who saw the dream woke up and she said that she wrote this story and handed it to others and whoever uh rewrites it or print it five times or six times and distributes it he will get a fortune and whoever this cards it and tears it up Allah would send him a Calamity a guy tore it up anded losing his son another one lost his uh um trade and got broke and imprisoned one uh uh printed six copies of it and got a fortune another one did this he got mashallah so I he said she look at this sh and they've copied it and distributed it on all the cars in the neighborhood say so I said in our neighborhood Subhan Allah I'll I'll talk about it tomorrow may Allah bless you he said okay take this paper and tear it up and throw it he said you do it she so he didn't even fully believe it so the Guy believes that this is sh but he's afraid so I said to the people and look what's happening I gave a and at the end I read the paper and I said look what sh is happening and I tore it in front of everybody I got a stroke yes but nothing happened aldah aldah this is walking the talk that I was mentioning"
