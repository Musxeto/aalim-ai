  "transcript": "muhammad from the philippines he says he doesn't find the zelf and the enthusiasm to pray and he doesn't know what is causing this well ahi this is one of the ways of shaytan to block you and prevent you from praying this feeling comes with time you cannot go to the gym work out for like couple of months and then say i don't have arnold schwarzenegger's biceps yeah arnold schwarzenegger took like 15 years to reach where he reached so you need time you need devotion you need this push in you to benefit and get the best of your prayer ana malik the companion of the prophet had his best student and companion by the name of thabit al-bunaning if i recall correctly and thabit said about himself he's a tabori he said i struggled with prayer for 20 years what does that mean it means that he's been praying for 20 years finding the same problem you're finding muhammad i'm not feeling it i'm not getting this connection it feels that i'm doing the rituals as a robot i'm not getting the benefits of it he says but after 20 years of struggling i started to enjoy it for the following 20 years this is when you reach your peak and it becomes in your system so it takes time what adds value to it number one to understand the meaning of the things you're saying in salat when you say subhana rabbi al-alah when you say semi-allahu liman hamid what does that mean when you recite the fatiha what does it mean this conversation alhamdulillah allah says my servant has praised me there's a conversation between you and allah so all of this adds a lot of value when you know the beautiful names and attributes of allah you get more sure and contemplation and submissiveness in your salat because of that then it will come gradually you"
