  "transcript": "I wanted to ask if someone uh made Zena in Ramadan and uh he remed to Allah for his experation uh he didn't want to fast for 60 days and uh he paid an amount that can uh feed for 60 people to man who was collecting money for the poor people and he said to him that I want you to feed this amount of money for 60 people for that extion is it valid or not any intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan whether it is halal such as in the case of marriage or Haram such as in the case of fornication or adultery or Zena this is a major sin and it has to be expediated in the same order that the prophet indicated number one free a slave we don't have slaves nowaday then you go to number two you have to fast 60 consecutive days two consecutive months if a person is sick or has a legitimate reason that is valid with Allah not just because oh what would I say to the people I have work I have this no this is not valid you've done a major sin and you have to pay for that and paying for that is by fasting two consecutive months if a person is unable to do this then we go to option number three which is to feed UH 60 poor Muslims and you must ensure that they're being fed and not given the money in cash and this is the order it has to be in if a person can fast but he went to the third option and fed 600 people not 60 it doesn't work and Allah Knows Best"
