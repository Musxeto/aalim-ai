  "title": "Making a restricted thing while in ihram",
  "transcript": "uh the ruling for those who make one of the restricted things in we know that the expedition is to feed six poor people to slaughter or to pass three days so uh do we have a choice in one of the three or we have to take them in order no you have a choice in any of the three you wish to do uh first and does this apply to all the restrictions of haram the answer is no because there are restrictions of haram that do not apply uh you don't have to expedite for those for example the marriage contract we know that the guardian the man and the girl the three of them if they are in the state of islam it is not permissible for them to have an engagement or to execute a marriage contract but if they do then this does not affect uh their uh hajj in the sense that they have to go on with their head and there is no explanation for that they have to say allah's forgiveness for that also if a a person performing hajj before standing in arafah and he um has intercourse with his wife his hajj is invalid and he has to give expiation enough a sacrifice not a sheep but a camel and he has to continue in his though it is invalid and he has to make it up the following year so this uh feeding the six poor people or past three days or sacrificing a sheet a ram does not apply to all the restrictions of iran"
