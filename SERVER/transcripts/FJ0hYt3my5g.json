  "transcript": "would there be any concluding advices you would like to give to our brothers and sisters in terms of the great month of ramadan the time of reformation connecting with the noble quran checkpoints are there that we can utilize in terms of making sure that benefited to the best that we can people differ some of us are fortunate with the grace of allah throughout the whole year too fast mondays thursdays the white days 13 14 and 15 to have a portion of every single night to offer to hajjud and to accomplish reciting the quran at least once a month meaning reciting one juzo a knight this is the bare minimum and they remain seated in the masjid after maghrib and after fajr or after assa and fajr to recite for 20 minutes or so their ascar of the morning the earthquake of the evening and they observe their car after the fourth prayers before going to bed after uh when they go out of their homes therefore their whole life revolves around islam and therefore when ramadan approaches they don't see any difference rather than they add a bit to it and they're comfortable with that unfortunately those who are negligent throughout the whole year when ramadan hits they are enthusiastic the first three four days and they're very happy and they're going out of their way trying to get closer to allah unfortunately they become bored they become uh um resisting to this habit that was introduced to their lives in the past three or four nights and some of them unfortunately fall down they begin in the beginning of ramadan like a shooting star they're very bright they're very enthusiastic as the nights progress the lights fade away and so many of them in the last 10 nights of ramadan all what they care about is shopping for aid buying gifts going to the malls and neglecting the core of ramadan the most important time of ramadan this unfortunately can be a sign of failure because if allah wanted good for us he would have guided our hearts and this is why you are astonished when you see a person sitting in the masjid raising his hands engaging in dua for half an hour one of the guys says okay i don't know what this guy is asking for i raise my hands i finish everything i want from allah in 60 seconds i look at him in a pity way and i say well this is problematic if everything you want from allah is summarized in 60 seconds this means that you neither know allah nor know what you need you have to acknowledge that we are full of flaws shortcomings and sins and we need allah in every breath we take and every step we make we need allah in everything we do because if allah does not support us we are losers in the dua the prophet used to say um and this is the punchline do not make me trust myself not even a blink of an eye do not let me depend and rely on myself not for a blink of an eye and unfortunately we totally depend on ourselves oh i managed to secure the revenue of the company for the past three months i thought i achieved the targets i did this i did that no it's not you who did this it's allah who made you do this but you're failing to acknowledge this so if you notice and analyze that you're wasting your time you're not utilizing this season and you're not aware of it this is a very negative indication that maybe allah does not want good for you and allah knows best"
