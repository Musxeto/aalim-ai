  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Alhamdulillah. [Music] Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallah.aihi alaihi wasallam would so often say and supplicate to Allahawel by saying oh turner of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion. So anastas asked him once and said oh prophet of Allah we believed in you and in what you had brought to us. So are you afraid that we may turn back on our heels? The prophet saidatam yes the hearts are between two of Allah's fingers and he flips it as he wills. This beautiful hadith puts a great deal of hope and at the same time a great deal of fear. As for the fear, we fear Allah's actions because one of Allah's actions is to flip to turn to redirect the hearts. So the source of fear is that we fear Allah's actions of flipping our hearts. And of course flipping our hearts from guidance to misguidance. The fear from flipping our heart from into shik from worshiping allahel into committing sins from being in light and going into the darkness. This is what scares us the most. While we have great hopes in Allahawel Subhanahu Waala that he may guide the misguided. So on the positive side, we're hopeful that those disbelievers would embrace Islam. Those sinners would come back into the line of the righteousness and piety of Muslims and likewise. So this hadith makes us balance between fear and hope at the same time. Now the prophet saidatam that the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers and the fingers is an attribute that is authentic proven by this hadith and many many other hadiths as well narrated by Annas by Sal by Mas and other companions. May Allah be pleased with them. And the scholars of have accepted, embraced and believed in such an attribute. Imam Abu Bakr in his book the book of made a chapter where he compiled a hadith that spoke about affirming the attribute of fingers to Allahel. Likewise, Abu Bakr ali may Allah have mercy on his soul in his book Sharia, he compiled a chapter by the name of the belief that the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers without simulation or asking how imi in his book a beautiful book that is in many volumes He said that the finger mentioned in the hadith is an attribute of allahel. And likewise every attribute that is mentioned in the Quran or in the sunnah we believe in it in such a fashion. So the attributes of allahel such as the face, the eyes, the hand, the foot when Allah talks about his actions of coming of descending to the lower heavens and to be upon and above his throne and to laugh and to rejoice. All of these are confirmed attributes of Allah that he mentioned about himself in the Quran and the prophet wasallam mentioned it in the authentic sunnah. The issue of flipping the hearts is a action of allahel that intimidate us that makes us afraid. We don't know what an ending we will have. Allah says in the Quran, \"And know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to him you will be gathered.\" Subhan Allah. Allah intervenes. Allah flips your heart. This is on the negative side in the sense, it's not negative in the sense that we're afraid of it. We don't want it to happen to us. We would like to live as Muslims and die as Muslims. We would love to live on offering forms of worship and dying on forms of worship and not flipping to the dark side as they say. Without any doubt, Allah's power and ability is second to none. How many people who abandoned prayer? How many drug addicts? How many people who commit heinous sins that people at the end of the day gave up on them being guided? How many of them are guided in seconds? Subhan Allah. There was this individual who made films ridiculing the Quran. ridiculing Islam and making fun of it. All of a sudden he accepts Islam and he becomes a d calling others to Islam showing them how wrong he was and he has a great influence upon the non-Muslims. May Allah forgive his previous sins. If we look in the Quran, we will find Allahawel flipping the hearts of people in seconds. Look at the great story of prophet Ma MS Moses peace be upon him. his story with the sorcerers and magicians of Pharaoh when they gathered the people and they wanted to defeat Musa peace be upon him and show the people how strong their magic is. They threw their staffs and their sticks and they eluded to people. They made them delusional and think that these are snakes walking on the ground. When MS threw his staff and it turned to a real snake that consumed everything that was on the floor, the sorcerers knew that this is not magic. They knew that this is a miracle only from from Allah. In seconds they turned from sorcerers and magicians into martyrs, righteous and pious. Allah says. So the magicians fell in prostration to Allah and they said we have believed in the Lord of the worlds. We've believed in a second seconds ago they were there to prove that Musa was an impostor. And subhan Allah in seconds they turned into believers. Not only that, they turned into firm believers with sound and they even preached. They preached Pharaoh himself when he said to them, \"I will kill you. I will torment you. I will crucify you.\" They said, \"Do whatever you do. It at the end of the day, it's all in Allah's hands. you have nothing that you can do to us if Allah does not will it. And they called him to Islam and to Allah subhana wa tala is the turner of hearts. And this is why we say in our dua. Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after you've guided us. We are in need of Allah's guidance. Even prophets of Allah needs this guidance and to be steadfast. Allah says in the Quran, \"And if we had not made you steadfast, oh Muhammad, you would have almost inclined to them a little.\" So this flipping and turning of the hearts happens only in accordance to Allah's wisdom, Allah's justice. Now it is totally unacceptable to think negatively of Allah. How it is not permissible for you to think that Allah would misguide those who come to him and white guy want guidance. Allah's mercy overwhelms everything to the extent that those who want guidance Allah would never set them astray. Allah says in the Quran, \"And those who strive for us in our cause, we will surely guide them to our ways.\" So this is a promise from allahel. Yet those who are misguided, it is because they chose to be misguided. Allah says in the Quran, \"And when they deviated, Allah caused their hearts to deviate. They drew first blood. They were the one who were inclined to deviate. No one turns back on their heel without a cause and a reason from himself. No one would all of a sudden flip except if there comes a dubious matter, a shouha whispers of the shan and he entertains it and endorses it or he gets something that is lustful, a desire, a sin. and he rides the wave. He chose to be deviated. While if someone wants to go to the masjid, it is illogical and irrational that all of a sudden he will find himself in a nightclub. He's going to the masid. But if he's going to the masid and he sees something that lures him and he gets inclined to follow his whims and desires and he goes right and left when this is it. This is what he has chosen for himself. This is what he had done to his him himself and this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran. And as for Tamud, the big tribe of Tamud whom Allah had sent to. As for peace be upon him, as for Tamud, we guided them, but they preferred blindness over guidance. They chose not to be guided. It is unfortunate when you've lived as short as I have and I've seen so many scholars not a lot but I've seen scholars I've seen dies I've seen righteous people flip and go rogue may Allah protect I've seen people who memorize the Quran now engaged in singing and music. I've seen people who were in the first row of the masjid now they're watching movies and spending their times at movie theaters and and and plays and the likes. I've seen people who used to be righteous and practicing with the wrong concept of life. Some of them turned atheists. All of those were misguided because they chose to be misguided. Had they chosen Allah, had they asked for guidance, they would have been guided. How many do we know who were among the Sunnah, who were preaching Islam, who had solid? Now, unfortunately, they're as they are as close as hypocrites, as close as enemies of Islam. You like what you hear and what comes out of their mouths, but it has nothing to do with correct or Quran or Sunnah. All what they seek is fame, recognition, the number of followers and they will get this in this life. But may Allahel keep our hearts steadfast on Islam. May Allahel direct our actions towards him, direct our hearts towards worshiping him in accordance to the correct and valid that pleases him."
