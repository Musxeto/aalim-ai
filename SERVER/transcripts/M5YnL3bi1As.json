  "title": "Should I recite Fateha and a Surah after it while praying behind the Imam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "should one recite the fateha' and surah while praying behind the imam in a prayer behind any man it is either loud prayer loud raucous like in the first two records of MRIB and Asia or it is silent prayers like in Lahore ah sir the last raka of Madrid and the last two records of Asia if you are praying behind the imam in loud raka like in Fajar - records of Maghreb to records of Asia the Sunnah is that you recite the Fatiha when the Imam has concluded his recitation and I'm saying it is a Sunnah it's not a pillar because the Imams recitation suffices for you so if I deliberately do not recite the Fatiha my prayer is valid because in the loud raka his Fatiha suffice for me if I want which is recommended I should recite my Fatiha as well after he says well abilene I mean I recite my Fatiha afterwards now reciting a surah 4 me after the fatiha is totally prohibited because the prophet alayhi salatu salam clearly instructed us not to recite behind the mm any surah after the Fatiha and that was referring to loud raucous but if it's for her time the Imam is not reading audibly I cannot hear him so it is a must that I read the fatiha this is a pillar if I don't my prayer is invalid and it is optional to read surah afterwards and it's highly recommended why after reciting walla bald lean mean insolent raka the naam is reciting surah I can't just sit there do nothing or looking around me I have to do something because in prayer you don't just sit there idle so recite fi a syrup I finished it recite the second one beside a long surah until the Imam goes for record but in loud raucous no surah to be recited except the fact you have for you as a follower"
