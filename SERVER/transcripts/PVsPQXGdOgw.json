  "transcript": "um when we wake up for tud we should say Etc and then make Dua but if I make my full Dua sitting down and raising hands it takes me like 15 minutes but then I think it is good to make Dua with Udu so should I sit down immediately after waking up and make Dua or should I make Dua after doing Udu no the Hadith specifically states that you say then you ask Allah for whatever Dua you want whether it takes 10 minutes 15 minutes no problem in that because your Dua is going to be answered with the grace of Allah afterwards you go and make your W and then you start to pray your and make Dua as well and that would be a win-win inshallah"
