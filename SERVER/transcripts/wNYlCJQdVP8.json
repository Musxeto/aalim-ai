  "title": "Does using cars, computers etc come under 'Imitating the Disbelievers? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all she has a confusion about the meaning of imitating the disbelievers the Hadith is authentic may Allah be pleased with him narrated in a long Hadith and at the end the prophet said whoever imitates a people he's a among them Scholars explained more on this issue for example when the prophet wasam became a prophet and the Muslims accepted Islam he did not tell them change your clothes and wear a different set of clothes that people would identify You by as Muslims he did not tell them to wear a certain color for the turbin or to change from riding horses into riding um bulls for example or or mules he didn't because this was the custom of the people and they are from the people so someone in America who accepts Islam and he's from Texas and he wear a Texan hat this is his people this is his land these are his Customs no problem in that it doesn't go against Islam because this is what he's used to but If part of the people is to wear something Haram like a rapper accepting Islam and he goes out wearing his bling blings and wearing a cross and he said no wait this is totally prohibited now you have to transform change this and become a Muslim so Scholars interpreted imitating the disbelievers by what is a sign of the disbelievers when I see a person I know that he's a disbeliever if I go anywhere and I see someone who is wearing is growing a beard mashallah and a mustache but he's wearing this big turban on his head I know he's a he say no no no she I'm not a but I like this big turban and and the way they tuck their hair this is imitating the kufar this belever is totally prohibited if h a person pierces one ear and wear's an earring in it and though he's a man said this is a sign of homosexuals and disbelievers and imitating women three in one this is even worse than heads and shoulders what are you doing so this is totally prohibited because only those are ENT identified by but let's come to wearing Jes and a t-shirt when I travel I wear a jeans and a t-shirt no one would say that ah imitating the kufar because 70% of the Muslims wear jeans and t-shirts sometimes I even wear suits if it's an official visit and I wear a tie because the vast majority of Muslims wear it so this is not identifying the disbelievers it's not a sign or characteristics of theirs anymore likewise riding a car wearing a watch working on Twitter or Facebook using a laptop no problem in all of this because this is not part of their signs but if a person holds a fork with the left hand and the knife with the right hand and starts to cut the meat and eat with his left hand oh stop Haram why first of all you're imitating Shan because he eats with and drinks with his left hand secondly you're doing exactly what the disbelievers do and Muslims don't eat with the left no matter what full stop so I hope Malika this answers your question"
