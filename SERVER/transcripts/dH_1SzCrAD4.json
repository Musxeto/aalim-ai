  "transcript": "Asam okay my question is about and prayers in general so because I'm a very indecisive person I had trouble choosing between law and business in University I decided to choose business and then made isara before the decision before I made my final decision to apply I started to have doubts so I prayed that whatever Allah knows is best for me happens I then applied for the business major and reasoned with myself that if Allah knew that this was what is best for me it would happen and otherwise it wouldn't so is this okay or does it not work this way no it does not work this way having two minds over a particular or more than one choice would not serve your your has to be predetermined on one thing and one thing alone and you act upon that thing not go and switch whenever you wish rather you act upon it and if it's blocked or there something that happens that makes you change your mind then you uh determine that you go for the other major you pray and you go in that route again"
