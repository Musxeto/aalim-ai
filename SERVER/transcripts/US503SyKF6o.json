  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet today we will talk about two of the prophets daughters may allah be pleased with them they are the second and the third in order in terms of age as we know zainab was the eldest and we talked about her in a previous episode she was the wife of abu al-assam then there was followed by um and the last of the prophet's daughters was fatima so today we are to speak about and um the daughter of muhammad sallallahu alaihi her mother was khadijah bintu so she had the best lineage ever she's the daughter of the messenger and the prophet of allah azzawajal she was born about when the prophet was 33 years of age so when he became a prophet alison she was seven years of age that's a young age however she accepted islam at that young age with the rest of her sisters alongside their mother and she was a girl a young girl and a woman who was sought after because her father was muhammad ibn abdullah he was the trustworthy the honest and the truthful everybody knew him and acknowledged this her mother was khadijah the rich and honorable woman of quraish so at an early age and her younger sister um who was a year younger than her were both married to the cousins of their father and and they were the sons of abu lahab uncle of the prophet their mother was jamilah the daughter of herb the sister of abu so the whole community was interlinked these two boys married these two sisters but when the prophet became a messenger and announced it as we know the prophet took the first three years of the bertha in calling people in secrecy he did not announce it after three years allah azzawajal revealed to him to announce the tao to everybody so he announced it he called the people of mecca the dignitaries everybody and gave them the announcement to worship allah and to abandon their idols the first one to reject and stand in his way was his own uncle abu lahab he was so furious so against islam and dawa after being one of the biggest supporters and people who loved muhammad as an individual once the prophet salam declared islam and called them to it he became a fierce enemy of islam he tried everything in his possession to tarnish his reputation and to deter people from following or even listening to him until allah azzawajal revealed a surah condemning him cursing him sentencing him to hellfire allah says in the quran what translates to may the hands of abu lahab be ruined and ruined is he his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained he will enter to burn in a fire of blazing flame and his wife as well the carrier of firewood around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber this surah is known as suratul masad it's a full chapter dedicated to abu lahab and his wife condemning them to hellfire some scholars said that this surah was a clear evidence of the truth of islam of the quran of muhammad the surah was revealed and it could have been easy for abu lahab to play a game and say okay this surah says that i will be i'll burn in hell well i embrace islam and to pretend that he embraces embraced islam and everybody would know that quran is not true because it stated something and it it was false but he didn't which indicates that was that was a prophecy and it was a challenge so when this surah was revealed abu lahab went to his sons along with his wife and said to them i will not speak to you i will not have anything to do with you unless you divorce muhammad's daughters so the two boys immediately divorced the daughters of the prophet which was something that allah wanted to honor our prophet by detaching from such people and allah wanted to increase the humiliation of abu lahab and his children because of their kuffur and their disbelief by the way was 10 years of age when she was married to her cousin which again not one not two so many women of quraish were given in marriage at a very early age amina the mother of the prophet allah was married when she was 13. so this was the norm that girls got married at a very early age because they blossomed physically and they were capable of catering for the needs of their husbands when she was divorced there was uthman ibn afan with man was a young man a rich man a man who came from a very powerful tribe he had kinship to defend him and this is what mattered at the times your kinship your family your tribe they can defend you they can't stand with you they can support you and if you had money alongside that you've got it made and if you were young and handsome then every woman would look to have an opportunity to marry you uthman was among the very first to accept islam and these are one of the blessings and favors of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him who managed to call so many people youngsters and influentials in a very short period of time the moment the words of truth touched his heart and his hearing he accepted islam being who he was he proposed to the prophet so that he would strengthen the bond with the messenger of allah azzawajal and the prophet alaihis could not refuse such an honorable man a man who came among the first to accept islam so he went and discussed it with his daughter who felt happy and joyful that allah azzawajal replaced her with such an honorable man instead of that thing that was married to her and divorced her without any wrongdoing from her side so she accepted and they got married and all historians say islam did not see a true love story similar to the story of uthman and his wife though he was rich and powerful his people did not like him reverting to islam nor that he got married to their enemy enemy's daughter so they started causing trouble to him and this is when the prophet salallahu salaam ordered him among a handful of men to migrate to abyssinian and the prophet told him to take his wife with him alaihis allah so they set off on their journey which was to the unknown a land they don't speak the language of and they have to cross the sea which they have never sailed on before and she was pregnant so they set off and traveled migrated she gave birth to his first born son abdullah and uthman was known to be nicknamed as abu abdullah and they stayed in abyssinia until allah will that they travel back again and they migrated again to medina so they had two migrations on their cv and that was a great honor at the time to migrate to abyssinia and to medina at the same time when they went to medina subhanallah a lot of people died in medina and unfortunately ruqayyah was one of them she felt sick and in the second year of hijra which means a year and few months after they reached medina she got really sick and it was the time for the battle of badr when the prophet sam told the companions to go along with him to [Music] try to attack and seize a caravan filled with wealth and money that belonged to the people of quraish so uthman asked the prophet sallallahu salaam if he could join him but he told him about his wife so the prophet isaiah told him that you have to stay with ruqayyah try to nurse her try to take care of her and i will save your share from the battle as if you were participating and this shows you how great rukaya was in the heart of her father that he prevented earth man from joining the army in order to take care of her and it's also a lesson for us to learn to learn the importance of our spouses of taking care of them of showing them affection and love especially at times of need so many men yes i know it's their nature not to express their feelings but they have no excuse not to give their spouses their wives they needed care especially when they are in need for that she serves you and your children and takes care of the house and cooks every single meal for you and when she is in need for help or assistance you simply look the other way this is not how men real men behave so he stayed behind and he tried his level best but fate was quicker than his attempts only for her to die before the coming back of the prophet isam from badr and she died at the age of 22 on the second year of hijrah and she was buried in al-baqir now rukaya had a second sister who was one year younger than her and this sister was unkalthum um kalthum at the time was about 21 or 20 years of age after being divorced from her cousin she did not get married now she also faced the calamity of divorce at an early age and this by itself was a trauma for any woman she migrated with her siblings to medina lived her life in medina of course after all the years she spent in the house of the prophet salaam in mecca and also in medina on the third year of hijrah the prophet as assam noticed that uthman had sadness in his face and when he asked him and this narration is mentioned in the books of seerah the chain of narratives may not be authentic but it is a famous story that when it comes to seerah we're not that specific in authenticating all the narrations so he asked him what is it so uthman says this calamity that had struck me the daughter of the messenger of allah died while being married to me and with me and my back is broken the chain the link between me and you o prophet of allah of being an in-law was severed and cut so the prophet said to him alaihis allah man this is jibril telling me that allah is ordering me to give you in marriage um on the same dowry you gave to rokaya on the condition that you treat her as well as you had treated and um says the prophet said alaihis allah i did not give uthman um except through a revelation from the heavens meaning from allah azzawajal so he married her and he lived with um for six years and they did not have any children she died in the ninth year of hijrah this is why some historians give uthman the nickname of the no reigning meaning the one with the two lights as no one had ever married two daughters of a prophet or of a messenger and he was the only one who managed to do that so those who praise ali may allah be pleased with him for marrying the daughter of the prophet which is fatima should praise uthman double that because he married two daughters of the prophet allah she died on the ninth year of hijrah and the prophet was reported to say had i had a third daughter i would given her to him and it shows the amount of love and respect the prophet alison had may allah be pleased with him may allah be pleased with may allah be pleased with um and all the companions of the prophet salallahu [Music] foreign you"
