  "title": "Sports as a profession in Islam - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says can we pursue profession in sports like football cricket etc if you look at the sports as a sport there's no problem in playing it so if a team plays with another team in the neighborhood and we have a good time there's no problem in that but to become a professional to earn money with all that surrounds the game this is something one has to contemplate upon first of all the scholars said that you are not allowed to compete and earn money on that except if it's horse-racing Camelbak racing or archery or whatever falls under these categories because these are the categories that instill jihad in the souls of the people of the youngsters of the community what happens or what's happening now with FIFA with these big organizations it is sort of a brainwash you see all these millions paying for these TV channels paying for attending these matches the advertisement related to it the money the money that some of the players receive for their profession shows you that it is not simply a game it is an industry not only that for a Muslim and this is what concerns us for a Muslim to have this as a profession it means that so many red lines must be crossed in terms of sports has nothing to do with religion so even if you play with the against the enemies of Islam if you play with Israel or misses sports what can you like what can you do about it you may have to skip prayers you may skip fastings you may have to show your love and affection and friendship to others whom you're not supposed to do this you're not supposed to kill people you're not supposed to blow them up but you're not supposed to lose your identity and befriend with everyone we have colleagues we know them but they're not our buddies we don't hang out with them we don't have a good time together because what relates me to others is my religion is my Quran is my Sunna it dictates how I treat with these people so in short it seems that taking this as a profession and being given a salary over it would be more to the Haram and prohibited side rather than the permissible side and Elijah knows best"
