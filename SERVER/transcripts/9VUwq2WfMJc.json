  "title": "Hesitant to talk about issues regarding Islam due to fear of saying something wrong Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "after practicing islam i am more hesitant to talk about issues because i'm afraid that i might be saying something wrong this is a good feeling it's always best to be safe rather than than being sorry so if you're hesitant if someone asks you a question and you're not sure don't put yourself as a bridge over hellfire where people cross on top of your back simply say i don't know simply say i will ask and tell you i remember like 30 maybe 34 years ago i called sheikh bin baz the grand mufti of saudi arabia one of the greatest contemporary scholars of all times and i asked him on the phone about an ayah in the quran which to me at the time seemed easy the grand mufti said to me um i don't know can you please call me tomorrow i'll research it and give it back to you he doesn't know me he never met me and he's having the humbleness to speak to a random caller and ask him to call him the following day i called him the following day and the moment he heard my voice he said yes i researched it and ibn kathy says so and so-and-so and so and this is the verdict on it so you you're not sure don't speak say i don't know it will not deduct any of your fame or reputation or your knowledge rather it would increase you in knowledge in front of the people"
