  "transcript": "[Music] is said that every fasting person does not get the reward of fasting fully who are these fasting is a form of worship it's like every kind of other worships for example the Prophet said ELISA love Sam when a person praise Allah instructs his angels and he says write to my servant whatever he understands from his prayer so they write half of it one-third of it a quarter of it until he reaches 1/10 of it sometimes you can pray and all what is registered is 1/10 10% of your prayer 90% is gone down the drain Allah says to his angels look and see if my servant has voluntary prayers and they compensate what's missing from the voluntary prayers so this shows us that sometimes our fasting is not at all accepted all of it it's not complete so what are the things that reduces the reward first of all since the prophets Fanta cadet Ras salatu salam man lambda I will Azuri well I'm an eBay well Joey Felicia Lily he has a ton V and the other panel Shah Baba whoever does not abandon saying falsehood or acting upon it or ignorance then Allah is not in need of him refraining from eating and drinking what uses your fasting if you refrain from halal which is eating and drinking while you engage in borrowing and lending money in RIBA if you give false testimony at court if you watch Haram or listen to Haram if you consume people's money unlawfully if you deprive people from their rights all of these things reduce your fasting until it may cancel all of it but it doesn't mean that you should break your fasting someone who works in a financial institution that deals with RIBA and he says well if I am lending people with interest which is one of the major sins of Islam and Allah does not need me to refrain from eating and drinking because of that then mad as well I'll break my mother no if you break the fasting of Ramadan this is in addition another major sin so instead of being punished for one you'll be punished for two but rather this is a direction from the Prophet area so some for you to ask Allah for forgiveness and to repent so you have to avoid sins so many people say that it's only Ramadan that counts that is the daytime I know a friend who used to fast Ramadan doesn't drink doesn't eat prays in the Masjid after sunset after he breaks his fasting he calls his girlfriend and he spends the night with her just before support and then he has water he eats a  and he fasts the following day and at nighttime he does the same what is this dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde Allah Azza WA JAL is the lord of the daytime of Ramadan as he is the lord of nighttime of Ramadan Allah is watching so you have missed the essence of fasting when you differentiate between the daytime and the nighttime thinking that Allah will not hold you accountable [Music] [Applause] you"
