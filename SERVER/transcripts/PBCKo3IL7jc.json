  "transcript": "please we are supposed to go too much yes what if you go during the Forbidden time like the sun govind the sun is on the head early afternoon do we have to pay the novel at a time or no okay first of all the Hadith that prohibits praying at specific times such as after Asar till the sunset after Fajr till the sunrise and when the sun is uh exactly on the meridian five to seven minutes before the Adan of dohor these times of restriction are for voluntary prayers that have no reason prayers that have a cause and a legitimate reason such as making up prayers missed prayers such as when you enter a Masjid and you want to sit you cannot sit until you pray to rakas such as al-janaza prayer funeral prayers such as any stihara for example I have something of urgency and I Must Praise tihara now you can do this because it has a legitimate reason and this is Exempted from prohibition at these times for Friday it's an exception because in in Friday a Muslim is recommended to pray voluntary prayers until the Imam comes and says assalamu alaikum which means that he must have been praying at the prohibited time but Scholars said that Friday is an exception from the prohibition of praying when the sun is at the Meridian because of the Hadith and Allah Knows Best"
