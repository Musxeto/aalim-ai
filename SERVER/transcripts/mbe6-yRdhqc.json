  "transcript": "if a person loves the prophet sallallah alai wasam from the heart and out of nowhere he has bad thoughts about the him such as labeling him but the person tries so hard to suppress it and starts crying and tries to ignore it and ask for forgiveness that the person left the fault of Islam the answer is no a person does not leave the fold of Islam through these intrusive thoughts that are generated by Satan himself the prophet said in an authentic Hadith Allah the almighty has forgiven my umah for my sake for whatever thoughts that cross their minds as long as they do not speak about it nor act upon it so so these intrusive thoughts that attack us every now and then Allah mentioned in the last two verses ofah Bak that in the beginning in the last three verses of Surah Al bakar in the beginning it was mandated that whatever crosses your mind Allah will hold you accountable for the companions came to the prophet Alat wasam and said to him oh prophet of Allah Allah has ordained Upon Us difficult things and we have no problem with that we can pray we can fast we can give charity and we can fight in the cause of Allah and offer our lives in Jihad but this verse we can't tolerate it's too difficult how is is it that we can control our inner thoughts and be held accountable for them so the prophet got angry and he said to them do you want to say what the Jews said we hear and we disobey rather say we hear and we adhere and Obey we seek of forgiveness and to you we will return when they said this with content and acceptance after falling down on their knees and asking Allah for forgiveness Allah abrogated this by saying Allah does not hold a soul beyond what it can tolerate and bear and Allah has forgiven our um for whatever crosses our mind mind as long as we don't speak about them and we don't act upon them so you're safe with the grace of Allah"
