  "title": "Can we make dhikr by saying 'Allahu'? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this question is from umar and he says is it permissible to make zikr like allah the answer is no it is not permissible to make dikkar by simply repeating the names of allah azzawajal without anything else so this is the way of the sufis they say allahu allahu allahu allahu and they keep on repeating it and after a while they start moving with the beat and maybe swirling right and left and after a while it becomes difficult to say allah who so they just say who and they repeat it a thousand times and you don't know is this a tribe in in in the jungles of africa or in in alaska what is what are you guys doing so no we're making thicker who's who says no this is allah who this is a pronoun saying him him so what are you doing some people say you say 120 times some say say a samir if you have a pain in your ear and repeat it a thousand times all of this is nonsense all of this is an innovation if it had any roots in sharia in quran in sunnah i would have been more than happy to share it with you but this is an innovation where shaytaan is making fun of you and messing up with your minds"
