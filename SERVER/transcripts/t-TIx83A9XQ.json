  "transcript": "alhamdulillah today with the grace and blessing and favor of Allah Asel upon us we will begin to discuss the chapter that deals with one of the pillars of Islam from the book of and this chapter is the chapter of a zakat and what is a zakat a zakat is a particular and specific amount that a Muslim has to pay when the conditions are fulfilled so we know that there are conditions for zakat and they call it the poor due so it's not a general charity it is what is due for the poor and there are conditions for that among these conditions Islam so zakat can only be taken from a Muslim secondly that the amount of money or of wealth or of the item that you are going to give zakat of has to reach and what is an it is a certain limit below it you don't have to pay zaka but if you have this limit or above you must pay as zakat and the third condition is that the how is achieved and what is the meaning of Al Al is the year so when a whole year passes then if you have the nisab you must give the zakat and it is important to know that zakat is paid only on four things once you master these four things and know them and understand them you will find that everything else is easy for example the first thing that you have to pay zakat for is gold silver and whatever is considered to be similar to them in financial transactions such as money so gold and silver we we know that and Bank notes or money is also zable and we will get to know inshallah what is the for it what is the limit what's the minimum for it secondly what is known as and this is in reference to live stock and when we talk about livestock it has to be either camels cows or sheep or the cousins what do you mean by the cousins well you have the goats you have the Bulls Etc these are all from the same family from the same species and there is a different nisab for each one of them thirdly the things that are grown from Earth and Scholars say that not everything that comes out of Earth we have to pay zakat for and they specifically say that anything that can be stored and can be measured in size or weight it's zable so if someone tells me how about fruit is it Z catable we ask the question can we store it said no after 5 6 days it will Decay then there is no zaka what about vegetables can we store it same thing uh if no fruit and no vegetable so what are you referring to the answer is grain so you have wheat you have barley we have dates you have raisin all of these can can be stored for long times right and they're measured by which is form of measurement of size or by kilograms which is a form of measurement by weight and watermelons can we have zakat for that no because it is not either weight nor measured by size it's measured by each piece five pieces 10 pieces 100 pieces and it cannot be stored so this is the third category the fourth category which is also part of the things that are zakat and you will not find the word zakat in your dictionary so don't look for it zakat is the puru and zakat meanings that you can take zakat out of it this is a new word I don't claim to be the first to use it but but I believe that inshallah it's usable so the fourth category it's an issue of dispute among Scholars however the majority say that it is correct such as and all our great Scholars say that it is zable and that is anything that is made for trade so anything that is displayed to be sold this is zable if I have a grocery shop all the merchandise inside or a supermarket this is zable because it's displayed to be sold if I have a car showroom this is the cata if I trade in clothes this is the catable if I'm a real estate agent I buy houses I buy lands and plots and I resell them so the money invested is zable because I keep on buying and selling buying and selling buying and selling now what are the categories that I've mentioned what are the details we have to go into deep discussion when we come to discuss it but this is not the proper time one would say Okay among the things that we're usually concerned about is shares and stocks do we have to pay zakat over them we have to look are you investing or are you selling and buying and this is also inshallah we will come to discuss later on but we would like to take the first Hadith with us ABD Rahman it is related fromb Abbas when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent mu to Yemen and said you will be meeting people of the scriptures so when you see them call on them to testify that there is no God worthy of being woried but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah if they comply with that then let them know that Allah has made the five prayers obligatory on them every day and night if they comply with that let them know that Allah has made the payment of zaka obligatory on them to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor if they comply with that avoid the best of their possessions when you take zaka and Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between Allah and it in this Hadith the prophet sets the guidelines for da and what are these guidelines one you should begin with with the priority and what is the most important thing in da is the testimony the sh so the prophet Alat wasam first of all had Intel about the people of Yemen so he did not send mu randomly and said go and whatever happens improvise no he knew about the people of Yemen and that they were followers of the the scriptures there are people of the scriptures so he told them you will be coming to people of such and such which means that preparation is extremely important it is not a wise thing to go to a place without preparing for it like Cowboys do and shoot from the hip no you have to prepare you have to do your research you have to be confident so that whenever you're challenged where whenever you're faced with a question usually have the guidelines that helps you to answer so the prophet told him when you meet these people let it be the first thing you call them to is to testify that there is no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah and that the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam is his servant and messenger so don't engage inside talk a lot of the times non-muslims come to me and say why is gold Haram for men and not for women so I spent a lot of time explaining and then they say okay why is music Haram music is very nice it makes people you know chill and enjoy life and do this do that oh okay why the women have to cover why the men don't cover why do this why do that and I engage myself and waste waste my time in s side talk the prophet tells me nope this is not the right way of doing it what's the right way set the foundation then the foundation is prove the Divinity of Allah prove the existence of Allah prove the Oneness of Allah this is number one if we reach this let's prove the authenticity of the Prophet Alat wasam and that he is the greatest messenger of Allah and that he is the one who conveyed the message of Allah to us might take time might be difficult no problem but it's worth working for other than that would be worthless if I cannot call them to testify that there's only Allah to be worshiped and no one is worthy of being worshiped except him I'd be wasting my time now assume that they've answered me and accepted my call to them to testify the K and then move on to Priority number two that is inform them that Allah mandated five daily prayers that's it don't talk to them about the Sunnah don't talk to them about wit night prayer D go with them with the basics so if they accept and they said okay then move on to telling them that Allah has mandated a financial obligation in your wealth and usually people when they hear this is huh money this is the hardest thing in our lives to give away but the prophet did not say give me money the prophet did not say I need money for myself or for my troops of from my treasury he said tell them that Allah has obliged this financial portion in your wealth to be taken from your rich and returned and given back to the poor we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be assalam alaykum and welcome back so the prophet mentioned three things the shahada the prayer and the zakat and he did not mention mention fasting he did not mention pilgrimage why because usually these are the first three things that people suffer and struggle with and fasting everybody fasts as a diet as it's not a big problem and pilgrimage is once in a lifetime so it's not a big problem as well now after he has established these three things the prophet wasam told him as a representative of the Prophet be careful not to go and choose the best of their wealth what does that mean we know that wealth is divided into two types wealth that is apparent they call it and wealth that is hidden and by the wealth that is apparent Scholars say that this is the duty of the ruler to go and collect it whether you like it or not what is the wealth that is apparent they say the livestock and if you have crops and if you have items prepared for sale so these three things it is the obligation of the ruler to send people to collect the zakat so they go to the livestock they count how many heads you have and they take the zakat portion of it and they go to the crops and see how heavy it is if you have harvested it if not they have experts who look at the tree and tell you that in that palm tree there are a approximately 150 kg of dates so they charge you the zakat accordingly and from your trade and your Commerce they also check your books and records and they tell you that these are your sales and this is what you have as inventory in your establishment in your company in your factory in your shop and you have to pay this much as zakat the hidden wealth the Imam is not responsible for calculating it and what is meant by the hidden wealth the cash the gold the silver that you have the ruler is not permitted to go into your house break into it and see what do you have under your bed or under the tiles your Treasures these are yours these are between you and Allah so now the prophet is addressing mu may Allah be pleased with him and he's telling him when you go and collect the wealth that is apparent which is the cattle livestock Etc don't choose the best so for example if I have to pay five camels for zakat he's not entitled to come and pick the best five camels I have this is forbidden because it would be unfair for me he should take the average he's not allowed to take the worst because sometimes I can bribe him and say listen take those they're dying and this is Haram so he is obliged to be just and fair by taking only the average of the wealth that I have and then the prophet saidat because if you do not do that if you take the best of their wealth what would they do they will supplicate they will make Dua and beware because the supplication of a person who's oppressed there is no barrier between it and Allah and that is why oppression is extremely forbidden in Islam the prophet tells us in a number of hadiths that there are three who supplicate and Allah Asel would answer their supplication immediately one the father when he supplicates against his son imagine when your father says something about you and Allah accepts that immediately and answers it and one must be very careful when he treats his parents because it is not a choice to be kind to them it is an obligation one would say yes but Allah says that when they grow old you should be kind to them and not say o but my parents are young so it's okay if I even hit them and smack them and kick them how dare you do such a thing Allah says that in the Quran are you stupid with all due respect any are you smart what is this Allah states in the Quran that when they are old don't say of to them nor say harsh words that does not mean when they're young you're allowed to do this on the contrary when they're young you are afraid of doing this because probably they will smack you they will step on your stomach but when they're old most people are not afraid because they're too old maybe if they raise their hand my father raises his hand he's going to die by a height attack maybe but this is not the right way of thinking it's a major sin if your father says may Allah break your neck Allah will break your neck so imagine if your father supplicates against you or your mother it is not something to be taken lightly you know let them do what they no Allah answers it and also Allah answers the supplication of a traveler while he's traveling and Allah answers the supplication of a person who was oppressed even if he's a cfir imagine if you oppress someone who's cfir usually we say it's okay cfir let me take his money let me beat him let me step on him no Allah says by my grace and my power I will answer you even after a while even after a while I will answer you I will not let you go by without being being answered so be careful from having any form of Oppression against anyone especially a Muslim but even if he's not a Muslim Allah would avenge him and Allah would punish you for doing what you have done of course it is from this Hadith we're not supposed to move on from one pillar before the other so it has to be in this order shahada then prayer then zakat and if you notice in the Quran you will find a lot of mentioning of the prayer and always accompanied by as zakat and Allah says this if they repent establish prayer and give zakat then they are your brethren so this is exactly similar to the Hadith Allah did not mention fasting of Ramadan or performing pilgrimage which indicates that what is mandatory upon any Muslim is to try to First establish these three however it is Allah's Mercy only this is limited to those who can fulfill the conditions and the conditions as stated before Islam and having the nisab so people who are poor do they have to give zakat no and likewise people who don't have money to go for Hajj can they go for Hajj or do they have to know however people who cannot give zakat do not go and beg and say give me money so that I would have nisab and then I would give the zakat but when it comes to Hajj people who cannot afford it they go and ask people for money and say give me money so that I can go for Hajj and this is wrong asking people is not permissible at all do we have any questions we have very short time for a question or two she what happens if a father supplicates against the son is there any way to reverse that like you go back to the father and say could you make another Dua if he's still alive if you realize that that is a situation yes you have to seek Allah's forgiveness first of all and then seek your father's forgiveness so that he would supplicate for you like the siblings of YF when they discovered that they had done something wrong they went to the father and said to him oh my father ask Allah to forgive us and he said I will do that in the S I will do that later on but usually if the Dua is been said it has been recorded so usually if it did not take effect then you try your best to reverse it and Allah knows best if it would be reverse this is all the time we have until we meet next time got"
