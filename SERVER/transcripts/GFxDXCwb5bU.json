  "transcript": "yeah so my questions uh about the shaytan so he's a demon made out of fire so and I heard that uh he kind of he can't stand heat and stuff and I also that he'll be punishing a headphones so uh how is this uh positive possible how can you go fire hot fire Muhammad what were you created from what were you created from from mud so tell me if there is a Mudslide may Allah protect you and your family and you're buried under the mud would you feel comfortable and cozy or would you die what would you die I would die okay how if you were made of mud did I answer your question or not yet so basically speaking yes though the essence of the creation of Satan and the Jinn they were created from fire this does not mean that fire would not be a source of Torment for them because as we are originally created from clay or from mud if someone holds a brick of clay and throws it to our heads we're gonna bleed and feel the pain so this has nothing to do with that and Allah azzawajal knows best this"
