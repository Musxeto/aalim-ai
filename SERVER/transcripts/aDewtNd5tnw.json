  "title": "Can parents stop talking to their children & severe ties of kinship? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible for your parents not to speak to you i.e severing kinship for not obeying them in something that doesn't benefit them and possibly harming you or their excuse for something that is benefiting them is reputation um uh i if you would like an example it's like the cutting of the hair uh like uh you know like let's say i want to grow my hair i'm doing you know not leaving parts and shaving parts and what they want is it is like in the culture or the community it is normal but the culture or the the more my smaller community it's not as normal and they believe it is like um you look crazy or something like that are you doing are you doing kazakh no not at all that's what they want they're saying you know as long as you don't shave you should leave some of it but not a lot rather than growing at all okay i will answer you inshallah uh abdulrahman's question is not something that we just simply can't draw the line and say yes or no boycotting your children for a legitimate reason is permissible why because they have the upper hand they are in control it is our duty to be dutiful to them respectful and obedient and if we fail in doing this maybe not according to what we see but according to what they see they are entitled to reprimand us to punish us through not speaking to us and they wouldn't be cutting or siviring the ties of kinship because they're doing it for a legitimate reason and the sunna is filled with that for example mother ishmael pleased with her when she boycotted her nephew abdullah ibn zubair she is his maternal aunt allah's mother is asma but when he gave her money for her to spend and she spent it all in seconds over charity he got outraged because it was a huge amount of money and he said if she does not refrain from that i'm going to put an authority on her expenditure so that she would not have any control over the wealth she has and this is done with insane people with people who are senile or people who don't have control over what they spend we call them in arabic a safe so when she heard this she was outraged my nephew says this about me and i am the wisest or one of the wisest women of all times and most knowledgeable and i'm the wife of the prophet his maternal aunt by allah i will not speak to him so she bycotted him for a legitimate reason and likewise our parents are entitled to do such a thing if there is a legitimate reason so if a father tells his son not to smoke and the son is defiant and he smokes or he parties or he hangs out with bad company and he doesn't listen to his father his father has the right to kick him out of the house not to speak to him for a month or two hoping that he will get back to his senses the prophet himself allah ordered the people of medina to boycott kabbalah and his friends two friends when they did not catch up with him and the muslim army at the expedition of tabuk and it's mentioned in chapter nine surat at tawba and they bycoted them for 50 days so it is a legitimate course of action to take from their perspective now what about me as a son let's look into each matter and determine you cannot ahi simply judge things from your own perspective now if they tell you to have a normal haircut where there is no kaza there's nothing wrong in following what they're saying even if it goes against your preference because most likely and i'm not a soothsayer alhamdulillah but it seems to me that the way you want to grow your hair is either simulating and imitating the so called quote unquote mujahideen so if you look at the typical mujahideen you'll find that they're wearing a certain head wear or a cap and they've got their hair so long as if it's if they're hippies or women yes this is an act of bravery in some tribes there's no doubt about it and most likely the mujahideen are so busy defending the religion of allah than to take care of their hair but you my friend living in the u.s by looking the way you look your parents have a reason to be afraid when you have a grown beard and you're wearing your head and most likely you're wearing a shirt camis so whoa this guy comes from the 70s or the 80s and i don't know what's your last name maybe it's you know some name that may reflect or you always call yourself like abu sufyan or abu dhujana or this fits like a glove this is a cause for them to be concerned and you may rethink obeying them and being normal and allah knows best islam"
