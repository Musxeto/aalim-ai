  "title": "Is buying Action hero figures permissible for teenagers & adults? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um uh just a quick question what is the ruling on the nowadays many teenagers and adults are purchasing things like action figures what is the ruling on that if these teenagers are adults this is totally Haram action figures is like buying a statue of Iron Man Batman Thor uh frog man Ant-Man whatever man they have and if they're adults this is prohibited for them if their children it is permissible for children to play with such toys however I sincerely would advise parents and grown-ups not to allow their children to watch such nonsense and sometimes such filth a couple of weeks ago a child somewhere I don't know in the UK maybe in the US so a spider and he went to the spider so that's the spider would bite him or sting him thinking that this would turn him into Spider-Man this is what happened happens when we allow our children to watch such nonsense some children and I remember when I was young used to jump from the balcony thinking that they're Superman and that they can fly so such action figures based on American heroes or Pulp Fiction or the likes is not part of our religion nor our culture when we bring up our children and I unfortunately end up with some of my grandchildren coming home with a mask of Batman or a Spider-Man and they've never seen the movies in their lives but it's a craze is it what everybody doing around them so this is problematic where is your identity where is your pride of your Islam ask them who is Osama bin is eight they wouldn't know they wouldn't know who halide is they would know who sallam Aqua is because they don't have any relationship to their history to their Heritage to their dignity the people that made them who they are therefore I would say again adults it's not permissible for them to buy action hearers children be careful"
