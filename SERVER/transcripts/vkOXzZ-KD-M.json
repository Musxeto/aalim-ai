  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (9) - The way he talked - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and welcome to this new episode of the role model is a gift from Allah azzawajal and Allah favored us over other creations of his with this blessing and the way a person talks is indicative of his intellect with him said that a person's tongue is a piece of his mind which means that when you speak this is an indication of your caliber and what a person you are Japanese be pleased with him used to describe the prophet alaihissalam as a person who would prolong his silence and laugh a little and this is a sign of wisdom of dignity that you don't spill your guts all over the place rather you maintain your honor you don't talk without any legitimate reason and when you do you don't take the whole hour or the whole event spending it on talking just for people to look at you and to listen to you without any doubt the prophet Allah was the most articulate person to have ever speak in the language of the Arabs or any other language he said about himself I was given the concise of speech meaning that it's a gift from Allah to speak few words and it these words contain so much information and value that you may need volumes to write them down in for example of one of the most known hadiths to everyone verily Deeds are judged by intentions there is no form of worship that this Hadith is not involved in and every single book that Muslims have written include this Hadith also the Beauty the beautiful phrase the beautiful sentence the legal Maxim neither causing harm nor reciprocating harm don't do this this is a law in two words and you can Cascade this to all aspects of life also the beautiful legal statement that all jurors and judges and those dealing with the law know and this is one of the most needed laws to be implemented someone comes and accuses me of taking his money of raping his sister of a shameful Act anyone could accuse me of doing this should we listen to him the prophet said no he has to provide the evidence to prove his allegation any one woman coming and pretending that or claiming that someone raped her should we hang him of course not she might be a big liar give us the proof that can stand in a court of law not just allegations and tears and the likes if that person claiming is false or is unable to bring evidence to back his claim the prophet says then the accused must swear by Allah that he did not do this end of story 95 percent of people's allegations and cases are solved Through This Magnificent phrase he was given the concise of speech and the prophet Allah is described by mother Aisha when he spoke he didn't speak like 60 miles per hour he wasn't fast and just throwing words right left and Center rather he used to speak in a very eloquent an articulate fashion that everyone understands every single letter that he is saying and she says that if a person wanted to count the number of words that come out of the prophet's mouth they could have done that Anderson Malik says when the prophet spoke sometimes not all the time sometimes when needed he would repeat what he had said three times so that people would comprehend it and this is a form of drawing people's attention and ensuring that what was said is not to be neglected once he came and saw his companions performing wudu and they were very tired after a very long journey and he noticed that some of them due to being so tired they were not washing their feet and heals properly so only the top of the foot so he said three times to these Hills from Hellfire and he repeated it Thrice and you can guess what impact is left upon those who were making voodoo also the prophet salallahu would give Salam three times when wanting to enter a house and this is like ringing the bell so it's a assalamu alaikum no response shall I come in no response if there is no response he would go and leave and also the prophet once was sitting with his companions in the well-known Hadith to all of you and he said shall I not tell you about the biggest of all major sins and he repeated this question three times so you can imagine the audience's attention to what was coming afterwards and the prophet salallahu sallam is rhetoric was straight to the heart because he used to select and choose the best of words foreign heard of a man and he's they told him that he's crazy he's insane and lamad was someone who did Rukia and did exorcism he dealt with taking the Gin out of the people though he was not a Muslim but he had this ability in him so he went to the prophet and said listen I know how to cure insane people so would you like me to help you the prophet Allah did not say to him what do you think you think I'm crazy I'm mad get out of my face no the prophet replied to him with these beautiful words [Music] the man said whoa hold your horses down repeat this and the prophet salallahu sallam repeated it three times then the guy said listen I've traveled the world I heard sooth Sayers wordings fortune tellers those possessed by Jinn I've heard the poets I've heard orators I've never heard anything similar to what comes out of your mouth and this is the most Optimum of all rhetorics and the man accepted Islam on the spot beautiful words that come out of his mouth and the prophet salallahu was also in a in a way as we use this terminology diplomatic in the sense that whenever he wanted to say something that might be repulsive to some he would pave the way because it has has to be said so in Hadith once the prophet addressed the companions he said listen I am to you as a father to his children so I teach you when you defecate do not face the Qibla or you give your backs to it and he orders of three stones to cleanse yourself with which is like toilet tissues and three wipes minimum and he forbade them from using dung or bones in cleaning themselves and he prohibited a person to clean himself using his right hand so the prophet gave her introduction to his teachings with these beautiful words I am like a father to his children sometimes when he spoke he used to swear by Allah azzawajal to put emphasis on what he says though everybody believes him but this is needed to draw your attention and to give importance to what you're about to say and he usually used the word or the phrase by whom my soul is in his hands in other incidents the prophet saws would pause a question so that he would draw their attention like in the well-known Hadith do you know who is a person who's broke and they said the one who doesn't have money then he clarified it to them said no he's a person that comes on the day of judgment with lots of prayers fasting charity but he slandered this man hit that man back bit this one shed the blood of that one took the money of this one so he comes on the day of judgment and he gives each one he had drawn done from his Good Deeds and if his Good Deeds are over before giving back what he owes to people then they give him from their bad deeds and then he would be thrown into hell this is someone who's truly broke so was the prophet Allah a person who's described as loud so that we know people when they speak in Gatherings they're so loud they're so dominant you can't hear anything except what they say was he like this may Allah be pleased with him says whenever the prophet saws entered a gathering or a room or a hall he would give he would give the Salaam to a level that someone who's awake can hear but someone who's asleep would not be awakened by so the prophet's tone was very moderate and very delicate he would not enter like every time we're in the Masjid especially in Ramadan before prayer time or during uh between Adan and Akama people come into the message why are you shouting why are you giving Salam as if you're the Imam for everybody and this is not a single person you get like 50 70 people coming in everybody's shouting his head off this is not from the Sunnah yes if you come and pray to arachas and there's someone you know you privately say Islam shake hands no problem in that but the prophet when he entered the room he would say so those who awake can hear but those who are asleep would not be bothered by his Salaam and when it was needed he would raise his voice as in the case of Friday he's giving a speech he's addressing thousands of people it's not logical to speak about hell and heaven and about warning people of the day of judgment from the day of judgment by saying and you have to fear the day of judgment and hellfire is frightening it is so hot it is so intimidating people fall asleep no the prophet saws whenever he gave he would raise his voice and his uh cheeks would grow and his veins would appear as if he's warning the people there's a an army coming to attack you just now how would a person warning people from an army coming to attack them he would definitely shout at them and this is also to draw their attention the prophet was a lot of parables or examples so he would say and he would use his hands gesture to illustrate so he would say those who remember Allah and those who don't or the house that people remember Allah in it and the house does not remember Allah in it it's like a dead person and a living person and he would show it and illustrate it through gestures by saying I was sent and the hour like this and he would show the resemblance between the index and the middle finger so this is him and this is a day of judgment the distance or the timeline is very close to one another and sometimes he would throw puzzles also to draw people's attention the prophet said once Allah there's a tree that it leaves never fall and it's like a Muslim it resembles a Muslim tell me about it so everybody was giving their guesses about the plants they know and then the prophet said it is the palm tree and this shows you that the resemblance between a Muslim and a palm tree and finally the prophet salallahu used a very needed etiquette for us today when talking he would not publicize people's names in the public so Aisha says if the prophet Allah was told something negative about a person the per the prophet Assam would never go and say publicly why did so and so and name the person why did Abdullah do this or say this like in the Hadith of amen the prophet dispatched to collect the zakat money so the man came after a few weeks and said oh prophet of Allah this is the zakat money I collected from all the different tribes and this is a gift that was given to me so the prophet Allah got onto the pulpit praise the law offers salutation upon the prophet as Islam and said why do we employ people to collect their zakat and they come back to us saying that this is your zakat and this was given to me on what basis they were given a gift shouldn't they stayed in their father and mother's home and see whether people would give them a gift or not the answer is definitely not because this is a bribe had you not been an employee by the government or by the prophet nobody would have come to your house and said listen this is a gift for you but because you're collecting zakat they're cut they're wanting you to cut them some slack and this is why they're giving you something underneath the table and this is a bribe in this Hadith the prophet did not say why did IBN Allah did so and so and so he just simply said it vaguely and generally and this is an etiquette we Muslims need if you go to YouTube or Instagram or whatever they call them Snapchats and social media you will find Brothers mentioning by name this die this scholar this individual and stripping them actually metaphorically that is otherwise it would have been a rated R they were stripping them and exposing them and they said this and they said that and they said and it's back and forth between them it's like volleyball throwing the ball from one Court to the other and they're wasting the Muslims times and they are slandering one another and they're losing a lot of good deeds and each one of them say I'm doing it for the sake of Allah I'm exposing him so that I would warn the Muslims and it's all a private Vendetta it's all something inside their hearts filled with malice and envy and may Allah protect us all yeah you want to warn against someone don't mention them by name just say generally speaking don't follow this uh way of thinking follow the mainstream of Scholars trusted Scholars someone who's not controversial instead of saying Sheikh so-and-so or Dr so-and-so or there is so and so and you fill people's hearts with malice and and hatred rather than filling it with peace and Deen and proper knowledge"
