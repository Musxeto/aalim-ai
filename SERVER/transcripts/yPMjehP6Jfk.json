  "transcript": "um latifah from the u.s u.s asks about a question and this question is about a hadith which states that no calamity no depression no worries not even a thorn that pricks a person and hurts him of course except allah azzawajal would erase from his bad deeds accordingly and this is a blessing of allah i'm depressed because i lost my job or because my car had an accident or i have to pay the rent or the kids did not make it or did not have good grades any reason that i feel depressed or i have worries of the future or i have a bad cold or a sore back all of these things as long as i'm patient i'm not complaining i'm not whining from my record books lots of bad sins and deeds so now latifah says what about if i committed a sin and i have this pain an ache in my heart because of regretting the sin that i had done would the same apply well this heartache this pain and suffering your feeling is called remorse and remorse is as the prophet said in authentic hadith remorse is repentance the feeling of pain that you get after doing a sin regretting it this is repentance by itself it's the highest condition of repentance so you are rewarded for it would that reward compensate to erase the sin committed this is in allah's hands this is something we don't know but yes you are being rewarded for it now this is not the question the question would be if i committed a sin and as a consequence i got sick or caught a disease will i be rewarded for the disease i caught whether it's an std may allah protect us all or anything likes this is something to be looked into because this might not be an expiation to your sins rather a punishment and this is in allah's hands and allah knows best"
