  "title": "Bahira Monk saw cloud above Prophet on the way 2 Syria Was the cloud always with him assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shake while reading the s of our beloved prophet Alisat wasam I came to know about the hadith on monk Bahira witnessing the cloud over prophet during the trade towards Syria does the significance of cloud over prophet persisted all the time or was this event specific to that journey the hadith of the monk with all the details and the little little uh tiny gritty stuff. It's an issue of dispute whether it's authentic or not. But we believe that the vast majority of what was mentioned would not significantly give any extra to our prophet because his prophethood his miracles were proven without the need of going to weak hadiths. But if the trip with Abu Talib to Asham to Syria was proven and that they met this monk Bah who recognized the signs upon this young boy and he told his uncle to return him back to Mecca because if the Jews figured him out they would assassinate him. If the story is correct, then so be it. It's it's not of a great importance. Now whether the cloud was on the prophet 247 or only when Bah saw him, how would we know? There were no companions to narrate the story to begin with. This is why it might be a little bit dubious to confirm it. But nevertheless, we don't have these details because there were no companions to narrate to us exactly what had happened. And Allah knows best."
