  "transcript": "and welcome to this episode of islamic filk some make it 63rd and some make it 64th and the numbers insha allah won't make that a big difference uh last time we stopped at one of the prescribed punishment and if you recall that the prescribed punishments have variable have different types and one of them is the sin of fornication or adultery and for this sin there is the punishment of either flogging or stoning as you remember inshaallah and we said that in order to prove such a crime we need either a confession or the testimony of for adult muslim men now if this condition is not fulfilled so if there were a hundred women or three men and two or three or five or ten women or there were three muslim men and ten non-muslim men etc in this case the punishment of zina is not implemented however those who came forward to testify without fulfilling the conditions of being a witness over such a a crime their punishment is to be flogged and this false accusation in islam is called al-qaeda and linguistically means to throw so if i have something and i throw it this is called and nowadays it is understood whenever you use this word that you mean slandering which is accusing someone of adultery of fornication and even of sodomy and the prohibition of this is crystal clear in the quran and the sunnah and in the consensus of scholars of islam allah says and those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce four witnesses lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept from them testimony ever after and those are definitely disobedient so this crime refers as stated to any accusation of adultery fornication or sodomy what about if the woman was not chased she is known to be a play woman and the man is known to be a playboy the ruling is the same and the scholars say using the word chaste women this is the norm which means that usually this is what makes it a major sin that people would slander chaste women without having proof to prove it and allah says also in the quran indeed those who falsely accuse chaste unaware and believing women are cursed in this world and hereafter and they will have great punishment so this is not specifically for women it also applies for those who falsely accuse men as well in the hadith of abu hurairam please with him the prophet said alaihis avoid the seven major sins and this hadith is why a lot of the muslims think that major sins are limited only in seven and this is not true the prophet allah ordered us to avoid the seven sins and he did not say there are no major sins except these sins and this is the way of the quran this is the way of the prophet salam to highlight the gravity of certain sins which does not necessarily mean that other sins are lesser in gravity what is the punishment for false accusation allah azzawajal prescribed this punishment by stating that it should be or that person who slanders an innocent individual must be flogged 80 lashes and he's considered to be a fair simple a transgressor thirdly that his testimony would be rejected and he would be disqualified as a witness allah says in the quran and those who cause or those who accuse chaste women and then do not produce for witnesses number one flog them with 80 lashes number two do not accept from them testimony ever after and number three those are definitely disobedient transgressors if such a person repents then allah azzawajal is most forgiving and in this sin of slaundering there are two rights the right of allah azzawajal and the right of the individual i had slandered so if i was flogged then the right of the individual has been taken care of as for the right of allah if i repent and i explain my transgression and i confess of the falsehood of my accusation while expressing regret then allah accepts my repentance allah says ex accepted are those who afterwards repent and make amends for allah is much forgiving ever merciful and this is alhamdulillah one of allah's favors and best blessings upon us now why is slaundering sinful what's wrong in what they call free speech this concept is greatly misunderstood in the west they consider this to be personal privacy if i go outside wearing no clothes if i shout if i curse if i say blasphemous things if i insult allah if i insult the prophet if i insult jesus christ if i insult the quran to them it's no problem it's freedom of speech it is protected by the constitution and they fail to acknowledge that your privacy your rights end and must stop when my rights and privacy begins so if you want to do something in your own room this is your privacy if you want to do it on the streets this is a public place and everybody is watching you have no right to do this and laws contradict so they say privacy freedom of speech you have the right to do whatever you want but if you go to a hospital it is a crime to smoke and it's a felony if i go to a restaurant it is not permissible to smoke subhanallah where is my privacy if the traffic light is red i have to stop and if i don't they will find me maybe put me in jail so who who put these rules and regulations it's the government it's man-made but when it comes to divine directives from allah azzawajal this is easily ignored now islam is a divine religion it's a religion that is from allah azzawajal which puts a lot of weight when it comes to credibility why do i say such a thing islam is a fair religion islam is a religion that cares about people in the past three or four decades maybe more heard through the media many scandals and people were slaughtered whether justly or unjustly people's reputation and honor were negatively impacted by an irresponsible accusation so nowadays a person accuses another of rape of having sex without consent of sodomy of this and of that many people lives have been changed forever simply because islam was not followed and if we look at bill clinton's case with monica lewinsky as an example so much money was wasted so much time and effort was put into such a case and in islam it is a simple thing to solve so as he said i have not have sex with that woman so he says and she says nothing and the whole world is against his case you guys don't have a proof no confession no four witnesses what do you have would you come to the international monetary fund head this french guy i forgot his name a woman accuses him of having sex with her without her consent and he was kicked off his position put into trial for two three years and then acquitted because there are no evidences subhanallah you destroy a man by such an accusation where's the proof i can come and accuse anyone with whatever i want would that make him a perpetrator michael jackson mj he was accused of child abuse okay witnesses no witnesses confession he did not confess but his image was tarnished all over the media and i could out of my memory bring you tens of similar cases the metoo movement and i know this is not going to go down who cares the me too movement maybe according to their laws is okay and with the media boost it is okay and a lot of the men are supporting it because it gives them momentum and a good reputation in islam it is unaccepted i was talking to one of my daughters the other day about it and she said no they deserve it these men are traitors they're liars they're this they're that and she was a little bit influenced by the feminist movement so i said to her okay let's assume one of your friends is visiting you and let us assume she stays over the night which is something we don't do usually and the following morning she goes out and says to the whole world she hasn't harassed me attacked me did heinous things to me my daughter immediately said she's a liar he said how can you tell i know my father subhanallah and also those being accused have daughters and sisters who happen to know their brothers and fathers islam protects your reputation as well as mine so if you confess and say yes i can i i committed this heinous sin with shaykh also you will be flogged or stoned depending whether you're married or not as for me islam says no we can't take her word against his we have to see does he confess he said no i didn't do anything can she provide four witnesses no there was no one there is there any circumstantial evidences dna etc no nothing then how can we even approach this man or that man or any man with such a crime or an accusation that is unproven what to do that woman who accused him she must be flogged for slaundering his reputation so islam is a fair and just religion from your point of view as a woman who was attacked yes you would say this is not fair this is not justice he's the perpetrator he has to be punished i understand reverse it let's assume that a woman accuses your father or your son or your husband who you know him more than you know yourself would you accept this accusation and say yes this is not fair yes i know he's my father i know he's my son i love them both but if the woman said that he attacked her then he must have attacked her would you say this or you would you say no she's a liar and this is what islam does protects both sides and puts clear rules for protection of women of men and for the community at large so what are the prescribed um punishment of flogging 80 lashes what are the reasons justifications for that in the book you would find number one protecting the society so this is to protect people from others coming and slaundering them simple as that number two safeguarding people's honor i have my reputation to protect i have my honor will you come and accuse me of doing something that i had not done and you failed to produce evidences then you have to be punished for that because you have transgressed against my honor and reputation number three putting an end to evil talk and this is something that whenever you visit friends and relatives this type of gossip of slandering of idol talk prevail in such gatherings so islam puts the punishment for that so it ensures that no one falls in such a heinous sin and finally ensuring that indecency continues to be held as repugnant or republic reap cognate yeah which is something that is disliked abhorred in a muslim society so indecency is not endorsed in islam and such accusations of innocent people must end you remember when the prophet sallam gave and delivered the final ceremony in the farewell hajj what did he say in the amway your blood meaning not to be shed not to be killed not to be injured and your reputation your honor are haram upon one another exactly like the sacredness of this day the day of arafah or the day of eight in this month the sacred month of the hija in these lands in mecca or in arafat in haram area in the sanctuary of haram so this is something that is well known in islam to be highly respected and to be highly protected so these are two major sins and they're prescribed punishment fornication and adultery number one number two is laundering we move on to the third sin major sin and that is consuming intoxicants intoxicants is referred to in the quran as is a general word that refers to any substance that enshrouds the human mind see what is the thing that a woman covers her head with it's called because it covers and hammer wine or intoxicants is called hammer simply because it covers your intellect and your ability to think and make the correct decision and allah azzawajal has prohibited consuming of intoxicants in the quran in the sunnah and the consensus of all scholars of islam allah says all you who believe indeed intoxicants gambling um sacrificing on stone altars and be divine and uh divining arrows are but defilement or defilement from the work of satan so avoid it that you may be successful allah also when mentioning the intoxicants he says stay away from turn away in a definitive statement of prohibition allah says turn away avoid it and the prophet said allah any drink that intoxicates is forbidden to take therefore anyone who's trying to play it smart and says whatever is mentioned in the quran we abide by it allah mentioned in the quran and the arabs know that al hamr refers to wine so drinking wine is prohibited we agree but no one calls other types of intoxicants wine so when we come to whiskey when we come to scotch bourbon gin rum vodka tequila johnny walker beer whatever you in an arabic record and all types of prohibited drinks and they said this these are not wine we know wine is made of dates or made of barley made of wheat it's made of grapes but these things are not intox disease are not hammer so it's okay to drink be careful it's the prophet who told us that there will come a time when people call intoxicants hammer with different names and in this bukhari halal and they will make wearing of silk fornication drinking of wine and listening to musical instrument halal which means that all of these four things are haram so changing the name doesn't make any difference the prophet said whatever intoxicates in large quantities little of it is haram so for example if there is a beer and this is something that people love to circulate about me and saying that the sheikh drinks beer that has point three percent alcohol or point one percent alcohol or one percent alcohol and we say to them that not everything that contains alcohol is haram if you drink a bottle of alcohol you'll die it will burn your intestines what intoxicates you is haram so if there is an non-alcoholic beer like the one sold in the gulf area in saudi arabia specifically and kuwait other areas may sell alcohol they have no problems in the gulf but with the grace of allah saudi arabia and kuwait till date don't sell intoxicants and may allah azza preserve these beautiful two countries and keep them steadfast on islam so when i go and buy a beer heineken budweiser musa or something i don't know and it says non-alcoholic beer and in the ingredients it says 0.5 alcohol 1 alcohol and if i drink a full six-pack would i be intoxicated answer is no if i drink 12 bottles i'll be hospitalized but no it doesn't intoxicate you because the amount of alcohol does not suffice to intoxicate you even if consumed in large quantities if this is the case then scholars say that this is halal to drink and if i take a sip of champagne will i be intoxicated that says no so does this mean it's halal they say wait a minute what happens if i drink like three four glasses or a whole bottle would i be intoxicated definitely yes you'll be wasted in this case one single drop of it is haram the hadith is whatevering intoxicates in large quantities a little bit of it is haram and this is the prophet's rule on it therefore anything that intoxicates anything that hampers your decision-making and makes you do heinous things such as cannabis hash marijuana [Music] amphetamines cocaine heroin etc all of these drugs are the same ruling of wine and intoxicants so what's the reason behind that well when you consume intoxicants first of all you lose your mind and you are increasing the tendencies of fighting others and it increases the hatred and enmity in the hearts and it prevents people from offering prayer on time on and in the way that pleases allah when you consume alcohol intoxicants drugs you make the wrong decisions and the majority of pregnancies among teenagers is due to being wasted being drunk this is why a lot of the guys love to introduce alcohol and parties because they know they can get laid then they can run up run away with it cases of rape cases of of course in islam alhamdulillah we don't have this but when we do ask about the reason of divorce i so many times get counseling sessions with people who divorced and the wife says he was on drugs when he divorced me he was drunk when he divorced me so it makes you do things that you tend to regret after you sober out one of the self when he was asked what do you think of intoxicants he said in the jahiliyyah in pre-islamic times i used to drink a lot and then after i saw what it did to me i stopped drinking one of the people drank once got wasted then he urinated well drunk and then he washed his face with his urine and said allah this is what we say after we perform buddha the guy is saying it after washing his face with his own urine because he's drunk so allah says that this is part of the evil of shaytan shaytan does this allah says satan seeks only to stir up enmity and hatred among you by means of intoxicants and games of chance and to turn you away from the remembrance of allah and from prayer will you not then desist so this these are the reasons as mentioned clearly in the quran and the prophets alaizu-san described wine as um the mother of all corruption there was a story that there was this monk who was known among his people to be god-fearing a woman once called him to her house claiming that she needed his help to do rukia or to do something that no one else can do except him so he entered thinking that the house is filled with people and there was not no one except him and her and she closed she locked door after door until he was in a room with her and she said to him you have a choice of three either to have me or to kill a child or to drink intoxicants the man having little knowledge said to himself zina is a major sin i'm not gonna do this killing an innocent person is a major sin i'm not gonna do this drinking wine is yeah something that i think is the the least of all evils so he drank and drank and drank until he got drunk and then he killed the boy and committed zina with that room this is why they called it so what is the punishment for that if a person whose conditions are fulfilled he has to be flogged and the flogging is not mentioned in the quran it is mentioned in the sunnah of the prophet so the prophet saw flogged and abu bakr flogged and the rest of the companions flogged as well the difference is in the number of lashes so at the time of the prophet the lashes were 40 and when people underestimated this punishment and they grew in number and consuming alcohol and wine rumor may allah be pleased with him increased it to 80 lashes and anas may allah be pleased with him says the prophet is used to punish drinking by 40 lashes using shoes and dried branches and then may allah be pleased with him as narrated by ali and others increased it to 80 and the reason was that in some stories that ali is the one who gave him this advice when he consulted adi and omar said to ali the people are growing in number in consuming wine so what to do about it so i'd leave me a little please with him said to him i believe that the best thing to do is to punish them a bit more because when a man drinks he becomes drunk and when he becomes drunk he slanders others and in the quran as we've just studied a while ago the punishment of a person who slaunders is being flogged 80 lashes so i would recommend that we raise it into 880. so um raise it till 80 and since then the muslim ruler and the muslim judge had the choice between 40 and 80 and both are accepted in islam because 40 is the doing of the prophet salaam and 80 is the ishtihad of umar who is one of the four rightly guided caliphs the prophet haslam asked us to follow what they do but to enforce this flogging process there are conditions that must apply condition number one that the person who's drunk and caught red handed or confessed has to be a muslim the flogging is for muslims but if a christian or a jew or a hindu or a buddhist were caught red-handed they would not be flawed as a prescribed punishment because some of them even might be halal in their religion there might be another type of punishment that the ruler the muslim ruler comes up with but this is up to his own judgment number two the offender must be an adult and have uh um who attained puberty so if we caught a ten-year-old boy and we have this unfortunately in some muslim countries who sniff glue or gasoline or any substance that would make them intoxicated we don't flock them because they're not adults thirdly they have to be sane so if we caught someone who is insane definitely he's not accountable uh he he should have free uh freely chosen to use intoxicants so if someone was under gunpoint and was forced to drink until he got drunk in this case the punishment does not apply we must know he must know that islam prohibits intoxicants so if a muslim in america or in germany accepted islam and drank champagne or there was a toast with his parents drinking red wine and he drank and then he confessed that he did not know that it was haram because he just accepted islam in this case it is not applicable to punish him and sixthly he should know that what he's drinking is intoxicant so if he's saying if he's an adult if he knows a prohibition but when he visited his friend and he gave him apple juice or orange juice he drank it thinking that it is juice and then he got drunk do we punish him the answer is no because he did not know the reason or the ruling so there's no punishment on him so i think that this about covers this prescribed punishment and we shall stop at theft and we will continue it inshallah next week which is thursday now we go back to the questions we have 17 minutes for the questions inshaallah and today is monday correct when will we have the free session for uh the questions you know we we have one hour three uh four questions every uh month so we did ours last month when should we do ours this month let us assume at the moment that it is next thursday after the session ends we will insha allah try to connect it with a session of questions hopefully and if there are any uh new plans we will keep you updated on time being question one sergey mibeki says can you please explain for me what is the kalala al kalala is generally speaking among scholars a person who does not leave behind after he dies any ancestors or offspring and he is called kalala due to the weakness because all who what he has left is al-hawashi those who are on the linear side but on the horizon on the vertical side fathers mothers parents grandparents sons grands children daughters etc he did not leave anyone so this is who dies leaving behind siblings or uncles paternal or cousins and this is the kalala that was mentioned in the quran and allah azza knows best what is the ruling and this is from hamyun what is the ruling of qurbani on a person who is not performing hajj this is a highly recommended sunnah i don't know if we answered this or not but anyhow in one family how many korbani is obligatory i mean every person who gives the cat should do qurbani we've answered this many times before and said that each household if they live under the same roof and they eat from the same kitchen as in the joint families for example or if i live in a house and there are 20 other people living under my roof and killing and eating from the food that i am bringing to my kitchen all the whole 20 people even if four or five of them are earning they require one uh um slaughtered by me and it suffices all of them afrina says if i suddenly fell asleep and when i wake up the time has gone can i combine both of salah together if you mean by combining is to pray one and then after you finish you pray the other the answer is yes because there is no other alternative a woman or a man goes to sleep at 10 am only to wake up at 5 00 p.m so he misses what should he do he should pray for raqqa and then he should pray for raqqa of assa this is the combining that there is no other alternative than it muhammad says is it necessary to change the position that the position after the fart salat in order to pay the sunnah in the house the answer is yes it was the prophet who ordered us after praying the fort salat to either change the position by moving one step forward backwards to the right or to the left or to talk these are the two actions that separates the for from the sunnah so yes i finished my father i did my afkar i want to pray my sunnah i have to change my standing position or speak to someone by saying salaam alaikum what's the time how are you whatever then i can pray in the same spot and allah knows best mahrokaf says recently my neighbor lost her husband she has two grown-up children but still dependent i am not aware of her financial condition back home and she might even get some amount from her husband's since there is no earning member in her family is she eligible for zakat from neighbors and friends or do we have to investigate about her finances that sounds inappropriate as she is first of all zakat is allah's right in our wealth so it is an obligation for us to give zakat because this is allah's right and we are obliged to give zakat to the eight categories of recipients of zakat mentioned in surat atoba chapter 9 verse 16. now the vast majority of muslims don't give zakat to those who need it but rather to those who they feel sorry for and this is unfortunate many muslims give their zakat to a friend or to a relative that they've been giving zakat for the past 20 years and when you investigate about that relative you would find that he does not fall under the category of any of the 80 members the the eight categories of zakat so when you look at your question you will understand that it is unacceptable to give zakat to someone you don't know whether they're rich or poor so you come and say shaykh asam well he looks poor he doesn't have a job he looks as if he needs the cat and if i give him zakat i can see that i'm doing something good so you give me the zakat and i'm not aware that this is zakat and i take it as a gift on the day of judgment you will pay for that because this is allah's right this is a form of worship that you have to be at least mostly certain that a person is either poor or needy so if you go to this woman who has two adult boys and who is in her edda you said that her husband has a business if a woman's husband has business and the business is running and she's getting revenue out of it being labeled and described as a widow does not equal being labeled as poor or needy so not every widow is poor or needy not every orphan is poor or needy you have to make at least almost certain that they are poor or needy by either her coming and begging and telling you that i don't have enough money to buy food and you believe that or by knowing firsthand that she does not have money to pay the rent and there's no income for her yes she needs oh she needs medication she cannot afford it yes or the income that she gets gets consumed 10 days before the end of the month which means that she's in need for 10 days only then you can go and gives a cat other than that no you have to be really careful when it comes to the cat money again i don't know if these names are real or because i'm unable to pronounce them well sheikh may i may is step child inherit or must they be gifted before or even after death of the one who has distribute the wealth no a step child is the son or the daughter of the spouse of the deceased so the deceased has no relationship with them they are simply the children of his wife or depending so such a person does not inherit because he's not the son of the deceased or the daughter of the deceased are they to be given money from the inheritance this is not mandatory at all and if the other heirs agreed to give them something as a compensation this this is permissible aklima islam says if i late attend to jamaa and have last few hours of the fatiha in audible prayer in this case should i have to repeat surah al-fatiha again after saying i mean the question is clear if a person who's a late comer joins the congregation when the imam is reciting the second surah after the fatiha of course it's a audible and loud prayer so as a latecomer who did not hear the fatiha am i obliged to recite it the answer is no you're not obliged if you recite it that's not a problem it's up to you if you skip it all together the recitation of the imam is sufficient for himself and for all those behind him and allah knows best wahab abdul nurin says can my wife change what she asked for mahar example if she asked for a set of gold and she sees i cannot pay she asks for another thing is that is that okay mahar is something that is agreed upon and it becomes the right of the wife and a debt upon the husband to give and it's a serious thing not to give it but if the woman was intelligent and generous and decided to reduce the amount so the gold set was five thousand dollars and she sees that her husband is unable to pay for that and she tells him listen give me something worth two thousand five hundred dollars then there's nothing wrong in that insha allah and this is like giving him half of her dowry as a gift and such a woman is rewarded for her action and should be praised by her husband for her generosity but to ask for something that is more this becomes riba so if she says well the five thousand dollar gold set that you did not bring me and it's been two years since we've been married then in this case i demand the ten thousand dollars worth of gold set a necklace or whatever for being late and to just wait for another two or three years for you to give it to me and the husband accepts this is riba and it's haram are two witnesses required during divorce it is recommended but not necessary nor mandatory for divorce what happens usually is that the vast majority of men divorce their wives and reconcile and revoke the divorce like couple of hours maybe a few days later down the line which is totally legit unfortunately 10 years down the line they tend to disagree the husband said i divorced you only once and the wife says no you divorced me twice before that and this is the third divorce and there are no witnesses therefore it is highly recommended for a person when he divorces his wife as well as when he reconciles and revokes the divorce that he tells two men so his brothers his cousins his friends his colleagues at office listen i divorced my wife last week this was my first divorce and i revoked the divorce last night and reconciled with her so we have one down two to go and this way it becomes clear that if there is any this agreement in the future we have people to refer to and they would most likely remember and tell us and help us authenticate how many divorces did take place and uh with this we come to the end of our session until we meet next time that is thursday was"
