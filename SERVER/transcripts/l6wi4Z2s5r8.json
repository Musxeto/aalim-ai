  "transcript": "in our household we would like to have a righteous husband and a righteous wife this is our model family this is our ideal family but does this mean that there are no fights can can we have houses without any fights this is not possible maybe probable but not quite possible even in the best of houses you would find some sort of skirmishes not fights but here and there the Prophet erase a lot or Sarah with Ayesha Ayesha used to be upset with him sometimes imagine I assure being upset of the prophet of Allah this is normal this is how a man and his wife it has nothing to do with the messenger and the servants of Allah it has to do with the man in his wife and the Prophet said decide some Ayesha I know when you are pleased with me and I know when you are angry he said this out of the blue they were happy so they were just chit-chatting so I said I know when you're angry and I know when you are not she said how do you know that prophet of Allah he says when you are angry you say no by ibrahim lord and when you're happy to say no by Muhammad's lord he said yes profitable wow this is true I do not abandon anything except your name I love you but when I'm angry I do not call your name Fatima and the ID may Allah be pleased with them also they used to have skirmishes the Prophet came once to his daughter's house where is Ali she said he got angry we had something and we fought over something so he went to the Masjid so the Prophet goes through the message and finds Ali sleeping on the floor and he wakes him up and he says stand up the father of dust because he will sleep one that's in the soil and he said this is the most beautiful name I would never ever trade it for anything about Rob but this is his nickname may Allah be pleased with him oh ma may Allah be pleased with him a man has a fight with his wife and he is so outraged of her character so he goes to remark to complain the halifa the Caliph so he knocks on the door and they tell him wait for a second and all what he hears is Rama's wife shouting at him Rama's wife is shouting and he can hear that said I'm coming to complete the Rahman he needs help more than I do so the guy goes away and then all my rushes to the daughter where's the man come what is it my brother he says well nothing nothing's I had a problem but I think you need the help more than I do he said my brother this is my wife she cooks my food she bakes my bread she washes my clothes she chuckles and breast feeds my children and she does not have to do all of that and not only that my heart is calm and I don't have to look for Haram when she's with me don't you think I should tolerate her as she is tolerating me well why if we look at our spouses with this way we would live a beautiful life because then we whenever Japan comes to us and says do this or do that I said no she tolerates me my wife tolerates me I have a lot of shortcomings so if she cooks the food that is bad and half burnt and no salt in it I will eat it I will eat three or four bites of it and say may Allah bless you the food was excellent and I'm lying why because I don't take her out I don't by her presence I am NOT kind to her I am NOT a perfect husband so I tolerate her shortcomings hoping from allah azza wajal that she tolerates my shortcomings and by this we would have the perfect house and allah azzawajal knows best i pray to allah subhana wa ta'ala that he would fix all our shortcomings and that he would make our houses"
