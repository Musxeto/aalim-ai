  "transcript": "so there are conditions whomever these conditions are fulfilled in him must attend the Gemara the number one Muslim which means non-muslims are not allowed to attend share we have non-muslims in our community who wish to enter the message and pray with us we say this is up to the Imams own HT had an opinion if the imam believes that these people are really interested in learning or seeing how islam is being practiced no problem in them entering the masjid but they should remain at the back of the masjid not engaged in the rows i've seen some people interested in Islam and the Muslims put them and make them stand with them in the row this is wrong this is not permissible and it is wrong he's a nun Muslim he cannot stand with the Muslims in a row as he would disconnect that row it is obligated and obligatory ritual upon males which means that women are not obliged to attend it is an obligation upon those who are free and this means that slaves are not obliged to attend because they require the permission of their masters and it is and then and it is mandatory upon those who are saying so people who have dementia people who have severe case of Alzheimer they do not know day from night they do not recognize their own children or their own close relatives and they are unable to concentrate or think properly they are classified as insane in the meaning in which means that Allah has uplifted the pen so that they're not accountable it is mandatory upon men who had reached the age of puberty and it is also important to know that it is mandatory upon residents so travelers are not obliged to conduct Friday prayers and we have to clarify this a little bit because I've seen even among some of the daddies that say that Friday is not mandatory when we go for a conference for example in a foreign country and it's time for Jumma I've heard some of the Duat say that Friday is not mandatory upon travellers and this is an understatement which unfortunately shows you that not all do at our scholars are knowledgeable yes they may have a BA or a master's degree or sometimes even PhD in Islamic studies but this does not mean that they are infallible it doesn't mean that what they say is 100% true you have to cross examine everything anyone says no matter how much you trust him if you're a student of knowledge now if you're a layman and you trust share Hassim yes you don't have to go and search and look because you're a layman even if you search you'll be more confused and most likely you won't understand what you're because it's not your profession but if you're a student of knowledge you have no right in taking what I say for granted because I'm a human being I may misunderstand things I may miss coat things I may make errors so these Diaries I was with them in one of the countries it was time for Friday we didn't have someone to take us to the hot bar so one of them said it's not mandated you to pray and in a sense he's right but he's not and I'll tell you the reason scholars all agree that travelers cannot pray Friday prayer so the dies words are correct no no wait I'll explain to you what do they mean by this what is their consensus on they say that if we are a group of a traveler of travelers if we are nomads so we are 500 people living in tents moving from one place to the other looking for grass for our herds to graze and we 500 so it is the whole time it's Friday shall we make a Friday nope Oh Cheryl 500 people yes but you're not residing Jim wah is not to be prayed except by those who reside and because you are not a resident if I'm a sailor and I travel five months at sea journeys are a month or two long I never presume ah I do I don't pray JAMA on ship though we have a full-fledged Masjid we have 200 crew members and passengers and and the whole nine yards no Gemara for us okay so where did the dairy go wrong the daddy went wrong when he thought that because he is a traveler and he shortens prayers that he can skip Friday prayer and this is not the case if he is on the road driving in passes by a Masjid and the message it in that city he is passing through calls for the salat he moves on he's a travel but if he's staying in a city or a town and they have messages and they're calling for Jumma he falls under the ayah either New Deal astrology monomial Jamaat if I saw here a decree la he would obey whenever you who believe the call for Juma is given you must abandon straight and walk briskly to the Masjid you have to go and pray so yes a traveler doesn't call others come come let's pray Jamar we're fifty of us with 20 people no but if there is a message it and he is staying in that town he has to go and answer the call for prayer"
