  "title": "In class room when teacher enters the children standup out of respect        By Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "is asking on the ruling that some schools still have that is when a teacher comes to the class all the students all the pupils must rise and stand up out of respect out of tradition out of anything what's the ruling on that the prophet Alat wasam told us about the individual who enters and he said whoever loves or desires people to stand up for him when he comes in he should take his seat in Hellfire which means that this is a major sin and it is the result of arrogance so whether you're a teacher you're a principal you are uh a king you are a prince you are a leader if you want want people to stand up when you enter this is a major sin and it is a sign of arrogance now for the students it's a problematic because they are stuck between a rock and a hard place if they do not stand and the teacher or the management of the school are ignorant and do not understand themselves they would probably reprimand him or punish him so in this case if he tried to explain that it is not something personal it is the law of Allah yet they do not uh seem to care or or uh pay attention in this case I feel out of compulsion it is permissible for the students to stand up after explaining"
