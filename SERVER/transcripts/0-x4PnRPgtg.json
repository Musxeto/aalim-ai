  "title": "Is it allowed for men to apply henna mehndi on hands on their wedding? Is it sunnah? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "who says is it permissible for men to apply on their hands during their wedding or just casually because some Muslims say that it is Sunnah of our prophet sallallahu is a form of a plant that is used to give a dying effect to the hair and sometimes to decorate women's hands with it I think they call it in the subcontinent as mihindi and henna is a natural substance that was mentioned in the Sunnah and the prophet himself applied it to his hair and to his beard and women used to apply it to their hands and feet and their bodies as a foreign form of adornment so what's the ruling on men applying it on their hands and feet the scholars say that this is only known to be used by women and at the time of the Prophet Allah this was known to be used by homosexuals or transgenders or gays not by real men as per Hadith where the Prophet was brought by such a an individual and he ordered him to be boycotted and taken out of Medina uh to somewhere as a form of punishment so it is known in our religion that whoever imitates women from the men is cursed the prophet salallahu cursed those who imitate women from amongst the men and those who imitate men from amongst the women imitating the opposite gender is a major sin and whoever does this is cursed so men are only permitted to use henna to dye their beards to dye their hair and that is it not to Adorn any part of their bodies and Allah Knows Best"
