  "transcript": "my question is uh what is the ruling on praying with the shoes on because we work and we go to school we often we go to the bathroom the prophet okay Al listen to me the prophet said in an authentic Hadith pray in your sandals in your slippers in your shoes because the Jews don't and the prophet himself and many occasions used to pray with his shoes on and in one incident in the middle of the prayer he took them off so all the companion took their shoes off during the prayer and after he finished he looked at them and he said why did you take off your shoes they said you took off your shoes we to took off our shoes he said while I was praying jiel came to me and told me that there are some impurities NASA on my shoes so I took them off therefore whenever one wants to come and pray in his shoes let him look at them to see if there is any impurity or not so praying in your shoes is a Sunnah providing that the circumstances allow you to do so so it's totally unadvisable to walk on the carpet of this fancy Masjid all the way from the back to the front with your shoes on because this is something that is resented and unaccepted by the people but if you're at the airport if you're at the mall if you're at the street if you're off uh uh out in the open and you have your shoes on pray with your shoes on without any problem inshallah"
