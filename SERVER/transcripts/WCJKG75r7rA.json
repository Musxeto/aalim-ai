  "title": "Do the Taraweeh Prayers cover the 2 rakah of sunnah before isha prayer? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so the answer is your tarawih do not cover for the two rakha Sunnah right after the Isha prayer these are two different things and you cannot hit two birds with one stone because the Sunnah of Isha is to be prayed and offered and this is separate from the taraweeh combining it with tarawih would diminish and reduce your reward in Allah Knows Best"
