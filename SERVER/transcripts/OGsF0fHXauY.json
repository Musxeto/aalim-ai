  "transcript": "a way of life brothers and sisters welcome to this episode in our last discussion we were dealing with intimacy and it's intimate when you speak about intimacy and of course it's a sensitive topic conflicting views it's taboo be careful on the other hand if we don't address it then ignorance will prevail and problems will arise so we know that it's a double-edged sword and it's a tough discussion but the truth necessitate that we share these issues in this particular episode today insha'allah so we were speaking about a wife not being vocal about her needs therefore the husband doesn't realize is not fulfilling her needs so problems and then the other way around you spoke about pornography and the truth of the matter is there are perverted men and they are men who have to use this because of because anyone if you told you want the real life or you want to see people on a screen he will tell you the real life so for him to avoid the wife and go to the screen to television it means that there must be something serious in in his needs being fulfilled unless he's sick which which exists let's go to that first option the lady the wife is failing in this regard he doesn't see in her what arouses him what advice do we have and and what is the nature of this problem there is rigidity sometimes that's the reason and husbands are complaining you see i don't feel anything a lot subhanallah allah subhanahu wa ta'ala allah subhanahu wa singh inalin allah made the last beautiful and make the man has this ink both the opposite sides have this inclination for the divine wisdom behind it came to the prophet salla because there was a rumor in medina if anyone approaches his pals in a way different from the normal way which was known the female is the passive okay so the the child will be okay that was the room that was the rumor in medina and the muslims in makkah you see because the people of medina they had the use in medina so they heard the use saying these things they said well they are people of the book maybe it is true but the muslims in makkah they were enjoying themselves in many ways he married the woman from among the assad the people of medina and he approached his tele his partner in a different way then he came shivering afraid maybe it is true a child will be croquet and he said to the but see how he put it to the prophet he said rasulullah oh messenger of allah i have changed the saddle of my mouth last night the saddle the prophet sallam kept quiet who answered this question allah subhanahu wa tahala then down to hansa your woman are your tillage approach your telly in the way you like in whatever manner you like and then the prophet sallam he explained what is this in whatever manner you like he said do everything except anal so allah azzawajal is telling you everything is halal for you everything is halal for you so if the spouses understood they should understand each other be open with each other this what i like this what i don't like and by the way women in general they like tenderness and men should understand this any comments on what sheikh salim said what are you what are the other issues well like the shoe said i could not add anything more that except that transparency is very essential not only in bed but in the whole marriage so it is important to be frank to address problems head-on we have a problem in our homes that whenever a problem arises we tend to either run away from it or to take something that would ease the headache instead of curing the illness and this erupts every now and then it comes back and again and again and instead of facing one problem you face three in the past and then instead of facing four problems it's like ten so it is essential for us to solve the problems to go to the root cause of the problem while of course bearing in mind not to be rude not to be aggressive so many times we have problems and we start head-on attacking each other and when you say why are you talking to your wife like this my sister my daughter why are you so aggressive with your husband so that we're trying to solve our problems problems are not sold like this well one of the things i often say is that you know when when a sister wants to persuade her husband to buy her a new dress or to buy some furniture for the hat for the house or you know something that is very important to her masha allah she knows all the beautiful techniques you know you're my husband you know this and that exactly you know just how to butter him up we say yeah but you know when it comes to some of these problems you're talking about it's like she comes she is very aggressive and she you know this nagging and the woman starts to nag the man he shuts off and he will avoid he it's like and it goes back to the you know first of all he feels perhaps that why are you bringing this problem up with me i know how to solve the problems i'm in charge you know so it he he feels his authority is being challenged and this upsets him on top of that and then he doesn't like the way that this issue is being dealt with so i mean just just to reiterate what you said sheikh is that for the sisters especially uh always be this nice beautiful approach yanni even the you know when when the sisters they they say my husband is not religious enough you know he is not really uh sometimes tahfur even not praying or something i still say use the same techniques used the same way you know if you want this you know how to persuade him but now when it comes to his islam you this you that you know and and the this way will work with the woman martial to the husband on the husband's side he also needs to listen to what his wife has to say as well this aggressiveness was mentioned in the hadith of the prophet he said kindness and gentleness was never present in anything except that it would beautify it more and if it's extracted from it it would make it very sad not only that the prophet said that when allah loves a household when allah loves a family he introduces to them kindness and gentleness so if you have a problem with your wife if the neighbors can always know oh shikhasam and his wife are on it again they're shouting they're screaming at the breaking the plates etc then this is an indication that allah does not love this house but when there is this love this gentleness this this kindness no aggressiveness why do you have to be aggressive why does the wife have to pick the wrong time to address her need she should as you've said she should treat her husband as she treats her child because a husband is a young child she can do wonders you know by talking to him as if talking to a child treating him as a child but he's an old child a big a big child if she does this wallahi she can have him like a ring around her finger and he feels jealous by the way her husband feels jealous if he is neglected and and this is a real problem a woman when she gets children and she is only focusing on the children neglecting me he feels jealous subhanallah he is a child he needs attention yes he is a child you need to take care of your child subhanallah and this child he has that mentality at some timings for example when the shaykh said about if he is neglecting his religious duties you have to educate him and maybe you are masha allah more educated than him but you know what we men have this ego they masha telling my husband you know better than i do how about reading this can you explain this to me let him feel it just play with the psychology with his mindset sometimes he has this ego he will not listen to you who are you to teach me okay so put this booklet in his uh in his desk or a tape or a cd or anything so when he's by himself he will so you should know how to uh to deal with your partner another problem i just now remembered that many of the husbands they complain that their wives they don't look presentable they don't take care of their looks at home they buy clothes for their money they say wallahi the clothes i bought from my wife i've never seen them you know what i see them only on day of weddings of others on the day of the weddings she is a bride that is my day he's apply today the rest of the days what i see the clothes of the daily chores what i smell the onion subhanallah we're going to have to take a short break and after the break we'll be discussing some other issues pertaining to this matter we'll be right back a way of life of life and we're back so we were discussing i allow me to intrude and try to present a view which we haven't really elaborated on but it's relevant to the topic and if you find that it is early just dismiss it and move on could it be or is one of the main reasons behind the calamities or behind the problems at home the absence of angels and the presence of the shayateen the household the lifestyle is one where sin is prevalent in the house among the parents and the children music is in the background you know nakedness on tv things of the sort and this is the where the shayateen spend their time and hang out and the angels will leave because of the presence of certain things and obviously this is among the main reasons why people have problems had the muslims try to remove these external elements and then see how harmonious the relationship would be many would do the other things we discussed and leave this one you know ignore it but i think it's crucial do you agree or disagree agree totally we agree with this and subhanallah the house that has no diker it is like the graveyard that's what the prophet sallallahu assalam said and the house which has subhan this is the beauty of islam we have everything so the house that has zikr of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala the angels in heaven they see this house is shining illuminating because of the thicket of allah subhanahu wata'ala so if the house is full of demons and the angels of mercy they leave the house that has a dog or that has pictures images they don't enter such a house so what do you expect such a the situation in that house full of shayateen but if the house is full of the angels of mercy who are praying for you so these problems will be reduced or reduced brother abdullah brothers what can you give us a brief description of the ideal muslim household the ideal muslim home what what should be there what shouldn't be there just briefly even if it's bullet points so that we can give something practical that the families can begin implementing as soon as they watch this just one little thing i wanted to say which is to pick up on the sheikh the very alhamdulillah didn't even know this hadith that's fantastic you know that if allah wants to bless a household he introduces you then kindness and gentleness kindness and gentleness mashaallah the first time i heard that and masha'allah so for me it's like the moment you mention this hadith i'm thinking okay let me think about my house does my house fit the bill for this and i would say i would like more kindness and gentleness in my house definitely so now how how can i go about bringing more kindness and gentleness in my house and i think it's not because okay that's it i don't find enough kindness and gentleness my allah doesn't want to bless my house no so i'm going to go and inshaallah try to make my house a place that has more kindness and more more gentleness it's the same you know when you're praying salah you you should have sure even it's better you should cry when you know you are standing in front of allah and you know the alamo said that if you don't cry make yourself cry make yourself cry because then the emotions the things will come and i think this is from this hadith what we all need to try and do is think about how can we bring kindness and gentleness into the house now this goes back to an important thing the position of the man when allah has given man that position the male the man the position of authority here is exactly an example where his authority comes into place is not only commanding this and commanding that this is his part of his responsibility to introduce kindness and gentleness into the house inshaallah so i think this is one of the things you can try to do make your house a place where there is kindness where there is gentleness and the best way for the brothers is to lead by example excellent the ideal that's of course part of that being part of it the ideal muslim household is one where kindness is is prevalent and is in the air as they say what other things in a nutshell your house should not contain anything that angers allah azzawajal so does this mean we have to turn our houses into a mosque a place of worship not necessarily but if you don't have these things it will in fact be a house of worship because everything you do pleases allah azzawajal and this includes halal thing so when we say that you have to get rid of these haram things you should not have statues in your house you should not have portraits in your house you should not have music you should not have uh soap operas or movies or things that do not relate to your religion but you can have everything that is halal and among the top of the list as such stated is the things that brings your kindness and gentleness so i may have this with my wife and we love each other we have this compassion between us but it's a children that always fighting so i have to introduce to them the thing that makes marriages happy and that is acknowledge the difference in personalities so when you marry a wife when you do not acknowledge that she is different than you then you'll have clashes women love to be treated nicely women love to be taken care of and cared for so without her asking every now and then buy her some do her favors do something to express your love in actions not only in rhetoric and this what my wife says to me and i'm always neglectful i'm not always heedless about this when you travel send me an sms don't call me just send me an sms of love a couple of of words of of something nice and and this works it does magic it costs a little bit when you're it's roaming but come on don't worry yes it is and it's fun i i used to and i'm still i still do alhamdulillah once a year i would take my wife only her to makkah or to medina because to me it's very close it's not like people in london saying i'm taking wife to makkah and he pays an arm on the leg for me it's it's next door but i say that this is your night and i serve her the dinner i i get her the plates i get the food and whatever she's like a queen for one night then i take the rest of the 364 days for my advantage wait wait 364 that's gregorian oh well there's a 300 maybe 50 something okay so the same thing goes with the woman if she acknowledges that the man has just come in he has so much stress he's not like you he's not willing to engage in chatting what happened throughout the day so give him time give him half an hour an hour until he relaxes and then gradually bombard him with your demands and your problems gradually this will will have a good effect inshallah that's an oxymoron gradually bombard him i would like to add something here regarding how to make our home and the typical muslim house read al-baqara in your house this chase is away the shayateen if you have enough rooms in your house dedicate and make and allocate one room as a masjid in the house and unfortunately many brothers they this is not there in their minds that there is a room message where the wife and her daughters they pray in that room and even in ramadan they pray in that room so this is known as a messy this room and also subhanallah the praying the sunna in the house you see the prophet sallam taught us that you prayed the fath for the men in the masjid and prayed the sunna in in your house so that this there is rahma there is light there is noor and so that the house will not become like a graveyard like the graveyard as you mentioned earlier yes but these are uh things that will inshallah how about one thing you need to get rid of in the house to help make your house a more happy place and to bring everyone closer to allah is the television the television is the biggest waste of time is the biggest source of maybe not the biggest but maybe the biggest source of evil especially in the west and the best thing you can do for your family and your kids is to get rid of it all together and you will find subhanallah your household will transform what do people do if you get rid of the television what's going to happen mashallah they will start playing the children they will start interacting they will start reading they will start reading you know and mashallah the difference you will see and believe me they will not miss it once it's gone they will not miss it correct and it's a a fantastic way just to transform your household and inshallah bring blessings of allah and i think maybe the masjid could be a library and a message library there should be a library in the house actually islamic library for all ages for kids for adults for students so it is very cool i'm thinking about us in england our houses you know are so small okay to find the next at least for example i mean maybe you're not that educated in islamic but the book is there okay so your daughter wants maybe he feels shy to ask you she will just go open the book and she knows okay the aftertau of a woman books and mashallah beautiful book so this is very essential to to have them in the at home and besides the television the television in itself is not haram i like one of the dua said the problem with the tv only when you open there's nothing wrong as long as it's off as long as it's off it's okay the problem when it is you you turn it on and you're watching and you're watching these things and they are masha'allah now good channels islamic channels so they are alternative there are alternatives sometimes you want to remove the telly and your sweetheart tells you and my body dead body that is over my dead body on my dead body you cannot remove it i am confined within four walls all the day this is the only window i watch and you want to remove it who brainwashed you yes and now you don't know you don't know what to do and you might go to a fanatic shaykh and he tells you he is not pious partner get rid of her divorce her no don't listen to that maybe you should get a dart game and practice some of that anyways the time for the episode is over inshaallah there will be one more episode in regards to the issue of marriage"
