  "transcript": "okay the community i am from my country original all these ceremonies like name of ceremonies ceremony is free mission and you know that you cannot be a rambo in the community with me you cannot say i will not go to the ceremony if you don't go there you also really have the ceremony nobody will not come there so in this case can i be there and lower my kids okay so again and again and again the same question arises in different forms and shapes my community demands things of me that goes against my religion what should i do whether it's your community your parents your spouse or your children the answer is the same as muslims we have no choice but to obey allah azzawajal even if this causes and leads to the displeasure of people muawiyah may allah be pleased with him when he was appointed as the ruler of the muslims after being handed it to him by she wrote a letter to mother isha the wife of the prophet sallallahu salaam saying to her assalamu alaikum advise me and be brief that's it that's a letter a whole month journey from hashem to medina so she wrote to him i heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi whoever seeks the pleasure of allah with the displeasure of the people allah would be pleased with him and he would make the people pleased with him and in whoever seeks the pleasure of the people while displeasing allah allah will be displeased with him and he will make the people displeased with him as well was salam that's it how brief can an advice be to a muslim ruler so you my friend abu abdul rahman if you seek allah's pleasure it doesn't matter who's displeased with you whether your community discu discriminates you this communicates you or boycotts you or says bad things about you they did the same to the prophet the prophet did not participate in their gatherings in their celebrations in their feasts in their worship and he told them that this is against islam so when people tend to offend islam and don't care about what islam says why should you care about offending them someone who insists on offending you and smoking in your home why should i respect him and say i have to tolerate him and leave him no smoking is prohibited in islam and it's banned in my home so if you want to smoke leave simple as that he doesn't respect me why should i respect him he doesn't pay attention to allah's instructions and commands why would i care how they feel at the end of the day it all depends on your commitment to islam and allah azza knows best"
