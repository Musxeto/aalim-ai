  "transcript": "ahmad allah from the u.s she says that she read somewhere or she heard that saying allahumma ajiri minar seven times which means o allah protect me from hellfire seven times after fajr and after maghrib before you utter a word so assalamu alaikum without speaking with others if i managed to say this seven times then allah will protect me from hell fire and will admit me to paradise so she says is this authentic the answer is no this is not authentic at all it was labeled as weak by sheikh al-bani the authentic hadith is whoever seeks refuge in allah three times from hellfire and asks allah to be admitted into paradise three times allah would give him refuge from hellfire and will admit him to jannah and this is not related to any salat and this has nothing to do with before speaking to anybody else this is general dua while i'm walking to my car i say allah not me that's it three times but not to do it after prayers because then it becomes you"
