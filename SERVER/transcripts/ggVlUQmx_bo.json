  "transcript": "queen says is vomit impure or pure can we pray with clothes that has vomit on it there's a difference between purity and cleanliness purity is something that is required for your prayer to be accepted cleanliness is not meaning if i have an overhaul and it's filled with ga with grease and oil and it's smelly can i pray in it definitely is it clean no it's not but i can pray and my prayer is valid but if i have a three-piece suit and i smell beautifully with perfumes and body lotions and blah blah blah but i have a drop of urine on my sleeves am i clean that says yes am i pure the answer is no so this is the difference now vomit is pure but it is disgusting and it's not clean it's repulsive however if i'm carrying my child and my child vomits all over me can i pray yes the prayer is valid and there's no problem in that and i hope this answers your question"
