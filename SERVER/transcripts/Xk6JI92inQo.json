  "transcript": "yes my wife keeps arguing with me that I'm not like other husbands who take their wives out for dinner buy them gifts etc and I always tell her I'm not am i not providing you food shelter clothes intimacy that's it that is my only job I don't need to do complimentary things for you and Allah will ask a man about these things now how much you love and care for your wife how many gifts not how much you love and care for your wives how many gifts you exchange etc it's not mentioned in the Sharia am i right as is actually no because if you look at a marriage as do's and don'ts rights and obligations this is not a marriage this is just a transaction contract you do this for me I do this for you nothing extra when Allah Azza WA JAL described marriage and the relationship between the spouses he said that among his signs that he created from your own selves spouses and he made compassion mercy love between you and the Prophet said that is salat wa salam that exchange gifts and you shall increase in love so to have the relationship with your wife limited to intimacy to providing food shelter and clothing zin that set this is definitely not the way of the Prophet RA salatu salam you know better better or the Prophet Allah masala Salim Ali he used to love mother Aisha and expresses his love not only through words but also through actions she drinks from a glass of milk he takes the glass of milk and looks where is she drank from and places his lips on the same spot she drank from we nowadays would ask her to wash the glass seven times and one with soil before we drink from it out of the villa what kind of marriage is this he used to see if she takes a piece of bone with meat and takes a bite he puts his teeth on the same spot showing his affection and love to her he tells her that I know when you're angry and when you're pleased he knows everything about her and what pleases her and he used to call her with a beautiful name ish yeah ish and this is called a human and an Arabic and it's sort of nicknaming her with something beautiful but to have your relationship with your spouse so rigid so dry this is not the right thing to do are you looking for a short-term relationship or what if she if you want to become intimate with her and she just lies there like a piece of log not doing anything would you be pleased with that she said this is what Islam tells me to do to fulfill your desires and I'm doing that I'm not ready to be supplicate I don't want to so do your thing and just get the heck out of here is this what you want of course not life cannot how would you expect your children to grow up without you kissing your wife in front of them hugging her giving her a gift coming one day in a year with a bouquet of flower yeah he don't bring a book if one single flower and tell her that I saw this and I loved it and I wanted to give it to you when you travel you bring her a bottle of perfume what's wrong in that what's wrong in taking her one-to-one to a restaurant to have dinner maybe I shall warmer even if you are cheap a cheap person anything but at least show her that you care rather than say okay I am obliged to do this I'm not gonna exceed and you are obliged to do this I'm expecting you to go for the full thing this is not the right way of doing it so am i right Noah you are not right"
