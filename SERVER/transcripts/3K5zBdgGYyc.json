  "transcript": "check there is a restaurant nearby whose manager and ship are both Muslims but they never ever pray not even the E prayers and I am uncertain of their Akida I tell the manager of that restaurant to prepare Biryani for me separately with halal meat and not to put nutmeg in it and I frequently eat from them so is it okay to trust them and eat from them or they will be considered as non-muslims okay first of all actually when you started your question by saying I don't see them pray not even eight this doesn't mean that they do not pray a lot of the Muslims unfortunately have weak Iman they're so far away from their religion yet they still pray on their own on their own terms where people don't see them so this does not label them as kafir they're still Muslims not knowing what their hakida is when you called me and you said I replied to you I did not refrain from replying and I did not say hi I didn't say what's up I replied they said though shaytan came to me and said how do you know that Salman has a good Akita or he's a Muslim he might be from the CIA he might be someone pretending to be a Muslim no actually the default is that you're a Muslim they say they are Muslims then they are Muslims I don't have any reason or evidence to change this default therefore you can implement it and act upon it unless you are really worried and having them do your Biryani is not something of necessity so if you're really worried that they're not Muslims or they might be lying to you or the meat is not Halal then call it a day and do not make your orders from them"
