  "transcript": "similar rahmani raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad until allah mean nabina muhammad in wada rd he was happy he ajma'in am a bad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato when islam came it was a revolution it came to change most of the things that the people believed in and i say most because the essence of tawheed the essence of the belief in the oneness of allah or what we call tohe Dorobo BIA was still intact people believed in the towhead of lordship that Allah was the Creator that Allah was the provider and the sustainer that Allah was the owner of everything and the giver of life and the taker of it but Islam came to change people's conviction and perception of things and this meant that in order to follow Islam you have to leave your comfort zone this is why when we look at people who are not Muslim yet they have this enmity and resentment not only towards Islam but towards everything else that is different to what they are used to and this is what is meant by the comfort zone each one of us loves his house loves his own private room loves his own lazy chair though there are many many other options that are better but this is what we're used to and when people accept Islam and they allow this change to be introduced to their lives their perception of things change 180 degrees before they used to hate Islam more than they hate death itself now nothing is more beloved to their heart than Islam so is change sought after for the sake of change the answer is no definitely not but in order to succeed if you are stagnant if you're not improving there is something wrong and you have to change so success is in so many times related to change someone who is not earning and is still sitting in his home playing his playstation not looking for jobs he has to change because heavens do not rain gold you have to go and dig for it and change can't be positive and it can be negative positive change is what introduces improvement to your life but how can I tell if this change is positive or negative people in non-muslim countries consider the change that they're undergoing is positive while we Muslims look at it and see that it is not so what is the ruling stick or the measurement stick it is the Quran and the Sunna whatever the Quran and the Sunnah approves off this is positive and whatever is not approved then this is negative when the Prophet came out in his salat WA Salam he came to change but he maintained so many things as they wear and he clearly stated I have only come to perfect the moral ethics and practices meaning that there were moral ethics and practices at the pre era of Islam but it needed perfection the Arabs were generous they're courageous they're always giving a helping hand but there are things that need to be perfected more and more this is what Islam came to change and Allah Azza WA JAL does not change a people until they change themselves so in order for us to change our environment to change our circumstances to uplift Allah's wrath upon us we have to change changes usually positive when you're sinful you have to change your ways you can't sit back and say what can I do Allah Azza WA JAL is testing me with so-and-so sins in my life I cannot leave them that's a lie Allah gave you the wealth power to leave but you have to do something you have to put some effort if you look at a person whose life revolved around terrorizing people and killing them but should such a person do to repent the Prophet tells us about alehissalaam a murderer who killed a hundred Souls then sought repentance and forgiveness a scholar directed him to change his environment and told him to leave his City and go to another town where there are righteous people and he should stick to them hang out with them and worship Allah with them Allah forgave his sins because he changed his situation now you want a lot to change you are you willing to change your environment the time that you spend on social media on the internet on watching movies on chatting with an organ with the opposite gender and then you want a large social to put improvement in your life you have to take the initiative and change but yes not all change is positive the religion of Allah social is fixed it has been perfected as Allah mentioned in surah al-ma'idah chapter 5 verse number 3 a glioma Akmal to Allah come Dina come today have completed your religion perfected it and approved it to be your religion so if someone comes and tries to innovate to add something to emit something from what Allah has perfected then definitely this change is blames worthy in such a person is cursed by Allah because his change is not positive the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam Allah the Almighty has blocked repentance from every innovator Allah accepts the repentance of people who associate others with him how can he block it from an innovator who's not a mushrik scholars say that Allah Dajjal blocked it in the sense that this innovator would never repent or ask for forgiveness because he believes that what he's doing is the right thing to do and the Prophet told us alehissalaam about people of his own coming on the day of judgment to drink from his pool and the angels throw them back and prevent them from drinking so the Prophet objects and says oh my lord they are my people they're my Ummah and the reply comes to the prophet alayhi salatu salam you do not know what they had altered and changed after you so I would say the Prophet says doom maybe it to those who innovate or change after me therefore you want success you have to follow the Quran and the Sunnah you will never attain success you'll never manage to have positive change in your life in your community and in the whole world without going back to the Quran in the Sunnah to identify which is right and positive and which is wrong and negative may allah azzawajal introduce the positive change in our lives so that we can improve and to worship Him as it pleases him had our love Adam when especially me alayhi assalam wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala abdullah Sudi he nabina muhammad"
