  "transcript": "whether armor has a question that he had underwent or undergone a number of surgeries in his kidneys and appendix and and etc and he suffers from passing wind so he's asking what to do when this is happening and what to do with the prayer ah hey Kareem Romo I pray to Allah that he cures your illnesses and restores your health back again to be stronger and better than before regarding passing wind and breaking your woudl you are either one of two either this happens on intervals or it is continuous intervals mean that it happens for 5-10 minutes and then it stops for half an hour or an hour and then it happens for 5-10 minutes and stops for half an hour so you can estimate that this is a half an hour or an hour where I can perform Woodill and pray in this case you have to pray in the interval or in the period that you don't pass when the second scenario is when you have it continuous and in this case there is nothing for you to do because even if you wait 24 hours it's going to still continue and it breaks every few minutes it doesn't give you time to pray or to maintain your Road in this case whenever the Adhan is called so I then an Oscar is called you go to the toilet make woudl even while making wudu if something comes out don't pay attention to it continue you would pray even if while praying something comes out this is continuous it has no impact on your Pajaro and your boodle nor your prayer and you can do everything until the time is over once the other prayer is do you have to perform model again and this maintains and stays with you until the prayer"
