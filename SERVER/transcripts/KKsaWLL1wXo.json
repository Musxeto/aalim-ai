  "title": "Going out with my Mother, Sister who don't wear hijab & put on Makeup - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Halil says my family does not wear the hijab is it permissible for me to take out to places because they would be revealing their hour in front of people I wonder if I'm considered a helper of sin in this situation like if I take my mom to a restaurant firm so Holly question scenario I have a mom that does not wear the hijab puts full makeup and wants me to take her to a restaurant and have dinner with her or my sisters want me to go with them shopping etc when they're not wearing the abaya so it is what is the ruling on that first of all Islam is not one size that fits all so each question has its background its scenario its consequences you have to measure the pros and cons generally speaking you are not allowed to facilitate sin so if you go with someone who is not abiding by the hijab she is your madam she doesn't cover her hair she wears western clothes and you go with her or with them to a restaurant this would be facilitating sin because you are accepting the sin they're committing and not doing anything about it when the prophet saw Salim said whoever sees something that is moon card that is wrong Islamically he should change it with his hand by force like a man with his wife like a man with his son like a ruler with his subjects they can do this by force if not possible then they should change it by speaking out and saying that this is Haram you're not allowed to do this and advising them even if this is not also possible then one should change it with his heart so by feeling bad about it by not normalizing relationships by not sitting so they're playing music they are slandering Islam or cursing Islam or backbiting and I just sit there and I don't like it but I and do anything about it no this is socially prohibited and wrong you have to change so by saying this you can't take them out and act normally yet sometimes you may have to because it's the lease of two evils so your mom and your sister not wearing the hijab they want to go to their to the mall to their uncle's house they want to go to the hospital and you say you have to cover and they say we're not going to cover you have to drop us or we'll take a cab taking a cab means that they will be with a nun muharram and it's not safe so the least of the two evils is that you drop them while still advising them and telling them that this is haram and reminding them softly and diplomatically about allah azza wajal and i hope this makes sense to you"
