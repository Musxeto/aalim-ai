  "transcript": "hosea from holland he says that some of the christians say that the verse that al makkar is a an attribute of deception and how can allah deceive others first of all do we take our religion from the christians this is nonsense look at the people who talk about our religion when they can't even explain how is their god three in one this is heads and shoulders three in one so you don't take anything from them they all what they have is to cast doubts and to us it would be fruitless it would be illogical to start defending what they're throwing at us and every time say okay why do men marry four women don't marry except one ah because this and okay why does a a daughter inherits half and the son inherits full uh because of this why do men not wear gold where women can wear gold what and you spend your time refuting their allegations which is not fruitful they don't believe in the system to begin with so why would i waste my time with them first of all allah tells us oh people of the book come to common terms first of all you want to discuss things about islam i have no problem let's establish first of all this universal fact that there is no other god worthy of being worshipped except allah and not to associate others with him how is that oh no we will talk about this later let's talk about no no no this is what we're talking about if they're willing alhamdulillah we will prove that there is not three in one it's only one if they don't i don't need to talk to them they don't have the authority or even they they have the audacity to come and speak to us about the characteristics of the the characters of allah and the attributes of allah this is ridiculous so does allah deceive no allah does not deceive allah meets the things that those disbelievers do in the same fashion because this is what fairness and justice is allah does not deceive people but when you deceive allah when you cheat allah azzawajal allah will deal with you and treat you in the same fashion you treated him then this is what they call touche there's no form of aggression or oppression in it you dealt with allah like in this fashion allah deals with you in the same fashion you're kind and generous and obedient to allah allah would deal with you in the same fashion allah azzawajal knows best"
