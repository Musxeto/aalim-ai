  "transcript": "nevermind over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen shadow la ilaha illa-llah who the hula Sharia Keller why should I do any muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in I'm about to dear brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam usually people talk about the prophet alayhi salatu salam from different aspects you have his serie that talks about when he was born how he was raised up and about his Dawa about his life about his struggles and suffering about his battles and how he died sallallahu alaihi wa sallam sometimes you look into the aspects and lessons that you can learn from different occasions his relationships with his companions sometimes you look at the prophet alayhi salatu salams attributes or what we call a shaman el his moral conduct his ethics the way he treated others rarely we would find in all of this a lot about women which usually raises the flag especially to the enemies of Islam who accuse Islam of subjugating women of oppressing women and they don't even take the effort to go and ask approximately 1 billion Muslim women living on the globe at the moment whether they feel subjugated or not they fail to look around them to see their own flesh and blood who were non-muslims like them reverting to Islam accepting the religion embracing the hijab and sometimes even than a nob staying home happy to raise a family after having the highest levels of academic achievements CEOs resigning their jobs content with being a housewife obeying her husband they fail to see this or they turn a blind eye to it all so that not to see the beauty and benefits of Islam so they only focus on the empty half of the glass rather than the empty their the full half of the glass now it's a logical question why isn't there so many mentions of women in Islam while we find that the focus is on men well the answer is quite easy women are not a sidekick they play a very important role in Islam but their role is behind the curtains their role is concealed and covered that's why we don't have women orators or women leaders or women coming up front and addressing the masses because this old defies the purpose of the hijab now to in order to understand the culture you have to look and study how women were treated 15 centuries ago not only in Arabia but also in Persia and the Byzantine Empire or the Roman Empire which were the two superpowers at the time so look at how women were treated and then compare that with what Islam brought in Arabia a person who was told that his wife gave birth to a baby girl he would have wished that a truck hit him instead of having a girl because having girls in the family having women in the family was a disgrace was something shameful Allah described this in the Quran where Allah says and when one of them is informed of the birth of a female his face becomes dark and he suppresses grief he hides himself from the people because of the ill of which he was been informed should he keep it in humiliation or bury it in the ground unquestionably evil is what they decide imagine that the Arabs whenever they were blessed with a baby girl once she was 6 or 7 years of age they would take her and bury her alive so that they won't be ashamed of what she chooses in the future or the shame that she would bring to her family so they think women used to be inherited like furniture and like wealth and like property so if a man dies his wife is inherited by his sons they allow her to marry or not they allow her to go out or not she has no right none whatsoever women did not inherit only the men inherited those who died women had no choice had no voice had no weight in the community and the society Islam came to change all of that and the change was so radical yet so effective that within less than 23 years and this is the span of the prophets message allahís a lot of Sam he stayed among his people for only 23 years and with the grace of Allah managed to overturn such false beliefs a hundred and eighty degrees the women had the right to inherit had a right to refuse being married to someone they don't want had the right to seek separation from a husband they disliked through hollar women had the right to keep their name unlike what's happening in non-muslim countries when a woman gets married she's stripped of her own family name and obliged and forced to take her husband's name Islam prohibits this and says that a woman has the right to sell and buy to own and possess and to keep her name so if you imagine that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was born into such an environment was born in a city called mecca which is was a mountainous desert area men were so rough and tough almost without emotions and if they had some it was next to impossible to express it they treated women as garbage they looted one another tribes used to attack other tribes and it was survival for the fittest in such an environment you would have expected the prophet alayhi salatu salam to come and be part of the clan at least share with them what they all had but this only to prove to you that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam was the perfect human being and that he was sent from Allah Azza WA JAL as the Messenger of Allah to represent this beautiful religion of Islam this religion that transformed people from barbarians to civilized and if you look at this transformation you could not stop yourself from raising your hat and saluting the process that took place in a number of years the prophet alayhi salatu salam came with a religion that gave women life that took women out of the darkness restored their dignity their humanity and all of this through the Quran and the Sunnah women by nature are weak physically this is how Allah built them weak they are weaker than men generally speaking and this is not their fault they are also weak sentimentally so they are overwhelmed with emotions which mayhem hamper and hinder their decision process yet this is not a weakness it is a point of strength a woman who is full of emotions a woman who is full of feelings is a rose in a desert just looking at it fills your heart with joy and the more of this weakness in her the more beautiful and cherished by everyone else without any exaggeration exaggeration of course now Islam came to cater and care for this natural weakness in a woman this is why every time the prophet alayhi salatu salam we used to address the masses of the Muslims he used to advise them and remind them to take care of women Estelle's will be nice' Huayra take care of women because he knows how the whole community was brought up and how they felt towards women and this was his job to change their perception and to fix it because it was broken so the Prophet used to always advise them and say take care of women because they were created from a rib meaning that Eve was created from Adam's rib and the Prophet said and the rib the highest point of it is twisted is crooked a little bit so the rib is like this if you want to straighten it up you will break it and if you leave it as it is you'll enjoy it but with a bit of a twist so take good care of women this is advice of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam if you look at how the Prophet Allah saw said I'm dealt with women you cannot believe that this man was born and raised in such a harsh environment that used to deal and treat women as trash subhanAllah how he was able to transform the way men treated women and how he made that an essential part of his religion know where you can find or anyone on earth know where anyone can find one single thing that tarnish is the reputation of the Prophet Isis Onam when it comes to dealing with women whether it was one of his daughters one of his wives or even the non-muslim women all of his actions and rhetoric went into the same channel of taking care of women and being kind to them and Islam came to promote this to take care of women whether she is a wife a daughter a child a widow no matter what kind of a woman Islam came for us to take care of them look at this incident and there's so many incidents that it would take us the full whole month of Ramadan to talk about once Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him visited the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and aisha the daughter of abu bakr was shouting at her husband the Prophet Harry thought of Salaam when Abu Bakr was admitted and permitted to enter he went to slap his daughter for raising her voice over the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and immediately the one who came in between was the prophet alayhi salaatu sir he prevented his companion from hitting his daughter who happened to be the wife of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he kept on defending her until Abu Bakr left the house and he was in rage and the prophet alayhi salatu salam started to boast about it to his wife saying didn't you see how i defended it you did you how I defend you wasn't I good to you in protecting you from the man who's your father few days later abu bakr came to visit again and this time he found aisha and the prophet s am laughing and talking happily so he said as you had admitted me in your war today admit me in your peace and let me join you in your peace as what i see and they said we have done so come come and join us so the prophet alayhi salatu salams mercy to his wife exceeded the mercy of her own father who wanted to reprimand her any other man would have been happy to see his father-in-law beat his wife just to get even not only that an acid malic tells us about the story that is mind-blowing the prophet has a son and you can imagine the scenario is sitting in Asia's house and there are companions in that house when a servant comes with food in a plate from Sophia had been to him after the co house the co wife of Aisha she's sending food to the Prophet in ashes turn or ashes day I shall may Allah be pleased with her was outraged she went and she struck the servant's hand making the plate fall and break and the food is spread all over now what would you do if your wife does such a thing in front of your friends the Prophet Allah so salaam who is on top of the pyramid he's the highest man of his time stood up gathered the food collected it and comforted his companions who were in shock and he said don't worry don't worry your mother has become jealous what she did was due to her jealousy look at the words chosen your mother he didn't say this woman he didn't say my wife he praised her by saying she is the mother of the believers your mother has become jealous the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam honored mothers when he said the best of your companionship is the most worthy of your companionship is your mother the companion said then who your mother then who your mother then who then he said your father and when a man came to the prophet as I'm asking permission for jihad the Prophet said is your mother alive and I said yes so the Prophet said RA salatu salam go to her and stick to her feet for paradise is there even islam honored a wife so the Prophet tells us be kind to your wives the best of you are the best to their wives and I'm the best to my wives he said that the women are identical and equal to men and Nisa ochakov ecoregion there are the sisters of men Islam honored the daughter and told us that whoever is blessed and tested by any of these girls as daughters they will be his visor and screen from Hellfire providing you take care of your girls taking care of widows subhanAllah the Prophet said the man who cares and is in charge of a widow and a poor person he's like a person doing jihad in the cause of Allah or like someone who's praying nighttime all night and fasting all day Islam had honored a woman Islam is so merciful that it dropped prayer and fasting when a woman is in her menses or postnatal bleeding dropped financial maintenance even if she's rich she doesn't provide for her husband she's not obliged to provide for her siblings while they are obliged to provide for her Islam dropped Friday prayers and congregational prayers so that women could be in their homes and at the comfort of their homes Islam oblige men to give women dowry and prohibited men to take a penny from their women it's the financial responsibility of men Islam gave a share of her husband's inheritance her father's wealth even she is not obliged to provide for anyone she still receives money Islam dropped jihad women don't have to go to jihad they don't even have to go to Hajj if they don't have a male Muharram to accompany them and to take care of them and to protect them Islam protected women so a woman cannot get married unless her guardian approves of it in the presence of two male Muslim witnesses so that her chastity would be protected and no one can say no she did not get married and she gave birth out of wedlock no we have a system to protect her chastity to the extent that Islam protected a woman from an irresponsible word anyone who slanders a woman he's obliged to bring four male witnesses to testify that she fornicated if he failed to do so he would be flogged 80 lashes just as a consequence of an irresponsible word he said about a Muslim woman after all of that they claimed that Islam subjugated women so in this series insha'Allah starting from tomorrow we will try our level best to give a glimpse and to highlight a number of women whom the prophet alayhi salatu salam knew and who had an impact on his life ha ha Allahu Alem when especially in melee he asked them what allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad while he was happy he had made salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu saeed al Hoadley rowdy in lahore and narrated that the prophet of allah salallahu alayhi wa sallam said for every hardship disease worry distress harm and grief that a Muslim faces and even for every thorn that pricks him Allah will expiate some of their sins through it Abdullah ibn Masud Ali allahu anhu said i entered where the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was and I found him suffering pains of a fever and I said o message of Allah you are suffering severe pains of your fever and he sallallahu alayhi wasallam said yes I'm suffering as much as two men among you would suffer I said to him for that reason will you have two rewards he sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said yes it will be as you said there is not a Muslim that is afflicted with the harm of a thorn or any above that except that because of it Allah will expiate their sins and his sins will fall like leaves fall of a tree assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back as you may have realized by now that the format of this program is that the first half is devoted for the women around the Prophet Alastair Sam and the second half is devoted to answering some of your questions whether through phone calls or through emails and you'll find that the numbers are displayed at the bottom of the screen if you have a wish to give us a call so Suhail says what is your opinion about ehtekaf during the covered 19 coronavirus can we do this at home and what about women can women observe ehtekaf at home during normal times the answer is no anta cough is a ritual that can only be done in messages so covet 19 is not a reason to change the religion meaning if someone says oh sure you can see now due to the covered 19 we are unable to make Remora said yes a good observation so can we make Amara in our homes there is definitely not so likewise what was prescribed to be performed in the message it has to be done as such until allah azzawajal uplifts this crisis and catastrophe that we are all suffering from ehtekaf can only be performed in messages some scholars even limited that to the three major message in islam which is the masjid al-haram in Mecca and Masjid in Neverland Medina and Masjid al-aqsa in Alpert's in Jerusalem but the most authentic opinion is that it is open to all messages that are full-fledged messages which means that a prayer hall in a mall does not qualify for ehtekaf a prayer hall in your company or in your residential building these are all do not qualify as messages because any second the owner can change the location or turn it into a shop or a warehouse but a full-fledged message it this is what this is for allah azza wajal no one can sell it no one can inherit it no one can give it as a gift so I hope this answers your question assha says how should we spend the last 10 nights of ramadan well the prophet alayhi salat wa salam had a major thing to do during the last 10 nights of ramadan and that is to pray all night long so whenever the 10 nights we do the Prophet a salam would tighten his apron or waist wrapper and some say that this is a metaphor for not having intimacy with the wives and some say that this is a metaphor for doing a lot of effort and striving and doing what you want to do to the most at most level so he used to do that he used to wake up his women his wives and he used to revive his night meaning that he would make the night alive with prayers reciting the Quran and long long raucous so this is the vast majority of what a person has to do in the last 10 nights of ramadan most of us won't be able to do even half of that so you do whatever you can to the best of your ability engage in making duaa because mother Aisha came to the Prophet I think his salat or sermon said Oh prophet of Allah teach me something to say if I were to notice lailatul cutter so the Prophet said to her say allahumma in the car who went to Hebrew life or far for honey oh Allah you are forgiven and you love to pardon so pardon me so if you do this a bit this a bit recite the Quran a little bit do thicker a little bit so that the whole night is engaged in good deeds that would be an excellent thing for you to do a person who did not give his name said how should we give a soul to the people who died due to the coffin 19 and how to perform funeral prayers I heard Hospital wraps the dead body with plastic and sent directly to graveyard in this situation what is to be done according to Islam first of all this is only done by ignorance even medical doctors say that this is nonsense the World Health Health Organization said that covered 19 is not transferred through washing it is transferred through touching a surface that is affected by it and by breathing a dead person does not breathe so if we have a dead corpse and you have your masks and gloves you can wash that individual without any problem shroud him after his shrouded you totally protected normal people can carry him without a fear of contracting that deadly virus and he can be preyed upon buried in the normal Islamic way without any problem it is not contagious to wash a dead body of a person who died due to covered 19 a brother says people in our country are praying in the message during this lockdown as some prominent Muftis are saying that this lockdown does not apply to mosques all daily prayers including Juma prayer will happen as normal with the precautionary measures that there would be a proper distance between rows and individuals that is six feet during congregations is it allowed to pray with such gaps between the followers or is it an innovation first of all if you are in a Muslim country that is ruled by a Muslim leader then you have to obey what the leader says and not to listen to any Tom Dick or Harry or any Mufti or any this or that because this is a crisis that requires decisive directive from the highest level so one Mufti says you have to do this other Mufti says you don't have to do this and putting the Muslims in confusion this is the role of the Muslim ruler ruler or leader he's the one who has to intervene and gives his directive so first of all don't listen to these Muftis if you are in a Muslim country you have to abide by what the Muslim ruler is telling you to do and praying in home you will be rewarded as if you're praying in the Masjid because Allah told you to obey your leader and at the same time this is a collateral issue it's something that you can't take a decision which may have negative consequences over whole country and then said whoops I did it again I wasn't aware that it will be this serious well this is your problem don't be a Rambo as I said so many times be with the Gemara of the Muslims and whatever they decide even if you think that this is not the right decision if you are in a non-muslim country and by law this is a crime to go and pray the message you have to pray home don't let the non-muslims take this as means of attacking Islam and the Muslims and accusing the Muslims of spreading the virus and doing this and doing that now if the Muslim leader says you can pray in the masjid and then they tell you to keep a six feet distance between you and the man praying next to you though this is a big innovation and it would not protect you from the virus if allah wills the virus to come and get you what will you do with prostrating on the carpet or on the floor where others have frustrated maybe a few hours ago so this is not logical this kind of innovation of leaving a six feet gap is unacceptable and your best better and it's best for you to pray home rather - rather than to join such an innovation and Lazo JAL knows best and har says I wanted to know if I'm on my period during lailatul Qatar how can I take advantage of it as I cannot fast and I cannot pray it's true that you cannot pray fasting is done only on the daytime so from Maverick till fetcher if you are unable to pray you're able to do everything else you can read the Koran you can make vicar you can make dua you can engage in so many good things other than the prayer so the sky is the limit feeding the people who are in need helping others helping your parents in the house making vicar reading the Quran reading a lot of the Quran would definitely compensate for your inability to pray Mustafa says in India the event for prayer is done at varying times because of the school the mosque follows now if I hear Anna dhaan first and I stop whatever I'm doing and reply to it and about five or more minutes later the other mosque gives a van do I need to reply to them and stop what I'm doing again first of all the concept of stopping when the iron is being cold I don't know any basis of it so if I'm eating and then it's cold I don't have to drop the spoon and just listen if I'm writing if I'm working with a hammer and a nail if I'm typing if I'm talking to someone I don't have to stop the Sunnah is to repeat I can do that while doing whatever I'm doing I don't have to stop and even if I don't want to repeat I don't want to again I'm not sinful this is recommended Sunnah I'd be losing reward for not repeating behind the imam at their mother then but i'm not sinful definitely for not repeating so if i hear the event from a masjid close by and i repeat after him and afterwards i say that Dora and ask for allah azza wajal to grant our prophet osama waseela and then 5-10 minutes later I hear another event in my oblige to as I said in the beginning neither the first nor the last you're not obliged it's a Sunnah so if you hear the second of that if you repeat behind him and say that Dora it's reward again if you don't there's no sin none whatsoever upon you on Allah knows best zuleyka says does your wood will break if you touch your private part after making wood oh this is an issue of dispute among scholars because there are two hadith one of them stated that a man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said that if a man touches his private part should he perform mudal in one hadith the Prophet said yes and another hadith the Prophet said it is a part of your body it's like any other organ in your body so scholars differed whether one is more authentic than the other or not and whether one abrogated the other or not and they have a lot of dispute and discussion regarding these two hadith it seems and Allah knows best and this is the opinion of share happiness they mean to combine both hadith that we would assume that touching the private part nullifies your Woodill if you touch it with desire and lust and if you touch it as you touch your hand or your thigh or any other part of your body without any feeling or desire then this does not nullify your rudl and allah azzawajal knows best anna says my question is regarding the importance of weak hadith there is wife should we follow the boy if a hadith and what is the Islamic ruling for it because I have heard people saying to not completely reject them as they are after all considered to be hadith this is an issue of dispute among scholars the reason of the dispute is that some imams considered the hadith that are weak to be better than using using your analogy so this came up when the Hanbury school of thought came to a fork of the road over issues that were not clearly covered by the Quran the Sunnah so they looked into the issue and to be able to determine and give a verdict they had one of two either to rely on their analogy and their logic or to search in the weak hadith and find the hadith that is weak yet it supports a verdict and they followed that inaudible hanifa used to follow the analogy and the logic due to the fact that he did not have a lot of hadith at his time to rely on due to the fact that he did not travel as did a man Malik Imam Shafi Muhammad he was always in his village in his town and people from all over came there and shared with him some of the hadith that they had heard but not all of it while ematic traveled Imam Shafi traveled anima Muhammad traveled the most so he got to meet people who heard the hadith from different companions who were travelling all over after the death of the Prophet erase a lot salam and managed to learn from them more now the problem is that when we come to a week or belief hadith scholars that said that we can refer to it sometimes said that there are conditions one that the weakness of the hadith is not due to one of the narrator's being a liar or being an innovator rather being weak in his memory his books were burnt so now he doesn't have any references he's giving hadith from his memory this is why it's weak secondly it should not be in hell and haarlem so it should not be related to fit or to al-qaeda rather it is related to father it'll a man the deeds that are not of essence so whoever prays to raka between this prayer and that prayer Allah would grant him a house in Jannah is therein halal Haram no is there anything to do with appear no it is something recommended to pray yes so this door if hadith we can adopt it and so on and this is why the scholars have differed some of them said it is okay to use weak hadith when it's related to things that do not deal with art either or with halal and Haram or with verdicts of the Deen others said no when Allah said that he will protect the religion that he is the one who revealed the Vicker which includes Quran and Sunna and that he is the one who's going to protect it the weak hadith is not part of the protected one and when Allah says a Leo McMahon telecom Dino come today I have completed your religion the weak hadith is not part of the religion that was completed therefore and this is open initial Albani we only rely on the Quran the authentic hadith with the understanding of the three favorite generations the generation of the Companions stabbing antara dubbing and I'm inclined to this opinion because it's the safest and it is crystal clear you cannot bring weak hadith and make the firm foundations which Islam is standing on a little bit shaky because of such weak hadith Allah knows best a rooster says are we sinful if we clean the spiderweb from the house or washroom because I heard about a hadith where the spider protected the Prophet is awesome through their web so we should not clean it is this true no the answer the answer is this is not true the incident where the when the Prophet a son was in the cave where he was trying to migrate from Mecca to Medina and and the idol worshippers were trying to look for his hiding place and what he was hiding with Abu Bakr Allah sent a spider and it made a web on the entrance of the cave and Allah sent a dog or a pigeon and the pigeon laid couple of eggs over a nest of hers there so the idol worshipers saw it and said no definitely no one could have entered here and they left this story is not authentic and therefore there's nothing wrong in cleaning your house and removing the spiderweb a sister says my sister-in-law and her husband do not attend any Nika Dawa there is the feast given by the bride's side as they say eating at Nika is Haram they are extremely rich and the Alliance they're looking or their daughter are also from rich people but they are saying they will not give Nica Dawa and that the Nica should take place in the Masjid and won't feed groom family but walima should be grant is it correct unfortunately so many people combined between ignorance and arrogance and this is so funny yet it is sad at the same time you see a lot especially from my position and I read questions and I face people on Twitter and I see how arrogant and ignorant at the same time well they come and complain and say why is this what this is the first time I hear something like that is it my mistake that your ignorant imbecile and when I say something on Twitter and someone uses vulgar language he curses increases me and then he says I've never heard something like that so I bring him the verse of the Quran which any child would have known in Arabia but he's not an Arab of course not no offense no offense but if you don't know ask don't start shooting asks I've never heard this before so can you please explain to me and I'd be happy to do this but they start shouting and cursing and using profanity only to discover at the end that the day is small due to their ignorance so these couple they're rich masha'Allah and they're looking for an alliance to the daughter whenever anyone invites them to a meal because their daughter is getting married and they're inviting others to attend they say no if the father of the girl is throwing a party we're not coming why says because this is Haram Oh Masha Allah you made that Haram said yes it is a responsibility of the man of the groom yeah he type if the father of the girl wants to invite his friends and loved ones you would say no it's not if a business so now they've combined ignorant with arrogance now they want someone to come and propose to their daughters and they don't want to throw any kind of hospitality to the groom's family okay we understand that but now they want a grand feast where the groom has to pay the money in a five-star hotel for two thousand people Subhan Allah isn't that Haram isn't that extravagance it's none of my business I don't throw a party well this is ignorant from your side my friend whenever people come to ask for the hand of my daughter I always throw a party that is decent for 2030 sometimes a hundred people just to express my happiness and to gather my friends the wedding afterwards is according to the boom he wants to throw a wedding how big how small is none of my business though I would HIGHLY advise it to be small and not to spend money and to save the money for their life and for their marriage but to insist on having a grand walima this is totally ignorant combined with arrogance may allah azzawajal guide them so the last question is from Umar and he says is it permissible to make vicar like Allah who the answer is no it is not permissible to make vicar by simply repeating the names of Allah Azza WA JAL without anything else so this is the way of the Sufis they say Allahu Allahu Allah who wha-hoo and they keep on repeating it and after a while they start moving with the beat and maybe swirling right and left and after a while it becomes difficult to say Allah who so they just say hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo and they repeat it a thousand times and you don't know is this a tribal in the jungles of Africa or in Alaska what is hoo-hoo-hoo what are you guys doing to know with making Vicker who's who says no this is Allah who this is a pronoun saying him him so what are you doing some people say you say a lot 'if a lot if a lot if 120 times some say say a Sameer if you have a pain in your ear and repeated a thousand times all of this is nonsense all of this is an innovation if it had any roots in Sharia in Quran in Sunnah I would have been more than happy to share it with you but this is an innovation where Shaitaan is making fun of you and messing up with your minds this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you family la cuesta Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
