  "title": "Be fair with all your children Calgary (Canada) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ (2nd half Q & A) #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "put anything in my fingers nails are already clipped so the prophet Al was indicating this when he said a woman is sought after for four things they be they may be married for four things her wealth her lineage her beauty and her religious commitment so seek the one who's religiously committed may your hands be rubbed with dust meaning may you prosper when the child arrives you have to be fair and just by implementing the Sunnah so part of the Sunnah is to do a andn is a Sunnah that is quite not known to many Muslims and that is to chew a very tiny piece of date until it's really soft and then you attach it to the ceiling of the child's uh um throat from the inside his mouth or her mouth and they used to do this with the Blessed people of the time which was the prophet Alam so they used to take their children to the prophet am and nowadays they usually take their children to the IM of the Masjid to the scholars to the righteous people whom they think they are righteous so that they would do this type of Sunnah part of the Sunnah is to choose a good name and you have to be fair with your children by giving them all good names the best of names for men no not Muhammad muh mad is one of the beautiful names of course but there's nothing in the Sunnah to indicate that we should call our children Muhammad the prophet says the is the best of names or the more beloved names to Allah so these are the most beloved names but of course if you call your son Muhammad that's a A plus unlike what they do in some countries they give their children confusing names and then they wonder why they are so confused in life so they call him muham and he sayah your father is say no your grandfather is say no so who's Muhammad says me so I don't know why the confusion they use Muhammad as a blessing and the second name is the actual name and this is I don't know I'm not going to speak about that now time is very very limited then part of the Sunnah is to shave the head of the newborn and to weigh the hair the equivalent of its weight in Silver is to be given in charity is this to be done with the girls an issue of dispute I personally do that to my girls I did that to my girls why because the Hadith indicated the prophet said remove the filth from the child's scalp and this applies for both boys and girls so you do this and this would ensure inshallah a good growth for the hair is also part of the Sunnah that you have to do for your children and that is to slaughter two Rams two sheep Two Goats on behalf of a male child and one on behalf of a female child and this is an indication that there are aspects in Shar where men are double the women for example in inheritance when a father dies the man the boy gets twice his sisters share also in also in testimony a the testimony of a man is equivalent to the testimony of two women also in blood money if you kill a man you pay a lot edit this it will go this is a problem so if you kill a man by mistake of course by an accident you pay the equivalent of 100 camels if you pay if you uh uh Rampage a woman mistakenly you pay 50 this is a Sunnah so this is the blood money and the fifth type of difference is in when you free a slave so if you free a slave man Allah will free with each limb of his a limb of yours from Hellfire but if you free two slave women this would happen to you as well these are the five types and this is not our topic but who cares so uh part of of also the rights of our children upon us is circumcision and this is mandatory for male children not for female children and there is a difference between Islamic circumcision and female um genital mutilation FGM I think they call it and this is totally Haram and prohibited and not from Islam at all then we have part of being fair to your children is that you sponsor them and you gave you give them maintenance and spend on them the prophet says it is enough sin for a man not to give food to the one whom he is supposed to feed and so many men fall into this sin when they work overseas and neglect their children and their wives they don't give them anything some of them even neglect them while they're here in this land because they're getting benefits and they're taking all the benefits from the government and leaving their children unattended and forcing the women to work sometimes two jobs to provide for the family and he's on his place station for playing with the boys all of this shows who's the man in the family probably she's the one wearing the pants but this is part of the unfairness and Injustice that we sometimes have so it is the right of the children to be provided for by their parents spe spe specifically the father now under unfortunately lots of us fathers and parents Force our children to be undutiful to us and to disrespect us so many of us because we executed what Allah told us to do by taking care of our children providing for them feeding them clothing them taking care of their medical expenses taking their care of their educational expenses once a child becomes a man and it starts to work the father expects his son to pay him back and the father is healthy the father is still earning the father has property the father has Investments okay what are you doing so no no no I have a dozen children they have to all work and give me this is ma here this is not a real parent a real father has dignity I would never ever ask any of my children for a dime until I am bedridden or dead broke even if my children are rich I would never ask them for anything I would still give them gifts on Eid I would still pay for whatever they need if they're in need because I am the father to ask your children to pay you so that you can take their money and give it to your to to to your siblings take their money and give it to your co-wives that are not his mother this is Injustice he's not obliged to do this and this is unfair because you're ordering your children to pay for your not needs for your luxury when they're not able to pay for their own wives and children some of them are not able to get married because of this this is Injustice some and I know cases not one or two cases where the man rejects proposals for his daughter w three girls actually not girls are now women in their 40s came to me complaining their teachers and their father has their ATM card and he gets all their salaries and he rejected a gazillion proposal that's where I'm coming from from Saudi and they're saying what can we do good men reputable men and he doesn't want us to get married others don't allow their daughters to get married so that they can serve him and his children and his wife he needs a maid this is Injustice and Allah would hold you accountable they're not your slaves you're ordered to treat them and to raise them and to upbring them according to what pleases Allah and this Injustice is in Every Family by the way all what you need to do is to look around you and you'll see it clearly unfortunately among the greatest rights of the children is to upbring him according to Islam according to the Quran and to the Sunnah so that you ensure that he is religiously committed that he has the best of moral conduct that you cater for his upbringing spiritually uh um his his his health his social activities all of this you have to take care of what while bringing your children and to be fair with them all and among the first that you have to ensure that you install in them is observing Salat the prophet saysat order your children to pray when they're seven and beat them up over it when they're 10 of course here this is not advisable because 911 is not going to leave you alone so be careful this is Hadith you have to practice it but not by throwing Yourself In Harm's Way be a little bit uh um aware and knowledgeable of the environment you're living in being fair between the children is a must even when it comes to being emotionally involved with them loving them caring for them praising them kissing them an Malik reports may Allah be pleased with him that while we were with the prophet there was a man sitting next to him and came in a son of this man so he picked him up he hugged him he kissed him and made him sit on his thigh he's sitting next to the prophet then came in a girl of his young daughter so he picked her up and placed her in front of him no kissing no hugging so the prophet said shouldn't you be fair with both of them shouldn't you treated them in the same fashion Why by Nature ween love boys as children because we think of them as our a rock when they grow up they're going to defend us they're going to take care of us not knowing that Girls Just Want to Have Fun girls they are the joy of Life Allah has blessed me with 13 no boys I'm growing a uterus at the moment but may Allah make it easy for all of us and alhamdulillah they take real good care of you boys on the other hand yes they could help they could add some value but they're not as affection affectionate maybe I don't know if this is the right word uh they're not as merciful as girls so in the old times in the Arabs would prefer men they were ashamed of having girls they're ashamed of having uh uh females as Offspring to the extent that they used to kill them that was the trend a guy gets a baby girl he buries her because he's ashamed of her so IIM says the Sal used to want and encourage people to be fair even in kisses don't kiss one of your children more than the other this would cause enmity jealousy hatred among one another and of course the prophet said that clearly in so many times fear Allah and be and be fair between your children now being fair between the children originates from a very famous Hadith you all know andash may Allah be pleased with them says that my mom went to my father Al bash and asked him for a gift for me so he gave me a slave man and another narration a property a plot my M my mother was an intellectual intelligent woman she said I will not accept such a gift until you make the prophet a witness because he would approve it or reject it so the pro the bash went to the prophet and he said I gave my son and this gift so the prophet asked him a very straightforward question have you given all of your children an equivalent gift he said no he said then give it back or take it back and another narration I do not testify upon Injustice and in another narration he ask him a second question would you like all of your children to be equal in being dutiful and respectful to you he said yes of course I don't want one to be less than the other in another narration the prophet said be fair between your children in gifts as you love that they are fair between you in kindness and being dutiful so this Hadith clearly states that in gifts you cannot favor one child over the other even if one child is 40 years old and the other one is one year old you have to give them equivalent gifts now may Allah be pleased with her says a woman came to me with two girls asking for food I had nothing in my house ex except a date imagine the wife of the Prophet has nothing in the house except to date and we have so much in our kitchen draw drawers uh cupboards um I don't know you know so I I apologize it's not my first language so I have to think of words sometimes I never go to the kitchen but I do do I do sometimes cook just to to clear the record so she gave her one date that's the only thing she had in the prophet's house the woman split it into two halves and gave each one half of it mother AA was shocked she have never seen such thing so when the prophet came she told her and the prophet said whoever is tested by means of these girls and he treats them with kindness they will be a protection for him from the fire Ya Allah two even one just be kind to the girls but what we want to learn from this story is that the woman was what fair with both of her daughters by giving them half of it so I know our time is limited and I don't want to be interrupted before I give you the um the juuce so there are a number of important things we have to understand because this causes a lot of confusion in a lot of the people's heads number one there is a difference between allowance and a gift a gift is uncalled for it's Eid tomorrow and I give this is in my country in Eid of Ramadan we give money to our kids so we give them all equal those who are 40 years of age and those who are 15 years of age the same amount they cry this is not fair I'm a a a an employee I'm a university student this is a gift we have to be fair an allowance is different the the child that goes to UNI is going to get pocket money different than the one that goes to Primary School definitely when I want to buy clothes the clothes I buy to the boys are way way different than the clothes I buy to the girls unless they come out of the closet then we have a problem may Allah forbid may Allah make them all outside so girls need more clothes needs more attention than and boys boys a pair of jeans and t-shirt that's it the girls need to be adornment and dresses and lots of things different likewise if I take one child to hospital and I have an operation and I spend $2 $3,000 the rest of the kids don't have the right to say be fair said okay I'll open your stomach and then I'll give you the m this this is different this is an allowance number two are boys and girls equal in gifts yes or no always when ask an a question say there is an issue of dispute there are two opinions be safe if you say yes and it's no you'll be embarrassed so it is an issue of dispute some Scholars say they have to be different as per the in inance Allah says Allah instructs you concerning your children that is their portion of inheritance for the male what is equal to the share of two females but this is in what in inheritance when you die our scholars in Saudi Arabia they say two for the boys one for the girls so if you want to give a gift give ,000 to your son 500 to the girls other Scholars like IM in and others and this is what I am inclined to follow that they have to be equal why because this is not inheritance I'm still alive two because the prophet asked do you have children other than him he said yes do you like them all to be equal in being respectful and beautiful he said yes he said then be equal in giving them equal shares and he did not differentiate between boys and girls so I am inclined that they should all be the same as a gift number three is the mother obliged to be fair in gifts similarly to the Father the mothers are saying no of course she does she has to she is held accountable on the day of judgment for f for favoring some of children over the other and this happens a lot in the subcontinent she what do you have against the subcontinent well I have no beef they're are brothers and sisters and we love them we we grew up with them all our lives but wrong practices have to be changed lots of the families hoard gold in large quantities for their daughters to get married and the poor boy has such nothing and the problem is that even when this girl gets married and they send her away with such gold her dot dot dot dot husband after a year takes the gold and run away and I have hundreds of cases coming to me she my mother-in-law took my gold she's a thief W she's a thief she first wants me to serve and to cook and to clean the house for her and her siblings and their husbands so I'm a mate and not only that she also took my my my gold and is refusing to return it and now they want me to file for bunch of Thieves and Crooks but this is not our topic again so yes the mother has to be fair with her children in gifts like the father is number four is the grandfather obliged to be fair with his grandsons I I know this I know this question fear Allah you see you can't give the topic it's due right in like 20 25 minutes because this is something that we need to practice to learn it's not here we're not here to joke I hope so anyhow I'll try to wrap it up to the best of my ability as a grandfather am I obliged to be fair with my grandchildren the answer is issue of dispute always be safe rather than sorry it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that no you're not a father you're a grandfather and the enmity between the grandchildren is negligible compared to the enmity between the sons and daughters to their direct father but if you're going to favor some of your grandchildren because you favor their father or their mother this would cause enmity between your own children ah he favors our children because he loves that individual his son but he doesn't love the other Sons more so this is Haram but if it's not try to do it discreetly and no problem inshah number five can the father increase in gifts due to an incentive and this is frequently Asked question my son goes to UNI and he's an A+ student and the other son doesn't he works in a garage or as a mechanic so can I give incentives to the the kid that does well in school the answer is no because the one who doesn't go to school is going to hate him so you have to be fair in gifts this son of mine is a of Quran I'd like to favor him you can providing you ask the rest of your children do you mind if I favor Muhammad with an extra gift because he just memorized the whole Quran if they say yes willingly no pressure not out of embarrassment out of real love and care you have the green light you can go and do so um okay let me skip this skip this if one of my children Works in my shop or in my company can I give him something because of his work the answer is no unless you treat him as a stranger so anyone working in his position how much would you give him as a salary x amount give it to him equally treating him now I know people are looking at the children say see you're you're the vice president of my company and you're getting no no no no he has to be qualified and he has to get exactly similarly to what any other Tom Dicker Harry would get if they were to assume that position but to favor him because he's been working with you for the past 20 years and give him something that's more more no this is not halal at all finally if one of my children goes to UNI and needs a car so can I buy him a car and the other children don't have cars the answer is yes providing hm what kind of a car providing what providing that the car is in my name because I might die today and then if it's in his name he's going to claim it and that would be a gift but if it's in my name after death it's going to be distributed to The Heirs and there are so many things that I have compiled but alhamdulillah apparently there's not enough time but I hope this may help in Opening Our Eyes how to be fair and just with our parents remember Prophet yub peace be upon him he's a prophet a son of a prophet is a son of a prophet and a messenger ibraim yet he was fair and just yet he could not hide his feelings everyone of his children knew that he loved Yousef more than anyone else what did they do to Yu you know the story and he was fair and just so imagine how our children would feel against one another if we tend to every time you're not like your brother abdalah Abdullah is this Abdullah is that Abdullah and the guy is being reprimanded for how good Abdullah is next thing you'll know he's going to get a Glock may Allah protect you all [Music] so we have um some questions that have come in and um I will fire them off for your answer inshah nlock um so one question is to what extent should we believe in black magic being so common nowadays especially back home black magic is mentioned in the Quran in verse number 102 chapter 2 it is mentioned in the Quran so who in his right mind would object to it it's also mentioned Inari that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had a spell casted upon him and it was mentioned that he was cured by getting the spell out and it was burnt it was done by who was a Jew so there is no doubt in the existence of black magic however the doubt is in a lot of the Muslims heads when they tend to blame everything on such Supernatural uh uh phenomenon so my boss hates my guts he doesn't give me an increment or a raise I think there is an evil eye my kid flunked his second year in medical school I this I think this is Envy my wife is nagging all the day mallah she speaks like 23 hours and 59 minutes a day nonstop I think she's possessed by Jin and my mother-in-law always comes at the wrong times to my home and she spends like 3 months without non-stop I think this is black magic no this is totally bogus this is our faults and shortcomings when we are unable to justify them or solve them we tend to blame these things over them and there's nothing like that yes they exist don't get me wrong yeah who would have the power to do magic just to uh do Such trivial things let them go to isra do some black magic there do some Gin possession do whatever you want I will not say but give us a break if it can solve problems it would have solved problems yes we do U um acknowledge and I've seen this and I've been through cases like this where newlywed would not be able to function due to something like that and the GU is one of them came to me I don't want to waste your time anyhow this is beside the point I get someone tapping my shoulders we have this time no sh continue this story sounds really intriguing I can finish my lecture so a guy came to me some years ago called me on the phone I have a problem I got married two months ago I've I'm unable to consumate my marriage I said well maybe you have impy problems go see the doctor said he should said sheh I'm as strong as a bull I'm 21 years old Subhan Allah maybe your house is filled with Haram and movies and music and Shan is overwhelming you she I am studying and teaching Quran in Medina mid of the prophet in the circles whoa this guy's High more hierarchy than than me so I said this is not natural but I think that you have either Jin or magic in you I don't know say can you do R to me that was on the phone said if I do on you all the Jin and me will come to you believe me trust me you don't want this but I'll advise you to do something he's in Medina make your and go to Mecca and do and do your cut your hair come back to the Kaa pray two raise your hands in the near the Kaa in in in the Haram and say oh Allah I'm helpless I have no one to turn to and there's no one on earth could who could cure me except you oh Allah I'm not leaving until am cured and praise Allah offer salutation upon the prophet and give Dua from your the bottom of your heart and you will be fine that was like 10:00 or 8:00 in the evening following morning about 10:00 or 11:00 in the morning I get a Callum may Allah reward you he makes Dua like everybody else yeah yeah I've heard this do you have money so he's making do I'm making do I said who are you I don't remember I get gazillion calls a day he says I called you yesterday oh yeah yeah I remember now so when are you coming he said oh sh the moment I hung up I drove 5 hours to meca did my omra in couple of hours drove back another 5 hours that's 12 hours on the road and the moment I reached home I consumated the marriage but this is better than F I should try this Subhan Allah if you believe W he nothing can stand in your way all what you have to do is trust Allah rely on him depend on him we have a problem on depending on our biceps on our strength or intellect or our degree on who you know not what you know not depending on Allah the moment a child Falls sick what's the first thing you do doctor doctor please help my child he has this fever real Muslims start with r and then they go to the emergency room trust Allah so what was the question to begin with okay black magic so does it exist it does exist it does exist without any doubt and Allah knows best um the next question is that is it true that we can change other with Dua and if everything is written how can making Dua change what is written so I'll ask you a question do you know what is your yes or no so how do you know if you make Dua that it change or did not change you don't know so is something that Allah had written 50,000 years before creating the universe it's fixed but also told us the prophet that the Dua can change so I make Dua so how could it change something that was written 50,000 years ago before creating the universe because in what was written the Dua was also written it will change so Allah pred divined that I will have an accident on XY Z day and I make Dua Ya Allah save me Allah protect me and then underneath that it's written because of the Dua that this person did the accident will be avoided this son of his will fall sick and should die but because of his Dua and his mother's Dua Allah cured him and made him live so yes Dua is part of the but you do not know what is written for you so you make Dua and Trust Allah whatever is good for you will happen don't say I made Dua and nothing happened this is because you don't have belief and that's why Allah doesn't respond to your Dua because you don't believe but if you believe Allah will make things happen better than you what you have anticipated and the next question is I have I've been married for a few months now and I had followed all the Islamic guidelines my mother is not talking to me and it's been more than 6 months even though I've tried my best to reach out to her but she wants nothing to do with me I'm not sure what else I can do why so how would I know see see such questions they assume that I have a crystal ball I don't but because I've done a lot of counseling I could tell number one either he married her against his her mother's his mother's will so she's from a different tribe different Clan different ethnicity and or not the mother's niece as usual number two he married her but he's not allowing his mother to control her so she's living in a joint family but but the mother is not happy because she wants her to wake up early after fer start cooking breakfast and cleaning and doing the shores and washing and ironing and everything and he as a real man says no she's lies only to serve me I married her you want to have her you marry her but alhamdulillah this is not Halal in Islam so I'm the one who married her she serves me and my children three a possib that he married this woman the mom was happy everything was fine he moved out and the mom is refusing to talk to him because he's breaking the family ties and his siblings are thinking of doing the same and she's losing grip over her flock so until I know the reason but you get the point that's PR good um the next question is uh what is expected of Muslims other than our prayers and charity towards the people of we don't have only the people of razah we have calamities all over the world but stands out because the Injustice is so crystal clear that even the blind could see it even the disbelievers would join hands with us and saying that this is unfair this is Injustice what's the point of a veto for the third time and the 36th time in the history of the United Nation against the Palestinians what is the message that you are siding by peace lovers democracy human rights all this baloney no this is a lot of BS and The Masks have been removed we know who the enemy is so yes as individuals what can we do nothing except to do pray Dua and to financially help in all means that we can because a penny matters and if you look at the way we spend our wealth lavishly W when we die nothing is going to help us in our Graves we won't be able to put a bul light can I have some light no it's dark it's lonely it's cold but whatever you give it's going to be stored for you there the prophet says in a very beautiful Hadith on the day of judgment each one of you will be in the shade of his charity the narrator of this Hadith he says W not a single day passed except I would give in charity even if it's an apple if it's a a donut if it's anything I just have to give something in charity every single day so we can do this Dua and don't think that Dua is something that is okay I'll make um 30 seconds Dua and that's it I've done my due diligence to Philistine what else do you want no you have to do Dua in every in between and in the last third of the night when the rooster calls when it's straining when this when do select the times of answering your Dua and at the same time you have to give thirdly you have to share their plight with the whole world to see these atrocities to know who are real enemies are those who are siding by Israel are our enemies we don't have to you be rocket scientists to know this and this is what they're trying for us not to abide and by and to believe we are Muslims we we we don't have nationalities we don't have borders one brother in the east of the world is being tortured and killed he's my brother one brother in the west is suffering he's my brother they don't want us to do this no they want they to segregate us to separate us to feel that I am from this nationality I'm from that nationality we're different we're better no we're not every time someone tells me about my ethnicity where are you originally from I said alhamdulillah my lineage is very prestigious and high and I I boast about that all the time my great great grandfather is a is a prophet he's Adam so what's the point who are you nothing it doesn't matter what document you carry what matters is what's in your heart what you do what you say how you believe how you feel towards your brothers so in a nutshell you can't do anything but to be peaceful but be vocal and according to the Quran and Sunnah don't exceed your limits share with the whole world their plight and may Allah make this our Jihad for their cause um shift the next question is are steroids H I'm not a doctor I can't tell I know that it is taken sometimes to cure some illnesses and to fix some infections and but if you mean do I take steroids or anabolic steroids I've never taken anything that's not natural in my life with the grace of Allah so I don't do this St and I Ser any sincerely and seriously feel sorry for those who take it why are you taking it to buff yourself this is not natural eat natural food and work out and exercise and why do you do it so many people do it and they go to the gym and they become so huge and one small evil eye well and the guy is on the ground so what's the point I think but I can't say if it's Oram this requires a medical profession professional to come and and say when to be taken when not to be taken and the reasons for that and Allah knows best this next question the context you will know um how I don't have a crystal ball I how do you get upgraded to an air condition condition by being a big fan when you become a big fan Allah will promote you to a big this statement I said and I regret it saying it was during a live uh um uh program on TV and the guy called and it was in the midst of serious questions so when someone calls I'm your biggest biggest fan so may Allah promote you to be a big air conditioner yes what's your question and he went on he didn't hear the the comment I don't know how people leave a full hour of serious marriage divorce issues and they focus on this and they extractive and every time I meet some of my fans say I'm your biggest fan huh huh I'm waiting so I think I have to find another catchphrase maybe better than that sounds good um the next question is how can I achieve in my prayers no this requires a long long long session is not steroids it's not a pill you take alhamdulillah now is a lifestyle is a conviction I always tell this to people who come to me you've heard it a gazillion times it's boring but who cares people come my wife doesn't wear the hijab she my son smokes she my husband is addicted to porn she this she that I say to them all of these are symptoms if someone comes to you and says I have a severe headache I think here you you give them Tylenol so in in in Saudi we have panad so give them two tinal Mah 6 hours no headache he comes back oh it came back again take two time and you do this for a whole week did I help him no probably he has cancer he has something that is serious yeah yeah yeah he has a serious illness chronic illness the symptoms are the headache so by giving him what cures the symptoms is not the illness itself I'm not helping him likewise all of our problems are going back to the chronic illness that is not knowing Allah we have a huge void in our hearts it's empty that's why we feel depressed so many times that's why so many times we're agitated we're not happy you can see it in the people's fa is they're working 9 to 5 and they take 2 hours to commute and 2 hours to come back and they have to pay the rent and they have to well here the rent is compared to Toronto anyhow um and they have problems with the kids they have problem with the wife the in-laws the food the debts the so many things this is the void in your heart I went to Pakistan last year and Subhan Allah in Pakistan the people are Stone broke below poverty lines and seriously but I see people with 13 or 14 family members living in Shanty houses or 10 houses no running water alayum please come and the smile is from here to here and he doesn't say I'm your biggest fan because he doesn't even have a fan and the guy invites me to bani said we we we received this three nights ago from a leftover from the wedding come it's it's I said this is not sufficient for me alone it's it's only couple of spoons let alone your family said no no no no say Allah Allah has graced us where can I get this IM his heart is filled with the love of Allah he doesn't look at the half empty of the glass or The Empty Glass because he has a glass we have bottles and still we think that Allah has not favored us or blessed us does not come until you know who Allah is until you know who what's his beautiful names and attributes isn't it a shame that when someone says Allah has 99 names and you asked how many names do you memorize they said m like 15 and then someone asks you about of these 15 names how many do you the the meaning of maybe one or two then how would you say allahar and start to pray it's empty you don't know who you're talking to when you say subh you don't know who you are bowing to or prostrating to therefore to do we need much more time and space and and an Open Hearts to rectify our Affairs our whole lifestyle is rubbish or as they say in England rubish it is nonsense we're not abiding by the Quran or by the Sunnah we do good deeds I have to admit mashallah the brothers pay generously for the cause of Allah the brothers may offer night prayer the sisters may cook food for Ramadan they're contributing to the community but we always think that we have credit what what do you mean she you're making a call yeah I have credit it's an international callam doesn't answer the mobile WhatsApp or FaceTime only international call you can call me any time of the day or night my number is open to all it's free but I don't receive except one call a day and it has to be less than 3 minutes and quick rapid fire question not she I'd like to tell you about my problem since childhood I'm going to hang up so you call and you get the answer what did I what brought me to this issue huh yeah I I totally lost [Music] it age age and 13 daughters and the uters I forgot anyhow to get you have to fill the void in your heart you have to learn Allah's beautiful names and attributes you have to change yes when you give I have credit ah see you're asleep have asleep not more than me what do we mean by we have credit we all are like this I'm among you I go take om so I finish my om I live an hour away from Ka alhamdulillah so taking omah is piece of cake while driving back Shan comes to me said why don't you listen to some music I just did said yes you have a clean book you have credit hm okay so I listened to some music go back home why did you want watch Netflix I don't have it subscribe Game of Thrones season 16 good okay I have credit this is is our biggest problem we treat Allah that we have credit I've done good things in my life I've done charity I've done night prayer I've fasted Mondays so I have credit and this is the void in our hearts we don't have fear of Allah we think that no I've done so many things Allah should give me more so once you fill the void in Your Heart by knowing Allah by being humble then inshallah you'll have um last probably two questions um there are a couple that are very similar in theme so I'll just ask the one of them if the parents are against two individuals to get married can they have a secret no a woman cannot be married without a consent and approval of her father a woman's marriage is dependent on her father if her father gives her the green light even if her mother fights tooth and nail against it it has no value because the mother's opinion in her daughter's marriage is not of essence she's emotionally motivated and many reasons drive her what counts in Islam is the opinion and the consent of the father if the father agrees let's go to the groom's side the man the man does not need anyone's approval nor neither his father nor his mother nor anyone else so if he's financially dependent he's a real man and the girl checks all the boxes but his parents don't want her because she's not fair she's not white she's dark she's fat she's this she's that her parents are not from the same level as we are we went to their home they don't have security with AK4 47 people come to me like this in Pakistan I went to some of the people's houses they have like 10 guards with AK-47 I was scared what is this no no she this is every day they come with me in the car scary business so some people say no if they're not from the same level then no you cannot marry her she doesn't have a job she doesn't earn why am I looking for a sugar Mommy I don't want her to earn I want her to sit home and to cook and to take care of my children I'm the man who's supposed to give every single dime needed in the house not her so if you're a financial independent and she checks all the boxes go ahead and don't look behind so just to add to that you were um also sharing that one story where um the father kept on denying his daughters were 40 years old to get married what happens in that situation I told them I told them dit your father and go to the uh Islamic court and get married such a father from day one see now I make a long short story long lots of the girls come to me she says she I met this boy in uni and I want to marry him he's religious he's H he's got a big beard and mallah he's practicing and and we love one another first of all he's not practicing you can't fall in love and have relationship and being and long beard come on who you fooling said she no no this is the norm in here in Canada and America and Europe so I don't know their level of practicing How could a person be practicing when he has illicit Haram relationship with a woman on the phone or in texting and he says I'm hijab she's a hijabi and I'm a beardy what what is this this is Dr Jackal Mr Hyde but none of my business so she my father rejected him so can we go to the Muslim judge to get married the answer is no she he's rejecting a good man even though it's his rights to reject but if he rejected four or five good suitors without any legitimate reason now you can override and go to the Muslim judge not from the first instance or the second instance because I'm a father mother I gave birth to this to this girl and I've taken care of her for all of my life now it's a mutual decision I cannot marry her off to someone she doesn't like no you have to marry your cousin dad I don't want like my cousin said no you have to no this marriage is invalid forced marriage is invalid and she cannot marry without my approval as they say it takes two to tango Hal she's your spouse nothing Haram so I hope this answers no that does that does um I guess uh one last question um there's there's a few like this but um is it Halal to become a real estate agent two is it Halal to become a real estate agent it is halal to become a real estate agent providing that you do not involve yourself in anything Haram all those who buy property buy them through mortgage and it's Haram it's not of your business where they get the money from you're a real estate agent you sell but if you're going to help them fill up the mortgage form or you tell them well this Bank gives 4.7% and that bank gives my recommendation is for this Bank or do the due diligence for the bank and help the bank and communicate with the bank to facilitate such a loan no this is make sense yeah thank you so so much"
