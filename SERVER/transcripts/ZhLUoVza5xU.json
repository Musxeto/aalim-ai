  "transcript": "we move on to um Lara from Nigeria she says that she has a friend who offended her deeply and she cannot stand her anymore is that okay and she has another question about bowing to or kneeling down to elderly people out of respect is that okay for for the first question the relationship ship between people is very difficult to manage and people themselves differ you find someone who's an easygoing even if you insult him even if you were disrespectful to him his heart is as big as an ocean once you come and seek his forgiveness he forgives you if you don't seek his forgiveness he forgot everything that you have harmed him or wronged him with and by far this is a characteristic of the people of Jenna those who are easygoing who are so forgiving and tolerant it is a characteristic of the people of Jenna on the opposite side there are people when you talk to them you are so afraid and intimidated because if you say the wrong thing even with a good intention they make a fuzz out of it they start to blame you they start to point fingers and they remind you of things that took place 50 or 60 years ago you did this you did that your intention was this your intention was was that and by far these are not among the righteous people those who keep on bringing up old stories and confusing you and making life difficult they are not part of the righteous people who are supposed to be friendly who are supposed to be forgiving and who are supposed to be tolerant therefore my advice to you is that you should forgive and you should forget any wrongdoing they did to you because if you do this anticipating the reward from Allah Allah would forgive your sins it's exactly what Abu Bakr did may Allah be pleased with him when his cousin whom Abu Bakr used to support and give money because he was poor slandered his daughtera may Allah be pleased with her the mother of the Believers so said I'm not going to give him a dime from now on because of what he had done and Allah revealed a verse inah which encouraged him to forgive so that Allah would forgive him and the minute he heard this verse from the prophet Alam he said oh prophet of Allah I make you my witness that I have forgiven my cousin and from now on I'm going to give him and support him and provide for him until I die this is how we should uh deal with others so that not they would like us and love us but so that Allah would forgive our sins as for"
