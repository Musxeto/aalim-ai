  "title": "Why are the Ayahs repeated in the Quran? #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh in the Quran we see many kasas or many phrases being question why is it necessary for all the repetition for example a phrase like why is it repeated a lot of times uh in the repetition some like the wording says in one Surah so why is the wording changing and someone would ask isn't this uh people who do not know Arabic Arabic is an eloquent language and speaks to us situations and incidents so sometimes you read Surah yusu and you find that a gap of 10 years was skipped so he enters a jail and he stays there from 3 to 9 years and and the F feels the pause or the Gap because it is Allah who eloquent Quran so Allah tells us in different although it's the same incident but different things that happened to it in a different way to make us in having the ability to find one contradiction of the samean said this and this and this and this inah Allah tells us this in another Surah Allah tells us this in a third Surah Allah tells us this but it the same incident different of the Quran why is Allah repeating some of his beautiful names and attributes to cement the IM that he's and the thing that would increase your Iman is the knowledge of Allah's beautiful names placement test now and give everybody an a for paper and ask them write you will have a big failure yeah the vast majority would fail to go beyond 15 and even of these these 15 they will manage to give you the meaning of three or four and this is a huge failure in your Iman because if you're going to visit Cape Town in South Africa as they say you will make your studies and Google it and sightseeing where to go best hotels best food but when you're going to Jenna you have no idea who you're meeting when you pray who you praying to Allah but what are his beautiful names I don't know what's the meaning of one of the beautiful names we recite every single day what does a su mean um I have to research it then what are the names that you know so this might be one of the reasons but I know I don't know Allah Knows Best"
