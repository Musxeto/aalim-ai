  "title": "What is muraqaba in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Nayla says just wanted to know what is your views are what are your views are on more Aqaba some people that i know practice it and i wanted to know whether this is part of the deen see some terminologies are glamorous and beautiful and sound nice but when you try to look for them in the Sharia you will not find it's backed by the Sharia more Aqaba means to observe to watch analyze name is Allah keep the ever watcher so more Aqaba in a sense it comes under the Sun as in the hadith of gibreel when he asked about Islam about a man about a son and the Prophet said to worship Allah as if you are able to see him and if you are not able to see him then you should worship Him acknowledging that he sees you and watches you so Maracana is to observe allah azzawajal but not to observe him in person so Hannah Tyler this is blasphemous no one can do that but rather to observe his beautiful names and attributes so you know that he's all-seeing all hearing this is maraca ba and this is the legitimate Shari or sharia-compliant way of doing maraca ba other sects may have this in their curriculum and that prerequisite to be a good Muslim but they are deviant sects so they claim that maraca ba is divided into three divisions and each division includes so bla bla at so many philosophical terms that do not relate to Muslims some of them even it equivalent to meditation like is done by the non muslims hindus the buddhists etc so it's like yoga and they just sit there and contemplate and they say we're doing murabba all of this is not part of Islam this was never done by the Prophet Allah so some nor his companions and this is only done by the deviant cults and sects that try to add things to Islam which are not part of Islam so in essence maraca ba which means that you do not do anything except while acknowledging that Allah is watching you so you are fearful I wish I can listen to a song or watch a movie but before doing so I remember that Allah is watching me so I refrain this is Morocco but that is advisable and highly recommended for those sinners like us"
