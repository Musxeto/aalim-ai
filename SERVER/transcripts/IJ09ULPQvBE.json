  "transcript": "is it permissible to curse someone specifically answer is no why because if you say to someone may Allah get you out of his mercy if he is out of his mercy where is he and he'll tell us so this is totally not permissible however there is a difference between individual cursing and general cursing what is the difference if I have brother Abdullah here and I say Abdullah may Allah curse you this is individual cursing this is haram general cursing is similar to what the Prophet had said at a his salat WA Salam first those who associate others with Allah second those who can associate by slaughtering those who change the land mark the land mark and we will come to talk about this so in the Quran Allah mentions a lot of the times that may Allah curse the wrongdoers may Allah curse the transgressors the prophets say that a solid Azam in so many hadith may Allah curse meaning to take out of Allah's mercy so many categories of people one the one who steals - the one who for decades for women for example the Prophet cursed the women who pluck their eyebrows a lot of the women's do this don't they in Saudi Arabia Malay I'm talking Saudi Arabia they have it like crazy they go and pluck their hair their eyebrows either plucking or cutting with the scissors or shaving and then drawing again seriously this is crazy women just want to be beautiful is it wrong no but do it in the halal way so allah cursed the prophet cursed those who do this the Prophet also cursed those who connect their hair with extensions in Malay they don't have any problem with that because their hair is mashallah naturally good in Arabia we have like hair like this afros and it's wu very very strange so they have to you know put chemicals on it soft in it then put extensions and make it big and all of this is haram they're cursed so now in Arabia if I see a woman coming with plucked eyebrows I said may Allah curse you is this permissible some say yes some say no it's an issue of dispute everything you people ask about say it's an issue of dispute is this halal or Haram issue of dispute so those who say it is halal to curse this woman who has eyebrows plucked raise your hands one two three four oh now they're increasing mashallah five six okay maybe five percent those who say it's Haram raise your hands masha'Allah then again fifteen percent eighty percent undecided or asleep or hungry and there is a fourth possibility they own beauty parlors that's why they don't want to see again we come back to the beginning individually you are not allowed to curse learn you're not allowed to generally speaking yes so this woman who plucks or extends her hair with extensions there are many possibilities that she can be exempted from such a curse no ignorant being forced being this being that at the end of the day it's not for you and me the curse is in Allah's hand so don't hold yourself a judge this portion will go to hell this portion will go to heaven good for you no this is not for you and me always be on top once you become judgmental and sure you will go to hell in sha allah then you are in hell seriously those who condemn people to being and how they will be in hell so this is not permissible"
