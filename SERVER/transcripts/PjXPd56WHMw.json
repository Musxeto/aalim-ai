  "title": "Role of a Muslim Woman in learning & spreading Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is huge and immense in islam whether it is as an individual whether it is in grower whether it is in teaching it is as huge as a man's role if not greater simply because women constitute the majority of our community they're far greater in number than men and basically they are half of the community because we're either males or females and she is responsible for upbringing the other half of the community because she's the mother she's the wife she's the sister and she is the daughter as well if you read the quran you will find great emphasis on taking care of the parents and specifically the mother we all know the hadith of the prophet when he said three times to a man asking him who is more worthy of my good companionship the prophet said your mother your mother your mother and then he said your father and also we all know the advice of the prophet to take care of their wives when the prophet said allah take good care of your women folk of your women folk and the prophet also said alison the best of you are the best to your women and i am the best to my women as a daughter we know lots of hadiths where the prophet says al-islam whoever is given three of these daughters and he upbrings them well takes care of them they will be a shield for him from hellfire even if they were true and some some companions said even if they were one so in essence if a woman is righteous practicing religiously committed if she is a good muslim woman then the whole community would become a good community because she would be outweighing a hundred men as she has the whole society on her shoulders however in order for a woman in order for a woman to be successful and to be productive in a community [Music] there are basics that must be acknowledged and these basics unfortunately a lot of the muslims are negligent either intentionally or unintentionally the vast majority are ignorant among the muslims they don't know and those who know tend to be negligent they don't want to pay attention they know the ruling so these are basics once we set the floor then we can proceed to be a productive nation for example a woman is a test a tribulation a fitna upon men and this is how allah created them this is part of our tests on earth there are so many of them allah says in s death and life to test you so all what we see in life is tests men are tested with so many things temptations of wealth temptations of power temptations of worldly matters the greatest of all temptations the greatest of all fitnah is women the prophet says i have not left behind me a temptation a fitna more harmful to men than women and a lot of the women don't pay attention to this they say i'm free to do whatever i want i can wear whatever i want even here in saudi arabia nowadays we hear women when people talk to them and say to them cover yourself wear the hijab as instructed by allah so you don't tempt any man they shrug their shoulders and say it's the man's fault he should lower his gaze and not look if he's tempted then this is his fault and subhanallah how people's understanding and logic is twisted by shaytan why don't you come out naked and ask people to lower their gaze this is the ruling of allah that you must cover it's a ruling of allah that you may must wear hijab so if a beautiful woman enters a circle of 50 men the vast majority of these men would not lower their gaze and they would look and stare at this beautiful woman while if a handsome man enters a circle of 50 women only few would look and the rest by nature are bashful they will lower their gaze or if they're religiously committed they will do it because of the fear of allah this is how allah created men and women so hijab is an obligation in islam if you want to be productive be my guest but you have to abide by the hijab the physical hijab and the sentimental hijab okay the physical hijab we know the one we cover our bodies and maybe cover our faces as well wearing the nihab but what's the sentimental hijab i've seen a lot of women lately abiding by the hijab and some of them unfortunately even abiding by the nihab which is physically required but they don't put any boundaries to how they deal with men so i've seen them chit-chat with nan mahram and when you address them they say we're wearing the hijab i was approached in kuala lumpur by two sisters or two daughters wearing the hijab wanting to take a selfie with me excuse me i've just finished the lecture what did you learn from my lecture i want to take a selfie alone we know this is haram because this is seclusion both of us we want to take a picture of you because now it's a reason look how shaytan messes up with people's heads do they look to be practicing they look to be abiding by the hijab but this is only the outer appearance that is covered the inside is totally corrupt and tarnished and this shows you the great impact such ideology has on the whole community when you have mr dr jekyll mr hyde personality in the same individual a person who is practicing masha'allah big beard looks islamic but at the same time he has a different private life which totally goes against his beliefs and this is something that needs maybe another lecture among the facts that we have to understand for a muslim woman to be productive that the media is our worst enemy which is nowadays controlled by marinates christians by jews by atheists by secularists not definitely by muslims because rarely will find a muslim real true muslim controlling any type of media and this media is our worst enemy because it portrays a non-hijabi woman a non-practicing muslim to be educated intellectual sophisticated beautiful while a muslim woman who's righteous and practicing they portray her as  uneducated doesn't know what to say or how to act so primitive and this is a sort of brainwash that the cause of all of this is her religious commitment if she wasn't practicing if she was easy going if she attended nightclubs and mixed with men and had no issues with hijab or music or watching movies she would have been a perfect person this is what the media is doing and we all know what the media is doing now in terms of enforcing the the uh concept of lgbtq homosexuality forcing it to the children even at primary schools introducing it in all aspects of life to be the norm they are normal people they can live their normal life you have to accept them you have to promote them and endorse them if they are within your community this is what the media is doing the media is creating a virtual battle between men and women and the media insists to creating another man so women now they look and sound like women but they're actually being transformed into another man i do a lot of counseling sessions as you guys know and a lot of these counseling sessions when i sit with the men and women i usually discover that these women are not real women they have this idea of being independent though she takes everything from her husband he provides for her he gives her money shelter food but she still feels that she's independent he has no right to control me he has no right to do this to do that and the man complains he says i'd like to have a wife not a colleague living with me whenever i say something or ask for something she says you do it yourself yet she demands everything from me so this is what is being created through the media nowadays and the concept of equality is also something that we have a lot of the women and the men thinking that this is a prime concept in islam women and men are equal this is totally un-islamic this is totally wrong it's not even logical how can they be equal in islam in the quran allah says clearly and a male is not similar to a female they're different but nowadays people who don't have islamic background people who have never touched the quran or finished it in their lives let alone studied it they come and say no no islam promotes equality between the genders this is not right islam promotes and endorses justice and fairness so a woman has a role that a man cannot do and a man has roles that women cannot do if there was equality then my wife would come to me and say listen i have given you so many children next year you become pregnant i'm gonna take the year off there's no equality in this sense she cannot do the things i can do because allah created her physically and mentally different than he created me so to believe that allah is the fairest of all and the most just and whatever allah decrees is the best is the main road to success a woman is in this life a lesser degree and we have to take this as a fact allah described in the quran the husband to be the master of his wife as in surah yusuf they found her master standing at the door and a boat can only sail with one captain and an airplane can only fly with one captain two captains on board would take the plane down one says go left the other one says go right one says go up rather someone says descend it will crash when we say that a man has a higher degree this is mentioned in the quran as well but in worldly matters in matters of management in matters of guardianship but at the site of allah on the day of judgment they are all equal in the sense of being rewarded for the good deeds and being punished for their sins and bad deeds and being lower than a man's status does not mean that a man does not need her or does not consult her we all know that the prophet islam consulted um the mother of the believers in al hudaibiyah in the treaty of when he ordered their when he ordered the companions to slaughter their sacrifice and shave their heads so that they can get out of their state of haram because they were prevented from going to mecca they could not believe their eyes or ears and they refused not because they rejected the prophet's instruction they were hoping maybe something would be revealed a an improvement would take place another incident would take place when the prophet talked to um and he was angry she told him don't speak to any anyone just go out shave your head and slaughter your sacrifice and you'll see what they'll do so the prophet took her advice not saying to himself she is lower in degree than me and i'm more superior than her on the contrary so the degree is in regards of guardianship in regards of supervision and management and who is to be obeyed at the end of the day and this is why we say that a woman's place is in her home this is where she is mostly productive i know this goes against what many working women believe but this is the islamic stance a productive or a working woman can produce a machine or a device in her factory while a practicing productive muslim woman in her home would produce a whole generation from her home working is not at all prohibited for women at all it is totally permissible if the conditions are fulfilled but what is better for a woman to work outside her home leave the kids unattended or taken care by a maid whom we don't know what she does to them or what she teaches them or to be among her children teaching them various sciences and moral acts that would shape and form the way they grow up so we always often hear how can a woman be productive which is deprived of everything you extremists you fundamentalists you shaykhs say everything is haram haram haram how can she be productive when she is deprived of everything first of all this is an exaggeration we never say that everything is haram and whatever we say we don't say it from our own whims and desires and this is what i always ask my students or who come asking me for solutions do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires one hundred percent of those who i ask those questions say we would like to follow sharia no doubt unanimous answer but when you ask them in that particular problem or situation which you're asking me about are you following sharia or are you following your whims and desires this is when they start to stutter and they stumble and say oh i i don't know why because they know that they're not backed up by sharia they can't provide the evidence in the quran and sunnah that what they were doing is right so the only alternative is that they're following their whims and desires and i'll give you an example we want women to be productive good we want women to enjoy life excellent can we do this through sharia or through our whims and desires we can do this through sharia but sharia doesn't suit you here why because in order for you to be productive in your point of view and to be happy and being paid you have to free mix you have to take off your hijab you have to um you know if not break some rules bend them you have to travel without a mahram you have to be in seclusion with nan maharam it's a meeting sheikh it's a businessman what can i do we have a retreat every year for three days and we have to go to to goa and yeah we have to go to the beach with with the management here it's my job here what can i do subhanallah so are you following your whims and desires here is where the punchline is he said they can't say sharia and this is the biggest problem muslims have i have many big problems for muslims but one of the biggest problems what is that no it is the biggest problem sue me who cares the biggest problem of muslims is that they are unable to sink between islam and their lives and this is where they come to the fork of the road either i have to go right or left islam says go right others stay well my whims and desires say go left whom to follow this is what defines you as a muslim or not you see islam is a frame so islam is just a frame like this one and your life is a picture which is bigger than the frame a real muslim puts the frame on the picture which is his life and start to cut the edges that does not fit so at the end of the day he has gotten rid of so many things of his life habits hobbies desires relationships interests that do not allow islam to fit on because islam is limited now we have the frame fitting 100 percent your life you're a practicing real true muslim a brook the vast majority of muslims when they put the frame said oops um i can't get rid of these hobbies these habits these desires these sense these is that what to do the frame i have to start breaking it taking edges off it put duct tape put branches here put some wood and nail it so at the end of the day i have a frame that fits my whole life but this frame this crooked frame is not islam it's something new this is why women find it difficult to add here to sharia because it doesn't go with what they want i'd like to be a nuclear scientist okay my daughter that's good but i have to live in america for seven years and work among men and study in different universities and i don't have a father or a brother or my friend to take me there and i have to live alone and i may have to work at night to provide for myself or what do you want me to say this is for the uh betterment of the muslim society this is haram she doesn't listen she goes why because she doesn't want to follow sharia she wants to follow her whims and desires so if we can cross this problem and solve it to abide by sharia then we have no problem but who wants to follow sharia nowadays you're an athlete and your country says to you we would like you to represent our country in the olympics yeah but i'm a woman there's no problem you can wear the hijab but everybody's going to look at me no problem just to compete maybe they will tell you you have to compete against an israeli woman there are enemies no problem it's for the spirit of sports what is left of islam they have taken everything away from us so no hijab no fear of allah and i'm competing against an enemy of islam who took forcefully from us muslims kicked our muslim brothers and sisters from their homes occupied them terrorized them oppressed them and i shake hands with them and i compete with them and i have a selfie with them what is left of islam this is why the biggest problem is how to get aligned synchronized between islam and what islam wants from us between islam and what our lives are all about once we manage to do this then we are in good hands so how can a woman be productive when she's deprived of everything a woman is not deprived of everything that's a big lie and we have to stand up and say that this is a lie so a woman is either married or unmarried if she is unmarried may allah will make her married may allah sent a righteous practicing rich handsome knowledgeable kind husband to her as soon as possible but meanwhile her greatest responsibility is to take care of her parents so she is productive once she takes care of her parents and does her utmost ability to improve her society and community within what is accepted in sharia and in norms an unmarried woman can teach can't preach can work in relief efforts can work in dawa providing that she does all of this away from men so she can teach her siblings her cousins her nephews and nieces her uh the children around her or her woman folk i shamelessly pleased with her the mother of the believers and all the mothers of the believers and the wives of the prophet did not teach men never had a halaqa in the masjid they limited the teachings and preachings to women and they managed to have a lot of women tabbing learn from them and convey this knowledge to their husbands and their mahrams etc nowadays unfortunately we see lots of women dies or scholars as they like to call them and the sister doesn't cover her face half of her arm is showing and she is addressing men and women on videos on youtube and sometimes sharing the same table and platform and stage with non-mahram men and i'm shocked when i see famous dairies sitting with a famous woman there and they're talking about islamic issues wow that's great then what's next and they crack jokes and yeah allah is so brotherly and sisterly yeah i need masha allah masha allah what a beautiful religion hey what are you guys doing is this halal in your religion come on don't be extreme you're an old grandpa you don't understand we don't have these emotions oh incarcerated what do you mean by you don't have emotions you're a man and she's a woman and the worst thing is not that you're a man and she's a woman the worst thing is that the people looking at you saying okay if she saw and so is okay with that then it's okay for me to sit with my female cousins and with my sisters-in-law and we're like them and this is where dr jekyll mr hyde comes into reality a productive unmarried woman can be productive in her community i know sisters that have circles of the quran with 40 and 50 other women four or five times a week she has classes in hapida exclusively for women not even recorded no one can hear it only those who attend they have classes in and some of them even called me i have students that i've never seen in my life they call me and for so many years i've been teaching them on the phone with strict adherence to the sharia not even how are you this is haram we we we don't do this what's the ruling and so and so i explain she takes it and teaches it to others this is how the prophet used to do allah not what we see nowadays so an unmarried productive woman can do wonders providing she exclusively does this with those who are women like her as for the married woman her greatest role and job description is to take care of her her house her husband and her children and if she manages to do this alone she will get the highest levels in general imagine mother khadija how many hadith did she report none or maybe one or two mother khadijah how many classes did she conducted to other women we don't know of any yet she is one of the four highest degree and uh levels of women of jannah she is the mistress of the women of jannah why very simple she took care of her husband and her children the prophet isaiah told us that gabriel gave her the glad tiding of a house in general made of a pearl that has no hardship and no loud noise this is what she gave to the prophet in dunya whenever he came home he would not work at all and he would not hear noises and shouting and nagging and bickering at all it was a safe haven for him she raised his children for beautiful women and look at one of them who was fatima and fatima also is one of the four mistresses of jannah which shows you that if you take care of your husband and your family you'll be in their level on the day of judgment a woman who's married is not ordered to go and make jihad she's not ordered to go and uh in the markets and say things and do things the prophet said that if she praise her fast protects her chastity and obeys her husband she will enter the jannah from whatever gate she wants only four things we men we have so many things on our bucket list that we have to fulfill otherwise life is difficult and a married woman can do wonders in producing a generation it is the most difficult task and job we men think that you're sitting home doing nothing with the kids while i'm working and i'm suffering with my bosses and colleagues and people on the road break uh cut cut on me while driving and we're shouting and fighting and the tenants not paying the rent and the landlord wants his rent people who i borrowed from are following me people are cheating me in the market you have nothing that's a big lie and a big misrepresent representation of the truth i as a man cannot stay with one of my children for more than an hour or two and then i lose my sanity i cannot carry a child for more than 10 minutes and then my strong biceps get wet and tired she does this 14 hours a day but we don't seem to notice this if a woman dedicates her life to her house and children she will make a generation that would become unbeatable look what a shafiri's mother did to him all great scholars of islam the sole person who brought them up islamically financed them took care of them was their mother most of them were orphans it's the mother that is the one who takes care of her children and she manages to make them real practicing muslims or actors and singers and people of no use at all when she sits home with her children making them memorize al-fatihah teaching them the pillars of islam saying to them how to read surat al-mukh i know women who used to spend half an hour or an hour before bed every single night reciting to her children until they memorized it by her recitation they memorized ayatul kursiy when they're three years of age you ask them what are the pillars of islam the child says at a very young age only a mother can do this and this is the most productive thing she can do in her life then what is the problem sheikh [Music] the problem is that shaytan messes up things confuses women plays with their minds and with men of course but we're focusing on women they have to know their obligations before they demand their rights first of all do what you have to do towards your community towards your children towards your parents swears towards your husband these are your obligations you must fulfill them then you may ask for your rights there are so many things that i think have exceeded the time way beyond the allocated time and apologize so i i in short a woman can be productive exactly as a man once she acknowledges and knows the field she has to uh perform in and she can do wonders if she applies sharia if she applies the quran the sunnah with understanding of the three favorite generations so that islam becomes the guide and the beacon to everyone in the household and this is the easiest way of solving problems when people come to me for consultation for marriage disputes etc when they're practicing it's done in 5-10 minutes no problems no no dispute they're not gonna divorce anymore because they immediately acknowledge and and recognize the fault all what i do is open their eyes i don't do anything else i just say okay this is wrong according to islam this is right according to islam and it's done when a muslim woman manages to plant this in her home where everybody acknowledges that we only abide by the quran by the sunnah and the man is respected as the main pillar of the house as the backbone of the house and the wife is the guardian and the truthful honest protector of the household from inside and all what they consume is money no hara money this is what qualifies to be a real true muslim house that would not have been established if there was no productive muslim woman taking care of it and allah azza knows best was allah foreign"
