  "transcript": "finally johar says in the subcontinent the bro a certain sect call themselves in this case can we call ourselves a hadith or salafis to differentiate ourselves from them and to let people know about our our correct apida there's no need for that i don't go around and say listen i am salafi i am ali hadis i am wahhabi i am this or if there is anything as wahabi i just go on about saying i'm a muslim and when i speak my quran my sunnah my behavior indicates what kind of a muslim i am flags and labeling doesn't add anything to you it does not truly make you or break you so we have to refrain from this unless it is at most necessity so what are you shaykh i'm a muslim what kind of a muslim what do you mean what kind of a sunni what do you mean you know there are different sects i'm from sunnah i follow the quran of the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations this is sufficient for anyone to be identifiable without saying salafi without saying this or that and allah knows best"
