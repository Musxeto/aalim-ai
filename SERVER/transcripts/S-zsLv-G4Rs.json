  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (6) - Things that angered him - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "wasallam was the perfect human being without any doubt and part of being a human being is that you are pleased but sometimes you are angered so it is not true that in order to be a perfect human being that you should not be angry a person without anger can't be a human being he's a wimp someone attacks your wife or your sister and you don't become angry he said it's all fine it's all fine I'll be patient no you're not a real man there are times that you must become angry yet we all know it's part of Islam that one must suppress his anger the prophet salallahu was approached once by a man and His companion asked him give me advice the prophet said do not become angry the man said okay give me more the prophet said do not become angry the man said okay give me more the prophet kept on repeating do not become angry do not become angry do not become angry this shows you that anger is something that Islam orders you to suppress however anger can be suppressed and you recommend it to suppress it but in some cases you have to show your anger you have to express it when is it preferred and when it is abhorred it is abhorred when it's forwardly matters someone parks in front of your home and you become angry and Furious I know of this person who when someone parked in front of his house he came with a baseball bat smashing all the windows of the car the guy just parked there for 10 minutes to pray in the message and come back not violating your rights and this is not your right this is not your god-given right this is not your parking this is a public area it's a road but some people are mentally challenged so such rage when it's for your own safety of for your own self someone insulted you someone said uh criticized you you become angry and you make a an issue out of it this is abhorred in Islam but when this anger is in the sake or in the sight of Allah for the sake of Allah when you see sins being committed when you see things that go against Allah's commands and the prophet and you become angry because of that this is something that is recommended and you're rewarded for it now is the perfect human being what were the incidents that were reported to us that he was angry because there are so many incidents one of us would have exploded in Rage yet the prophet saws kept his calm and cool and he did not react negatively and this is what is meant by do not become angry meaning do not do things that you would regret due to your anger these things are impulsive you just divorce your wife is angry she said you're not a man you're divorced and then five seconds later what I've done and he keeps on knocking on Scholars doors Sheikh did the divorce take place or not can you find us a loop hole here or there and this is what the prophet prohibited the consequences of such anger not that you do not become angry because you're a human being you have to so what are the incidents that the prophet became angry in there are a number of which we must study to learn and acquire knowledge and whenever we are placed in the same situation we can analyze should we become angry like the prophet was I assume or should we look the other side and pretend that we did not see anything so we will mention some and not all because we don't have enough time for example the prophet Allah got angry with his companions disputed and argued over things that are Beyond dispute and argument such as such as the Quran now we know that the Quran was revealed in seven ahrof whether you die you translate it as dialects as Styles as whatever these are the seventh that everybody agrees upon and the authentic hadiths in the sahih confirm it so we embrace that the Quran was revealed in seven ahrov and we embrace the fact that there are 10 recitations which are well known to the scholars now to go into the details we don't need this we're believers we believe that we are created from clay from mud from Earth from soil to go into details and start to analyze and to go back to the labs and this is not necessary or not needed because we believe so the prophet salallahu once heard the voices of two men disputing over one Ayah the companion said that the prophet came out of his house with anger visible on his face and he said to them in a scolding fashion those before you were destroyed because they differed in their scriptures reported by Imam Muslim in the sahih so we as Muslims believe that the Quran confirms itself and if there is something that we cannot understand we attribute this to our own understanding and that we don't have the ability to understand it and we go back to the scholars and we say that Allah and the prophet is no best not that we start to doubt the Quran or the or the preservation of the and if you look nowadays at contemporary times especially on social media you find what is called in the haditha the silly man someone without any importance in Islam you'll find Giants who were made to look like midgets and midgets who were inflated to look like Giants and they speak left right and Center about Islam and about things that are pillars of Islam like the Quran and they cast doubts in people's minds not because they're Hypocrites inshallah they're not but because they want to flex their muscles I know you don't know I have higher degrees I am an academic I am this I am that and they start spreading doubts among the people about the Layman and then they apologize you don't have to do this you don't have to search in the books of History historians and of the scholars to get something that people don't know of or have never heard of and exaggerated and inflated and show it to the public as if you've found Antarctica or Atlantis or whatever was lost all right Antarctica I think they they now have it this is big problem just to show off and look at me I know what others don't know and you confuse them laymen and you confuse the Muslims and you cast doubts and you allow the disbelievers to speak ill about the Quran do you think if this happened at the time of the Prophet Allah he would be pleased with it or he would be angered by it Allah he would be angered by it also the prophet Allah used to sometimes make Dua when angry and this is very very very rare and if I say that it's only three or four incidents in his whole lifetime I wouldn't be exaggerating but when you come to it as a individual incident a separate incident you may read it and say subhanallah how is it possible for example two men once came to the prophet Allah and they said something to him which made him angry mother Aisha said I did not hear it and the prophet was outraged by what they said so he cursed them and he said bad words to them and they left mother Aisha came frightened and terrified o prophet of Allah if there anyone who's a great loser it's these two men so the prophet said why is that she said you cursed them and said bad things to them definitely they will be cursed by Allah the prophet smiled that Isha didn't you know what I made the condition to my Lord I said to Allah azzawajal oh Allah I am a human being meaning that I'm not perfect so whomever among the Muslims that I may curse or say bad things to oh Allah make my curse to be a form of purification and a great reward to them which means that this curse is not a curse actually it's Dua of mercy and great reward for them and this is exactly what happened also with um the mother of anas you know the servant of the Prophet his mother's name is um had a young orphan girl raised in her house and this orphan once came to the prophet Allah and the prophet saw her and he was Amazed by how fast she grew so he said to her oh you oh you you have grown may Allah stop you from growing so the girl went terrified to the prophet saws crying saying the prophet made Dua that I may not grow I will not grow the young girl was frightened and she had all the right to be frightened so um rushed to the prophet assalam and said to her o prophet of Allah you made Dua against my orphaned girl and he said what is that um said she claims that you said that may you never grow up and that you never you stay as you are so the prophet laughed don't you know I had the condition with my Lord that I am a human being I am happy and pleased like anyone else is happy and pleased and I also get angry like anyone else get angry as a human being so o Allah whomever I make Dua against from my ummah that he is not worthy of it oh Allah make it a purification and a a cleansing and a good deed that he would get closer buy it from you on the day of judgment so this clearly indicates that the prophet saws acknowledged his human nature but due to that he was the mercy sent to mankind he asked Allah azzawajal to add more to that Mercy by even when he curses those who are not worthy of being cursed or say bad things to them that Allah switches it and flips it to be something positive it's for their sake and for their own goodness and this is as I said only two or three and maybe four incidents that are known throughout all of his life that he had cursed those who are not worthy of being cursed of course transforming it into mercy and cleansing and purification does not fall for those who deserve it like those who deal in riba like those who fornicate like those who deal in bribery and and steal people's money no when the prophet Islam curses them they're cursed for what they had done what other incidents a prophet got angry may Allah be pleased with him said a man came to the prophet salallahu and explained himself he said o prophet of Allah when the Fajr prayer is established I tend to delay it so the iqama is called I tend to come a little bit slow and waste some time because the Imam prolongs the Salat too much yeah neither guy is like praying for 25 minutes half an hour and that is a lot and we can't take this because it's too long the prophets with them says I've never seen him angry more than that incident he was outraged and he said o people among you there are those who are specialized in making people repel from Islam there are those among you when they speak they make you hate Islam and this is a serious offense be careful you and I could be one of those when we give dawah are we mindful of the impact of what we're saying and doing I'm talking about the majority not about a single specific ignorant imbecile who know even if you read an eye of the Quran he would be repelled by it no this guy is trash we don't care about him I'm talking about the impact of your dawa of your actions of what you say on the majority of the people are they benefiting go ahead keep up keep it up are they repelled because you're selecting things that people don't know and highlighting it and they say Islam can't be like this I'm reserved no you caused this so the prophet was angry and he said among you there are those who make people repel from Islam when you lead others make it short and concise because behind you there might be praying the weak the elderly those who have errands they want to go and fulfill likewise the prophet saws whenever he was attacked for his his own self he would probably forgive but when the attack was towards Sharia towards religion Quran or Sunnah this is not a time to be diplomatic and play it cool no you have to show your resentment to what is being said as a form of Defense of Islam you this is not a place to be diplomatic they are attacking Islam insulting the prophet saws insulting the religion and he's saying yeah it's an issue of dispute I know where you're coming from no you don't you have to show your anger if you're a true Muslim and the hell with everybody else who cares so once the prophet was Distributing the booties of war and giving to the Muslims but he is the messenger of Allah so he knows that some certain certain people segments of people deserve more like for example the dignitaries of quraish who just accepted Islam they were enemies of Islam but because they were dignitaries of quraish the Prophet gave them a hundred camels each so that they would love Islam and get stronger in Islam and those behind them would follow them while the ansar the close beloved Companions of Medina the prophet did not give them anything so some of the hypocrites thought that this was unfair not knowing the wisdom behind it so they wanted to question the prophet is one of them even went further by objecting and said this is a division Allah's face was not sought after now who are you accusing the divider who's the divider the prophet of Allah are you saying that the prophets division is not fair and he is not seeking Allah's face by it this is blasphemous so the prophet Allah got outrage when he was told of this statement but then he calmed down and he said may Allah have mercy on my brother Musa peace be upon him he was abused insulted and harmed with things that were far greater than this yet he was tolerant and patient so it shows you that the anger of the Prophet is not for himself rather it's for the religion also the prophet Allah once came to the Masjid and on the wall of the Masjid he saw as putum you know when someone collects from his chest and from his throat and spits it out it's visible in its you know repulsive so the prophet saw this and he was angry and his face became red and this was a sign of his anger whenever the prophet got angry his face would become red and he would never avenge for his own self never it would only be for the religion of Allah and this is an insult to the religion of Allah when you spit it in the direction of the Qibla when you're praying in the wall of the Masjid the Masjid is supposed to be purified and cleaned so he was angered by that by it a woman from the ansar saw his anger went straight to it rubbed it out scratched it out until it was removed from the wall and then brought perfume and placed it on its spot so now the wall has been perfumed of the Masjid and the prophet said how good this is that's a very good thing she did praising it and showing the Muslims when to be angry when the Masjid is being made filthy dirty disrespected and when to be happy and pleased when it's perfumed it's cleaned it's been taken care of a three quick incidents because our time is up and we don't want to hold the callers from their questions came to the prophet that Islam with two garments died in saffron and the prophet had prohibited the Muslims from wearing clothes died in Saffron not yellow yellow is a color but saffron is a herb and dying your clothes with it which gives it a scent it gives it a color is imitating the disbelievers and the idol worshipers so the prophet prohibited this came to the prophet wearing it the prophet was outraged and you can see it in his face and he said to him did your mother order you to do this you're saying this to a grown-up man so he knew that the prophet was scolding him so he said oh prophet of Allah should I wash them and remove the saffron from them the prophet said no burn them and this is his punishment for defying the prophet's instructions in another incident the prophet saw one of his companions wearing a golden ring and everyone knows that it's prohibited for men to wear anything that has gold in it whether it's a ring cufflings a watch a pen a a chain holder or a key holder so the prophet got angry and you can see it in his face went straight to the man snatched the ring from his finger and tossed it away and he said why would any one of you take a fire of stone and place it in his hand and finally the prophet was outraged when Bilal came to him once and said o prophet of Allah I had a heated argument with one of the great Companions and the first to migrate and in the heated argument he was so angry he said to me you are a son of a black woman so he is insulting him that his mother is black this is racists in Islam we don't tolerate any such racism so he went and complained to the Prophet sallallahu alaihi The Prophet was angry and he summoned Abu dhar and when Abu dhar came and he said to him you are a man of ignorance of pre-islamic era for saying this to this companion of mine do you say to him and insult him by the color of his mother Abu dhar came back to his senses went to uh to Bilal placed his cheek on the sand and said to him o son of the black woman place your foot on my other cheek while he was on the ground as a sign of humility that you're placing your foot on my face and Bilal said my brother stand up may Allah forgive you these are some of the incidents where the Prophet is expressed and portrayed his anger not for himself rather for the religion of Allah in the defense of Allah governed and controlled by the Sharia of Allah because I don't want people to come and say okay I want to become angry like the prophet salaam for the sake of Allah in the cause of Allah let's burn a house let's break a a property let's turn uh let's attack the authorities no this is not what the prophet did at racism this is not what Islam promotes or endorses being angry is controlled by Sharia and not by the calls of hooligans and thugs like we find in some Muslim countries all of a sudden demonstrations and uh protests and burning of of property and destruction this is not part of Islam and this is definitely not part of the Sunnah of the prophet"
