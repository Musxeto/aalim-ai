  "title": "Ruling on 2 nafl rakahs with all prayers except Asr, 4 with Isha and awwabeen prayer-Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "uh maliha says here in uh pakistan we're taught to offer two nfl with each prayer except for asar for aisha prayers people usually offer four nafl that is voluntary prayers what is the ruling of islam as most people consider them as much obligatory as fart prayers well first of all i have to raise my hat if i had one on my head this i cannot trace but i raised my hat to the people of india and pakistan for upbringing their children to abide by the voluntary prayers i am always mesmerized always shocked when i see 13 or 14 year old kids offering so many rakaas before and after the prayer and they observe it religiously not just something that it's a habit they believe that it's a whole thing but my only problem is that not all of it is authentic though i appreciate how they brought up their children to appreciate salat and to observe it like that yet i would whisper in their ears to follow the sunnah and not to confuse fart with nafil meaning the 17 rakah we pray it at risha if you miss two raka's then the whole isha is invalid as so many people write to me and this is totally baseless asia is for raka's if you live and die praying only for raka's of risha nothing else before it or after it insha allah you will be in paradise what level this is up to allah azza but no one can come and say two sunnahs after isha is mandatory no it's not the man who came to the prophet and he told him tell me about the religion of allah and the prophet told him about the prayers he said that there are five prayers that allah had obligated upon you and the man said anything else the prophet said al islam no unless you would like to add extra meaning voluntary prayers so the man said by the one who sent you i will not add a single thing to what you have just said so he committed himself to praying only the five fart two of fajr four of zuhrasar and isha and three of mahrim the prophet said whoever wants to see a man of the residents of jannah let him look at this man and in a narration that he has prospered if he commits to what he had said so this means that thinking that voluntary prayers are mandatory is totally out of the question now having said that we know that there are 12 raka's according to hadith of um habib may allah be pleased and others during the day and night to be prayed with the fart prayers and these are highly recommended sunnah it's known as two before fajr four before lohur two after the two after maghrib and two after asia twelve raka's if you'd like to add a little bit more you can add two raka's in addition to the two raka's after the so you pray four before it and four after it and if you add a little bit more you can pray four raka's before asir after the adhan before the kama of asir you can pray two two raka's these are four that is it what about the four raka's before isha this is baseless the rak has before between maghrib and isha the four of awabin baseless all the hadiths are not authentic so if you want to add more this is up to you but to say you have to pray two raka's here or two raka's there and it's a must or it's a sunnah without evidence from the the sunnah of the prophet you and i how can we invent such things it's impossible this is what scholars categorize as innovation so either follow the sunnah of the prophet hashem or don't add anything to what is mandated upon you so i hope uh this answers your question"
