  "transcript": "there is a question that my husband divor me many times and did rer but now I'm confused about uh is my marital relation is staying now or not so okay first of all issues of divorce cannot be answered in such a fashion so when a woman says my husband divorced me so many times so these divorces are valid or not how would I know this is something that needs a meeting with the husband with the wife with the Muti so it's highly advisable that you go to the Islamic Court in your country and ask them second of all issues of divorce are not done through a woman ask so she my husband divorced me and he was very angry but he wasn't in his sanity I don't answer such questions it's your husband who has to come to me because in so many times the woman says something so that the divorce would not happen and there is a conflict of interest and that's why it's the husband who has to come and said Sheik I regretfully divorced my wife I would ask him what are the circumstances what is this what is that and then we can say that the divorce is valid or not valid Etc therefore we have to be really careful these issues of divorce they're not a game it's not like I've I've seen people I had counseling sessions with people a man divorced his wife in the duration of the past 3 years 20 times and the woman says he says though I asked a mu then I asked a then I wasn't intending it or I said it by mistaken and she accepts it and sits with him she's living in Zena this is not a marriage he divorced her 20 times oh Sheik but he said he asked someone who did he ask you can't take his word for for in that you have to go and tell your father to go with him and ask the Sheikh to verify or at least you listen to the Sheikh with him and to see if the Sheikh is reliable or he's a Sheikh that doesn't know doesn't have knowledge so these are issues that separate Halal as in marital relationship from Haram as in Zena Muhammad from Pak"
