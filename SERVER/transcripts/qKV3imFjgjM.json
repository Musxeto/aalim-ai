  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] milah Haram and r-rahim wa salatu was-salam ala rasulillah Kadeem welcome back to another episode of life's adornments handle and this series will be discussing child rearing its benefits its difficulties its trousers relations but most importantly how are we to rear our children to raise our children in a way that is according to the Koran and in the authentic tradition of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam as well as Vanuatu I said in the Quran al Maleh well Ben noon Xena - hiya T dunya was originally NASA hwacha meaning necessary Lebanon so we love children they are joyous we are excited to have them but we must give them their rights according to the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu wasallam not to help us with these matters we have awesome Luqman Hakeem who's a teacher at that Academy in the teacher at KIU and he has been an imam and a teacher and a daddy for over 30 years what in the hell hamd without further ado we give you a set of Monaco Hunter lubricate Wadi come salawatullahi wa barakaatuh thank you so much for joining us today shift vehicle okay for having me sure so let's jump directly into the matter okay my children are born many things that caused some doubts or a check is whether or not they should be vaccinated now particularly in the West we have some theories that the government is out to get you know the people and some of this proven some of it I'm substantiate it that they put sicknesses within the medicine things of nature so some people were afraid from it is there any Islamic material Islamic presidents and in these sort of issues she let her behind eloheem and hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen why should I later hail Allah who I had the hula Cheri Keller ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajmain am i back what you've said brother Yousef is totally true a lot of the people believe in the conspiracy theory so everything around them is conspiring to get them any Islam we have a legal maxim or a rule which says that certainty is not removed by doubts what is certain is what the medical environment the medical circles tell us if I have a problem with my engine I'll take it to a mechanic if I have a problem with my CVR or TV I'll take it to an electrician who knows an electronics so we have to give each person what he's good at we can't be jack-of-all-trades so we give fatwa in Islam we do fata way mechanics we get Fatima in engineering we do fatwa in politics and every single aspect of life when we are not qualified to do this so hearsay is a big problem I get tons of material saying that your toothpaste has pork has dogs in it what are you talking about they say that even your soft drinks is made of pork your shoes are made of Port your car is made of what is this it's pork power we don't have these things it has to be authenticated it has to be proven without doubt in a in a sense that we have to have evidences that would stand and stick in a court of law it's not permissible just to say oh sure we have a halal institution and by the way this is a big business nowadays in the West and in Malaysia you get institutions a company I've met some of them who start a business so they go from one company to the other it's a marketing strategy they come to you and say okay we're a halal labeling company so if you advertise with us or if you allow us to look into your products and pay a small premium we will put your name in a booklet stating that we've checked your stuff in your Hellas and if we don't if I don't pay well we don't include you so it's a business nowadays they're so powerful that they can run businesses out of the business because simply they say it's not Helen and this is a an issue of credibility if they don't fear Allah so L if they don't have people who are qualified to know what is halal and what is Haram if people are not knowledgeable in Sharia they don't have a Sharia board then we have a big problem so it's a business we do not believe these people because they're commercially oriented in terms of vaccinations there is a theory as you have mentioned earlier but the vast majority of the whole world does not believe in that so should I take the minority or stick with the majority no I would stick with the majority so all my children were vaccinated throughout their life according to the Ministry of Health because I believe that the Ministry of Health is run by Muslims by professionals and if there is any room to doubt they should tell me not the other way around so there's no problem in taking these vaccinations and it is part of seeking Allah's guidance so it's not sufficient just to say I trust Allah it is an essential part of your Eman to trust rely and depend on Allah but part of it is that you take the necessary means so someone says mmm it's sufficient to trust Allah soldier ok throw yourself from a high-rise er interest Allah if Allah wills it you'll land on your feet and you walk unharmed but if tough luck nobody that says this because if you do throw yourself you go straight to hell so likewise trusting Allah is done by taking the necessary means a man came to the prophet a sorceress and said o prophet of Allah I left my camel outside of the Masjid should I trust Allah and leave it or should I tie the rope that holds the camel to a ring so that it would not run away so the Prophet said Isis and trust Allah and tied the rope they're inseparable there they go side by side you can't say no I trust Allah Azza WA JAL I'm just let letting the horse or the camel loose it will run away and you cannot tie the catalogue or the horse and say I'm not depending on Allah I'm depending on the knot that I have tied it this is shirk so you have to have them side by side okay you mentioned the firm any of the halal companies that they aren't to be trusted because they are commercially commercially focused well big pharmaceutical companies many times their business oriented so the bottom line is to fulfill our capital or to sell this amount of product so in this event there's the same ruling apply to both situations when somebody's not really or centered focused on the health and the well-being of the community or at large or the nation at large but rather fulfilling quota there is a big difference between both companies the halal labeling companies I did not say we cannot trust them I said that we cannot rely on what they give us as verdicts because sometimes and this happened in Saudi Arabia you get fish coming from countries saying halal excuse me this means that you're abusing the word halal the first and you don't know what it means there's no no no we meant that it is eatable so you don't say hell I just said yeah what is this so I don't say that we don't trust them by default we trust everyone but I can't trust their word that this is not halal until proven to me with pharmaceutical companies it's a different issue because the pharmaceutical companies they produce medications and the FDA approves of that the ministries of Health approve of that so they scrutinize their products the medical circles write papers on these medications so from there I can get a point of view of professionals not from the first pharmaceutical company rather through the municipal information the FDA in the states the medical circles and research papers on such issues from that I can tell whether it's okay or not okay sometimes it is so famous and public like in the opioid issue that you don't need a second opinion it's so obvious to you that this is not a good thing okay well in this mind discussion what about healing what are the ways to heal a child when they're coming up we have certain stun and black seed honey is mentioned and things of this nature what are some ways that we can go about healing do we have time because this is a long a topic myself maybe we can begin in him okay so generally speaking healing is advised it is the Prophet who said erase or some today or a bad Allah seek medication and healing o servants of Allah and he himself used to take medications when he got sick mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her long we know that he died when she was 18 years of age so later on in life over the span of like 40 years or so people would come to her and ask her for advice whether they were sick or no and she would prescribe to them herbs and plants and medication and they say subhanallah mother I said what did you get this information from she said that the Prophet used to get sick early so that for Salam and the nomads and the Arabs used to come with their recipes and herbs and medication and I used to learn from that so it does not defy your toach all your trust and dependence on a larger - sake medic to seek medication how is this to be taken care of there's a process but I don't think we have enough time to elaborate on it yes this is a good introduction it's all about the ila but we're gonna pause here and come back with some specifics about how the price alone was it how we learned from healing things from Emersonian and even from the Quran is watch Allah Tala that would be our next discussion when we come back viewer stay tuned - Allah - either for our episode of life's adornments until you get back as-salaam alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh [Music] assalamualaikum warahmatullahi briquetting welcome back to another episode of life's adornments this is our second segment and we left off talking about healing ham leader the sheikh gave a beautiful introduction but like right now we would like to go into the details where were some specific things that prophesy assalam used to do that we learn from the Sunnah that we learned from the Quran and how should we go about continuing this beautiful tradition shape okay first of all the scholars say that there are three types of healing something that is religious and the religious aspects of healing is also divided into two types so it's three one of them is divided into two the first one is the Islamic healing process and this is divided into two types something that is totally spiritual and something that is physical the spiritual part is known as rope here what is Rukia Rukia is a number of verses of the Quran or the prophetic sayings or supplications in Arabic that has a good meaning this is done to seek Allah's help in curing our ill whether possessed by jinn affected by black magic or envy or evil eye and whether it is physically impacting the patient or mentally so any type of illness the first thing to do is to offer rope here and this is a continuous process not one shot in a lifetime rather you do this a number of times per day I have an illness in my knee I recite rakia on it like ten times the during the day and the night and different ways and means of doing it this particular Rukia is different than duaa for example we're talking about raising children in Islam part of raising the children of Islam in Islam is to make a lot of duaa so the Prophet himself is awesome used to say a specific door for al-hasan and al-husayn his grandchildren his grandsons and he used to say Orido kuma Bukhari Mattila hit Tam min kulli shayyin in wa ham woman I mean lamb which translates to I seek Allah's protection and refuge for you from every devil and poisonous a reptile or insect and from every evil affecting I and he used to say to them when they were young that this is what your grandfather Prophet Ibrahim peace be upon him used to say to his sons is Marianas help so we have this dua also there is a dua of protection which the which we say part of our evening and morning as car so many people come to me Sheikh share how do I protect my children from evil eye from this from that should I recite ayatul kursi should I put my hand or the over their heads should I wipe their bodies should I Spit on them dry spitting or any a part of I said no part of the protection process is to say adora it will take us a lot of time to translate but it's found on in national Muslim or the fortress of the Muslim in the earth car aheh carry map a year why Bela Sahib all books are worth car so the Prophet used to say every morning and evening along in ESL car theatre for dunya will occur a lot of mania for a fee fee Deenie word only i what i li my family were maddie this dua is seeking Allah's protection in my religion in my life in my family which includes my children and in my wealth this door is a door of protection this is different than Rukia because Rukia is for healing you don't take aspirin when you don't have a headache you take it when you have an illness likewise Rukia is not sad as a form of protection but rather as a form of healing so the rakia from the Quran ayatul kursi is one of the greatest rakia the best of all types of Rukia is al-fatiha if you recite al-fatiha it's one of his nicknames is a Shaffir the healer so it cures a lot of illnesses when you say it with conviction and when you believe this is part of the spiritual type of healing there are numbers of rakia when you visit as someone who's sick you see as a lot of Aleen rubble optionally manned yes react a lot of bananas at Hill baths for sure auntie shura philosopher Elisha Farouk she finally overdose a coma all of this is Rukia now when my child gets sick or it develops a fever the first thing I do is not give the child medication rather do rakia immediately afterwards give the child medication or take the child to the emergency room or take the child to a doctor not delaying the rocket to be the last thing because it is the origin it has the priority this is part one of the first type of healing part two is the physical things which also comes from Islam so the Prophet told us a lot was sent to seek healing through three things either a drink of honey and honey is mentioned in the Quran to be a source of healing so honey is very positive honey is very good number two is utilization I think they call it but maybe a misspelling a Mis saying it utilization is to bring an iron heat it and then put it on different parts of the body it burns it this kind of bird burning is also found in surgical procedures they use laser to do it this is part of the healing and thirdly copying so cupping which is slashing with a blade the back of the neck or the shoulders and then sucking portions of the blood there through machines of course before it was done by the mouth or by vacuuming a glass or a cup and putting it this takes the rotten blood which is at the back of the neck or the shoulders and it subhanAllah he leaves the person from migraines from blood pressure from a fatigue it's it's something that the Prophet himself did Isis also there is the black seed which the Prophet hasn't told us that it is a cure of all types of disease except aging but this differs how to consume it because the Prophet did not give us how to take it and what portions so it is a cure but it depends on the professional who knows how to use it and utilize it so in a sense these are part of the first type of healing in Islam which the Quran or the Sunnah have directed us to do the second type of healing in generally as a scholars say which is proven by science so the doctor says you have an infection you have to take antibiotics 1000 milligrams of XYZ so I look in the Quran I look in the Sunnah there's nothing nothing prescribed for such an illness or antibiotics so I'm refraining no you should not refrain the doctors the professionals said that this cures so say bismillah and take it the doctor says we have to perform a surgical procedure to save your life or to extract something that is harmful for you I don't see anything but I trust the doctors because out of their experience it is proven to be true and scientific so this is dependent on science and Islam does not at all go against science and this is what differentiates Islam from other religions which took a negative standpoint of science and we know what happened in medievals and the executions and the Inquisition's etc Islam support science 100% but the priorities for Islam because through time it was proven that so many times scientific theories that opposes Islam in few decades they reverse and say oops sorry we were wrong Islam is right so we do not dependent or rely on their scientific theories because Islam is what prevails over all one and two scholars say there is a third form of healing and this is not scientific at all do you mean they say those who wear rings and they think that the stone depending on the type and kind of it either increases your libido it increases your strength it brings you wealth it does this or that for you this is those who adapt means of healing that scientists say whoa this is not proven what are you doing and they are convinced that it cures them this is not prohibited for example in the past they had this copper bracelet and lots of middle-aged men used to wear it and we ask him what is this is all subhanAllah I had this for a couple of weeks and it relieved me from my rheumatism from my joint pain and backache etc we go to medical professionals what do you think of this they say this is bogus this is unproven and it has no basis to it using these things is shik minor shik because Allah did not put healing in it and the scientists say that is there's no healing in it so believing in something that heals which is not proven is minor Shaikh if you believe it heals by itself not by Allah as powers this is major shirk and they have these discs energy discs and so many different things that they're coming up the things that take away the negative power or energy in the cosmic energy and all of this is what science fiction it's not proven scientifically it's not there in the Quran and the Sunnah so it's all part of their whims and desires and they are making billions of dollars out of this yeah this is something very deep topic something too dense to I guess cover on one episode but in terms of if a subject has something this because it isn't scientifically proven you're saying that is - shirt correct how was the connection between the connection is that if you believe in something that it cures and it's neither proven from the Quran and Sunnah nor through the practice of medical professionals then this belief of yours becomes minor like someone wearing a Tau is at a visa an amulet and he says that tying a red string cured me from my headaches okay okay let's go to the Quran Sunnah there's nothing like that let's go to the doctors and scientists it this is baseless so what remains is that your belief of this string having the ability to kill you from your headache becomes a minor ship if you believe that it is by itself curing you and not a lot so this is major shirk takes you out of the fold of Islam okay thank you for sharing that shake this is gonna be the last I guess topic for today but viewers stay tuned we're going to continue thank you for your immense wisdom as always we're going to continue with our episode of life's a dormant viewer stay tuned for the next episode we hope that you are benefiting from the information that is giving here until next time assalamualaikum
