  "transcript": "perfect with no FL at all are the laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of way of all prais is due to Allah oh Allah send you blessings and exal Dimension and Grant peace to the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam his companions his wives and all those who follow them on the righteous path until the day of judgment brothers and sisters welcome to a new episode and a continuation on the topic of marriage uh which has become a conflict in some cases because of some disagreement amongst the the parents who may have a particular way or mode or a Viewpoint and then the youth who may agree with many things we have said yet they they find that it it's not materializing in real life what are some of the reasons this issue continues to be a problem among the problems and obstacles facing those who want to marry or it can be external it can be self-imposed MH usually a lot of the youngsters delay marriage because of the qualities found in a spouse so they put a long list of conditions she has to look she has to feel she has to smell lots of qualities and characteristics that can only be in the in Paradise this is what usually happens so whenever the mother comes and says son I have this girl she comes from a very good family says how is her hair she says it's a said no I want it to be so and so how is her skin is sheir or yes and he keeps on thinking of formulating something like what he sees in the media so it's becoming stereotyping 100 years ago a man from Indonesia thought only a similar woman from Denia would be his dream girl a man from the jungles of Africa could never consider a white woman as beautiful a man from Norway would never think of a Bernett to be beautiful now with the media and with the stereotyping in the minds of the people they have changed their standards of beauty and this is extremely difficult and that is why I know this in my country boys wanting to get married and they get like 50 60 proposals and this is no this is not the one this is not the one and this is not the one and this is why is delayed she is very interesting is that uh um just to quickly mention what you this is and you mentioned the media it's exactly the case it's a very very pentious effect of the spread of Television but not television it's the Western idea of beauty that's been spread and it's very interesting that they found that uh that women who normally were rated you know attractive to very attractive because of the exposure to television that men started to rate them as not attractive or not very attractive because of the you know the photosho image of that doesn't exist it they don't these women don't exist in real life at all and this is the thing I have we have this problem in England with Brothers there's one particular brother I said what what are you looking for I can't believe it you know oh I just want like this what do you mean you just want like this she doesn't exist you know it's a really big problem you know Subhan Allah I've seen I know a brother practicing he's IM of Masjid M he saw 30 or 32 I forgot the number sisters imagine 32 families visiting sitting with the girl and he's practicing he's IM he's not you know is he married yet he's he finally got married after like ages like years and his mother gave up on him and and I I spoke to him have mercy on yourself what you're doing is torturing yourself so I have want I want that and this guy is not someone who watches movies he is just picky so this is I believe one of the reasons of delaying the marriage of males in the Muslim Community alongside a very important issue which is expenses a lot of the boys they tend to want to marry I taught in high school for 15 years and of course I was all the time with the teach teenagers and every one of them said she I want to get married what's stopping you are you crazy I'm getting five r a day to buy my soft drink and and sandwich and this is all the money I have who would give me in marriage and what would I do how to to do them how how to support my wife and we always encourage people if your son is a man not a male if your son is is a true man who behaves like one who can take responsibility who is not impulsive if he is such a person it's your responsibility as a father to marry him and you have to support him and you have to provide to him a lot of the the parents what would they say no I will not help my son let him depend on himself let him get a degree let him work you're Paving the the way for him to fall it's so interesting in Canada I sat with a father who was originally from Lebanon the same thing his son wanted to get married because I have this discussion all the time his his father was almost exactly verbatim I thought you maybe heard the same speech that is it is a sickness it is a disease actually and this I mean boils down to that do we really love our children as parents if as a father love my child I want my child to be happy I want my child to be happy whether a boy or a girl a daughter or a son and I have in mind some real true stories one happened in RI and this is a real father who loves his daughter he saw this nice boy in the Masid always in the Masid punctual never missing his Salah well disciplined well-mannered so he started asking about him and he found out that he was studying Sharia so one day after ass prayer he said please come I'm inviting you for a cup of tea he took him to his house while they were sitting in the sitting room the girl came in caring the tray with the the glasses or Cups of Tea so the boy was was so Pious and righteous immediately he lowered his gaze because he thought it was an accident mistake a mistake the girl was expecting her father to be alone so the father said it's not a mistake it's not an accident have a look that's a nice guy yes this is a father loves his daughter have a look the boy looked and then put his head down said do you want to marry him couldn't say anything he couldn't talk his face turned red and sure but you know you know I'm still doing my degree I said I know everything about you this is the key of the car and this is the key of the flat yes it these are true story do you want to get married he got them married so this is a father who loves his daughter he wants his daughter to live her life happily and this is a duty on the parent and there are other examples perhaps in we can hear some more of them after the break we'll be back shortly Salam alaykum a way of life way of life Welcome Back yes we were saying that um sometimes the youth them all the people interested in marriage they create their own uh set of obstacles which complicate the issue of marriage and are there more examples of that I just wanted to pick up on the beautiful story M may Allah bless more uh fathers in the um to be like their daughters because we know there's so many problems out there if we only feared Allah and we follow we feared Allah we'll have no problems but and Subhan Allah I was speaking to a sheh from Saudi and he exactly the same type of thing he said that his daughter I'm going to look I need to find a good man for you but her reaction was are you going to look for someone for me isn't that a shame that the father looked for his daughter don't you have to wait for someone to is this true is this a cust no no at all it's not true is there's no shame in this and the clearest example is Omar may Allah be pleased with him in the authentic Hadith the daughter of Omar Omar himself went to when his wife died so he told him uh my H is ready if you want to get married married he said no I don't feel like getting married now because he's been recently widowed so he went to Abu Bakr and Abu Baker was his closest companion and said Abu Bakr my daughter haa now is without a husband so if you have any interest yeah I would not find someone like you and Abu Bakr did not reply he did not reject he did not reply to him as if he's ignoring him and few days later it was the prophet opping to H Abu then came and said Omar your daughter there's nothing wrong with her and you're my best friend but had I not heard the prophet Alam mentioning ha and his interest in her I would have married her for myself so Omar is going to three of his close friends Abu Bakr well he did not go to the prophet Alam but eventually she ended up being one of the mothers of the believer which indicates that if I have a daughter I have 13 alhamdulillah what is the best thing that I wish for my daughters that they are successful with a Pious and practicing husband does he have to be a CEO of a company does he have to own Porsche or Ferrari no this is the last well it it would me make some sense yeah but seriously I have four my daughters married alhamd yes two of them I gave them in marriage two students in universities and I could and I stated that inshallah if they needed something I'll provide for them because I'm buying a man I'm buying a son-in-law he's my son so unfortunately there's no shame in that so that sister or that daughter who said it's shameful for you my father to go and look out this is her her point of view however we have to know that the marriage cannot be done without her approval so even if the father goes and look for a suitable person that does not mean that the marriage takes place unless she approves approves what I understood she from what it's just the culture that was what her cultural environment was telling her not because she thought it was a wrong thing to do rather that's what the culture seem to dictate this correct culturally yes people would think of ah definitely she has a defect there's something wrong with her that her father is is is advertising is is marketing her but of course is we're talking about an ideal Islamic Society yes and that's what we need to talk about also goad go ahead sorry sir also there is the issue of Customs that you've just mentioned it is a deterent from getting married for example for a boy to get married In some cultures he is bound to marry his cousin so from a very early age in some parts of Arabia even when the child is like two months old and his uh uh cousin is not yet born not yet born automatically the parents say my son is for your daughter and they grow up on this but the son does not the boy does not want to get married to his cousin he doesn't have any feelings to her so whenever he approaches his father saying that I want to marry from outside of the tribe or the family and the father insist say no no marriage is going to take place unless you marry your cousin I committed myself so the boy does not marry it keeps on waiting for his father to die or for the girl to change her their parents change their mind and give her to someone else I believe in some countries it's also in Pakistan many in England we have this problem with this issue with many of the Pakistani families as well it's a very big issue marrying the cousins and it becomes more problematic because they want them to marry cousins from back from Pakistan different culture yeah and the problem is often you know their cousins are and it could be either way it could be the girl marrying a boy or the boy marrying a girl but either way what you find is they're not really educated least to the Western standards which is very problematic being a father in the west or a mother in the west to children who you can't contribute you know becomes very we have so many problems from this I receive literally yeah emails weekly by the T from UK from this problem seeking divorce because her father gave her in marriage to her cousin who is from a different culture she is born and brought up in the UK in America and they insist on getting her married to someone who is not educated not same culture and simply for taking the citizenship or the opposite Brothers being or choosing selecting a woman from their own native country to come over which is a lesser problem because the man is dominating he's able to sort of handle his wife and bring her up in the way that suits him but if it's the opposite then it becomes more difficult I believe also in some countries that you cannot marry unless the eldest brother is married first isn't that this is another thing is so the eldest brother has to marry then the next then the next and the younger brother can't marry to the elder brother or the elder sister it could be brothers or sisters but basically it has to start with the eldest and then it has to go down so that's another thing that delays marriage and all the all of these things are not from Islam I'd just like to add one thing here I think it is the upbringing how you bring up your children if one brings up his daughter islamically educating her teaching her that and now she knows that because in Islam who will facilitate the marriage the parents because we don't believe or Islam doesn't permit that the girl will go and find suitable partner to the parents so here there is a problem now anything comes through the parents the youngesters or the youth being brainwashed anything comes through the parents know it is wrong this is myself yes this is one extreme there this is another problem yeah this is one extreme they don't say okay let give it a second thought think about it see the proposal see the guy all these things so because this is we became so distant from our Islam because when we go to back to our Dean and see the history of Islam we see many many beautiful stor which are totally different from what we hear today and you know the famous story of the uh the son of Malik imagine the son of the khif proposing to to ask him for the hand of his daughter he refused refusing the son of the khif he said no is the she who went to the student his exactly this is the same story one of his students was missing and he said what happened to him they said his we don't know so he went to the his the house of his you not knocked on the door I said who is it I said he said s the student said never crossed my mind that could be my Sheik this this of course after he met his student in the Masjid and he asked him why were you absent he said well I was married and my wife died yes and I had to take four or five days you know to take care of her then he asked him why didn't you get married again and he said who will give me in marriage so I said I will give you in marriage do you accept and then go the boy the stud said yeah except and he was think that he was playing with him did is it that he said my she's blind she's something she never she's never seen no that's about IM Abu that's different story but Subhan Allah I mean this is another father who loves his daughter and he buys happiness not only a man happiness continue the story when he come came and and knocked on okay knocked on the door and uh he opened and he asked him and of course the rest is history accepted the offer but what happened after a few days of the uh of the marriage he wanted not to go back to the circle to attend uh the circles of the sh his wife pulled down pulled him down he said what are you going said to attend your father's circus he said what for said to learn he said his knowledge is with me I'll sit down I'm going to teach you she became his CH okay you see this is our Islam brothers and sisters but this shows how the father B up exactly Subhan Allah so that's why we need to bring up our children Subhan Allah in Islam Subhan Allah we what the prophet sallallah wasallam said again it goes to the IM he said the one who was not married before Al okay the Virgin her consense is what silence my daughter there is a man who's this who's that who's this and is proposing a faithful h Lush and he'll keep quiet and the they say why that the lawgiver considered the silence as an sign of acceptance because they said the reply is easy no is not difficult to say no but to say yes a bit for a girl who is having ha today what happened what kind does he drive how does he look okay I want him I love him and all that stuff you hear the one I want yeah it is it is the the upbringing again and Subhan Allah this brings us back to looking at what pleases Allah and the prophet not what pleases the society and it is quite important for us to look at the things that preserve this Society feeding one mouth is like feeding to mou it's not going to harm you if you make your son married however this crossed my mind the issue of the criticism that some may say the Muslims always have arranged marriage and they are criticizing it as if it's something negative is it something negative well statistically no statistically arranged marriages even in England even in UK they they admit that arranged marriages are much more successful they last longer people tend to be more happy I mean so subh I mean we know from Islam that's the case but uh it's it's interesting that the kufar even they admit themselves that our system is is shown to be better is it forced is marri of course this is yeah this is different yeah there's two things forced marriage but we have to be honest this is another thing that is another extreme now we're talking about what prevents marriage but we have the we do have amongst our communities Muslim communities throughout the world the the phenoma unfortunately of forced marriage mhm um I personally know of a case a very extreme case where the girl had no idea she was in a room and the next thing she know a man appeared with a bottle actually unfortunately of alcohol and basically you know I suppose raped her because she never gave her consent she didn't and that I'm your husband that's it this was her marriage so we do have these things taking place by the way islamically this is not a marriage even if the father gives his approval and consent to marry this man to the girl and the girl does not give her consent this is not marriage yes it's not valid it's it's nullified it it has no grounds at all our time is up for this episode but we will continue inshallah in the next episode with more about marriage for tuning in and we'll catch you in the future inshah a way of life"
