  "transcript": "so like I fall into sin deliberately like lot of times I have slow Ean and on that time before sping the sin I'm like that like when I get back my IM I will be repenting and Allah will forgive me and by having that intention I commit sin delber so sh what can me to scare me dead so that I stop doing this separately you are in great danger as long as you're doing mistakes without repenting the moment you die you will face a lot of Torment in your grave and there would be a lot of punishment and torment for you in Hellfire on the day of judgment because Allah has given you so much time blessed you with so many favors and blessings in this dun yet you're failing big time to show your gratitude to Allah and to thank him instead you're utilizing whatever Allah has granted you in doing these sins over and over again neglecting the fact that Allah is all hearing and allseeing so when you're doing these mistakes ask yourself is Allah watching me is Allah listening to what I'm listening to does Allah know what I'm doing if your answer is yes this should put a lot of fear in your heart that something is going to happen and if it's not happening Allah Asel is waiting waiting for you to slip and to get your heart hardened and black until you've lost everything that would qualify you to Allah's mercy so it's your call what you want to do"
