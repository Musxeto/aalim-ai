  "transcript": "brother sofyan from the UK says there is a problem when it comes to the war it's an issue of dispute and because it of its sensitivity we try our level best not to give a fatwa on TV why see a person in Pakistan living in that beautiful land they have an Islamic sharia court they have scholars of their own and they live in the community they do something it's legislated in their system that the ruling is so-and-so I living in Saudi Arabia may beg to differ not only that I may have the correct opinion in Islam according to my beliefs but I cannot overrule their rulings because they live in their country and they follow a Muslim leader a Muslim ruler and they abide but with you but why by what he says therefore it's difficult for me to give a fatwa where they would implement and go against the fatwah of the land so although sufian is from the UK they have a Sharia board there a Sharia Court brother Haytham had daddies I believe a member of it so they can go pay them a hundred pounds and get the ruling insha Allah why pay them 100 pounds here you see they have to make a living these guys are not government officials public servants they need to make a living so you have to get them for the time so you go there and ask them and they will answer you generally speaking if someone I don't know where he's from asking me this question what is the ruling on a man saying to his wife you're divorced you divorced you divorced three times at the same sitting at the same time without having intervals between the divorces for a period of their iddah where Allah says ya un nabi palaka to Manisa of Apple even at the end there is a time frame that you have to follow not give the three in one go so what's the ruling share and what's your rolling on the divorce of someone who's angry and what's the ruling on this and that well each needs a separate hat wa the divorce while you're angry is the norm nobody's drinking cappuccino with his wife and says honey I love you you divorced no you divorce your wife when you are angry but the anger itself is divided in two levels the highest level which is rage that blocks your vision that you cannot see when you divorce and after you wake up they say you divorce your wife I don't remember that yes and you broke the coffee to the tea table and you smashed the LCD TV and you did this and he said well I don't remember anything okay this is a rage that simulates being in the state of intoxication divorce doesn't happen here so would you say he divorced me while he's angry I cannot advise you someone has to sit with him speaks with him make sure that his anger was extreme rage and not just normal anger when a wife says to her husband you're not a man divorced me if you're a man misses you divorced this is not real anger this is playing chicken and he won and you lost so what about divorce divorce divorce or you divorced rice the Prophet Ellison am at his time and also at the time of Abu Bakr such divorce was considered to be one only now the Hanafi school of thought followed the opinion of Omar who changed this and implemented it three as was said to reprimand people from playing around with divorce so if you go to Hanafy family and her husband had to fight and I have hundreds of cases like this the husband had a fight with his wife in a moment of anger he said I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you her uncle comes and takes the woman and leaves and the man says I reconciled with my wife said no according to my mother HAP she's totally Haram for you you need to have halala as they call it in order and she has to get married to another one before she can marry you and they destroy the marriage because of this imbecile again I'm not giving a fatwa it depends where you live you have to go to the Muslim authorities and ask them for a factor in this but I'm just generally in lighting you people to know where the difference of opinion comes from and how to behave it's not cherry-picking so if you live in Pakistan you divorce your wife three times in one setting before you reach the court says listen let me go to Egypt maybe I'll have an easier response or let me go to Saudi Arabia and have an easier response it doesn't work like that unfortunately"
