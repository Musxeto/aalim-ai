  "transcript": "this is a question from aisha she says can you please explain what body hair can both males and females remove so we have hairs on our bodies that we are prohibited from removing and we have hairs on our bodies that we are obliged to remove and the third category is the hair that we are not told to remove nor order to keep so it is permissible for you to do whatever you want with that for a man it is a must that he does not remove his beard and not to come in contact or touch pluck cut or shave his eyebrows so this is okay understood there's no problem in that the prophet islam has forbidden us from shaving the beards and he told us to go against the jews the christians and the fire worshipers and to keep it to honor it to grow it etc now the women don't have beards actually but if they do they are obliged to remove it because they are not allowed to imitate men as men are not allowed to imitate women by shaving it women are also prohibited from plucking their eyebrows and there is a an authentic hadith in buhari and muslim narrated by abdullah bin masrudmi allah be pleased with him who said that the prophet had cursed ali the women who pluck their eyebrows and those who it is done for them okay this is haram for women what is obligatory to remove well for men and for women they're obliged to pluck the armpit hair and to shave the pubic hair this is part of the 10 characteristics of fitra of nature which was reported by mother aisha anas stated that the prophet allah salatu told us ordered us to remove these and not to exceed 40 days now having said that you can shave the armpit if you wish you don't have to wax it you don't have to pluck it and you could do the same with the pubic hair if you wish and this is up to you but you have to remove it totally the rest of the hair is permissible so for women they can remove the hair on their arms on their legs no problem of course they can't remove the hair on their head they cannot shave this is totally prohibited for men it's the same thing they can you remove the hair on the the arms on the legs on the chest and if they want they can shave or trim the hair on their heads and allah knows best"
