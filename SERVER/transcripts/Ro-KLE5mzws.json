  "transcript": "he used to suffer from ocd and he used to repeat the shahada frequently now he alhamdulillah is much much better and this is from the grace of allah upon him this is nirma from allah he has to be grateful to allah azzawajal and he's asking sometimes i'm confused is this kufa or not what to do number one if you're not certain your islam is still intact as stated certainty is not impacted is not affected by doubts we take the doubts and throw them in the dustbin but if you are certain that what you have said or what you have seen is kufur then you have to rectify that the vast majority of cases that you're suffering from is totally doubtful so ignore it and the second thing to do is that when you ever you're confused give us a call talk to the imam of the masjid talk to the darya in your neighborhood to your scholars ask them is this kufa or not and they will clarify that for you"
