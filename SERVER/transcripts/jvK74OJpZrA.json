  "title": "If a woman forgets to wear socks in prayer Is her prayer valid #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is my prayer valid if I forgot to put my socks on this is an issue of dispute thei states that it is not and I think IB Tamia also agrees when a woman is praying home and she prays without wearing socks or covering her feet that this is permissible and due to the difference of opinion I believe inshallah that if you've done this out of forgetfulness that your prayer is valid but if you know no you have to cover your feet because the vast majority of Scholars consider the feet of women in Salat and in looking to be as well"
