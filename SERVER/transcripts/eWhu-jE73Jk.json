  "transcript": "so I used to be an idiot who watches cartoons in anime before now I stopped the problem is it's like a drug to me right now I used to imagine stories of what I used to watch in my head as fanfiction you could say I want to stop it it's like OCD it comes yet it's like drugs the person enjoys it I don't want it yet my mind wants it and it sometimes it contains magic not no just magic and stuff like that are you are you watching it or you stopped no no I stopped but as long as you have stopped because I'm sorry the time of the episode is over as long as you've stopped you will need maybe few years maybe more for your brain and your body to detox and these images will come and jump on you even in your Salat even when you're going to bed fantasizing thinking this is your test from Allah you have to remain steadfast and not go back to watching them and ask Allah for forgiveness whenever you recall or remember them and Allah Asel Knows Best"
