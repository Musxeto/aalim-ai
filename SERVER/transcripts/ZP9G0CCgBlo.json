  "title": "Does Traveling for entertainment in Ramadan exempt you from fasting? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Heidi says I had a question that traveling for entertainment and fun exempts us from fasting does it not because it's necessity just for for example going for vacations the answer would be as long as you're not committing sin you're not traveling for sin as the jeweler's described those who go to other countries to fornicate to drink alcohol to go to movies etc these are sinful and their intention of travel is sinful so they may not break their fast they may not shorten their prayers because they are in on a sinful journey however if someone during the month of Ramadan wants to go on a vacation is this Haram definitely not as long as it's a halal vacation you're going to hell are places you have the permission from Allah to skip from a bond and to shorten your your prayers and combine them when necessary but is it recommended this is up to you you are the best judge of your situation someone says I don't have any opening in the year except during the month of model Ramadan to go and visit my mom to visit my father to travel all the way back to their country because I have migrated from my motherland and now I'm a citizen of another country for good so in this case this is permissible and there's no problem in that Isha Allah"
