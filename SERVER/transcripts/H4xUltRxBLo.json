  "title": "Is a woman allowed to work against her husband's permission? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "let me rephrase that she's asking about her husband who's providing for her a house food taking care of her children and that's it and at the same time she has a father who is in need and who is unable to make ends meet so he is requesting her to work and to help him financially what's the ruling on that if my understanding is correct it is not permissible for a woman to work against her husband's will so if he's providing for her she must stay home if he doesn't want her to work if he's not providing for her children this means that he's not providing for her properly so it is his obligation to provide for his children if he refuses then she has the right to file for a divorce and to file a case against them at court where they will force him to provide for his children on monthly basis if he's providing for her and for her children but her father is in need of financial assistance and she doesn't have a job well this is not her responsibility what Allah obliged her with is that she stays home takes care of her husband and of her children and her father Allah so they would make a way out for him but for her to divorce her husband or to work against his will this is not permissible even if he allows her to work but she has to work in a mixed environment with men and women working together mixing chit-chatting sometimes flirting this is not permissible no matter what the circuit stances are the protection of a Muslim woman is more important and allah azzawajal knows best"
