  "title": "Making movie out of a small issue! Have OCD about menses blood spreading everywhere assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have cleaned a lot of lenses from my mattress in crazy I just wrapped only and removed the blood with weight clothes with tissue and soap when the impure mattress was still moist and damp I kept my pillows for one minute or less and also checked with my hands couple of times that it had dried or not thinking the area to be correctly purified now I have forgotten and I'm not sure that my hands and pillows then got the wetness of impurity on them or not but when I touch the mattress I felt the coldness of the wet mattress on my hand and now sometimes I am inclined to the thought that my pillows did not get the wetness but my hands got the wetness and sometimes I'm in French to the thought that maybe both got the wetness and also sometimes I have the thought that none of them got Wellness I have touched many things afterwards so what can be the solution how would I know come on give me a break when you make a Bollywood movie out of so trivial things this is not logical you make a mistake and you Cascade this mistake intentionally by doing who would put pillows on an area that he's not certain whether it's pure or not and then he touches the area with his hands and then it's soiled or not then he touches the pillow you're making a movie out of this and this is not Islam whenever you try to complicate things whenever you try to make life hard upon yourself believe me Allah will make it harder you're challenging Allah azzawajal when you do these things of course now here is a reverse mechanism or the defense oh no no I'm just afraid of impurity transferring elsewhere if you were truly afraid you would not have done all of this you would have taken uh the appropriate measurement to avoid such impurities from transferring but you are recklessly behaving and making a long plot and a scenario and then coming and asking questions sometimes people come and ask me about soiling the whole house from a small drop of urine that came into their hand they neglected it they touched the tab and the faucets and the doorknob and a light switch and they they touched their feet and they walked with their feet on the carpet to the living room to the bedroom and then they climbed over their bed and they touched the pillow from a single drop of urine they've managed to contaminate the whole house this is not urine this is acid even if it's acid it wouldn't last that long it would have burnt few places and that's it but look what shaytan is doing to you and at the end of the day she said I have so much Whispers what can I do the whole house is soil can I burn it This Is the End you want to burn the whole house to purify it what is this so again we have rules and regulations in Islam that covers things certainty is not affected by doubt if you've noticed in your question you've used the word I feel I maybe perhaps I think all of these are phrases used in doubt just put them in the dust bin and move on with your life"
