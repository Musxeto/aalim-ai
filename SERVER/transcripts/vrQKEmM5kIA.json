  "title": "Can control his or her desire for opposite gender, can they decide to never marry? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I saw many of your videos regarding whether marriage is obligatory or not and can someone decide not to get married and in one of your videos you said that a person who has noticed that to get married at the moment he has to take and postpone their marriage for a couple of years and so on but my question is if someone has deserved for the opposite gender but they have control over that desire and they know they will not fall into Haram can hear she decide not to get married ever well this again is not the question to be asked someone who does not have any desire to the opposite gender is he obliged to get married the answer is no but it is not how we look at things marriage is one of Allah's signs Allah created spouses so that they can inhibit one another and Allah made between them mercy and compassion even if you don't have the desire you may have it and develop it next year five years from now 10 years from now but the more you get older the less the demand is and the market is open and it is ruled by demand and supply women in previous years there their marriage average rate was 18. 17. so when I got married 40 years ago about 40 years ago that was the norm 17 or 18. if she was 23 whoa that's too much nowadays it's like 28. why because men are not interested a lot of them are unfortunately not practicing so they fulfill their desires through Haram means or they are more oriented towards their jobs and career so they don't get married until they're 40 or 45 which is very sad for a Muslim to wait this long and waste the most beautiful years of his life without a companion nevertheless if a woman says I don't want to get married ever and she doesn't have any desire for the opposite gender and there is no fitna that's her problem is she doing a good thing definitely not she's going against against the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah may Allah be pleased with him so amen once and ask him are you married and the man said no and the probably the man was in his mid-20s or 30s so remember looked at him and said one of two nothing is preventing you from getting married except either impotency or you are a Playboy a fornicator because this is not normal everybody is looking forward to get married this is a natural thing so are you following the Sunnah definitely not are you losing a lot of reward because you're refusing to get married definitely yes but am I sinful it depends from one case to the other"
