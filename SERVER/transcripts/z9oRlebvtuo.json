  "title": "Living in America or a non muslim country, can I travel as a tourist to another city assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it has been previously discussed that traveling to non-muslim countries for things like tourism is Haram but I'm a bit confused about the limits like what if you already living in a non-muslim country like America and you travel from state to state such as a state all the way in the east coast to State all the way in the west coast for leisure would this be Haram the prohibition which the scholars mentioned about traveling to non-muslim countries this was was addressing those living in Muslim countries those abiding by the Shar law those and this fatwa was given when the people were totally Muslim practicing individuals women were covered from head to toe men used to pray in the Masjid so the scholars at that particular time gave the fatwa that it is not permissible to travel to non Muslim countries unless it is for a legitimate reason where the person has Iman that would defy his whims and desires so he won't fall into sin and he has knowledge that would protect him from falling uh uh captive to Whispers of Shan and doubts of other religions and it has to be of for a legitimate reason such as studying uh medical treatment or business and the likes this is what our Scholars used to give as justifications to travel to non-muslim countries those who are already living in a non-muslim country that wouldn't be a problem as you've said going from the east coast to the West Coast or the likes because it's the same uh thing for them"
