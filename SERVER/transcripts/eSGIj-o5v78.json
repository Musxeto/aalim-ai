  "transcript": "[Music] about his actions yet everybody else is therefore we don't have the power to ask Allah why did you do this no one can come and say why did you create Adam and Eve in the first place in paradise and had him sin why didn't you prevent him from sinning so that we would be all living in Paradise at the moment no one could say why did Allah create earthquakes tornadoes floods fires diseases calami why did Allah do this this is Allah's creation this is Allah's wisdom and his wisdom is so vast and great that we don't know of it you know what Al did with M he killed a young boy and he almost made a think and he also fixed a wall that was about to fall though the people of the village did not feed them all of these things it appears that they have no wisdom at all so why would someone do such a thing but when Al explained his position and why he did this and what he had done was through the revelation of Allah it became apparent that it was for wisdom and this is a very very small scale if you look at the whole greater picture you would find things that would battle you would would make your uh uh head go in strange directions so why didn't Allah reveal one book it's the same thing that Allah Asel made intoxicant forbidden over three stages in the Quran so the companions were Tak gradually the people the intellect of the people at the time of no or at the time of samud or at the time of uh Moses were not completely developed developed as they were at the time of the Prophet so Allah revealed special things for each um ethnicity if you say if if you may say or to each country to each Nation but at the time of the Prophet Alam his religion was for all not only humans but even for the Gin so the Dee was complete and probably this is why but again we have to know that we have no right none whatsoever to question Allah's decisions and Allah knows that"
