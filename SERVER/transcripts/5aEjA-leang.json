  "transcript": "me Andrea's says in Thoth every time a guy passes by hitting and they touch shoulders accidentally is it Haram or is it okay because men don't care while we sisters try to do toe off very carefully but one way or another it accidentally happens what to do first of all Tawaf going around the kaabah is a pillar of both Ramallah and Hajj however it can be inevitable that accidental touching take place and whenever something is accidental and it's not intended there is no sin on the individual mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her was with her companion and she the companion told her come let's go closer to the Kaaba so that we would make the distance shorter while doing Tawaf she said are you crazy I will never mingle with men and she used to perform Tawaf at the outer side of the circle it makes it longer but it is safer for herself from getting touched by men like that and this is what women should do and allah azza wajal knows best"
