  "transcript": "question is regarding 33 years of age I could not understand but in Paradise we will all be of the age of 33 so those who died a 100 years of age will be resurrected as youngsters in the age of the youth 33 years of age will they have recollection of the Dunya yes they do they know the people who they were with and those who uh oppress them and those who were kind to them but this would not have any impact on their enjoyment in Paradise because all hatred and grudges would be taken from their chests and thrown away cleansed and they would have good time in Paradise for eternity and Allah Knows Best"
