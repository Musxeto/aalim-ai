  "transcript": "my brother often worry about an area outside our house where we used to put our sandals off the reason is because the sandals usually works on impurity like several water he worries that the area is still impure because of that even if the area is already dry place your advice so let me understand your question correctly people walk may walk on areas that is impure and they put their sandals before they enter and the area is dry your brother is worried that this is nudges novel yes what I said was right yes right okay first of all the prophet Allah was asked about people walking over nudges areas especially women who may drag their Abaya their garments and walk over Nexus areas so what would they do with that the prophet told the Madison the pure areas afterwards would purify it meaning that if you have slippers or shoes and you step on najasa on an impurity then you walk on a pure land whether it's cement whether it's grass whether it's soil this area that you'd walked over purifies your shoes and we have a legal Maxim um or a major rule stating that certainty is not affected by doubt everything you see around you is pure by default so my iPad is pure my pen is pure my head gear is pure yes I have grandchildren they may have touched it may perhaps an impurity came perhaps I feel there is an impurity that came by I feel all of these are phrases used in doubt would not impact the certainty so if I go out of the house and I see the slippers on the ground it's dry I look I don't see any traces of impurity I cannot assume because such assumptions would not impact the certainty which is everything is pure until proven otherwise therefore tell your brother to rest assure that everything is pure in sha Allah"
