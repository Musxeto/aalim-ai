  "title": "Can woman marry man younger than her Going against Urf (Local norm, customs) sinful? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that what is the meaning of rorf is what people acknowledge to be the norm so rf in some countries is when someone comes in everybody stands up to shake hands this is lorf is that people may not speak while eating depending on the customs is when a person proposes to a girl he has to be accompanied by his father and his family most likely his his uncles his siblings to make it presentable not coming on his own this is official so these are part of the customs of the traditions of the norm so um [Music] ahmad allah is saying is going against such norms would be sinful now such genetic questions can be answered we have to have an example so that we can understand and answer upon or answer that example but this does not cascade to all other issues in your head so she says in our community marrying someone marrying a man who's younger than you is not something nice and people would consider it to be insulting the answer to that would be this is bogus such tradition and customs and is to be neglected and not to looked upon simply because the prophet isaiah married a woman who was older than him so if the prophet did this and he's the role model then definitely we can do that so the age difference whether the man is older than the girl or the girl is older than the man there is nothing wrong or humiliating in this in islam at all you"
