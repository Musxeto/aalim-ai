  "title": "Does pausing in prayer (trying to remember an ayah) require sujood as sahu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from turkey says is the long pause a reason to offer prostration of sahu the prostration of sahu as scholars say is either for skipping something that is mandatory or a pillar or adding something that is mandatory or a pillar anything that is voluntary it is not considered to be a cause of concern so for example i know that raising the hands is a sunnah if i omit it my prayer is valid because it's neither pillar nor mandatory if i add when i go to sujud i raise my hands which is not from the sunnah again this does not require sujude sahu now the issue is while praying i recited the fatiha and i paused for 10-15 seconds trying to remember the ayah which i concluded my previous rakah with so that i can continue and i blacking out i don't know so 15 seconds 20 seconds i'm just sitting trying to remember does this require so you decide the answer is no you"
