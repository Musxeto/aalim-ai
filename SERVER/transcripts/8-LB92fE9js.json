  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can [Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode dealing with hadiths of the prophet where he talks about how to fix our hearts and the Hadith we have today is theith ofd may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam said Faith Iman Faith wears out in your hearts just as clothes wear out so ask Allah to renew the faith in your heart in this Hadith the prophet Alat gives the example of faith in our hearts to a piece of cloth by time this cloth wears out re either because it's worn out or because of the time effect on it it starts to go pale lose its color the fabric becomes soft maybe torn the heart is exactly behaving in the same fashion when one of us does not protect his Hearts because sins doubts Whispers tribulations and trials all weaken the heart and is always an enemy who's just lurking and waiting 24 hours 7 days a week waiting for the right moment to strike and if you do not protect your heart from such diseases and illnesses that would it then it will lead it to death exactly as the the threads of a piece of cloth would become weak and soft and maybe torn out by time Abu d may Allah have may Allah be pleased with him the companion of the Prophet Alat says and he was known to be the wise men among the companions because his words were filled with wisdom he says may Allah be pleased with him that a sign of a man's intellect knowledge a sign of it that he always checks on his Iman and what was reduced of it and it's a sign of his intellect and knowledge to know whether he's increasing or decreasing and it is part of his intellect wisdom knowledge to know where is Shan at attacking him from so if a person checks his heart all the time and his Iman whether it's increasing or decreasing whe so that if it's decreasing he will do it more and if it is increasing he will try to preserve this high level and he would always make a check and balance to find out where is he being attacked from how is Shan being able to infiltrate his defense lines may Allah have mercy on his soul says that the heart and the IM in your heart is like a tree the sources of a healthy tree tree are two things the tree is regularly irrigated with pure water and it's always checked whether there are weeds that would harm it that would hamper its health or not so if we find these weeds we have to remove them constantly and clean and clear the air area around it and we have to ensure that it is irrigated with good pure water once we ensure this then the fruit of the tree would be perfect likewise the heart and the Iman in it has to have the same thing what irrigates our hearts is it the Quran is it VI is it forms of worship is it contemplating and pondering upon Allah's Beautiful Creatures or is it being irrigated with music with poetry with movies with Haram scenes with obscene words with backbiting and slandering and gossiping this is what makes it or breaks it this is what gives life to your heart or it kills it and it is part of's Creed and belief that IM fluctuates it increases with good deeds and it decreases with sins whoever acknowledge this pillar and fundamental and always checks on his heart he would recognize that the more he's doing sins and he's heedless undoing them the more the heart is becoming tough and stiff and hard the glow and the light in it is dimming little by little because when you do good deeds when you worship Allah Asel you are actually polishing your heart the prophet saysat IM wears out so this is an indication and a warning not to lose faith not to have weak IM and then he says so ask Allah to new IM in your hearts ask Allah continuously frequently persistently keep on insisting on Allah because without Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala there won't be guidance in the first place it is Allah who guided us why aren't we following other religions why aren't we worshiping other gods why are we blessed to be Muslims because Allah blessed us and guided Us in the first place likewise without Allah making us steadfast on Iman we would not be able to attain such a level and therefore we need to frequently ask Allah Asel to make us steadfast on IM and on Islam because the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers Allah flips them as he wills and as he wishes and from this Hadith we benefit that Iman increases and decreases as believe we benefit and learn that a Muslim has to check on his Iman regularly and to monitor the state of his heart so that nothing would harm him we also learn from this Hadith that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave the example of a weak and sick Heart To A Worn Out piece of cloth which means that the doubts The Whispers the desires the sins would negatively impact our hearts like a piece of cloth of cloth can be damaged with many many fact for with many many factors in this Hadith the prophet highlights the importance of Dua and by far Dua like the prophet said in another authentic Hadith Dua is worship it's like saying is it's like saying repentance is remorse which means that the vast majority of worship lies in Dua so without asking Allah to keep us steadfast on IM and to Main maintain our hearts and to increase the light in our vision to see what's right and what's wrong we could not we could never attain such a level we have to ask Allah we have to make Dua and the 1 million Kuwaiti din question how do we ask Allah to renew IM in our hearts Dua is number one second ly we need to have a constant portion of the Quran that we recite on daily basis that we Ponder upon that we read and learn the T because this is the quote unquote source of guidance to humanity the Quran this is the book that Satan the enemies of Islam the Hypocrites among the Muslims are trying their level best to set us away from so we have to have a selected quality time with the Quran on daily basis this renews the IM in our Hearts likewise observing obligations on the top of all obligations praying in the Masjid those who pray in the Masjid have strong Iman in their hearts they're not perfect but they are far more better than those who pray home and there is no comparison between them and those who do not pray at all so by observing the Salah on time in the Masid this renews your Iman having good companionship when you have bad company that you hang out with and all the time they tell you vulgar jokes they gossip they backbite they slander people and they never remember Allah and they also encourage you to sin they remind you of Haram this would eliminate any chance of your Iman to be renewed while if you have a good company that keeps on reminding you of Allah giving you benefits and showing you the beauty of Islam and when you do something wrong they give you a sincere advice you will find that your Iman is flourishing and that it is thriving and growing and finally when we want to increase our Iman and to renew it we need to ponder upon Allah's favors and blessings upon us how he made us healthy how he made us wealthy how he made us Believers while others are worse than animals because of their negligence their lack of knowledge because of their distance from Allah and because of their kufur when we Ponder and contemplate upon Allah's beautiful signs in this universe on Earth in ourselves we get to in in ree the levels of our Iman and get closer and closer to Allah the almighty and I pray to Allah Asel that he renews the IM in our hearts and that he makes us steadfast on Islam and to grant us the ability to know him more and to get closer to him till the day we die"
