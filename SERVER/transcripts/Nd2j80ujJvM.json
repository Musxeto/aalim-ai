  "transcript": "asked the prophet about Islam Iman and when he left he asked Omar om do you know who this man is no Prophet said this is he came to teach you your religion and your Islam so now we have questions how many time how long we have 10 minutes okay few questions what is the importance of humans is it important this guidance is it no what is it important very or little it is more important than your weal then your health then medicine then engineering because all of these things fix your D you know with medicine I can cure my body but I'm going to die so cure my body until 10 years 20 years 60 years old I'm going to die but without I cannot cure my heart my soul so it is the most important thing for humans and never ever mix the fact that the best knowledge the best is the of Islam the of Dean of religion we have lots of doctors we need doctors we have lots of Engineers we we need Engineers we need mathematicians Physicians uh physicists that is chemists and so on but all of this put it aside the most important are those who know the Quan who know the Sunnah who know the dean because they are the people who guide you to Paradise this is your inevitable and eventual Target you live how long are you going to live 60 years 70 years then what you're going to die so what was it that you've achieved in your life a PhD degree three diplomas four BSS um coures in NLP and so on good big bank account three four cars houses what will you take with you in the grade nothing except the knowledge you've learned practice and and conveyed and Tau to others so it is the most important thing to know the this is the message from Allah if the president writes you a letter to you what will you do with this letter put it in a frame and put it in the guest room en large it and whenever someone comes said this he wrote this to me the is Allah's words to you when he when he says yeah he's addressing you do do you know what Allah wants from you if you do alhamdulillah you have achieved it can there be Inspirations for the followers of the Prophet The Sisters yes this is Inspirations in same thing linguistically yes it's or or but is it the form that we can say it is like what was revealed to the prophet no one is revealed to after the prophet You Can Be Inspired but this inspiration can be true and it can be false so you don't have any means to say that surely this is from Allah there are incidents for example was once giving and all of a sudden he said what is this change channel what is talking about making and when he was through he they asked him what did you say what did I say they said you shouted what I was giving I had this idea that s was a leader of an expedition in Virg so he was leading the war against the virgins and I was giving a i all of a sudden I was so engaged and worried about my troops and I thought that they were next to a mountain and the enemies were attacking them without them knowing so the only way out is for them to go to a jab to the mountain so I just shouted this I didn't know that you were appearing me it was just something that crossed my mind and Subhan Allah one month later s comes back and they told him that this is what happened he saidh Allah we were in the same location in the same position and we were both to be defeated when we heard the voice of saying so we went to the mountain will grant us Victory so this is inspiration now does this happen to us you know I say my wife the soup the soup is going to bur when she hear this if I do this the people would attack me and you know say you're crazy this can happen but how can I define that this is from Allah or is an inspiration from Shan I cannot all what I can do is ask after I see the results if it's positive then I say the grace of Allah Allah inspired me to do this Allah inspired me to make the right choice and if it's the wrong then this is from my own shortcomings and from my own wrongdoing let us wrap up the questions quickly are the thoughts one gets after offering isar considered to be form of Inspirations now this is a misconception a lot of people say yes I did not get a dream I did not get any inspiration saying do or don't you don't usually you don't what is all what I hear is sounds like the be can understand speaking counseling from Allah which means the prophet says if you intend to do something I have two choices whether to buy a red car or a blue car I don't have a you know a fixed opinion and then blue is I I'll buy the blue I decided on someone some some thing of the two I chose after I choose I pray and I supplicate to Allah if there is good for me in buying the blue one Allah will make it easy if not Allah will change it it will not go through this is it is not when I have two things and I'm not decisive yet I don't have a decision which one to go to I pray which one no you have to make a decision and then ask Allah for what is the difference between and what the sufis claim to be Inspirations now of course sufis are divisions they're not all bad but there are divisions of the sufis are not Muslims they are not considered to be Muslims those who say that Allah and I are one and one of them they called they said that Allah came into me this I think in in in Hinduism I think they have this I don't know what they call it but there are are parts of like this these are not Muslims there are extremists among them who are considered to be Muslim what deviant uh uh sexs because theyve innovated and they come and say you people of Hadith you say this man narrated that this man and reported to this man to Abu to the prophet while we say that my heart told me that Allah told him so we take our direct from Allah it's always when you have one stop it's not as good as when you have non-stop light so you have you know directly to Allah this is the kind of inspiration they claim and their sh usually these extremists do not refer to Quran and Sunnah you have to do this why because I was inspired by this the same inspiration came to George Bush when he said God came to me and he told me to invade these countries Iraq and Afghanistan so he's not sou but so are these Inspirations when you have to look at these dreams Inspirations and measure them to the Quran and Sunnah if they follow the Quran and Sunnah then they are positive but if a Dev if someone no matter how Pious he is no matter how religious he is no matter how practicing he is comes and sees a vision telling him that we give you 20% discount you don't have to pray you pray only four prayers a day and he wakes up says Allah Exempted me from this is this acceptable this is from because Allah says that the dean has been perfected and completed no one can delete and no one can add to it with anything and finally what is I think it's finally what is the difference between talking uh to the prophet muham to Moses we we spoke about this that the elevation was much higher uh I think we have few what do we call what the sorcerers claim to have you know the sorcerers the magic and the fortune tellers and they get Inspirations as well this is part of Shan's inspiring his allies how can we understand these two verses verely we shall send down to you a weighty word very heavy and and we have indeed made the Quran easy to understand and to remember then is there anyone who will remember how can we combine this it's very easy the instructions the Quran itself is heavy in teachings and in instructions so that is why when it was revealed to the prophet it was heavy on him but it is not difficult to to memorize it is not difficult to understand so the first verse means that everything in Islam has a strong and heavy weight cannot be taken lightly don't think that this is easy this is this verse is let's look at the big picture no everything in Islam is heavy and that is why IM Malik when he was approached of course you know Malik IM of Medina when he was approached by a man asking him a question he said oh IM I would like to ask you a light question a very light question in weight he said nothing in Islam is light Allah says and verily we shall send down to you weighty words in Islam it's all serious it's all heavy but the one of the characteristics of Quran that is second to none nowhere in the world you'll find a religious scripture memorized by anyone I can bring you a 7-year-old child who memorizes the Quran by heart I can bring you people who do not speak one word of Arabic and knows exactly how to pronounce every single word in the Quran is this possible yes we have thousands hundreds of thousands millions of Muslims know the Quran by heart so many times I recite the Quran I make a mistake a brother from India from Pakistan corrects me in the prayer crazy I'm an Arab no you can't say this I say and because Allah preserved this Quran and it's not for the Arabs or for the it's for the humanity they all preserve the Quran therefore it is easy to remember it is easy to memorize and it's very easy if you put your head an in mind to it one other thing I forgot now I just remember we said the angel comes in two forms the Angelic form and the human form the human form is the easiest because the prophet does not have to bear the weight of the different inform forms he looks human he talks like a human so he takes the Revelation from him uh with ease and without any difficulty and I believe that now we have to take a break after this refreshing break we go on to continue and talk about the difference between the Quran and other other forms of Revelations and specifically we're talking about Hadi and alith Al the word Hadith what does it mean narration also in an Arabic new new in contrast to old and Scholars Define by saying anything that is attributed to the prophet whe whether it is his rhetoric the things he says or the actions the things he does or the approval and concession if he sees something and he accepts he does not talk this is part of the Sunnah or attributes of the Prophet himself how he looks how he behaves uh the things that are specially attributed to him in his descriptionat how high how tall how short how thin how fat the color of his hair the color of his skin all of this is considered to be also a descriptive Sunnah so this is theith of the Prophet what type of is this and the prophet never ate leaning down this is this is action and when he was presented with I don't know how to translate this but it's a big lizard a desert lizard it's not a desert that you see in no it's something that's you know big I used to have my students bringing it to school they tie it from the neck and they try to you know scare it's scary if it bites it never leaves what it bites it is very horrible animal and they used to bring it to me and to bring it to the students to fear people uh to intimidate people with uh the prophet wasam was presented with this food the they say is good I never tried it myself and the prophet did not eat it and KH who was a fierce Warrior you know Warriors like you know uh the Special Forces when they're in the desert they eat anything so immediately started eating and the prophet did not comment which meant that it's it's Hal approved and in another narration the companions pulled their hands away and he told them why aren't you eating you're not eating he said this is food that is not found in my homeland I'm not used to it so I don't eat it so you can eat it as well so this is approving on something this is part of the Sunnah now whatever the prophet Alat wasam says is it inspiration or not some say yes some say no all say yes okay and what about when the prophet agreed to take ransom for the prisoners of bad was this so how do you say it is yes when I said in the beginning okay then you have to make a iction when I say was everything the prophet sallallah Al wasallam said is no okay Scholars Define and divide whatever the prophet said into two sections one is inspirational from Allah and one is from the prophet so the inspir inspired part which is the majority of whatever the prophet says this is now what the prophet makes he tries his best and comes with a conclusion if it's right it part it is part of if it's wrong immediately Allah will correct it as in the case and this to prove to you that this is from Allah not from the prophet in the case of Z he was the adopted son of the Prophet Alam and then it was abrogated and he was not allowed to have an adopted son and then he got his cousin z b j to marry him but she did not like him Z was an Arab but originally he was a slave and z b j was a prominent woman from qur with a name and a reputation so to marry this slave it was the instruction of the Prophet she accepted but they could not get along both are great Companions of the Prophet but marriage is not something to do with being great or not great it's chemistry if there is no chemistry and Zade used to complain to the prophet prophet of Allah he's doing this she's doing that we're not happy and the prophet is telling him stay with her keep her she's a good woman Allah how do you say this he subhanahu wa taala told his companion in sort of a harsh way that you are concealing in you what Allah will reveal and you are fearing people and Allah is more worthy for you to fear what was the prophet fearing Allah told him that Zade will not continue in his marriage with Zab he will divorce her and you will marry her the prophet was shocked it is unacceptable in Arabia to marry your stepdaughter because he is the son of the Prophet the adopted son of the prophet and Allah wanted to completely abrigate and annihilate this idea that an adopted son is a real son no he's not there's no adoption in Islam and to prove this the Muhammad Alam will marry his so-called stepdaughter no one who compiles his biography or write something would say this against himself this shows you that this is from Allah so what the prophet didam Allah corrected immediately when the blind man what's his name ABD when he came and the prophet was talking to the dignitaries of qur you know prominent people the prophet Alam saw him the man said teach me the prophet Alam wanted to talk to the dignitaries of qur because they had hundreds and thousands of people following them this blind man now you frown in his face because he comes to you so Allah immediately corrected this likewise in the in The Ransom of the prisoners of the battle of bad so this is the we go on to thei what is is the things that the prophet relate to Allah by saying Allah said and this is not the Quran he said or Allah inspired me to tell you so is different than he he never says I say whatever the prophet says this is the prophet says Allah told me so and so for example I am so independent that people would associate others with me whoever Associates others with me I will leave him and his shik Allah accepts only what is purely for him he does not accept anyone to associate others with him he's the sole creator of the heavens and the Earth how can he accept you offering something to him and to someone else he accepts only what's being offered to him the almighty Allah so this is thei so what's the difference between and the Quran well the Quran is challenging and miraculous Allah challenged us the humans to bring a Surah three verses only three verses is it difficult we have so many poets so many eloquent people no one has succeeded in producing using three verses while the is not miraculous because the wording is not challenging so someone can come and say and when you hear it you know that it's not Quran but you cannot say whether it's Hadith it's a Hadith it can have some wisdom in it but it cannot be a Quran you know the power of the Quran Al is not always while the Quran must be what is the meaning of continuous a large number of narrators narrated it in theth did you do I don't think so is the science that governs the Hadith how it's reported how it's uh um translated how it's transformed from one place to the other transmitted from one place to the other oh he gave him a gift this is a gift from the brother whoever gives a a nice and and correct answer in the Hadith we have classifications"
