  "transcript": "[Music] The topic as announced is about marriage and it depends how you look at marriage. It can be a blessing and to some it may be a menace. It depends on uh uh if you're married or not. Those who are not married definitely think of it as a blessing. Those who are married but unhappy in their marriage would look at it at a in a cynical way. Before we start, who's married among us? Raise your hands please. Mashallah. Mashallah. and the rest are not married. There is a hadith that states that the worst among you Muslims are those who are not married. The worst among the Muslims are the bachelors. But this is a fabricated. So alhamdulillah that we don't have anything serious against this but it is something that is to be uh considered and to be reckoned with. Marriage is a blessing of allahel. It's a favor from Allah subhana wa ta'ala upon those whom he favors them with. And this is mentioned clearly in the Quran. Allahel says in the Quran and among his signs is this that he created for you wives from among yourselves that you may find repose in them. And he has put between you affection and mercy. Verely in that are indeed signs for the for a people who reflect. Three things are mentioned in this ayah. Repose, reflection, and mercy. Any marriage that has these three ingredients is a successful marriage. And any marriage does that does not have this in it, it is a disaster. It's a tribulation. It's a calamity. It is a trial from Allahel. And it's best for you if you are unable to attain these things to call it off because this is not something that you should continue to have. The essence of marriage is to have repose, repose and to have affection and mercy. But if the husband is dominating and he has no mercy in his heart or if he does not show his affection to his wife or if he goes into the house and the misses does this go to the sisters? Do we have sisters? I could I could know my limits. If the sister the minute her husband walks in starts to nag to demand things and she makes his life hell. This is not a marriage. This is solidity confinement. And he has to look for a way out. He has to escape from this prison. And it might be the same for the girl, for the woman, for the wife. But generally speaking, marriage is a favor and blessing from allahel. We're going to list number of the benefits of marriage. So that those who do not have a wife would be encouraged to look for one and those who have a wife may be encouraged to look for another one or this is haram. Of course this is halal. And I don't know about your country but is the demand greater than uh the supply or the opposite? The opposite. The supply is a lot. Yeah. You have lots of sisters who are unmarried. Who will marry them? Definitely we have to find a solution because if it if if she was my sister, if she was my daughter and she's not married, I definitely want her to get married even to someone who has another wife because half a man is better than no man. And he's not a half a man. He's a fullfledged man but meaning of the time and not of the finance. This is not our topic. Let's keep it happy. Huh? This is our happy hour in in Islamic sense. That is so one of the benefits of marriage is that those who get married they have accomplished a lot in Islam by getting married. Is this possible? Yes. The prophet says when a person gets married, he has completed half of his religion. So let him feel Allah with regard to the other half. When I get married, I get half of my my religion fulfilled and completed. The the scholars say, \"Yes, the hadith is crystal clear. It's a explain it to me.\" Scholars say that the problems that Muslims face are caused by two things. The desires of the mouth and the desires of their uh what do you call it? Chastity or private parts or whatever. So if you get married this is blocked. One would be cynically say well I'm married but I'm I'm unable to avoid haram. I still watch porn. I still go to chat rooms. I still uh flirt with women. You sick with with all due respect. Allahel has favored you, has given you. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala had provided for you the means of protecting your necessity. You are but you still have you're looking somewhere else. Then the problem is in you because the prophet told us that is he told us that when once you fulfill your sexual desire you will not be willing to look elsewhere. The prophet tells us in the authentic hadith whenever one of you sees a woman that he likes or desires by accident of course not by will. If you walk in the street and you see something you like, the prophet told us, \"Go back to your wife because she has what that woman has, it's a little bit frank and it's a little bit too clear, but at the end of the day, this is reality. It's they're all the same. So once you fulfill your desire, anyone any man who fulfills his desire after fulfilling his desire for few hours or maybe for few days he's not even willing to look at the most beautiful woman. He's almost about to throw up. So you have to appreciate this gift from allahel. It's half of your religion. The other half comes from what you consume. Whether it is materialistic things, food and drink or if it is of sentimental value of ribba, of interest, of uh uh bribes of haram, you just keep on collecting it and and in Islam it's it's eating haram. Actually, you're not eating it. You're gaining it. You are dealing with it. But it is considered also to be that one of the benefits of being married is that you protect your chest. The prophetat wasam, \"Oh young men,\" and he's addressing the Shabb, the youngsters, \"Oh young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married.\" affording it comes in two meanings. Financially and physically. All the youngsters who say physically we're fit. We're overqualified. Not not only fit, he said we're overqualified. Find a solution. So the prophet says then it has to do with financing it. So if you're capable of finding the means to get married, then you should do so for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding one's chestity. And this is a fact. Those who are married, they don't go around uh uh looking left and right. They're it's much easier for them to lower their gaze because they've tasted what marriage is. and they are happy with what Allahel has given them. Or even those who are not happy with what Allah has given them, they're still content in the sense that alhamdulillah their desire was fulfilled. The prophet says, \"And whoever cannot afford it?\" I get tons of males of students from the UK saying, \"Is masturbation halal? Can we do this? Can we do that? We have a lot of fna, we have this and that.\" And the answer is no. What is the ruling? What can we do? The prophet says, \"Whoever cannot afford it, let him fast. Fasting is difficult. Entering hell is more. Being punished in fire is more. You don't sin. You don't want to be there because you know that allahel is going to punish you for sinning. So you fast and this keeps your im intact. It grows the amount of chessity and it helps you to lower your gaze. The prophet says, \"Let him fast for it will be a shield for him.\" And this hadith was uh reported in Bkhari Muslim. So it's an agreed upon hadith. Part of the points that one should pay attention to is that getting married is part of the sunnah of all messengers of Allah. So all messengers of Allah were married before. Even Jesus well this is something we cannot tell because we don't have evidence whether he got married or not. But we know that he will descend and he will get married and he will have offspring of his own. The pro uh uh the prophet said or actually allahel says about his prophets and indeed we sent messengers before you Muhammad wasam and made for them wives and offsprings. So always when you do something have this in your intention that I'm following the sunnas of the messengers of Allah. So it would become a double reward marriage by itself and your intention of following the sunnah. And of course if it's the sunnah of the messengers of Allah it is also the sunnah of the greatest messenger of Allah and that is our prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam. Did the prophet marry? Yes. And he married a number of women who are our mothers. And when the prophet wasallam had three of his companions going and asking his wives about the forms of worship that the prophetam offered and they told them that well he does this and that. They belittled it. They thought that okay the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has been forgiven all of his previous sins and not only that even the coming sins. So he's not like us. We need forgiveness. We need a lot of good deeds. So one of them stood up and said, \"I will pray the whole night without sleeping.\" The second one said, \"I will fast and I'll never break my fast. Every single day I will fast. The whole year.\" And the third one who was the luckiest said, \"Well, I'll not marry. I will not marry at all.\" And when the prophet heard about this wasam, he got outraged and he went to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he praised Allah and he said that why do people say so and so and so by Allah I fast and I break my fasting. I pray and I sleep and I marry women. Whoever chooses a way or a path or a sunnah other than mine then he is not from me. meaning that he's not following my sunnah. So those who live a life of uh how do you c celibacy whatever you know what I mean those who live a life like that this is permissible it's not permissible because you're going against the sunnah of the prophetatam and you have to get married but this depends again on uh uh the Five rulings that apply to marriage. Marriage can be mandatory. It can be recommended. It can be halal, permissible. It can be not recommended and it can be haram depending on the individual. And we will not go into this inshallah. Now, if you ask any of the people, what is the most thing that you want in this world? Some would say I I I I want a house mortgage free. One would say I'd like a a Porsche 911 Turbo S4 to whatever convertible preferably. Others would say I'd like a big position. But the prophet is indicating to us the best thing in this world that is worldly connection and he says sallallahu alaihi wasallam this world is transient comforts. This is something that you enjoy but it is soon to go and disappear. And the best of the comforts of this world is a righteous woman. This was reported by Muslim. Imagine that you complete half of your dean and you fulfill your desires and you get the best in this world when you marry a righteous and and and and Allah feeding woman. By marrying, you're not only doing something that pleases Allah. You're doing something that can have benefit for you in this world as well. One would say, \"A I'm poor. I'm a student. I can barely get the money to go to college.\" Now, it's £9,000, right? University for the for the university. So, I can barely get the money. and I'm trying to get a loan and it's all interest based loans and and you want me to get married? Well, if you have the sincere intention of getting married for the sake of preserving your chestity for the the the intent with the intention of pleasing allahel, Allah will help you. You have to believe in this. You have to have the conviction that this is a fact. The prophet tells us in the authentic there are three who are all entitled to Allah's help. Who are they? One, the one who fights for the sake of Allah. Allah will help him. Two, who wants to pay the price of his freedom. Do you know who who is alk is a slave in Islam? PWS are not sent into Guantanamo. PWS are sold and distributed to Muslims so that they serve in their houses and they become slaves. If they accept Islam, alhamdulillah, but they're still slaves. And it is one of the greatest means of converting them to Islam. when they live with the Muslims in their houses and they see how they deal, they turn into Islam and this captivity becomes the main source of them entering paradise. And that is why in the authentic hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said, \"I am astonished for seeing people being dragged into paradise with chains in their necks and hands. Who are these people? The prisoners of war who were non-Muslims. They were captive. The chains were put in their necks and into in in their hands. After a while, they accepted Islam. These chains caused them to enter paradise. So it is for their sake. It is for the best of their interest. However, in Islam, alhamdulillah, there is a way of freeing themselves. You know that all our experations on top of the list is always free a slave. So, Islam does not promote slavery. On the contrary, it promotes freeing them. If you say wall, I will do this tomorrow and you're unable to do it or you want to break your promise, what do you do? Free a slave. If you have intercourse during the day of Ramadan while fasting, what is the penalty? Free a slave. If you kill someone by mistake, you must free a slave. If you say to your wife that I will not touch you and you are like my mother, you have to free a slave. It goes on and on and on. Subhan Allah. So, al- Muk is a person who wants to free himself, but he doesn't have any money. So he goes to his master and says, \"Master, I will buy myself from you. How much do you want?\" He said, \"I I need £2,000.\" He said, \"Okay.\" In a duration of 10 months. So the man goes and works outside and collects money until he's capable of gathering 2,000 and giving it to his master and then he becomes free. This second person, Allahel will help him. The third one is a person who gets uh married seeking chastity. So if this is your intention, allahel would help you not only financially but through all the aspects because marriage is important in Islam. Allahel will help you financially. Allah will provide for you if you want to get married. It is a means and source of income. Marriage is a source of income. Do you believe in this or it's a source of spending money unwisely? When you look at the weddings, when you look at the dowies that people pay, when you look at the conditions that the uh uh woman's family put you, this is ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Islam. It has to do with customs. It has to do with anything but other than Islam. It is a means of income to get married. Allahel says in the Quran and marry those among you who are single and the pious the pious fit and capable ones of your male slaves and made servants female slaves if they be poor Allah will enrich them out of his bounty. This is Allah's words in So Allah is promising that if they were to be poor, Allahel would provide for them. Now those who are not married, you have to believe in the Quran. You don't have the means, allahel would provide for you. But the problem is sometimes we put forward a lot of conditions and we put obstacles that may hinder the process. So now you're poor, you're a student, you don't have money, but you want her to be the most beautiful woman on earth. She knows Bkari and Muslim by heart of course and the Quran with seven and before she uh started practicing Islam she used to be a baller or whatever she dances the bal she's our greatest viol vist and she did this and subhan Allah what are you what you're looking for is in Jenna not here and the guy has nothing to show for what he's asking for but still No, when you want to get married, you want to preserve and protect your chastity. So, don't put conditions. I'd like her to be this height, this uh uh fair color, this uh level of education, and preferably she provides for me. I can come four or five times a year and and and this is this is not the thing that you want to do. You want to preserve your chestity, take a a wife that would fulfill this. But once you put this, then you have a problem. Among the benefits of marriage is those who are married are usually mentally fitter than those who are not. And why do I say usually? Because sometimes the MS just, you know, blows your mind away with her nagging, with her constant uh abuse, mental abuse. And the sisters, mah, they're extremely well educated in how to poke you and and and abuse you in ways that you don't know. You can't anticipate. Now, of course, the sisters are boiling and said they want to the the men definitely have this in them, but they have an extra edge. They do it even physically. And by allahel, the these are not among the best of the Muslims. They are among the worst of Muslims. It is a means of reward to be good to your wife. And the prophet tells us the best among you to their wives are the best among the Muslims. So you are the one who is supposed to go the extra mile. And you the one who's supposed to be tolerant and uh uh uh trying your best to uh um how do you say incubate or not? It's not a good word. Not incubate. Don't try to spell it. You have to do your best to cater for your wife's needs and and to tolerate her any of the wrong things that she does. In a study of 35,000 cases, and this is done over 15 countries, Dr. Kate Scott, not a Muslim of Otago Willington University in New Zealand, concluded after this thorough study that marriage helps in reducing depression and uh psychological pressure. Allahel had made repose between the spouses. What did the prophetat wasallam when he saw the archangel peace be upon him and he told him and he said I'm not going to recite and you know the whole story when he came back home to his wife Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her and we know that a lot of men has have have reached perfection among the women only four had reached this level of perfection. They are no she's not one of them. Khadijah and may Allah be pleased with them. So Khadijah was one of them. What did she have more than the others? The minute the prophet came trembling, shaking, afraid of what he had seen because he saw Gibl peace be upon him on his throne in the original form that Allah had created him. What was the original form? The prophet said, I saw him on his throne blocking the horizon. Okay, my horizon is this big. When you're in a desert, what can block your horizon? It has to be extremely huge. He said he had 600 wings from these wings. Pearls, emeralds, rubies and precious stones are falling down. So he came back home shaking and shivering, afraid. What did Khadijah say? Why did you come now? Why are you late? Why didn't you bring the groceries? Why didn't you do this? Why you you always make up make make something up so that I would feel sorry. No. Subhan Allah. She never did anything like that. She She immediately brought him something to cover him with. What kind of love is this? If I come home with a fever and I look tired, pale, yellow, I'm originally yellow. What What What's wrong with that? And I come home and my wife says, \"You always do this just because you know that you're supposed to go out for dinner. You never want us in the in the first place you take us out. You always make up these things. Don't pretend. There is no affection. There's no mercy.\" When I see her carrying the dishes and she trembles and fall, I said, \"Alhamdulillah.\" Exactly as planned. What kind of of of love is this? Is this is there any love? No. But there is no affection. There's no mercy. Khadijah subhan Allah immediately said what's wrong? And when he told her, she said do not be afraid. By Allah, allahel will not turn you down because you do this, you do this, you do this, you do this. She started listing things that would give him courage and confidence, restore the confidence in himself. This is a real wife. This is a real woman with such a woman. Would you ever be feel depressed or psychologically pressured by Allah? No. That is why you find those who are happily married would always share their secrets, not their sins, previous sins. One of the brother came to me and said wallah made a big mistake. Why? said, \"After 15 years of marriage, I went to my wife in a in a moment of, you know, transparency. We were happy drinking coffee and and I told her, \"Listen, I had an affair before I got married.\" And all hell broke loose. It's been a week now. I'm I'm unable to sleep. And of You're crazy. You are you crazy whether you're a man or a woman to go and tell your spouse about your previous uh life. This is haram Islamically because Allah concealed your sins and now you are exposing them. So this is the wife you look for, the wife you talk to and share with her your secrets and your problems and your worries. And likewise you also listen to what she has to say about things that occupy her mind, things that bother her. and you give her the uh uh uh repose that you should both exchange together. How much time is that? Okay, there's more than enough. Among the benefits of marriage, it uh is means of getting reward from Allah that those who are not married cannot get. So the only way to get such rewards from Allah is through what? Getting married. Such as one the prophet tells us in an authentic hadith that when a man has intimacy intercourse with his wife he's rewarded. Now the brothers who are married know let's call the misses. It's your right. This is your right completely. The me the the companions were you know their minds were blown out. Prophet of Allah we enjoy our desire we fulfill our desire and we reward it. And the prophet said yes if you put it in sin if you put it in would you be sinful? He said they said yes. He said likewise if you put it in halal it is a means of charity and a reward. What kind of religion do you have? It is beauty. You enjoy life. You're not supposed to put yourself in a box and bury yourself. Enjoy life to the fullest. And Allah reward you for that. All what he asks from you subhana is that you worship him and stay away from. Is that much to ask? The prophet saysam, \"Avoid forbidden things and you'll become the most righteous person on earth.\" Subhan Allah. You want to be become a good righteous person. Avoid sin. You don't have to pray night prayers six, seven hours. You don't have to give all of your money to charity. Avoid sin. Among the things that only married people can enjoy and and get rewarded for the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam. No matter what you spend on your family that is wife, you will be rewarded even the morsel of food you put in your wife's mouth. Imagine if you have a good intention every day you go and buy groceries. What do you do when you come home with two big full bags of of of grocery? The wife sees this mashallah father of so and so in Arab you say Abu Abdah Abu Muhammad you know beautiful nicknames. So she says mashallah for may Allah grant you re reward you and grant you more money on for what you spend on us. What the man what does man say? It cost me £75 and 28 piece and he puts the receipt. Why are you doing this? Why are you rubbing it rubbing it in? You just want to make it bad for your uh wife. She's thanking you. The least you could do is say, \"May Allah reward you as well.\" Why do you have to show her that I've spent so much on the grocery? You're you're the one who's going to eat it. If you anticipate the reward from Allah for the morsel you put in her mouth, Allahel will consider will put this for you as a a charity. Now, when was the last time I asked some some of the brothers, when was the last time you put a morsel in your uh uh uh wife's mouth? He said, uh 25 years ago on our wedding night, we exchanged capes. That is it. So, okay, why don't you do it now? You crazy. She'll bite my fingers. There is so much dryness in our relationships with our spouses. The prophetat was whenever peace with her took a bite from a piece of meat, he used to take it from her and watches where her teeth were and he eats from the same place. And whenever she drunk milk from the cup, he would turn the cup and puts her puts his lips on the same place where she drank from. Look at the love. I know gazillion of cases where the husband says to his wife, \"Go and get me a spoon so that I can eat.\" She says, \"Use my spoons.\" You crazy. Go wash it first. What is this? What What are you doing? Where is the love? And then say, I don't know where the love has gone. I I know where the love has gone. It went down the drain when she washed the spoon she ate with. You have a problem and you have to fix that problem. It's means of reward in Islam. The prophet tells us the best of you are those best to their wives. So if you're not married, you cannot have this reward because you don't have any wife to uh be good to. The prophetam also indicated that among the benefits of marrying is when you marry a virgin and the prophet told be pleased with him and with his father when he saw him and he told him did you get married he said yes. So he asked him to a virgin or a non- virgin and he said no to a non virgin and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh why not a virgin that you would play with and she would play with you. A virgin is different than a non virgin and this is not the suitable time to elaborate but Jabar explained himself. He said, \"A prophet of Allah, my father was martyed in battle and he left half a dozen of girls and I did not want to bring another girl to them.\" So they're all makes them seven. I needed someone who was mature, who was experienced in life so that she would take care of my sisters. And the prophet uh supplicated that may Allahel uh bless his marriage. Among the benefits of or the the means of reward that you only can get from uh being married is the prophetatam uh he said that all that does not have in it is amusement. So whatever we do that does not have football, it's amusement. There's no reward in it if you do it. There is sin in it if you do it at times of prayer and you skip prayer or if you're wearing shorts or if you are a professional and breaking others people's legs. Some of the the brothers mashallah they don't know how to play football. They only they don't see the ball actually. They only see legs. So they just intent on you know attacking people. So this is a sin by itself. So the prophet saysam all that does not have in it is amusement except for if he mentioned that one of them is playing or having intimacy with your spouse with your wife or with the spouse if she is doing that to her husband subhan Allah it's means of reward though it has no vic in of allahel but because it preserves both spouses chastity and uh uh helps them. Among the benefits of zavage of marriage that you cannot get except in marriage is the reproduction. And in Islam, it is an important aspect. In Islam, we're instructed, we're ordered to have as many children as we can. Nowadays, people in in in in UK, I think if they have one, alhamdulillah, house is more than enough. Maybe they have two, a boy and a girl. Oh, you have it made block all means and and and do it surgically or or whatever ways possible. A boy and a girl is enough. No, the more you have children, the better a Muslim you are. Of course, providing that you give them a a good life and you bring them up in an Islamic way, not reproduce and throw on the streets and and and don't know who you understand. What's your name? Ahmed. How old are you? I'm six. Not seeing you. We have people who have lots and lots of children and they don't know any thing about them. I know a brother who has children. You're going to ask him this son of yours which year is he at school said don't ask him you don't know what level your your son is no this is haram you should take care of your children uh reproduction is the dawa the supplication of and Ibraim peace be upon them they asked allahelah granted them children when they were extremely old so it you keep on. One of the brothers says, \"I'm 60 years old. I don't have children.\" Don't give up. Keep on asking Allahel. Ibraim had his first child when he was like 70, 80 years old. So, you still have 20 years to to go. Keep on asking Allah and Allah would reward you uh uh with his grace. Uh the hadith of prophet 10 minutes you just said 45 minutes. What is this? Time traveling. Okay. Yeah, I I'll I don't read I I'll try my best. Peace be upon him, a king and a prophet had 100 wives and he said by Allah I will sleep with them all and I will have 100 fighters in the cause of allahel. So look at his intention. What is his intention? to have fun, to have children, to have men that would serve the cause of allahel of his uh uh religion. One of the greatest things of reproduction is that after your death, your legacy continues through a righteous son. And the prophet told us when someone dies all of his deeds are stopped except one two three and one of them was a righteous son that supplicates for his father. And of course among you all inshallah are those righteous son who do this to their parents. A man by the name of Mahar may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophetam and he said that oh prophet of Allah I found a woman who is of good lineage and she's beautiful but she does not have children should I marry her the prophet said noam and the man repeated his question again the prophet said no and repeated it twice and the prophet said no and then the prophet said marry those who are loving and fertile it is an essential thing in marriage that you reproduce. You have children. One would say, \"How can I know if my wife to be is fertile? Should I take it for a test drive, for example? How would I know she if she's fertile or not?\" Well, the scholars say that this is known through looking at her relatives. So if she has sisters and her sisters mah all have children this means that the possibility is far greater that she would also be fertile. But if she has three sisters and none of them was able to have children then you should refrain. And this does not mean it's haram to marry someone who does not have children. No. But she is not your first option. She can be your second option. And if you have a a wife and you have children and you marry her, this is quite uh permissible inshallah. Uh there's so much to say, but among the benefits of marriage, you don't have this here maybe, but we have it in Arabia a lot, is to have in-laws. Maybe it's a menace here to have in-laws. In Saudi Arabia, we're proud in Arabia. Generally speaking, we proud to have in-laws. When I marry a a woman and she has brothers and she has relatives, c cousins and nephews, it makes me a stronger person. It's it makes me more uh uh honorable person to have so many people knowing me and connecting with me. So, I do them favors. They'll do me favors. But if I'm on my own, this would not be uh possible. And finally uh among the benefits of marriage is the protection of the society. A society that the people do not get married in they will have a lot of tribulation. The prophet saidatam if there comes to you to propose for marriage to your daughter one with whose religious commitment and character you are pleased then marry your daughter to him. For if you do not do that, there will be tribulation fitna on earth and widespread corruption uh on earth. And this is obvious after the second world war in countries like Germany, France where a lot of the men have perished and died. There were a lot and a lot of women available and due to the fact that only one man took one woman you had surplus and it's natural that women have to beautify themselves have to fulfill their natural desires and this caused in the widespread of prostitution and a lot of marital problems. Islam fights this. Islam gives you the solution. It gives you the alternative in such cases. And with this I conclude my talk and I also invite you all to get married. It's a better a bitter sweet experience. You with the grace of Allah if you have good intention it will always be sweet. And not only that, there are lots and lots of things that should follow and that is responsibilities, obligations and rights of the spouses over each other. But this inshallah we will come to uh talk about with the grace of Allah on our seminar on marriage on a Sunday inshallah."
