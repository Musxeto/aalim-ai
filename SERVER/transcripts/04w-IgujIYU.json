  "transcript": "smelly Hammond over him and hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen well shadow la ilaha illa-llah who had the hula Cheri Keller ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in am a bird dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh among the most famous women around the prophet alayhi salat wa salam is his beloved daughter fatima bint mohammed sallallahu alehiwassallaam the daughter of hadiza went to Hue lit may allah be pleased with her and with her mother she was born five years before the revelation which means that she was 18 years old when the prophet Isaiah migrated to Medina she was the youngest of the prophets and he saw sons daughters and we all know that usually the youngest of our children are the most beloved to our hearts we tend to care for them love them give them more affection than any of the other children because they the youngest they're the most vulnerable and this is human nature with Fatima it was different though it was human nature but she had a character that made the prophet alayhi salatu salam loved her more and more at an early age she used to defend the Prophet Alice of Salaam and take care of him even after the death of her mother may Allah be pleased with her Khadija she took care of her own father caring for him catering for his needs Abdullah namazu tells us about an incident that just gives you a glimpse of what caliber this great woman was made of he said that when we were in Mecca the Prophet came allahís alot of Salaam to the Masjid prostrated to allah azza wajal during prayer so the Prophet prayed on his own he's a Muslim to them he's an infidel to the idol worshipers so he prayed on his own minding his own business and when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prostrated abu jahil may Allah curse him the pharaoh of this ummah talked to his companions and said who among you would go to the house of so-and-so and get the placenta of their camel so one of them aqua Allah made me a locker Sam went there and took that center and all the dirt that was attached to it and while the Prophet was prostrating Ali salatu salam on the ground facing the kaabah in the sacred Masjid of Mecca the Masjid al-haram he came and placed it on his head and back the Prophet alehissallaam was not startled he did not move he continued in his position of sujood abdullah al masud who was a companion Muslim he said none of us could do anything we were weak we were vulnerable we did not have anyone to protect us had we stood and objected to that so we remain silent with our hearts being torn apart but being unable to do or say anything until someone went to the prophet's house had insulin and informed Fatima who was a child of maybe seven nine years of age she came running removed that filth from her father's back and had and addressed the dignitaries of Quraysh this little girl addressing these fearless warriors saying to them may Allah curse you swearing at them cursing them and it shows you how strong she was even at an early age and the story as you all know from the serie that the Prophet lysozyme concluded this prayer and then he started to make dua against them by saying o Allah destroy Quraysh oh Allah destroy Quraysh oh Allah destroy crush and they went into silence mode because they hated it when someone made dua in the Masjid against them and they knew that Allah would respond and then he made Doris if eclis on these tyrants allah ma li ka b JN o Allah destroy Abu jahil never be ashamed never be our Al Waleed neretva Oh Mahalo but never my and the rest of the gang abdullah al masud says later on on the Battle of whether I saw all of those whom he made against killed and thrown in a well in better faatima may Allah be pleased with her is also nicked named as as Zahara and there is not a single authentic hadith authenticating that she is to be called like this yet great scholars of Islam such as a mammoth they're happy in I mean Noah we a ma'am even kefir a member even had jar and many more used to always call her Fatima to Zara therefore Sahara means the one with the white and illuminating or shining face so there's no harm in calling her with such a name Fatima as we all know got married to the cousin of her father Ali bin Abi Talib so the Prophet has some and Ali were cousins and we know that among the children Ali was the first to accept Islam and he was raised in the house of the Prophet era so Salam so later on when they migrated to Medina he went to speak to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he used to be not afraid but sort of having this respect great respect to the Prophet and I saw some that intimidated him in a sense so he says about himself when I went in and sought permission to speak to the Prophet alle sammen I was allowed to I was baffled I couldn't say a word I didn't know what to say so it was the prophet who and I said are you coming here to propose to Fatima and that was a relief he said yes so he said what are you giving her as a dowry this is his beloved daughter so it has to be something worthwhile I only said I don't have a thing and Ali was Stone broke because his father abu talib though was he was one of the dignitaries of Quraysh but he has had so many children and not a lot of property or income so Ali inherited literally nothing so the Prophet asked him what about your I'll helped me the shield that you had and it was of the value of 400 dirhams not not a lot she said yes I still have it so the Prophet said give it to her as a dowry and they were Wed simple dowry a simple wedding a simple furniture of the house it was only a small mattress and a pillow filled with sponge or such a material and two jars and one grinder where they put the grain to make it or change it into flour that's it this is the house of the daughter of the Prophet himself Ali salatu salam yes this is the house of the mistress of Jenna the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam said in an authentic hadith this is an angel coming down for the first time in his life requesting permission from Allah to give Salam and to give the glad tiding that fatima is the mistress of all women of Jenna and that al-hasan and al-husayn there are the masters of the youth of the people of Jannah subhanAllah the rear tone bar Muhammad what a blessed progeny what a blessed lineage she was the daughter of the Prophet Allah thought so without any doubt and she had a happy life with Adi what we know is that she had the famous al-hasan and al-husayn whom the descendants of the Prophet array sought some come from them but a lot of us don't know that she gave birth to five children Hasan and Husayn Merson and she also was or gave birth to two daughters Uncle Tom and zina uncle Thome was married to Roma in the hot tub when he was extremely old and she was extremely young her father Ali gave her in marriage because Homer wanted to keep a lineage between him and the Prophet Allah sjostrom through marrying her and she gave birth to his son Zane so five children she gave in the span of nine years may Allah be pleased with her and we know the status of it Hasan and Husayn in the prophet's heart alehissalaam salam fatima used to be nekked name also by omaha the mother of her father how is that possible how can a woman be the mother of her father this means that she was caring for him and she loved him like a son not as a father she had so much love for the Prophet Elisha and care since a very young age and it would be no doubt to us when we hear how mother aisha may allah be pleased with her described her she said no one resembled the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam in the way he looks in the way he talks in the way he walks more than fatima whatever she stood up or sat down that you could tell that this is the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and whenever she would enter a room where the Prophet Haslam was sitting he would stand up for fatima and he would kiss her and he would make her sit in his seat in his place and whenever the Prophet would enter a room where fatima is she would stand up for him kiss him and she would make him sit where she was sitting fatima was a patient wife acknowledging that she is the mistress of the women of paradise acknowledging that her father is the best man Allah ever created and the most beloved to Allah Almighty yet this did not make her arrogant she was an excellent wife a superior mother and she used to work in her own home with her own hands without the assistance of a servant until it made a impact on the palms of her hands it became rough like a man's hands so I highly advise her may Allah be pleased with him to go and ask from your father a slave from all the slaves that the Muslims have so that she can serve you and help you with the shores when she went the Prophet SSM who had all the means to do that directed her and him Ali to something that was better first of all he did not want to do any favors for them just for their relationship to him secondly he wanted to tell them and show them that life is not worth all of that and thirdly he directed the ohm at large to something that was beneficial and that would grant them the energy to behave and act so he came to them just before they went to sleep and he taught them to say subhanAllah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times Allahu Akbar 34 times the total is a hundred saying it as you are lying on your bed as part of your bedtime at car would be more beneficial for you than having a servant to assist you in your work even taymiyah and many scholar said that whoever observes this vicar before going to bed at night allah azza wajal would grant him the power and energy and the agility to do what is needed to be done with a helping hand subhanAllah and in this hadith it shows clearly as a memory says and others that the Prophet Allison did not order Heidi to provide his wife with a servant because this is not her right when it came to dowry though he can postpone the dowry make it in installments delay it a year or two he insisted that he gives gives her his shield a hot Mia because this is mandatory but for the servant he did not even ask Kylie to provide her with one because outside or external service it is the man's duty inside or the internal service of the house it is the woman's responsibility and duty Fatima was a woman whom the prophet alayhi salatu salam entrusted her with secrets and she would never reveal the prophet's secrets aisha tells us when the prophet well his son was on his deathbed Aisha came and we can barely miss the way she walks resembling it to the way the Prophet walks Alison it's almost identical when the prophet saw her say he said hello my daughter must have an ability and he made her sit next to him and then he whispered something in her ears and she cried and wept heavily and when the prophet saw Ali saw some how distressed she was he whispered something again in her ears and she laughed so how I went to her and said what did the Prophet Elias awesome tell you fatima said I would never disclose and expose a secret prophet sallallaahu l'm told me and later on the Prophet Alakazam passed away after his death Aisha went again to Fatima and said now the Prophet is gone now the Prophet is dead sallallahu alaihi wa sallam tell me what he whispered in your ears Fatima said as of now you're right he's dead so I am at liberty to say and disclose it the Prophet told me that every Ramadan gibreel revises the Quran with him once except this last Ramadan he revised the Quran with him twice and I feel that this is my year that I will die in so I wept and cried being sad to depart my father then he whispered in my ear again telling me won't you be happy to know that you are the mistress of the women of Jena and I laughed in another narration if I do not I hope I recall correctly he said to her that you are the first of my family to die after me and she died six months later as we know how was her relationship with her so-called stepmothers she had nine of them may Allah be pleased with them all the mothers are the believers they all loved and respected Fatima even when they needed someone to mediate between them and the Prophet and they would send Fatima mother Aisha said that one day the other wives of the Prophet Allah saw some sent Fatima to ask the Prophet Ali saw - Salam to be fair with all of them his wives include ayesha because as you remember men of medina used the people of medina used to send their gifts to the prophet alayhi salatu salam food and other stuffs when he was at ayisha's day and house and when he went to other houses they would not send a thing to them so they sent fatima asking and demanding that the prophet our son put an end to such a practice because it's unfair for us and it wasn't the Prophet who was asking for it it was the people who were doing it from their own selves so fatima went and said o prophet of allah as she was sitting Oh prophet of Allah my father your wives are demanding justice so the Prophet looked at her and said my daughter don't you love what I love and Fatima said by Allah I love what you love Oh o prophet of Allah so the Prophet said oh my daughter I love her meaning I love Aisha and I did not do any injustice it's the people who are giving it to me so why would I stop people from doing that so she went back to the wives of the Prophet and told them about the incident so they objected and told her you didn't do anything for us go back again and speak to him and demand justice fatima says by Allah I'll never speak to him about this subject again in my life now the incident that a lot of the Muslims know about is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prohibited ali from taking a second wife and they always spread this among the people saying oh look if the Prophet our son prohibited Riley from taking a second wife then you son-in-law are not allowed to take a second wife and your wife has all the right to be mad and jealous and refused this and that this is misunderstood incident you have to look into the hadith and understand it as the scholars had and not improvise or come up with opinions that are baseless the story goes that the family of abu jahil the pharaoh of this ummah and the enemy of Islam and the Muslims proposed to Ali to marry the daughter of Abu jahil so he was contemplating about it and when this reached the Prophet array salat WA Salam he became angry and he addressed the people saying that my first son-in-law bellossom de la fere proposed and was truthful to me and fulfilled his pledge to me meaning he did not take another wife over his daughter Zainab may Allah be pleased with her and now I hear that Holly wants to combine the daughter of the messenger of allah that is fatima alongside the daughter of the enemy of allah the daughter of abu jahil by allah this hurts fatima and whatever hurts fatima hurts me as she is part of me and a flesh of mine by allah i do not make halahala or Haram hala meaning that marriage is holid I'm not making it prohibited but due to the fact that hurting fatima hurts the prophet and we know that hurting the Prophet Isom is an act of apostasy therefore the Prophet Isis am prevented such a marriage due to the reasons that he had given you are not the prophet of Allah to be hurt by your daughter's hurting and your daughter is not the daughter of the messengers of Allah and the one your son-in-law is getting married to is not the daughter of the enemy of Allah so all of these justifications and conditions clarifies why the Prophet I so am prohibited idly from marrying someone else when did fatima die fatima may allah be pleased with her died in the month of ramadan six months or less after the death of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam and when she was on her deathbed Asma been to amaze me Allah be pleased with her told her that in Abyssinia she saw a practice that was very beautiful and that is they put a body over the deceased body they put something like an arch arch like a fence a key a cage over a woman's body and then they put a cloth on it so when men are carrying the deceased body no one can tell her figure her body her curves while she is lying on that piece of machinery or piece of equipment they carry disease over or on and Fatima loved the idea because it helps conceal her body shape so she made it in her will that when she dies they put this cage on her entire body and put a cloth on top of it so no one would recognize her body when she's been carried to the grave and she was the first one to do that she died and she was 29 years of age may Allah be pleased with her had their Allahu Alem when especially in merely Haslam was a little ah who was hello Nevada kinda nabina muhammad why daddy he was happy he remain assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu huraira radi aallahu anhu said that a man came to the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and said o Messenger of Allah poverty has struck me the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam sent a messenger to one of his wives to bring something for that man to eat but she said by the one who sent you with the truth I only have water he said allah alayhi wasallam sent to another one of his wives to bring something for the man to eat but she said the same until all of them said the same thing then a law's messenger salallahu alayhi wa sallam said who will take this one as a guest in exchange for a laws mercy a man from the unser said I will o Messenger of Allah so he took the man to his home and said to his wife treat the guests of Messenger of Allah well she said by Allah we have nothing except the meal for my children he said get the food ready and light the lamp and put your children to sleep if they ask for dinner then when the guest enters dim the lamp and make it seem as if we are eating and when he reaches for the food to eat then stand up to the lantern and turn it off she got the food ready turned the lamp on and put the children to sleep she then went to the lamp as if she was fixing it and turned it off then they pretended as they were eating and they both went to leave hungry in the morning the man from the unser to a las messenger sallallahu alayhi wasallam who said Allah has loft implying his acceptance to the D from your actions last night then Allah revealed his saying which means and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that reported by Al Bukhari and Muslim assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back dear viewers those who are going to give us a call kindly make sure that you turn off your television and listen to me through your earpiece or your headset so that I would not be hearing the echo okay Osama from Pakistan Osama ossama from Pakistan I don't hear the caller maybe we're facing some technical errors okay so we have a question from Ziad and Ziad says I read that lead is rajab for anyone who is not a mush to head is this true these are Islamic terminologies tallit is blindly following someone without evidence Rajab is compulsory mujtahid is the highest rank of a scholar who has the ability to look through the evidences of the Quran and the Sunnah and the previous scholars with his knowledge and detect what is the most suitable and correct opinion of all so now Said's question is I heard that blindly following a person without evidence is wajib is mandatory is that true this depends on the individual people are categorized into three levels a scholar who is a must ahead who does not imitate or blindly follow others rather he has to it's an obligation that he looks into the evidences of the Quran of the Sunnah of the in through the understanding of the favorite three generations looks into the different opinions and then comes up comes up with his own opinion that is 99.99 percent following those who came before him but he's doing that through his own observation not through cherry-picking the second and these people the most a hates the ulema they're a handful we are there few of them the second level is those who are classified as students of knowledge and students of knowledge are people with appropriate amount of knowledge but they're not classified as scholars yet so they have the basics of the English the Arabic language knowledge of the Quran of the Deaf seer of the hadith authentic or not authentic of of a soulful and the others so they come and they look and search a topic they cannot come up with their own HT hat rather they have to look into the six seven different HT hands of previous scholars and come up with a conclusion that one of them is the most authentic and they adopt this so to Khalid for such people is not permissible because they have the means to search and they have the tools that would qualify them to search the third segment of people and this is the largest of them all are the laymen who can be professors in the university medical doctors neurosurgeons engineers pilots intellectuals but their knowledge in Islamic sharia is negligible such people must follow someone or a method because Allah says in the Quran tha's who had a victory in community element you must ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so they ask and whatever the Sheikh tells them they comply without knowing the evidence because even if the share tells them the evidence they wouldn't know whether this is Quran Sunnah or just a quotation from Tom Dick or Harry they wouldn't know so in this case yes such people must follow but they must not be blind followers for a school of thought in whatever they say good or bad because on the day of judgment Allah would ask you about two things matter contempt a boon what were you worshipping meaning sincerity Allah Azza WA JAL - heat of lordship worship and the smells of fat the second question matter a jabber to mull more saline what did you answer the messengers that were sent to you so this means that you have to answer and follow the messengers and a large version knows best Osama is back again from Pakistan yes sir assalamualaikum shaikh sanam lubricator how are you sheikh three questions yes sir first question is what is the ending term of each prayer what is the and ending time of each Salah overeats a long time okay no no of all five prayers of all five frames question is yes sir and second question is after completing the Holy Quran we should make any - or not okay they third question is Sheikh is there any voluntary work if you can give me I want to learn it from him okay inshallah thank you so much ik Baraka laughing so brother Osama from Pakistan had three questions the first question what is the end time of the five daily prayers there is a hadith which is authentic where the prophet alayhi salatu salam tells us that gibreel came to him over the duration of two days the first day he prayed at the beginning of the time the second day he prayed at the end of the time and then he addressed the Prophet Elias I'm telling him that prayer time is between these two forfeiture the prayer begins at the break of dawn it's pitch black once I see the horizontal thread white thread of the Federman the day is approaching this white thread which is horizontal can be seen on the top of the mountains etc this is the beginning of fuzzy time once the whole world is lit but the Sun is not rising yet the moment the tip of the Sun surfaces the time of fire is over then the time of Lahore is when an erect object has a very small shade once the Sun heads to the west so this shade had in the direction of east this is the time of jihad and it inaugurates the time beginning for the horse a lot once the shade is equivalent to the length of the erected object to the east this is the time where lower ends and this is the time when a sir begins so a third time begins when the shade is equivalent to the length of an erect object and it continues to sunset so once the Sun sets and disappears the end of a sir is over bearing in mind that when the Sun becomes yellow and loses its brightness this is the end of the time of choice but you still can pray until the Sun sets so the male rape starts when the Sun disappears and it continues until the redness disappears in the horizon in the twilight the redness what at the position where the Sun had set there's the redness in the in the sky once the redness goes and its now speech black this is the time of Asia and the time of Asia ends when the middle of the night is due according to the Islamic calendar how to calculate this it's the middle between sunset and the break of dawn the time in between is the midnight we have Muhammad from Australia so a male constricted shell of a Cadillac now that we're praying at home a lot regards to a fuddled cellar with a Sania before so I have to give event then a coma or can I just give a coma of em pray and also if I just keep the a coma can I say the Doria that you normally say after that vein okay any more questions that's all thank you chef Monica Murphy Leanne from the US Salam aleikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh why are they come salaam wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh how are you saying I'm doing well as I can hear about a caliph ich what's gonna do for you yes sir my first question is that um can you give us some tips of how to better over email in character okay and my last question is um can you give some tips on how can we know magical on more easily you can say okay I will answer in Sharla there's a Baraka laughing so Osama from Pakistan and second question is there any Dora to be recited after finishing reciting the whole Quran as known as hotmail Quran the answer is no there is nothing prescribed by the prophet alayhi salatu salam and to my knowledge nothing prescribed by the companions may allah be pleased with him except for a hadith and this hadith was reported that an assembly Malik may Allah be pleased with him whenever he finished reciting the Quran would gather all of his offspring children and grandchildren and make dua and I'm not certain whether this is an authentic hadith or not but this is not the Sunnah of the Prophet as I am and it was not reported that other Companions used to do it so it was something Ana's came up with maybe it was his sh t hat and most likely maybe it was not an authentic hadith to follow Osama's third question is do you have any voluntary deeds that I can participate for larkey exact Allah here but I'm afraid we don't have any volunteers because we don't have an organization or a set up for volunteers all what I have is a small team of sisters have never met in my life and I don't know them and zom Allah here they take care of my YouTube my Facebook and my website in terms of organizing it and sending me the questions and managing it but other than that I'm afraid we don't have any volunteer work for you may Allah make it easy for you and for us Amina from Russia I asked me a question Sheikh yes the first one is I know passive when Greeks one would do so if I'm performing salat and then I pass when I shall stop myself and then to perform another will do when I come back should I continue my prayer from where I stopped or shall I start all over again okay second question and my second question is I watch a video where you say who grew up with us come on stop 10 minutes before it's advisable to create 10 minutes before where shall I combine is it if I combine my um Sunnah raka with my grew up we are like for example like if I want to play my sunnah prayer before so I made intention in my ad that this to like I'm coming to play it for my first sunnah prayer before zoom and my do act we're okay and the third question is concerning keeping family tied like some family member like sister blood-related sister i always try to get in contact with them but they would not reply to your message and even if you call them they would not speak your call and even if the Tiki or call the we just like they are not in the mood to speak with you and sometimes it gets so overwhelming and I get annoyed should I continue contacting them for the sake of Allah okay or shall I stop okay any more questions no are you concerned impossible so we have Muhammad Iran Australia and Mohammed says yeah we know that we have this lockdown and we don't pray in the message so when praying home is it mandatory to give a done in a comma the answer is no it is not mandatory but it is highly recommended to give a van so that those who hear you would repeat after you and you and them would be able to say that door afterwards but as long as there are messages in Australia and they call the Adhan in it this is sufficient for you as for a comma it is again highly recommended to say it it's not mandatory so if you say there comma that's good if you don't say it your prayer is valid but there is no dua after a comma so you don't make a comma and say aloha murabba had hit doubt eternity or so logic I mean oh this is only to be said after the event which you had called or you heard it being called life so even hearing the event from your alarm clock or your your than app is not a real advance so you don't repeat after it and you don't say the dua after it either so I hope this answers the questions again from the US ask two questions unfortunately my friend this is a Q&A session and what you're asking for is a lecture so how to strengthen your Eman how to improve your character how to memorize the Quran this is not a question that can be addressed in a Q&A session but it needs a lecture and if you post this question on my website my team will send you lectures or part of my lectures on these topics that you can benefit a Sharla from amina from russia says if a person breaks his widow during prayer let's assume i mean ii raka of the and i break my wooden when i go and perform moodle should I continue my third and fourth raka or begin from the very beginning the answer is salat is a whole unit so it is like fasting the day of Ramadan you begin from the break of dawn you can only break your fasting when the Sun sets if you break your fasting intentionally one minute before the Sun sets the whole day is in is invalid is void and likewise in salat if you pray full for rock eyes sit for to shout salutation number prophet Isis Salam Allahu Manero they become inaudible Jahannam inaudible cub will fight until my helmet Fatima see had the gel as you want to say Salam aleikum hot Ally you break your rule the whole prayer is void and you have to go and perform model and repeat it all over again we have xeno Dean from UK I did your advice you gave me I'm the lightweight very successful my father and my friendship of many masha'Allah masha'Allah so you owe me a million dollars Angela but I mean is like Allah hey what can I do for you is anything regarding saliva if you should use celebrity ring your fasting does that break your fast or not well if your saliva is poisonous then it would break your your fasting or if your your saliva is normal okay what makes people think that saliva breaks your Moodle or breaks your fasting I'll tell you it is Shaitaan the way he manipulates our heads and minds he makes us extreme so that we would not like we would abhor we would resent the form of worship so making Woodill is difficult he's making me an OCD ish patient so I hates a lot now swallowing your saliva is problematic so you have to spit all the time in an hour to your mouth and throat are dried I hate fasting man this is all from shape on there is nothing wrong at all in swallowing your saliva even when you make Woodill and you swirl water in your mouth and you spit it out that's it oh I don't need to spit a second and a third time so that I ensure that there's no water left no I just spit the water in your mouth and that's it you can swallow whatever is remaining with your saliva because this is negligible so I hope this answers your question Zinedine I apologize I should have taken all of you questions at once we have Ibrahim from the US sorry ma yes sir I have a question in regards to my family ok shake basically I grew up in a abusive household with a abusive father and he used to used to abuse us physically for many years me and my mother and now my parents have been married for 35 years and they're old and they're 60s but my mother she refuses to speak with my father because he still doesn't treat her right and they don't talk to each other they don't sit with each other my father sleeps downstairs my mother sleeps top stairs ok I was wondering what advice he would give because me as a son I don't know what to say to them ok and the second thing is because because of how they behave with each other and how they behaved with us as children my sister who is older than me she's in her thirties when she saw this she refuses to get married because she's afraid that what if she gets a husband like my father ok ok Abraham I'm afraid that the control room is telling me that our time is over but I think I have some leverage over them so I'll go quickly it's through Amin as questions from Russia praying Baha cannot be prayed after the Adhan and praying Sunnah of law cannot be done before the Adhan of the horse so you cannot combine them both each has to be prayed separately in its own time and her third question about kinship that they don't call they don't reciprocate and they're very cold when she contacts them if you're doing it for the sake of Allah don't pay any attention for their feelings keep on doing what you're doing calling them texting them greeting them for eat eventually either they will barge in or allah azzawajal will reward you greatly in this life in the hereafter never give up and always make her intention for the sake of allah not for themselves Ibrahim says his father and mothers problem this requires a counseling session but in a nutshell your sister this requires a separate answer I won't be able to give it to her today but your father and mother they've been living together for the past 35 years they can take care of their own affairs as a son do not get involved because you will be taking sides and the other party would hate you for life and you don't want to do that because both of them are gates of genda so be neutral if someone asks you for advice give diplomatic advice without taking sides and without standing in the face of one against the other your mother is responsible for her actions and only Allah can judge her if your father is complaining we could try to reconcile and talk some sense into them but most likely you can it's very difficult to teach an old dog new tricks as they say that he's not gonna change she's not gonna change don't get involved between them so that you won't put yourself in trouble this is all the time we have until we meet same time tomorrow I leave you via Manila was salam alikum warahmatu allahi /"
