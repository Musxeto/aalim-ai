  "title": "Is my step daughter my mahram (Young or Adult)? Why is the word Young used in Quran? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "according to one of your videos okay you say that some scholar say that the word that Allah used in the Quran describing the stepdaughter that a man cannot marry is that of a young female so my question is that is that the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion is that a stop a stepdaughter whether she's an infant or a toddler or a u someone older or even a grown-up female is a a Maham to her stepdad regardless of the age when he married her mother this is the most authentic opinion which the majority of Scholars follow so yes a mute amount of Scholars said that as described meaning those who are raised in your presence meaning a small child that grows up under your supervision this is your Maham she is like your daughter you can't marry her but what happens if I marry someone who's over 50 and she has a young daughter of that's 30 years of age should I say that she's not my Maham she should cover up the answer is no she she's still taking the same ruling so why was why did Allah mention the word of a young daughter in the Quran because this goes as the vast majority it's in Arabic called which means that the vast majority of men who marry women with children their daughters would be uh uh in very young age not the norm to marry someone with a 30 or 25 years old daughter this is why the Quran referred to it but that does not mean it cannot be cascaded to uh elder or older a ages is no the answer is still the same so the conclusion if a man marries a woman and this woman has a daughter of 20 or 25 or 30 years of age she is considered his permanent Maham for Life as a daughter and Allah Knows Best"
