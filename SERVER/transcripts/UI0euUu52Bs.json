  "transcript": "uh so in one of your videos you said that um when Maddie like semen when it dries you can like see it right um so what should one do if they had nocturnal emissions and then they see that the semen in their underwear like it it was semen they can see that it's like dry in its heart and they can see it but when they see it on their bed it has basically disappeared after a couple of hours right because some of the semen also got out of bed so after like five six hours they see that there's like nothing on their bed and and there's like no crust like there's there's no seam in there they can't find it so is this semen is this managers for impure what because yeah what counts is what you find on your underwear not on your bed sheet so the question is did you see semen on your bed on your underwear yes I'm sure this is that's what counts you have to go and perform muscle now whether you saw traces of semen on your bed sheet and then it dried out and you don't see it anymore or not it doesn't matter because semen is pure so if it dried out and it is not visible anymore you can still use the bed sheet and steep on it and you have no problem with that none whatsoever and Allah Knows Best"
