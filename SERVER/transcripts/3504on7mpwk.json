  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 26 - The Rights Of The Parents - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our beer host our subject parents in particular looking at the rights of parents and we are try our best to relate this to the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him and his parents we know that there was very little time that he was alive with his parents peace be upon him our guest visiting from Saudi Arabia Shaikh awesome al-hakim assalamualaikum waalaikumsalam huntin love thank you again for being with us Sheikh we look forward to a great conversation maybe we should elaborate for those who are not fully aware the Prophet peace be upon him Prophet Muhammad lost his parents at a young age and so he didn't spend a lot of time living walking the earth with them but a very important question is always I mean we wish the best for our parents and then certainly the Prophet peace be upon him wish the same there's some spiritual concerns with the spiritual fate the ultimate destiny of the parents and even his uncle who took care of him after his parents died can you talk about that Mahima salat WA Salam o Allah Allah why Ali he was who am i bad in Islam the role of parents is highly appreciated and there are so many verses of the Quran instructing us to be kind and dutiful to them there are so tons of hadith in the Sunnah ordering us to obey them to be dutiful to respect them and not to say anything that harms their feelings the least mmm and when you come to the prophets parents sallallahu alayhi wa seldom we know that his father Abdullah died when he was six months in his mother's womb so she was pregnant of six month when Abdullah Abdullah Talib died and when he was born the Prophet was born sallallahu wasallam as an orphan soon after his birth his mother gave him like the customs of the Arabs from high families in Arabia to a woman who would nurse him and breastfeed him and she was from a tribe of nomads so that it would be healthier for him not being brought up in the city and it would be best for his linguistic abilities as they spoke standard Fosca Arabic and we know that his interaction was if his mother was limited mm-hm and he lost his mom when he was about six years of age so having said that our program is about with the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam so what would it be that connected the Prophet a son to his parents we have two hadith in sahih Hal Imam Muslim which is the highest graded in authenticity we as muslims know that's a high Albahari and so he he'll imam muslim are the highest in authenticity so in the sake of imam muslim a man comes to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and says to him o prophet of allah where is my father the Prophet is revealed to him so Allah reveals to the Prophet that this man's father is in hell so the Prophet answers accordingly your father isn't help so the man was a little bit upset so the Prophet told him my friend your father and my father are both in hell in another hadith it shows you the emotional impact upon the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once he passed by the grave of his mother who was buried in a lebwa an area between Mecca and Medina and he wept so the companion said o prophet of Allah why are you crying why do we see tears coming down your face he said I asked Allah that he would permit me to seek forgiveness for my mother Allah denied me that and I asked Allah the permission to visit her grave and Allah granted me that so these two hadith in Swahili I'm a Muslim illustrate to us without any doubt that the parents of the Prophet Elisha Salam are in hell now having said that a lot of the different cults and sects may jump the gun and they would point fingers saying this is not true the hadith is fabricated you hate the prophet sallallaahu Salam and when they do this one of two either they are genuinely loving the Prophet array so Salam to the extent that they want and wish his parents are in heaven like we all do right or they are a bunch of deviant scholars or individuals who would like to make money of their congregation pretending they are extremely in love with the Prophet as a Salaam to the extent that they are ready to falsify and accuse a hadith in the Sahara to be wrong and this is a serious offence the vast majority of scholars of Islam have agreed that the prophets of the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam's the prophets parents are in hell this is what an mm never we said half of the bin hajar have been telling me the whole nine yards the only one who differed whether Imam assualted and he mentioned a number of hadiths all fabricated all lies and wrong but but check why is this such a point of concern you said that some fabricate to make money somehow and he but what's the problem what's the problem does it mean something spiritually about the Prophet if his parents are in hell why is it an issue see we followed the Quran in this room now we say in the Quran that the father of Abraham whose name was azor isn't hell it is written there and authentic hadith it proves there so we acknowledges and when the Prophet tells us aliens Allah to some that his beloved uncle Abu Talib is the least tormented person in hell because of what he had done to the Prophet Elisha Salam and his punishment is a stone of fire placed in his shoes where his brain boils out of it as if he's conducting Heat his body becomes conducting Heat so when the Prophet tells us this do we believe it or reject it a Muslim stands with the evidence the Prophet tells us this about his parents now the cults and sects they think that because they love the Prophet so much Isis em and they hanged by a thread over these issues but if you watch all of their other rituals and practicing of Islam you'll find that they're far away from the Sunnah far away from the true understanding of the Koran far away from implementing the teachings of the Prophet s system then it is obvious that their deviance is present now we love the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam to the extent that by Allah each and one of us is ready to sacrifice his own parents his own siblings his own spouse and children just for the parents of the Prophet SM to enter paradise and make the Prophet happy we're ready to do this but these deviant sects they come and they try to tarnish our reputation for following the Sunnah for following the true authentic Ikeda by accusing us of hating the Prophet or a sorcerer who in his right mind would hate the Prophet Allah so sir or would love this this is what we believe that Allah Azza WA JAL has sent to them as we know that the people of korish were following the religion of Abraham they knew of jesus christ the new of moses so they had the scriptures around them yet they failed to follow of any of them and they decided to worship idols mm-hmm so we believe that it is Allah who has condemned them to hell and told his messenger so allah salem about this however this is how we treat and deal with them in this life as disbelievers on the day of judgment it's up to allah - allah azza wajal whether he would admit them or forgive them this is something we have no knowledge of but it is not appropriate at all to lie to fabricate hadith like some of these sects do and say that Allah revived them at the time of the Prophet as Salam they race Islam and they died again and likewise with Abu Tarek all of these are baseless it's it personally for me it's enough to say that you know it's a laws business and he will make the ultimate decision we're ready for our break Sheikh we'll come back to continue talking about the parents Salam alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we're continuing with Shaikh awesome on the subject of parents Shaikh awesome as you helped us in before the break you were explaining to us how Islam emphasizes the important role parents play and the important for us to be dutiful respectful towards our parents and the benefits both here and hereafter for us for following the Prophet's advice in this regard peace be upon him however some of our parent-child relationships are less than ideal to put it mildly sometimes there can be serious issues that can be painful memories that makes being dutiful difficult and challenging parents after all are human beings and so the question that I often hear some people I've to put it to go to the extreme some have said you know I just don't like to be around my mother or my father or whatever but I want to be a good Muslim help us out with this okay well this is a no-go you cannot at all be a good Muslim if you're not dutiful to your parents if you're not not only dutiful that you are respectful obedient the whole nine yards I'm the loveliness Road may Allah be pleased with him said I went to the Prophet area saw Simon asked him which among the deeds are best and most beloved to Allah the prophet said to pray on time so I said what else he said to be dutiful to your parents I said what else he said she had fighting in the cause of Allah so being dutiful to your parents is far greater than jihad not only that the Prophet said allahís a lot o Salaam that the father is the middle gate of paradise so keep that gate or loo it meaning that it's a metaphor that you will not be able to enter paradise without being dutiful obedient and respectful to your father and it's up to you whether you don't want to see him then you will lose entering Jenna or you push yourself and force yourself to be kind to him the problem is that people neglect the fact that each one of us has rights but has obligations as well it is LOM we are told to fulfill our obligations first even if we were deprived from our rights with our parents with the Muslim ruler and a wife with her husband for example hmm a man is not kind to his son abusive to his son doesn't treat his offspring equally favors some over the other years now these are rights of mine that my father deprives me of never ever think that is possible for me to say okay if this is the case then I'm not gonna be the obedient to my father I'm not gonna do my obligations towards him no he breached the contract he's not being fair to me so yes this is totally wrong your contract is with Allah he tells you do your obligations what about my rights what about this inequality injustice is that he's doing to meetin ask Allah and Allah will compensate you on the day of judgement so is la miz not ignoring the fact that there could be some inequities or some favoritism or whatever but is asking us to focus on our relationship with the law and and not to put ourselves in it not to be to hurt ourselves in the process see why would I be kind to my father natural reasons he's my father he's carrying his loving I am in this world through him but there is far greater purpose and that is the divine instruction from allah azza wajal to be kind to my parents this comes first so when I am respectful to my parents it's not just for the natural reasons it is because Allah ordered me to do so and this doesn't mean that he's not being going to be accountable for his shortcomings towards me okay this is something between him and a larger but in this life and I always get this question from sisters complaining from their abusive controlling mother or from their abusive harsh father mm-hmm and they say why is this I usually tell them this format in answering them say listen no one on earth lives without being tested okay this is crystal clear everyone is destiny some are tested with cancer colon cancer breast cancer leukemia some are tested which with HIV positive some are tested with drought and famine looking for a drop of water or a piece of grain to feed their children some are tested by insecurity bombs and barrels of explosive thrown at them seeing their loved ones die in front of their eyes some are tested with not having a place to live they're constantly refugees mm-hmm so they are drowning in the Mediterranean they are being sold as slaves etc each one has his own test now Allah tested you with such a father or with such a mother would you like to swap places with the previously mentioned mm-hmm every time they would say nope we're happy with the way we are see this is life it's all about your choices your reactions your the consequences of what you do is what you're going to be either rewarded for in Paradise or tormented for in Hellfire so we have a choice it can make us or break us we can yeah use it constructively or destructively what does it change when the parents are non-muslims is some of the Sahaba may Allah be pleased with him may have come from families that did not follow their example and follow their decision to walk with the Prophet peace be upon him does that change the equation at all the responsibilities the duties to parents if the parent is non-muslim none at all not at all see in the Orang allah tells us and this is really strange because people are negligent of this to ayahs Allah says in the Quran that if your parents disbelievers we're to strive against you to make you out of the religion so that you would associate others with me mm-hmm so Allah is telling us if you have non-muslim parents and they are going out of the way their striving their doing jihad yeah against you so that you go to church with them or you worship their idols with them Allah says do not obey them yet have good companionship with the majority of people who revert Islam and they said I wouldn't do that I'll use my 8 gauge shotgun if he does this to me this is wrong this is why you need to fix your affairs and rectify them through the Quran and Sunnah without knowledge you'll do the wrong decisions so even if her parents are not Muslim it is an obligation upon you to be obedient and respectful and to be dutiful a SMAP may Allah be pleased with her came to the Prophet Ali salsa and said o prophet of Allah my mother is an idol worshipper and she came to my home and wanting to connect with me she's my mom but she's a mushrik mm-hmm the Prophet said connect with her give her gifts he's ordering her to be dutiful to her though she's not a believer you know some of us are better than others when it comes to managing the parent relationship besides the practical benefit of having a peace of heart peace of mind good relations with our parents what are the other benefits by the OMA qiyamah after judgment day of judgment what spiritual benefits are there besides the practical ones in this life we can't say except what we know from the Quran and Sunnah for example in the Quran Allah tells us that the offspring will be elevated to the level of their parents on the day of judgment in paradise and there are other evidences stating the other for example the Prophet Allah hasn't told us that a man on the day of judgment has been given a level in Jannah and he says God I did not do this mm-hmm why am i elevated to this level of paradise and he is answered and told this is by the dua of your offspring the dua of your son so the relationship is there mmm the content of your heart would definitely be when you meet with them I just touched something very important after our parents traditionally our parents would die before us and we continue to benefit them after their that is that means that there's a very important relationship even after they've died indeed indeed the profit that is assumed was asked is there anything that I can do to my parents after they die the Prophet said yes to execute their promise if they promise someone something and they died you do that for them to connect to those who are related to them you have no kinship except through your parents and to check upon their friends not only them yeah so it's a good reputation when I go and check on upon my father's friends and they say oh may Allah have mercy on your father he did leave after him real men yeah that's right so these things will connect of course the Prophet said that some when a person dies his deeds are interrupted except from three things one of them a righteous offspring that makes duaa so making dua asking Allah for forgiveness giving charity on behalf of your parents offering the Umrah or Hajj on their behalf all of these will go in their scales of good deeds sheikh osman we are out of time we appreciate you opening up and explaining these things for us document locking Allah accept our efforts and thank you for being with us we pray for this episode benefiting you and your Islamic knowledge and understanding we will close the program for today thank you again assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah"
