  "transcript": "he says can we do one wudu for mevi and prayer is prosthetic uh uh discharge and this breaks her wudu so if you clean yourself and you perform mudu this single wudu can do anything that is required for it so with the single wudu whether you intended the acts that follow or not you can with this single wudu perform Salat you can sit in the Masjid you can perform a tawaf you can hold the message that must have and read from it Etc so there isn't the cons a concept of performing for Medi discharge then performing wudu for urinating then performing wood for intending to to pray after finishing all of these things you perform one will do and this suffices for all"
