  "transcript": "what we do is we look into the Quran - the Sunnah do we have any cure do we have any treatment for solving this problem for uplifting this evil eye and answer is yes we do the Sunnah is clear the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam visited sahib Hanif may Allah may Allah be pleased with him when he fell sick so he asked around do you accuse anyone of giving him the evil eye so that he would fall sick like this and they said yes he was washing his body and a companion saw him and he was amazed by the clarity and beauty of his skin so he said giving him the evil eye unintentionally of course because evil eye does not come intentionally he said I have never seen such soft skin as if it's the skin of a virgin of course both of them are men and both of them are true natural men they don't have any inclination towards homosexuality may Allah forbid like sick people do today but he was amazed by seriously the softness of the skin and Salomon honey fell on the ground and he was sick on the spot so when they told the prophet alayhi salatu salam he was very angry and he said to that companion why does one of you attempt to kill his brother by giving him evil eye wouldn't you have said allahumma barik or Allah Mubarak lahu or barakallahu laka which all's is stemmed from blessings of Allah then the Prophet ordered him to do something and this is the best cure for the evil eye if you know who gave it to you the Prophet ordered him to perform ablution and to wash the inside of his garment his waste wrapper his robe his shirt his trousers the inside of it that touches his body to wash it and the water all is collected in a vessel then the he ordered them to throw the water over the head of the affected person in some narrations from behind him so he stands in the bathroom someone from behind him gives him a bath or throws it on top of his head and his body the hadith goes on to say Sahel instantly stood up as if nothing had been wrong with him so this is the best form of treatment for evil eye"
