  "title": "Did Sheikh Bin Baz say if we don't have time 2 pray tahiyatul masjid We can sit down assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh shik my question is that I saw a video on the YouTube the shik asked bin Bas he was with him in the Masjid and the aan was going on so he told him to sit and the sh gave the fatwa that if we don't have time to pray we can sit so what's your opinion on that my opinion is first of all I don't know whether this uh the story is true or not I know that in the authentic Hadith the prophet saidat and he's the one I follow as you do definitely ran the prophet said when someone enters the Masjid he must not sit down until he prays two ra this is the prophet's command he did not say if there is enough time or not a second Hadith while the prophet was given a man came and sat down and if I'm not wrong his name isik so the prophet interrupted his Friday sermon and said sik did you pray two raas and the man said no the prophet said stand up and pray two raas which means if it was permissible to sit and listen to theba that would have been more important than praying two yet the prophet interrupted his so I don't know about the story whether it's authentic or not whether it was the Sheik baz who said this or someone reported it and if someone reported it I may doubt the narration of that person or that individual whether he heard it correctly whether he understood it correctly or whether he was lying or not I don't know but I respect Bas he's my sheh I follow him I learn from his teachings but he's the one who taught me that no matter who says what ask this important question is he a messenger so when someone says to him IM Ahmed says so and so so says is IM Ahmed a messenger IM shaf says so and so he says is IM Shafi a prophet and the answer would be no said then whatever they say must be filtered through Quran and Sunnah if it complies with them we take them if not we disregard them with all due respect to the imams but we only follow the Quran and Sunnah I hope this clarifies things a bit"
