  "title": "After praying Taraweeh & Witr with the imam, can we pray more when going back home? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign due to some condition now my question is after we finish the rest with Imam some of my friends and I we decided that we will create some additional rakas where I would lead them and we will just prolong the parade so is this permissible for us for two of us for Allah recommended that Witcher is to conclude the night prayer however it is also reported that he prayed to rakas after winter from this Scholars concluded that the instruction and the Order of concluding night prayer with Witcher is not mandatory rather it's highly recommended so if you pray terawih in the Masjid and you offer the with your prayers whether you're the Imam or a follower and you go home Allah has given you the reward of praying the whole night if you wish to offer more prayers like tahajud for example alone with other friends or family members this is totally permissible but you must not repeat the waiter because you've already prayed Witcher and the prophet said Allah there are no two witchers in the same night so due to the fact that you concluded your you can pray two by two by two and that's the sky's the limit without repeating your Witcher prayer at the end and Allah Knows Best"
