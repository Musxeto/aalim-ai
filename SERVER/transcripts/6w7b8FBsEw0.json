  "transcript": "when I was young my father told me that high high school is not uh that important so he told me that to skip it and make uh fake certificate so I did what he said and went to University now I finished University and I realized that I made a mistake so I'm wondering that if I work with that uh degree of University that my income will be Halal or Haram how how can you help me Chef I can't help you unfortunately I cannot help you you you forged a high school certificate which without they would not have accepted you in the University I don't care if you got a 4.0 GPA average in your University because it was based on Haram and falsehood and cheating so even if you graduated from your University I believe that working with the University degree and the money earned is Haram because you're cheating the people the only way I can see it rectified is that you do your high school all over again and get it legalized and uh accepted or you go to the authorities and uh confess to them of your crime and see what can be fixed and Allah Knows Best"
