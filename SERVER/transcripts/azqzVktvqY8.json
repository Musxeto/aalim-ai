  "transcript": "is it permissible to make Dua in your mother tongue while you are in prostration if you do not know the Arabic language it's an issue of dispute among Scholars but the most authentic opinion is that you are allowed to make Dua in your own native language providing you do not know how to do this in Arabic and this is after you have offered the necessary and mandatory VI so in your prostration it is mandatory for you it is wag to say sub and if you add to that then this is okay subh and the other forms of supplications as well now if you do this saying it in Arabic which is a must sub after that if you want to ask Allah for something but you do not know how to ask it in in in your uh um in Arabic then in this case you may ask it in your native language but if you know how to ask it in Arabic it's a must so for example if you want to ask Allah for forgiveness and you say and you know Allah you cannot say oh Allah forgive me because you know it in Arabic but if you want to ask Allah Asel to guide your son to uh uh the straight path or to award your wife hi or to pay off your debts and you can't say this in Arabic because you simply don't know Arabic in this case it becomes permissible inshallah"
