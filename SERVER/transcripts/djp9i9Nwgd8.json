  "transcript": "I had a question on um buying a house is if you have already bought a house um and yeah is it is it permissible to look at Islamic financing or is it better off to just sell and be renting okay first of all it is totally prohibited to buy a house through conventional mortgage which is Haram because this is riba it's a river-based loan and what people say in the west that we have a fatwa stating that the first house is permissible to buy through Haram because of necessity because this is a land of the kuffar because this and that all of this is baseless and nonsense this is not true and I I'm shocked by the amount of people who buy such a fatwa and embrace it says it's a necessity we have to no it's not necessity you can rent there's not not nothing that's compelling you to borrow such a huge amount to buy a house you can rent for the rest of your life I don't own a property with the grace of Allah I am paying rent for two houses till date and I have no problem alhamdulillah and I don't have nightmares now having said that if you have a house and you wish to buy a second property or if you're I don't know what the circumstances are but if you're interested in buying a second property through Islamic financing this is permissible providing that this Islamic financing is truly Sharia compliant not camouflaging riba interest-based riba loans through the label of Islamic so if they that the bank actually possesses the property before any strings attached between you and them before any down payment before any signature or commitment they go and buy the actual property and they call you a week or a month later and say listen the house you wanted to buy on street so and so we've already purchased it and it's aren't under our name it cost us a million dollars are you interested in buying you go and check if they say we're willing to sell it for you over the duration of 20 years for 1.5 million dollars and the price is fixed there is no there are no strings attached at all it cannot be increased then more than 1.5 million dollars by one single Cent whether you're late you're defaulted the same amount is there and if you default it within the process and you could not pay we have the Liberty to sell the property take what's Ours from the 1.5 million remaining and give you the rest because it's your house if this is applicable this is 100 permissible in halal diminishing ijara which we spoke about before and it's on the rise in Western countries under Islamic financing is permissible providing that few glitches are eliminated such as the insurance beneficiary if I'm the tenant and I'm paying the insurance who's the beneficiary why is it you why am I paying it you want to be the beneficiary of the house is burnt down to the ground you pay the insurance premium in you get the benefit out of it and likewise maintenance cost the tenant is never obliged to fix a a broken pipe or to fix the sewer or to fix the heating system if it's busted the boilers this is the duty and the responsibility and the ownership of the landlord so if these issues are eliminated inshallites best"
