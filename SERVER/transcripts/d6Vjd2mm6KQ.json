  "transcript": "we move on to something that would most likely happen if a person does not get married as indicated by Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he spoke to the man and he said you are one of two either an impotent or a fornicator so if you don't get married person would probably fall into the Zena and Zena is the word in Arabic described in the Quran what is the meaning of Don't Go Near don't approach this this means that anything that leads to Zena you stay away from it such as what leads to Zena seclusion the prophet says that whenever a man is alone with a woman their the third one with them is Shan I was in Delhi five six seven years ago and I was in uh exper an exhibition King Abdullah came to visit India and I was in my company so they we had an exhibition and I was you know responsible for that exhibition we had a driver and his name was shitan I was shocked said what said what what's your name said Shan shitan so I don't know if this is common name here it's not he wasn't a Muslim of course but this is what brought Memories Back To Me so whenever me and my friend would call him said Allah may Allah curse you why because his name isan and I would tell my friend he doesn't know Arabic it's okay anyhow also among the things that call for Zena and we unfortunately think that it is very easy is not lowering the Gaze and so many practicing Muslims as I've met think that lowering the Gaze is something of the past they go to movie theaters they watch television freely they speak to women freely they communicate they look at each other they exchange jokes they laugh the and she Iman is is in the heart this is wrong it leads to Zena listening to what calls for zena is also means of Zena so many things even when a woman puts on or wears perfume this is means of Zena the prophet said any woman who wears perfume and passes by men who would find her scent who would ah this is C Chanel oh no this is no no this is Gucci this is so and so if she if they find the smell of her perfume the prophet said she is a fornicator she is Zia because she tempted them by her smell sisters say she what is this you mean that we should go out without putting perfume and maybe we're smelly maybe we're sweating yeah you you should I'm not telling you to go out sweating or smelling but you don't put perfume because if you put perfume you're calling people and you don't know what shatan throws in their hearts so you should be careful about this Zena in Arabic is illegal sexual act in English it's different if you're not married they call it fornication and if you're married they call it adultery so it was no no it's in Islam it's all called Zena it is one of the most major sins in Islam Allah in Combined it with associating others with Allah y three they don't call others with Allah they don't kill innocent people and they do not fornicate this is all part of the major sins Allah says and come not near to the unlawful sexual intercourse verily it's a and an evil way also one of the gravity of Zena is that it is a cause of illness and plague and this is completely apparent and visible nowadays isn't it in the west what is the the the the most fearful things uh uh to them AIDS and AIDS is a plague it is spreading now it's much less alhamdulillah because people are much wiser they stop not fearing of Allah but fearing of this uh illness and disease so whenever these five characteristics appear in people then it will spread among them the diseases and the plague that were not among those of their predecessors also one of the gra I ities of Zena is it causes the mixing of lineage so people do not know their parents people are born out of wedlock and our Prophet Alat wasam is proud that in his lineage was all properly married there is no forbidden relationship in all of his lineage to to ibraim or even further than that s wasam z causes the mixing of the lineage and that is why there is what is known as what is it's a waiting period so if a woman is divorced she has to have a waiting period before getting married again and the is a chapter in F it can go to the maximum and to the minimum what's the maximum in three months 10 days four months and 10 days no yeah give me give me give me time it can be 8 months well 9 months you have to know where exactly the minute a woman when is pregnant but it can be 8 months if I divorce my I would not if someone divorces his wife when she is pregnant of one month her is until she delivers and this means eight months if a person die if I die yes this is possible and my wife is pregnant of one month her is over not after four months and 10 days but after she delivers all of this she has to remain in but if I die and half an hour she gives birth her is over and she get married she can get married an hour later how happy she is okay so is different it can be until she delivers it can be 4 months and 10 days in the case of a person who dies in the case of a widow it can be three menes which is the the normal in divorce three menstruation periods three and then she the is over it can be three months if if she does not have her period If a woman is 60 years old she doesn't have period what what what is her three months as mentioned in the Quran and if she is too young to have period if she's 8 years of age she doesn't have a period and she was married divorced what is her what is her three months huh one says she if she's 8 years old how can she get married if she's 5 years old she can get married but we will not go into that section but islamically if you read Surah you will find that Allah mentions the waiting period the of those who do not have Menses such as the infants the children and those who menes has stopped such as the old women we can answer questions afterwards if you have questions no problem uh number it's the same thing number three I think it is there it's a cause of depression stress psychological and mental insec Purity but before that in mixing of lineage also it is a means of spreading of homosexuality when you don't have marriage then you would either have Zena in some places a lot of Zena causes homosexuality is this true people are nodding their heads prove it Francisco San Francisco exactly correct that is exactly what I had in mind San Francisco is a city in California right the the brother is going to have many misss H put some paste on it San Francisco is a city in uh uh California known to be the largest city of homosexuals the capital of homosexuality they have a yearly Eid where they do not fast and they offer their Eid prayer H but very weird costumes if you can call them costumes they have homosexuality but why because they've reached a degree of well let me go that this is not the right they've reached a degree of lowness and of disintegration in their moral uh uh uh behavior that after Zena after the 60s and the 70s after all the free sex they had they reached a level they wanted something more and nothing can be less than that except homosexuality they it is the capital of homosexuals unfortunately and this is one of the byproduct of not being married when you don't M have marriage when you don't have this constitution of binding a man to a woman lawfully and through gr the uh legitimate means this is what takes place and of course it causes bashfulness to disappear when you have Zena you have men coming to meet with women and women enforcing themselves upon men few days ago one brother I don't know who sent me a clip where had do you know him Hadad he's one of the students of knowledge mallah a good student of knowledge uh he resides in England he went to Holland and he was having a press conference seminar and a woman from the audience shouting why don't you want women to sit on the same table and she came to the theater and she sat forcibly on the table with him now anyone would think that this has no bashfulness this woman has no shyness has no feminine in her she's a man but with a long hair and with other different features the way she treats is not a way of a woman and this is the cause of Zena because she is a free woman she is a public toilet that is why she doesn't have any shyness and bashfulness and this is the most beautiful feature of women that they're shy that they are concealed they're preserved it's like a pearl in its shell untouched did not see the light of the Sun and that what makes it more precious than finding it on the floor for anyone to pick among the the the serious things or the gravities of Zena is that it's a cause and means of depression stress psychological and mental insecurity anyone who commits this who commits this major sin will not be at ease if you walk with if I walk with my wife I walk with my wife proud I have nothing to Fe fear if I walk with my girlfriend I'm afraid that people would see me if someone says Salam uham uh she's my cousin I didn't ask you who she is what's what's wrong with you no no maybe you thought no no no I didn't what are you doing so it is a great cause of depression a person who commits Zena don't you ever think that he's happy in what we hear that this guy has girlfriends this girl has boyfriends oh she looks happy I see her in college she looks always beautiful putting makeup you don't you don't see except the outer shell inside W they are tortured they are torn out and the depression the stress they're facing they cannot curb they cannot control except with or that's it that is why they for all the time occupying their head with anything that would take this stress this uh uh depression this mental insecurity away how by watching movies by listening to music all the time they cannot sit for half an hour idle they cannot sit in a chair no music no TV no smss no uh telephones just sit for half an hour and think well they cannot they'll go crazy why because so much stress they have to occupy this they have to forget and that is why they consume alcohol they consume drugs they do all these things to just forget anyone would think why would someone drink a lot of alcohol to get they they they wasted huh why would someone want to waste himself because he has things that would kill him if he doesn't do this reasons behind marri marrying late what's the average among male of marriage here 25 25 okay any of the males married below 20 years of age 21 22 23 auction 24 24 masallah okay good 25 only three 25 four 26 only two 27 only four 20 27 28 29 okay 30 whoa 31 we have a problem marrying is too late I married my second wife when I was 28 [Music] so this was was not mtas by the way so just to clarify inshallah came from the crowd no no it it it is not something you look up to huh it is not something you it's not a trophy ah inshallah I'll marry another wife it's not a trophy you you know you want to buy it is a hell of responsibility so don't think of it as mashallah I'm going to the Caribbeans getting married is not a holiday again so you we have reasons for men marrying late I put it from my perspectives perspective as a as a Saudi one of the reasons globally is education why don't you get married I'll finish my ba why don't you get married you finish your ba I'm waiting for my masters you finish masses I'm waiting for my PhD so they postpone it and think that it would affect their studies and it won't I got married my to my first wife when I was in second or third year in college and alhamdulillah I was an honor student it went a little bit down but it felt a way way different because I was much much comfortable relaxed alhamdulillah so education is one of the reasons second reason is career Mah you got your PhD why don't you get married I have a job so uh in order to reach a certain level now I'm a supervisor I would like to be a manager and then I would like to be a vice president and then I would like to be a CEO so pursuing your career usually is one of the reasons that marriage is late and a lot of the those who pursue their career spend 15 hours 16 hours a day on their job thinking that they're doing a good thing not knowing that they're being enslaved for that job life is not all jobs life has much more to offer so a lot of them say no I'd like to secure my future I'd like to reach a certain position and then get married and those who have this target never fulfill it because every time you reach a position you say okay you now you're 40 years old you've reached a CEO of the company what do you when are you getting married I want to buy the company and then acquire another and then a third and this is exactly what the prophet said in theat which some Scholars say that it was an aah it was a verse of the Quran and then abrogated we mentioned this in Quran the Divine thread what is that the prophet says Alam if the son of Adam had a valy of gold he would acquire a second one and if he had two valleys of gold a third and nothing fulfills the or fills the stomach of B Adam the mouth of the badam the Eye of B Adam except dust some of the companions said that this was Quran and it was abated it was taken out by Allah and thirdly conditions required by the future spouse this is one of the reasons that delays marriage I propose for a woman to a woman and the woman has conditions and I am unable to fulfill these conditions so this takes time among the conditions she wants a driver meaning that women in Saudi don't drive alhamdulillah until now so she wants a car and a driver to take her and she cannot be alone with the driver so she has to have a mate and she would like to have a a one month vacation every year International location she wants this she wants that and all of this is not realistic but she demands this and I cannot get married so I postpone my marriage where if we were to follow the Sunnah and have the marriage as easy and basic as possible we would not have anyone unmarried in Islam this is the proper Islamic way the grace of Allah I got four of my daughters married and they all have children alhamdulillah so I'm my grandfather you can call me uncle and with the grace of Allah every time someone comes and propose of them they the his father comes and talks to me and say okay what is your doy how much you demanding I said I'm not selling my daughter whatever you bring you bring so say some of them say Okay 20,000 real is a good and 20,000 is considered to be minimum or average it can go to 10 15 and I say I don't bargain whatever you bring I'm buying a man I am actually accepting him as my son he's I'm buying a man it's I'm I'm the one who's on the winning end okay any other conditions any gold nothing and I all of my marriages of my daughters are like this alhamdulillah the wedding we do it on the roof in my house the food only would cost something 40 people more than enough if I invite those I know I would probably need 5,000 people not money reals but I invite only 4030 maximum yeah it would not cost me the whole night more than 7,000 R food if I take them out venue also the same thing and that is it alhamdulillah marriage is easy when you put a lot of restrictions and conditions you will find people that are unmarried and you have problems with that I believe here it's also too expensive here it's not realistic here the men receive money receive the doy and I do not know how a man can accept something like this they tell me that not only that they put conditions they say the man says okay I need a car and I need this and I need that who are you getting it from from the wife are you a man allowing a woman to pay for you I'd rather die up till recently this is not Islamic huh I'm talking about personal up till recently I would not accept a gift from my wife you do not give me a gift I give you she said I have money said no no no no because it made me feel humiliated you know that my wife is giving me something but then I changed this and said alhamdulillah the prophet accepted gifts so you can accept gifts as well but up till recently man does not allow a woman to pay one single rupee to him how can you demand this but of course all of you are practicing no one is doing this right right inshallah inshallah among the condition the the reasons behind the marriage expenses this is what I was talking about if we Muslims if we practicing students of knowledge do not implement this in our lives we will never change and Allah will never bless us so you have to start with your own sister you have to start with your own self those who do not or did not get married yet when you propose to a sister and they start to tell you what do you want what do you say a car a Tata AATA Jeep is it a good car not a good car you should show them that you're a practicing Muslim and say sorry all what I want is you to accept this doy from me and all the expenses I will bear them now when he hears you say this will he request that you have your marriage in a hotel or in a hall costing an arm and a leg no they will say okay make it as short and as simple as possible and the shorter the Lesser in expense your marriage is the B the more blessed your marriage is the prophet said in a number of hadiths and the scholars say that these are are all acceptable inshallah that the woman who gets lesser in Dowry her marriage is more blessed and if you look at the prophet's dowy what was it if you look at Fatima in in in Pakistan they call it BB Fatima you call it like this I don't know FAA Allah be pleased with what was her a bed made of uh something I some furniture that would not cost maybe 500 rupees that was her dowy and she is one of the greatest women of all times may Allah be pleased with her if we succeed in doing this in our community w we will succeed in everything else I tell my wives and daughters when they attend marriages it is very expensive to attend a marriage because they have to wear a new dress and next week they have another marriage they have to to buy another dress and I say I'm not paying for this this is too expensive 13 plus 2 I have 15 women every time we have an invitation I'm not paying for this I keep on telling them W if you wear a nice blouse a shirt and a nice skirt that cost nothing and you attend they said oh people will be very angry they will laugh at us so let them laugh at you I tell them them if you do this once in your life the second marriage you go to you will find another two women doing the same and people will laugh at them the 10th marriage you will find half of the women attending coming in their normal nice skirt and shirt instead of wearing a dress that cost 10 times more and you have no problem in changing the skirts so people would not remember but the problem is who will hang the Bell who's the first one to do this this is a problem one of my uh uh wives told me that her daughter wore a dress a year and a half ago and after a year and a half she went to another wedding and she wear the same dress one woman came to her and said didn't you wear this a year and a half ago w she said this and my wife said oh I was so embarrassed and why are you embarrassed why do you feel this inferiority complex you don't have it you don't need it but I was amazed of that woman who remembers who watches and says okay my neighbor so and so the date the costume she's wearing and she remembers a year and a half that is evil I consider this to be evil so one of the reasons for late marriage is uh having these expenses now one of the reasons do you have this here the Customs the cousin is for her cousin fixed huh in some tribes in Saudi we have it as well so the man is interested in marrying his friend's sister the father says no you have to marry your cousin I'm not marrying my cousin so there is no marriage so three four 5 10 years pass the boy is not willing to marry his cousin and the father is not accepting him to marry another woman from another tribe or from another city or elsewhere this is for the men now when we come to the girls we have a way way longer list"
