  "transcript": "foreign may allah be pleased with him and how he came to islam he is known to scholars as the truth seeker because he fled his homeland persia and took several main stops in his route seeking allah's best way to be worshiped he went from persia to one of the priests in sham in iraq and to the other and to the other until he found a righteous priest and monk he prayed and and and worshiped allah with him and when this monk was dying he directed salman to go to medina because as they can see from their books it is time for a messenger to come out he was enslaved by a group of arabs who took him as a slave and sold him to a jew took all his positions after being free they made him a slave he worked with the jew in his farm and was anticipating the arrival of the prophet and when he heard his master and a friend of his talk about the prophet sallam he asked them a question and they beated him because it was not of his business he later on collected something dates and food and went to the prophet because he was informed by his monk that his description in the holy scriptures said that he does not accept charity but he accepts gifts and that he had something in his back which is the seal of prophethood so he went in the first day and gave the food to the prophet his companions so the prophet smiled at him and said what is this so he said this is charity so the prophet told his companions eat and he did not eat so salman said this is one the following day he brought another plate or dish of food and he gave it to the prophet saw sallam so the prophet said what is this so he said a gift so the prophet saw sallam ate from it then he said ah this is two. and the last sign salman was trying to come from behind the prophet sallam and sneak and look at this sign which is called to be khatman nubuwa or the seal of the prophethood which is like a mold with hair on it on the back of the prophet sallam when the prophet saw him trying to sneak around him he knew that he was looking for it so he put down his shirt the prophet sallam and the minute salman saw it he embraced the prophet and started crying and the companions were astonished what what is he doing so he sat down and he told the prophet salla sallam about his long journey that took over five or six years or maybe more just seeking the truth so he's spent about six years more than that well i'm not sure of the amount of time he spent but definitely it is far more than six years maybe it's 10 years because they've been traveling from one country to one to the other and spending time with this priest he's crooked and corrupt he goes to the other one he spends few years with him so it is definitely more than 10 years yes sir does this not also show that when an individual seeks guidance from his lord sincerely that allah will surely guide them of course and this is mentioned in the quran in the last verse of surat al anka and those who thrive in our side in our cause allah azza will guide them so whoever thrives his best and no one knows your best except allah the almighty so you can pretend you can claim that i did my best and this is all what i got no it's not it's only allah that knows your best so if you do your best then allah azza will guide you so the prophet helped salman and pharisee to by himself from his jew master and the companions helped him also and he was a free man what brought us all to this subject of salman was the jews of banu quraida have collaborated with quraish the politics of mecca and with the tribe of ratafan to attack medina from three different fronts when the prophet knew that alaisalatu and the the news was shocking ten thousand warriors are coming to invade medina the prophet sallam gathered his companions and told them what what do you suggest so salman and pharisee came up with an idea and he told him oh prophet of allah medina is surrounded by nature there are mountains hills and lots of farms and palm trees so an army of ten thousand would not by any means find it easy to enter from these sides therefore the east west and south by nature is protected these sides are protected but the north of medina is exposed so i would recommend that we dig a big trench up this northern side so that the polytheist army would be unable to penetrate so the prophet sallam like this idea because the arabs never heard of this and he instructed every group of 10 men of 10 men to dig about 40 foot and they have participated and they started work themselves even the prophet allah participated in digging the digging of this trench took about two weeks to a whole full month different narrations if you look at the plasma you can you can see that the trench is up over to the north of medina and this is what is known as the khandak and that is why some scholars call it the battle of khandak the trench and some scholars call it the battle off the different parties because there were three parties or more collaborating in this battle and you can also see the fortresses on this map now they started digging but digging was not an easy thing to do because as we as we know medina is surrounded by a volcanic rock and mountains so sometimes it's easy for you to dig but sometimes you're going to find big rocks and you did not have any bulldozers or special equipment to remove these truck rocks beside all of that it was extremely cold weather and they were extremely poor they did not have anything to eat and in some incidents it's reported that the muslims while digging this trench they had three days in a row without a single bite nothing to eat not because they were dieting it was because they did not have anything to to eat they were poor and we're also told that the only food they would have would be few bits and pieces of barley cooked with old and stinking fat and it was horrific taste and horrible smell but this is the only thing that they could do they were not on their own they were accompanied by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam himself and this boosted their morale because when the prophet sallam was with them no one would dare and stay back so the prophet used to dig with them and dirt was all over him he used to dig and he used to say poetry encouraging them he used to say an arabic a line that says that there is no life except the life on the day after and the hereafter and also the life of the companions the ansar and muhajira may allah azzawajal have mercy on them this shows us that the companions were with the prophet and that the prophet was among them and one of them he was not a ruler that would stay away from his companions and let them do all the dirty work i want to ask about the job of the sallam this time what do you mean the job the work was working or not was he was working of whom the prophet of course we just said that the prophet himself used to dig the trench with the companions this is his work i'm talking about his work in his life from where he gained the money the prophet salallahu was the ruler and in the sense that he did not work and traded with the money on the contrary we are told in the in islam that whatever the booty muslims get through wars the prophet gets one-fifth of that and this is to finance his life and to put this money wherever he wants for his wives or for his uh companions or even to pay money for charity but the prophet never kept this one-fifth of the booty he had it was always on the move it was always uh given to a charity and there were lots of miracles that the prophet sallam had throughout his life and some of these miracles appeared on this great event the event of the trench or the battle of alhandak and insha allah this what we will come to when we meet stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the hereafter as well each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared now there were miracles at the life time of the prophet and in this battle of al-khandak or the battle of the trench or known as the battle of ahzaab the battle of the parties one of the miracles that took place was the companions called the prophet and told them that there is this big huge rock that we are unable to dig out or to break our shovels are not working so the prophet came down to it and he had one big stone tied to his stomach and the arabs used to do this whenever they felt hungry so they tie a stone to their stomachs so that they would not feel that it's empty and he went down there and he hit it once and subhanallah it turned into sand all together another narration says that the prophet is hit it once saying allahu akbar and one third of it was cracked and turned into sand and the prophet said allah i see the castles of rome the romans in the sham area because they used to rule the area from sham district and allah azzawajal will give us the muslims its keys and then he hit it once again and the second third turned into sand and he said allahu akbar i can see the white castles of persia and allah azza will give us the keys and he hit it one third and final time and he said allahu akbar i can see the castles of yemen and allah will give us its keys now this was a miracle by itself to break the this big rock but the miracle was in the prophecies where the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in this cold weather in this hunger and in this great fear of what's going to happen to them and he is giving them the glad tidings that they will conquer the sham area conquer persia they will conquer yemen what kind of a man is he and that's why what called and encouraged the hypocrites hypocrites to say he the prophet and his lord do not promise us except illusions what are they talking about and they to the extent that some of the hypocrites said the prophet promises us the castles of the romans and the persians and the people in yemen and one of us is unsafe to go to answer the call of nature what is this the believers as described in the holy quran said that this is what allah and the prophet and the prophet promised this and they were truthful and what they promised and this increased only in their faith they it increased in their belief among the other miracles that took place on the battle of alhandak was an invitation this invitation was made by jaber abdullah whose father died on the battle of uhud when abdullah died he left lots of daughters and abdullah and he told his son i'm going to die on the battle of ahud therefore take care of your daughter of your sisters jabber could not take care of girls because he did not know what to do with them so he got married and when he got married he went to the prophet sallallahu alaihis that i got married so the prophet asked him did you marry a woman that was not married before a virgin or did you married a woman that had a previous experience in marriage so he told him no i took one that had an earlier experience in marriage and i did not marry a virgin because i had sisters young sisters and i could not put to them and add to them another girl like them that could not take care of them so i had to get someone with experience to take care of my sisters so the prophet sallam prayed for him and told him may allah bless you and your marriage this wise woman the wife of jabber she told jabber to go and whisper in the prophet's ears and tell him you are invited with a handful of your companions four or five maximum because we have a small tiny goat that we will slaughter for you because the the muslims are in times of hunger and you've been working so we would like to offer this to you the prophet of allah and we have asar which is about half a kilo a kilo or a kilo and a half of barley that we will make as bread we'll grind it and make it as flour and bread so please come and she emphasized on jabber do not let people heal you just push spirit in the prophet's ears because it's very little so jabber went to the prophet very happy very enthusiastic because he's going to have the prophet as his guest and he whispered in his ears and the minute the prophet heard this he said with his loud voice o people of muslims oh muslims let's go and dine at jabba's house and jabber was shocked he went back to his wife dragging his feet not knowing what to say he went to the house and his wife looked at him and she could see the expression on his face he was depressed what will we do so she asked him what happened and he told her that the prophet invited the whole army and how much was that over a thousand one thousand fighters over one goat what is this so she told him the prophet did this though you notified him that he was invited with only four or five he said yes so she told him rest assured nothing will go wrong it's the prophet and he knows what he's doing so the prophet had the camp the people camping outside and he ordered them to come in the fives and the tens inside the house he had the stove and he had this big pot where the food was in and he had it covered and he had the bread with the meat and he would put his hand under the cover and take and put it in plates and people would eat in the tents so whenever they had their what they needed and they were completely full they went out and another group came in until the 1 000 men had enough and they were full of food and the prophet sallam gave away from that food to other houses jabber himself gave away as gifts to other houses and when they unveiled the pot the food was still as it is nothing was missing from it and indeed this was a great miracle of the prophet and this is an authentic hadith this is not in the books of history this is in the sahih al-bukhari the most authentic book in islam there are lots of miracles similar to this where the prophet sallam would gather the whole army on a handful of dates and he would cover it and they will all take from the date and they will eat and eat and eat until they are completely full there is another incident where abu hurairam pleased with him was starving out of death and he used to talk to companions asking them about hadiths and they would tell him the hadith not because he did not know it he just wanted them to figure out that he was hungry and they would call him to their houses and feed them feed him until he met the prophet al-isram once and the prophet saw him and he recognized his hunger so he told him come and follow me he went uh the prophet saws to one of his houses he asked his wife do you have any food she said by allah we don't have not a single thing except this glass of milk that was given to us by one of our neighbors so the prophet says that i was relieved now i can find something to eat i'm starving i just fainted so the prophet told him abu hurairah and he was you know happy because now he knew it was coming so yes o prophet of allah prophet told him go to the masjid and call all the poor people of a suffer you're about 70 to 80 percent and said gosh i was hope i was hoping i would have something but this is the instruction of the prophet so he went to the masjid and he called his brothers and they came back and the prophet sallam gave each one of them the glass and say bismillah and they drank until they were full and after they were filled up the prophet sallam gave the glass to abu hurairah so he was watching what he's watching and and the guy was astonishing what's what is left 80 8-0 so he drank of it and the prophet says drink more he said i drank and i gave it to the prophet and he said drink more and i drank so much i told the prophet by allah there is no way for anything more and then the prophet took the glass and drank from it himself this is part of the miracles of the prophet and there's so many but because we're studying the seerah of the prophet and we're following a timeline a lot of these stories are not suitable to be told now hopefully at the very end we'll be able to uh categorize the things in his life sallallahu sallam according to topics not according to the timeline now the prophet is succeeded with his companions to dig this big trench which is a barrier between medina and the enemy army and the prophet gathered all the women gathered all the children and he had them uh uh allocated and put in a fortress known to be by the name of al-faria and this fortress belonged to bani harita so it was behind enemy alliance it was behind the muslims also so it was protected and this the fight was about to begin because the enemy army has arrived to the outskirts of medina what happened afterwards is inshallah what we will discuss when we meet next time until then um hmm hmm hmm"
