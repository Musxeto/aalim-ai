  "transcript": "she loved Amanda rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallaho seldom Oh barkhad Abdi he wore a saudi hay nabina muhammad in wada early he was like eh marine I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 196 hadith of the law of number Blass in a different narration he says may Allah be pleased with him that the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam said the best fasting at the sight of Allah is that of David or the wood peace be upon him and the best prayer is that of the wood peace be upon him for he slept half of the night and stood for prayer for the third of the night and then slept the sixth part of it and he observed fast one day and broke on the other day we spoke about the first portion which is fasting one day and skipping one day but here the Prophet erased autism is telling us how to offer night prayer and the best means of offering night prayer is to sleep half of the night and pray one-third of the night and then sleep one-sixth of the night again so it's a sleeping then praying then also sleeping so that when you wake up for fajr you have enough energy to do so and if the night is 12 hours one-third of it would be four hours so this means that he would sleep for six hours and pray for four hours and sleep again for two hours however if you calculate it from mother if tell Roger then you have two hours off of that so then your calculation would be from the Asia time until the fuzzer time and usually aphasia is approximately eight average and Fletcher is six its average these are 10 hours sleeping half of it is five hours and this is more than sufficient most of us sleep five hours a day especially those who go to work early and spend about 10 to 12 hours either commuting or working so by the time you get back home and you have dinner and you sit and do things with the family and so on usually you only get five hours to sleep so in this hadith no it's more than that you sleep for five hours and you pray for approximately two hours and a half to three hours and then you sleep the final hour this was the best of prayer as described by the prophet alayhi salatu salam and this is the prayer of Prophet de would why did the Prophet I saw a device of the law eben amer even asked with it because of the long arm last used to pray the whole night no sleep at all so the Prophet instructed him to do this and in another narration the Prophet told him that your body has rights over you your wife and family have rights over you your eye has rights over you meaning you have to sleep your guest has rights over you and your Lord Allah has rights over you so give each one it's due right the same narration the same hadith the same advice was given by Salman and Pharisee to his brother Abu da da when he visited him once and he found that he was exactly like a block number las fasting all day praying all night so he insisted that he breaks his fast and he insisted that he does not pray until that last third of the night and then he told him this phrase when that went to the prophet and told him what Salman said the Prophet said re so salaam salman has told you the truth so what do we learn from this we learn the importance of balance in our lives Muslims have to be balanced and this balance is what a lot of us fail to achieve some of us have a target which is good by itself but if the target makes you neglect other priorities then you are in Los some of us have a target of being the top of his company being the CEO being a rich businessman being an influential entrepreneur for example so he works hard for this maybe 14 hours a day 15 hours a day meetings traveling very hard working hours yet he neglects his prayer because he has a meeting he neglects fasting because he has to work long hours and he cannot do this while he's fasting Ramadan he neglects his wives rights because he's all the time working and when he's home he's on his email or surfing the net and he doesn't have time for her even in the weekends he goes with his friends because he misses them he neglects the rights of his children he does not teach them he does not bring them up in islamic manners because he himself is not brought up in an Islamic manner he does not have any boundaries regarding halal or Haram everything is held on he neglects his health because he's working so long and so hard he develops after few years high blood pressure high levels of cholesterol he might turn to be diabetic he has this he has that deficiencies in so many things and all of this because of his target and this does not please Allah social and it also does not please Allah that you seclude yourself and isolate yourself in the message it only worshipping Allah praying fasting and not doing anything else this is not part of Islam because you need someone to support you so those who give you so Dhaka those who give you money so that you can live and your family can live they are far far greater than you at the side of Allah so the issue of balance is completely important and very rarely that you would find Muslims having this balance being able to take care of their family being able to take care of the religion and learning process being able to give Dawa being able to have their own time with allah azzawajal for cleansing their heart I've seen a lot of the brothers who are engaged in Dawa get burnt out after a while what does that mean they are so active in Dawa in making lectures and organizing lectures and organizing events and so on distributing leaflets doing this doing that all for the cause of Allah that's very good but so many times I meet these brothers and ask them when was it the last time you skipped budget prayer in the masjid a chef I pray only two or three days a month in the masjid the rest i am so dead i cannot pray said why he said I spend my time at night until one or two am working on preparation for events for Dario for soil I cannot wake up forfeiture so the issue of balance you have to have some time at night to worship Allah no one knows about night prayer except Allah you have to fast certain days of the month at least three days this is between you and Allah you don't go to people in the office and I'm very tired today and the guy does not ask you why he doesn't ask you and he's just doing his paperwork and then you say do you know why I'm tired yesterday I spray it for an our and man I feel asleep subhanAllah you're exposing your good deeds and then you say and ham dealer today I'm fasting and Hammond alert hamdillah he didn't ask you but you come out of your way to show him this means that you're not doing it for a lot no you have to have something between you and Allah something secret something that when you are in need you raise your hand and say oh Allah because I have done so and so for your sake o Allah forgive my sins or Allah make this happen because i found a limping cat on the road was about to die and i took it before the cars run over it and it took it on the sidewalk because i made a blind man cross the street and i helped him for your sake I don't go around telling people oh Allah do this and that for me you have to have something between you and Allah but when you don't then you're in trouble and when you don't have this balance you are in double trouble and our religion is built and based on justice and fairness so you have to be fair to yourself to your family to your work to religion and to your body you have to be holistic not only focusing on one part and neglecting the rest hadith number 198 narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him he said my dear friend the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam kalili which is the highest level of friendship he said that he ordered me to do three things too fast the three days every month to pray to raucous of the Baja and to do wit ER before going to sleep now you all know that the prophet alayhi salatu salam advised his companions and gave each one of them what he needs so if some one of them was maybe a little bit angry a little bit stressed when he asked the prophet alayhi salatu salam for advice the Prophet told him do not become angry and he said give me more do not become angry do not become angry and he kept on repeating it and when another one told him more profitable I want to be with you in Jenna he said help me by offering as many prayers as you can why because maybe the prophet saw that this man was calm he didn't need to be told don't be angry but he is not offering voluntary prayers so the Prophet encouraged him to do so a third person said o prophet of allah i would like to be with you in paradise the Prophet told him Anna so solemn keep your tongue muy stirred keep it wet by the corolla meaning all the time keep giving vicar of allah azzawajal and this with draws you closer to Allah I'm the lab namaha pop may allah be pleased with him and with his father when he saw in his dream that he was brought into hell and he saw the people being tortured in to hell when he was afraid two men came to him and said to him don't be worried you are not from the people of hell so he woke up frightened and he told hafsa about it his sister who told in by her turn to the Prophet aerosol of sonam the Prophet said abdullah hammer is the best of companions if he would pray night prayer meaning that everything is complete except he doesn't offer nitrate Abdullah says and since that day I never left night ray so the Prophet gives the proper advice depending on the people we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right assalamu alaikum and welcome back now abu huraira may allah be pleased with him is telling us about a special advice a special order from the prophet is awesome this advice was given to him because the Prophet knew him sallallahu wasallam what is advice first advice was do not sleep before offering Witter this is strange we know that the Prophet recommended that we make our last night prayer to be witty and the best of which it is the last of the night yet the Prophet is instructing him not to sleep before witter why scholars say that Abu hores companionship to the prophet alayhi salatu salam was how many years do you think 5 10 20 it was less than four years Abu Hurairah spent all of his years with the Prophet Ali salatu salam accompanying him and memorizing and learning from him so Abu Hurairah was known may allah be pleased with him to memorize the hadith of the Prophet erase salatu salam and every time some of the Companions doubted what he said he always brought someone to testify when they did not know and they all acknowledge that abu hurairah new things that they did not know of because of these last three years and a half where he was with the Prophet arasana so scholars say abu hurayra used to spend most of his night memorizing the hadith of the Prophet re salatu salam that is why he did not have enough time to pray night prayer and hence when he went to bed the Prophet instructed him to do what to offer witter before going to bed after the death of the Prophet array salatu salam as we read in Cyril a minus bella for Ali Mahmoud Zahabi which is a very beautiful and beautiful book it's quite big he stated that a boobarella his brother and their mother and one narration and their servant but most likely it's his mother after the death of the Prophet Aristotle salam the learning process was over now he's not memorizing because the Prophet died so they used to divide the night into three shifts so Abu Hurairah would play the first third and then goes to sleep his mother would pray the second third and then she would go to sleep and then his brother would pray the third shift when his mother died he divided the night between him and his brother so half of the night he would pray and half of the night his brother would pray but this was in the beginning and from this we learned that it is permissible for a person to offer with her before he goes to bed if he's afraid that he will not be able to what to wake up before fechar but if you can wake up before firing you know that you will wake up before fudger do not offer with her except at the end of the night so what happens if I offer which it before i go to bed and masha allah i managed to wake up an hour before fechar scholars say that you pray to records to record sooner cuz these are tahajjud but you do not repeat the witcher again because the prophet said re sort some there are no two witter in one night ok what is the ruling then on if I pray one with you so that this witted with the Witter before I slept become sheffer and then I pray one third with it this is of course not permitted because then you would have disobeyed the Prophet Alice thoughts none twice when you prayed the second whittier which he told you do not do and then you pray the third water which is originally not acceptable Abu Hurairah said and he instructed me Ali salatu salam to pray 2 rakats of Baja and we know doha prayer we spoke about that before and then he said he commanded me to fast three days of every month the same instruction he gave to abdullah even hammer in an ass when he told him fast three days and this is considered to be asking the whole year so are these days any given days scholars say there are two levels the first level is you fast the white days 13th 14th and 15th this is the best of course you cannot fast the 13th in the ledger because this is forbidden for you too fast but any other month you fast 13th 14th and 15th this is the best second level if I'm unable to fast these days fast any three given days of a month and most preferred and most advice would be mondays and thursdays because the Prophet encourage that is salatu salam us to do this and he told us that the deeds of the humans are displayed to Alonzo gel on mondays and thursdays and that is why I love to be in the state of fasting when my deeds are displayed to allah azza virgin I think we have few minutes left so if there are any questions telecom and I'm sure as you mentioned about a balance in our life if it's not there it could cause destruction so I wanted to know that today we see that there are many people who accuse the practicing brothers and sisters of extremism in such case like why are we having a beard why are you offering violence Allah listen to music watch TV don't wear hijab so even in such cases they are accused of extremism so as the things mentioned in the hadith what are exactly acts of extremism apart from the things mentioned in hadith and how do we reply to these so-called I mean modern people who accuse practicing Muslim brothers and sisters of extremism that's a very good question but it needs a lecture rather than a quick answer but in a nutshell those who accuse you of being extreme ask them one question and one question alone what I am doing and what you're criticizing was it done by the Prophet so I'm or not if they say it was not then they're right it is extreme but if they say yes it was but this but tell them I will not accept as long as it was done by the Prophet a little Absalom either you are accusing him as well of extremism and if you do you become a kafir you have nullified your Islam or you have a misconception that has to be clarified how do I know what is considered to be extreme it's very simple display it cross examine it to the Sunnah of the Prophet array salatu salam so if someone says on the time of the Prophet as salaam beard was accepted but now it's not because the Americans British the Europeans this that they don't have beards I would argue with them and say who instructed us to grow the bid who said grow the beard let go of the beard five verbs of instructing in Arabic just to honor it to leave it who told us to do this if they say nobody then these are not through our proper Muslims because the hadith is in vihari no one can argue with it it is the prophet who commanded us now if you say that time changes then you are accusing the Quran of lying because allah says allah ma'ak melt welcome Dina come i have completed your religion so the religion has been completed if you come today and say yes but now we have to take this out and we have to take this out and this is considered to be barbaric and this is considered to be uncivilized you're changing the deal of Allah so always don't be flared up don't be angry when people talk to you about this take it easy tell them sit down have a cup of tea have a cup of coffee and let's talk about it and at the end of the session it will be an eye-opener because these people have been misguided by the media by their peers by the Liberals who claim that this is not Islamic general things they say without thinking about it and when you tell them where is that reference what's your evidence they don't know even how to wash themselves after they answer the call of nature so take it easy give them Dawa teach them tell them show them what is the Sunnah of the Prophet is a sauna and what is the right way of doing it and this is the way you can differentiate between following the sunnah and extremism extremism is not part of the sooner it's not part of our religion however weakness and humility and abandoning the way of the Prophet is also not part of our religion this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
