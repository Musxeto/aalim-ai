  "title": "SUNNAH: What's the big deal? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] alhamd the topic is the Sunnah what's the big deal the concept of Sunnah is is misunderstood not only among the disbelievers but also among the Muslims themselves we live in times of tribulations calamities fan people around us are anticipating the right moment to attack to strike hard not for any other reason than because we are Muslims they hate us because we are Muslims now in order to get our things straight and back to the straight path not the convention but the real straight path we have to seek the guidance from Allah and from the prophet so what did the prophet tell us Sall alai wasallam in the authentic Hadith listen to this Hadith the prophet says I'm leaving among you two things you will never go astray as long as you adhere to them so this is very important the prophet Alat is giving you a guarantee you'll never go astray if you adhere to them the book of Allah and the sunah of his Messenger s wasallam Anyone who reads this Hadith even if you get someone from the street outside and tell him what do you understand he will tell you if you do not adhere to the Quran and to the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat you will inevitably go astray you don't have to be a rocket science scientist to understand this so the prophet is warning us not to go astray he's showing us the road to guidance to success and he is telling us that this cannot be attained until we adhere we abide by the Sunnah what is the Sunnah though a lot of the Muslims nowadays have confusion when you tell them you have to grow your bead he said no I don't have to it's a Sunnah what do you mean by Sunnah others when you talk to them about important things in the religion they ask you is it mandatory or Sunnah so there is confusion in the meaning of Sunnah linguistically Sunnah means the path or the way that is continuous and constant whether good or bad the prophet says and this is used by by the way in the Quran I will not give you the evidences but if you read the Quran and you contemplate you will find that the word Sun means the way that is constantly used whether good or bad so good people have good Sunnah this is my Sunnah this is my way bad people have bad Sunnah this is used in the prophet saying as well whoever sets a good precedent in Islam whoever sets a bad precedent in Islam so it can be used both ways linguistically okay we want don't want the linguistic meaning she we want the technical meaning technical meaning again there is a number of definitions why simply because there are a number of different branches of knowledge in Islam as there are a number of different branches in Engineering in medicine and in other Sciences so not every dentist can be a surgeon and not every Doctor Who's a specialist in uh eyes I don't know what they call them can fix your teeth these are different branches so sunah for example where it comes to the scholars of Hadith who are the scholars of Hadith science is a diff is a separate branch that deals with the Hadith of the Prophet Alat and they consider their knowledge their science to be Sunnah so they study the Sunnah ask them what do you do they say we study the chain of narrators who conveyed the Hadith to us we study the M the text itself we study the men each one of this chain of narrators we have to know their biography their authenticity their reliability so when we tell them what is your definition of Sunnah then they say in our science that who the science of what aldah there is someone awake keep him awake Ya Allah when you ask them what how do you define the Sunnah they would say anything that the prophet said text this is a text the prophet said this or he did action the prophet used to pray Friday prayers after the giving two sermons he never said this he never told his umah pray two sermons sit in between then pray two never and it's not found in the Quran so how do we know it by his actions Sunnah then by his approvals can I eat desert lizard wow what would you want to eat something like don't go into my intention can I or can't can't I W let us look in the books of Sunnah what did the prophet say nothing what did the prophet do nothing did the prophet approve it yes sat once on his table and ate it and the prophet was watching he did not comment he did not prohibit he did not deny him means that it is sunah it is approved by the prophet Alat wasam number four his description physical or moral conduct and behavior so when they told us that the prophet was not tall and was not short and he was in between his eyes were wide his bone structure was big Etc we take this as Sunnah according to the scholars of Hadith and finally they add the the biography of the Prophet Alam part of the Hadith so his battles his events the things that happened in his life all of this is considered to be Sunnah wow okay this is number one number two when we look at another branch of knowledge in Islam we know the fundamentals of fundamentals of is a beautiful Branch but it is very technical it does not go into details it takes rather the helicopter view over the Shar so when they sayah they're not referring to putting the hand right hand on over the left on your chest in prayer as a Sunnah no they are talking about the Sunnah as one of the sources of legislation in Islam so they believe that the first source of legislation is Quran then the Sunnah which we stem which we take all rulings pertaining Islamic legislation from it then they have the consensus then some would go into anology Etc to the different branches so their Sunnah is not related to his battles not related to his description sallallah alai wasallam not related to the other things that we have mentioned earlier they are related Rel ated to what we can obtain legislative rulings from then we have a third branch known as jurisprudent Shar law this goes into details here the scholars of this branch of science refer to the Sunnah as one of the five categories of deeds in Arabic they call it everything we do has one of these five rulings so if I'm speaking to you now this is an action it has one of the five rulings if you pray if you eat if you drink if whatever you do it has to fit one of the fives either it is mandatory W or at the bottom prohibited and Haram h two and then you have number three something that is highly recommended they call it must if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you have no sin on you for example praying two before of what is the ruling on this this is called must highly recommended in this branch of science they call it Sunnah and then you have Mak which is something disliked if you do it you're not sinful but if you leave it you are rewarded and then we have the one in between in the middle number five which is permissible whether you do it or you don't do it this is up to you so these are the five C categories of Deeds now when you compare F to Hadith to fundamentals of f you'll find that when you speak about Sunnah is different so if I tell you according to the linguistic meaning what is the ruling on F it is Sunnah what is the ruling on performing Haj once in a lifetime it is Sunnah but when I come to the ruling this is the different entering a Masjid with my right foot first is a Sunnah but if I enter it with the left there's no problem Mak but growing the beard is a wag it's not a Sunnah only it's a sunah and something that's mandatory that is W so if you do not understand the reference of the word Sunnah you tend to to fall into error there is also the definition of Sunnah according to the the science of a which is the highest and upmost important science of all is what you believe your conviction and it's based on monism it's based on so when the people of a talk about Sunnah they are referring to followship they don't talk about permissible or recommended or man they talk about Fellowship so whenever they speak about Sunnah they speak about following the prophet and this is the essence of Islam and usually they also talk about Sunnah in contrast to so the the the scholars of they are the foremost prominent speakers against bid because bid Innovation goes against the religion of Islam don't be fooled by their masses by their numbers by their aerobatic uh uh uh stunts some of them you know swirl some of them fly this is not something to be impressed with because this goes against Islam how like Raji may Allah bless him quoted the Ayah today I have completed your religion and perfected my favor upon you and approved Islam to be your religion so whatever was not a religion at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam cannot be Islam so you say she you're wearing a watch so I I'm not praying with my watch in the sense that oh I don't have my watch I cannot pray this has nothing to do with religion this is like riding a car you said the prophet did not do it so you're innovating yeah don't take us away from our topic yeah come on give me a break you said you you have to follow the Sunnah say follow the Sunnah ride a mule and go to your office because the prophet used to ride the MU this is difficult it is not difficult you have to think logically Innovation deals with Dean deal deals with our own practice trying to get closer to Allah but it does not deal with what I wear what I use a pen or a car or a watch or a microphone phone so you have to get things clear Innovation goes against Islam and this is why to the AA scientists when we talk about Sunnah we talk about everything that deals with the dean in terms of conviction that is why Imam Ahmed compiled a book called it aah and his son Abdullah compiled a book called it aah and compiled a book called it aah which included a lot of uh uh things that related to authentic AA without Sunnah your is incomplete how how come she we have the Quran yes you have the Quran but you need the Sunnah to clarify to you to explain to you what is in the Quran imagine without the Sunnah you won't be able to fully understand the beautiful names and attributes of Allah because the Sunnah has brought us a lot of that you won't be able to believe in what all Muslims believe in and that is the coming of the Dalal the Antichrist where in the Quran is mentioned the deal it's the greatest tribulation and Calamity ever to face mankind you won't be able without the Sunnah to believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him will descend at the end of time to kill the deal all what we know in our a in terms of the Soul coming out when people die the life of the Barak the pleasure and torment of the Grave Resurrection the the path the scale the how the pool where we inshallah will drink from the pool of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and many more all of this is not mentioned in the Quran it's mentioned only in the Sunnah and your will never be complete without understanding the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat part of the Declaration of Faith part of your if you don't say it if someone says hey I say I believe only in one God but I don't believe in Muhammad you're in hell no doubt in that don't have second thoughts the prophet saidham by whom my soul is in his hand no Jew or Christian would hear of me and not believe except he will enter hell no one on earth who heard of the Prophet who had the message of Islam reaching him and he does not believe he will not go to paradise no way so part of the Declaration of faith is to believe him sallallahu alaihi wasallam in whatever he says to obey him in whatever he orders to refrain from whatever he prohibits and not to worship Allah except with the religion that he directed us to so you might do the first three but the fourth a lot of the Muslims are not doing they're worshiping Allah why are you doing what you're doing it sounds nice why are you praying this kind of fabricated prayer it it's good why do you do what you do I feel whenever I do this I get in my heart what do you mean he said when I put my hands on my chest I cannot pray that good but if I put it on my forehead masallah I feel that I'm reaching the heavens this is innovation he said yes but I like it without following the prophet Alat you are in your road to destruction and nowadays see in order to be a good crime fighter you have to think like a criminal and now the enemies of Islam are doing exactly the same thing they've tried to undermine Islam from many sources they've tried to attack us physically they sent their armies they tried to brainwash us it doesn't work it Works a little bit but Islam always prevails now their Relentless effort is directed on attacking your Sunnah just casting doubt in your heart even if it's one% good enough that maybe the Sunnah is not good maybe the Sunnah is not complete Quran is okay we know no doubt in that but the maybe this is so once you have this probability the concept in your mind to doubt the Hadith of the Prophet then you are doomed Maybe not today few weeks few months inevitably you will reach there why because Allah has taken a vow upon himself to preserve his religion and his religion includes the Quran and the Sunnah Allah says in the Quran and Allah has revealed to you meaning Muhammad what did he reveal listen Allah has revealed to you the book and wisdom and has taught you which you did not know Imam Shafi may Allah have mercy on his soul says in this Ayah the book we know and the wisdom all All Those whom I have met from the and those who took the knowledge from the companions used to say that the wisdom is the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat it means that Allah revealed the Sunnah it's a revelation it's not something that the prophet saidat and it so happened to be okay everything that the prophet saysat is a revelation evidence the beginning of Allah says in by the star when it descends your companion Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam has not strayed nor he ER nor does he speak from his own inclination it is not but a revelation revealed who's saying this Allah you have doubt no I believe that sunah is from a revelation but this Hadith maybe the prophet was not in a good mood this was said and the prophet is a human being he can be in a good mood and he can be in a bad mood one of the doubts that the orientalist throw in our hearts accompanied byan they say that Sunnah was not written except 300 years after the death of the Prophet Alat wasam you always hear this the Sunnah was not compiled bukari came 180 years after the death of the Prophet da da nonsense all of this is not true listen to this authentic Hadith abdah a companion and a son of a companion well known he used to write everything that the prophet used to sayat and the prophet used to see see this until the people of qur the tribe of quray told him you write everything that the prophet saysat wasam when you know that he's a human being and he sometimes is Happy pleased satis satisfied and sometimes he's angry so do not do this so Abdullah says I refrained I stopped writing until I met the prophet Alat wasam and I told him the people of quray the tribe of quray they are telling me not to write whatever comes from your mouth what did the prophet answer himat the prophet said to him right for by whom my soul is in his hand nothing comes out of me except the truth what does this mean it means that he did not approve what he had they said that he says something when angry other than when he is pleased and satisfied everything that comes out of his mouth is truth and if there were something that may confuse you Allah has made that a blessing even if the prophet at times of anger curses an individual he himself told us that this curse is a call of Allah's mercy and Allah has transformed it from curse into a mercy when he's angry with someone so this is a Blessing by Allah to our Prophet so nothing comes out of his mouth except the ultimate truth and Sunnah is not only for the time of of the prophets salat's life it is ongoing Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe obey Allah and obey the messenger and those in Authority among you obey Allah we know but how do we obey Allah at the time of the Prophet how did Muslims obey Allah by reading the Quran and nowadays how do we obey Allah by reading the Quran how do we obey the messenger of Allah definitely by following the Sunnah by obeying his instructions and this is mentioned a lot in the Quran listen to this Ayah and we revealed to you oh Muhammad the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them we reveal to you a message so that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them what was sent down to them hello what was sent down to them Quran so what is the message that was revealed to him so that he can explain and clarify what was revealed to them the Sunnah these are two things the eye is clear Allah has revealed to him the message and that message message would make clear to the people what was sent to them now if you go to understand the Sunnah this is not the right time you need a workshop but I'll give you glimpses in whatever remains what how how much time do you have don't know anyhow I will continue inshallah until they come so listen if you want to look a little bit deeper into the Sunnah aah specifies whatever was General let me repeat the Sunnah specifies whatever was General in the Quran how is that Allah says prohibited to you are dead animals and blood what do you understand you understand that every type of dead animal every type of blood is Haram correct the Sunnah comes and the prophet says there are two types of blood that were made Halal and there are two types of dead animal that were made Halal so the Dead the the blood is the liver and the spleen these are Halal so the Ayah is General the exception is these two and the Lucas and the fish are dead but we can eat them without having to slaughter you don't bring a Cod and sayb and you Slaughter it's a fish you just catch it and you eat it it's dead the Quran said it's dead meat but it was made Halal so this is specifying what is general also there are things in the Quran that are ambiguous what is meant by ambiguous meaning that we know the word but we don't know the details Allah says [Music] Allah says establish Sal how many times a day open your book open the Quran tell me what are the times beginning and end I don't know how many five okay what's the format two with four S four with eight SAS is three with six does this is confusing where is it found in the Quran it's not where is it found in the Quran that there is a prayer for seeking rain a prayer for the eclipse of the Sun or the moon a prayer for and by the way the prayer for the is after the the prayer while in J the is before now you're getting me confused so how would I know you have to learn the Sunnah if you look at zakat oh zakat is easy sh alhamdulillah very easy huh what's the percentage of zakat what is the percentage of zakat 2.5 or five no no no I'm not asking I'm telling you 2.5 or five or 10 or 25% this is new I have to learn the Sunnah you must it depends on the crops that you give zakat sometimes it can be 5% if you irrigate it yourself it can be 10% if it is irrigated by effortlessly from other than you by Rain by Rivers Etc it can I need binocular okay 15 minutes in enough time so we have to how do I know that 40 sheep the zaka is one and five camels the zaka is one sheep camels and sheep yeah this is a Sunnah and if it's 30 or 40 cows we have this wrong or or the other formula that does not apply here you cannot find this in the Quran you must recite and read the Sunnah go to fasting no Ramadan is close you will understand this insh later on but go to Haj may Allah make us among those who perform Haj this year inshallah how would I know that omra requires seven rounds of the and seven rounds in saf and and there is there is and there is slaughtering there is throwing the pibbles there is going to mifa there is doing how would I know this it's not mentioned the Quran it is mentioned in the sun and the prophet says take from me your rituals then you must read and learn and you go on when it comes to marriages divorces when you come to transaction which is Haram the types of riba and how not to in involve in it and the rest of the prescribed punishment and jinat Etc without Sunnah Islam would be chaos because each and everyone would Implement his own religion and this is what's happening in the Muslim World Muslim countries we don't have the same Islam yeah may we may have Salat but everything else is different and everyone else is implementing whatever goes into his mind without Sunnah you cannot understand Quran she this is an exaggeration Quran we are Arabs we know well some of us we know the Quran is in Arabic it's clear the hand is mentioned in the Quran in different ways you amputate a thief's hand you wash in woodo your hand and if there is no water you wipe with the soil your hand now in Arabic hand can be this from the wrist and it can't be to the elbows and it can't be to the shoulder so when Allah says ask for the thief male and female amputate their hands I go and chop his shoulder this is an exitation how would I know if I make there's no water I just strike the soil or the ground I wipe my face and I wipe my hands why might as well take a shower what are you doing I have to refer to the Sunnah the prophet tells us that only from the wrist you amputate the hand of a thief and to the Elbow you wash as mentioned in chapter 5ah Al and as for tum only the wrist and the hand is to be wiped in tum without the sunah I would not be able to understand this likewise you you cannot understand the Sunnah let me rephrase that edit this please you cannot understand the Quran without referring to the Sunnah even if you were among the companions imagine the companions came to the prophet Alat wasam and they were confused by one of the verses of the Quran Allah says they who believe and do not mix their belief with with Injustice those will have security and they are rightly guided so they came to the prophet Alam and said what prophet of Allah we all do Injustice we have we may wrong our spouses we may wrong our children we may wrong our neighbors how is this we cannot be guided we cannot be uh uh um having Security on the day of judgment because of this the prophet said no you misunderstood this Injustice is shik the greatest Injustice of all Allah says in the Quran indeed sh is great Injustice shortening the prayer we pray four R when we travel two R but this was mentioned in Surah chapter 4 when there is fear of the disbelievers the companions went to the prophet Alam and said we don't have any fear now we're in Medina we travel to Syria we go here and there we have no fear why do we shorten the four raas into two this is their understanding the prophet clarified it to them by saying this is a charity from Allah he has given it to you accept his charity so now their understanding of the Quran has improved so nowadays if you look at the difference sects in Islam there are many as Prophet said 73 All In Hell except one the one who believes and follows the footsteps of the prophet alaih and his companions and this is why we are known as and this is why the Do Not refer to the Sunnah that is why the do not refer to the Sunnah that is why the liberals or the secularists or even these new uh uh wave cult known as ALR those who say oh we only believe in Quran and we believe in nothing else the prophet saidat warning us from them he said soon there will be a time when a man will be reclining on his couch narrating a Hadith from me and he he will say between us and you is the book of Allah this Hadith is no it's disregarded I don't believe in it between you and me or on us the book of Allah what it says is halal we take as Halal and what it says Isam we take Asam the prophet says in warning his um but listen whatever the messenger of Allah forbids is like what Allah forbids this is the authority of the Sunnah Shar is not only Quran it is both believing in one over the other does not give you a complete Islam on the contrary it nullifies your Islam a possibility listen to this Ayah Allah says but no by your lord Allah Asel is swearing by himself he says but know by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you oh Muhammad judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission without these three conditions you cannot be a full believer a full m and this is what the companions understood that Sunnah is the second source of Dean of Shar that cannot be overlooked the idol worshippers use to be frustrated from the Muslims why because they follow everything that the prophet instructs them to do to the extent that they went to Salman Al and theth is Muslim they said to him your messenger has taught you everything even how to defecate how to take a crap this this is my own translation some anyhow so they said he taught you everything including this he did not become angry no he simply said yes this is true the prophet Alat wasam forbade us from facing or giving our backs to the when urinating or defecating and he prohibited us from cleaning our private parts after answering the call of nature using our right hand or to clean our private parts after the answering of the call of nature with less than three wipes or to use dung or bones in cleaning our private parts so he is conf confirming the prophet did not leave us astray he taught us every single thing in our religion in our life that we need and if you look at the understanding of the companions you will understand why they were the most beloved people to the prophet Alat wasam not only that they were the most beloved people to Allah the almighty who has chosen them to be his Messengers companions Abdullah and the Hadith is both in bukari and Muslim used to say may Allah curse those who make tattoos to themselves and those artist who make tattoos and may Allah curse those who pluck their eyebrows and those who have others eyebrows plucked and may Allah curse those who file their teeth separating them making it beautiful and those who change the creation of Allah intending to be beautiful a woman who was known to read the Quran a lot her name is came to Abdullah said hey hey wait wait why are you cursing these people so Abdullah said why wouldn't I curse Those whom the prophet cursed and Allah cursed in his book she said listen I read the Quran from cover to cover and never ever I found such a curse in it Abdullah Mas the companion may Allah be pleased with him said if you have read the Quran you would found you would have found that curse in the Quran she says where he said where Allah says and whatever the messenger has given you take and what he has forbidden you refrain from and fear Allah so understood that in order to believe in the Quran you must follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat otherwise you won't be a follower of the Quran in conclusion you all have heard this before I have not introduced anything new to you the purpose of this lecture is to confirm is to strengthen is to reassure the importance of Sunnah in our lives so when you want to know if someone is deviant or on the straight way not the path again so I will not have to repeat the same if you want to know if someone is deviant or on the straight way you have to see how much is he abiding by the Sunnah I have seen so many people unfortunately even Unfortunately they are that go against the Sunnah and when you give them a gentle reminder and advice he said it's Sunnah doing this as if it is something to look down upon and this is a great error and a sign of deviancy a proper Muslim whenever he is told that this is the Sunnah he refrains he stops he abides because this is a sign of his true love to our Prophet Alat [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music]"
