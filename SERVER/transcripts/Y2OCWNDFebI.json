  "transcript": "today or tonight is the 14th of Feb 2015 and the first question that we have for today is from um ABD Rahman she says what's the ruling on celebrating Valentine's Day and we could go on talking about the history of Valentine's Day and its origin as a pagan Festival then turned into a Christian festival and it's sufficient for us as Muslims to know that it has nothing to do with Islam and it's called St Valentine's Day so it's even not related to Islam it's related to other religions but I will not go to that celebrating Valentine's Day whether by giving gifts or receiving them or selling um red roses or wearing uh red clothes or sending postcards all of this is totally prohibited in Islam the prophet saidham whoever imitat a people he is considered to be among them with them from them and this is very scary because it shows that if you imitate these people then there's a possibility that you will be with them on the day of judgment and part of them so this is totally prohibited to celebrate by any form or mean the problem is not here the problem is that there are two types of people who celebrate uh Valentine's Day those who are living among the cfir in cfir countries in non-muslim countries and these people I feel sorry for them because they have what is called as peer pressure so everyone around them is exchanging cards and we know that the rate of divorce in these countries booms rocket high on the uh 14th of February on Valentine's Day and this is backed by statistics they say that the divorce rate increases why is that because so much infidelity so much cheating uh over your spouse because you feel under the pure pressure that this is the time to express my love to someone I'm not allowed to love but at the end of the day you have to express yourself you have to get out of the closet you have to do this and that and then we know what happens Islam totally opposes that the second type of people who celebrate Valentine's Day are those who are living among us among the Muslims in Muslim countries and I feel sorry for them as well because some of them are ignorant simply they give their wives legitimate love that is they give their wives or their spouses a gift on that day commemorating that they have love among themselves and this this is totally prohibited Muslim loves his spouse or her spouse 247 the whole year not to express it in one day per year and uh uh um pretend that to love one another the other type of people who celebrate this are those who are indulged in Haram relationships so boyfriend girlfriend colleague at school and no matter how many times Scholars tell them that this is Haram this is against Islam blah blah blah they would not listen because they have this rebellious feeling they inside do not love Islam they want to rebel they want they feel this resentment they have this inferiority complex in them feeling that whatever Islam tells them to do makes them second class so they want to excel so they think so they want to be someone else and the only way to do this is to celebrate Christmas new year's Halloween imagine inside Arabia and Arabian countries they some of them celebrate Halloween you find boys and girls walking down the street with a dog what is this is this part of a culture is this part of a religion they could care less because they want to stand out in a crowd and whoever does this ends up in hell as the prophet tells us not to wear not to look to be famous or identified by a certain uh way of style that you are following so Valentine is totally prohibited and it's not part of Islam and it's a major sin to celebrate it and Allah knows best uh"
