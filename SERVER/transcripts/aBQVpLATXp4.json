  "title": "Does it count if I wipe 3/4th of ear with my thumb Must I wipe the whole ear in wudu assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I wipe my ears like like you told me and my thumb only touches two3 of my outer ear this okay because my ears wi than my thumb or not so if it touches four quarters or four fifths of your ear is it okay or not most likely okay uh three quarters Maybe half um probably I don't I don't know so what's the logic of me qu asking you these questions um you're saying I'm I'm overthinking I'm saying that what is mandatory is to wipe and this is the Sunnah what percentage is not mentioned so whatever counts as wiping does the job for example we ordered in the Quran to wipe over our heads now definitely I'm not going to wipe every strand of hair so what's the percentage it's not mentioned whatever counts as wiping does the job so if you do this with your ear and you move on it's what Allah told you to do you don't have to go to details as they say that the devil is in the details"
