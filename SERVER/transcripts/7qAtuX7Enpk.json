  "transcript": "is how many represent ourselves when we put in the role as minority and how can we have to save our probability in ways that are acceptable accomplishments as a participation thank you first of all I believe that as Muslims we are not obliged to justify our religion to others the vast majority of Muslims today are weak and their apologetic no no no Islam is not like this no no it's not it's not like that let me explain to you they're apologetic and they try to defend Islam No again who cares you like Islam as it is more than welcome you don't I have with you I'm not gonna waste my time to defend why Islam says this why Islam is that how do you expect Islam to thrive in places like this and like I don't expect Islam to do anything this is my religion and I represent Islam as Allah told me to do in the Quran and in the Sunnah if we manage to implement Islam as per the Quran people will come to Islam as for what the Quran and the Sunnah but when we try to compromise our religion we will not have good results what do we mean by compromising your religion free mixing Islam no doubt in that I cannot freely mix with women a lot of the sisters are angry whenever I go they come to me and say sure can I have a selfie excuse me I was once sent Kuala Lumpur and I had a lecture in the Masjid as I was coming from University two beautiful women came uh how did you know they were beautiful you should not have looked I'm not blind Islam permits the first case someone comes I look and I go Halas this fraction of second gives me the right to know what's the height what's the measurements everything I'm a man I thought she was asking me a question oh sure can we have selfies are you talking to me the anti-women priest picture no you can't have selfies it's hard she says no no I know not with one two two women Masha Allah so now there is no hulua there is no seclusion two women is okay she says I said no sister I do not take pictures with women even my own daughters by the way I do not take pictures with my own daughters and they're very angry it's only for us I said I do not approve of women taking pictures the pictures can fall in wrong hands no it's only in my phone your phone can be stolen can be hacked uh pictures can be downloaded so they said share there are so many mufti's and Scholars who take selfies with women why you said I'm different because I try my level best to live according to Parana Sunnah I don't care about other in Scholars they will be held accountable on the day of judgment for their actions so free mixing is totally prohibited you can't have friends from the opposite gender or colleagues let alone ask them to wake you up for Salat or no this is totally out of the question abide by Islam people will appreciate you for your principles long time ago maybe 43 42 years ago I participated in a competition in squash I was very young and I was representing the American embassy before 9 11 of course so I was part of the team of the American Embassy in Saudi and I want one of my games so that counselor's wife came down to congratulate me in front of the audience of course I was not wearing shorts I was wearing long trousers and I was playing with a man so when she came in front of everyone I said oh congratulations good match what did I do I said I don't shake hands with women how would you expect her reaction her face turned red that was an insult who cares and everybody was shocked in the audience I left him went away was I embarrassed of course well what can I do either please her or please Allah what will you choose 10 minutes later another British man comes and says Mr Hakim don't be offended everybody in the audience praising you and saying this man has principles they're not Muslims but they like someone who stands his grounds with principles with ethics and you did this we have to abide by the Quran the Sunnah this is the best way of dawa dawah is not speaking only that was actions that was being kind being generous being cooperative giving a helping hand but not compromising your religion not one single bit always abide by your religion the prophet himself on the conquest of Mecca says to him o prophet of Allah give us your hand to give you the pledge of allegiance to give you Baya what did the prophet says I Do Not Shake Hands with women alas this is the statement of the Prophet full stop we as Muslims we do the same I am shocked by how many hijabi women in Arabia in Saudi in Egypt in Morocco hijabi along with mawlana shaking hands pictures what are you doing Haram you can't shake hands with a uh you know it's Haram the prophet says for a man to be stabbed in his head with an iron needle is better than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him so we have to hold to our religion abide by it and inshallah this is the best form of dawah and I hope this answers your question"
