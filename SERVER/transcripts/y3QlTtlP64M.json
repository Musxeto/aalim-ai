  "transcript": "egypt nowadays in the way we live in these concrete buildings we lack communication and connection with our neighbors are we sinful the answer is yes if your neighbors needed help and you turned the blind eye to that and you did not check upon them you're sinful but if you did not know i hope that you're not sinful for that but at least you should know the people you pray with in the masjid so the message is in within your vicinity if you pray there five times a day jummah and you attend classes inevitably you will have to know your neighbors by name check on them meet them not necessarily visit them but that would be a plus not necessarily sending them food whenever you cook something that is good but that would be plus as well so checking on them knowing whether they need help or not is the minimum requirement"
