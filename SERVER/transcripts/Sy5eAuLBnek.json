  "transcript": "my question is wearing the garments above the ankles it is compulsory on all the times are only during the prayer times because why I am asking is I working as a marketing executive and marketing executive marketing off actually M my manager is Muslim but he is not allowing me to wear the pants trouses above the ankles he is telling that is looking like funny so maybe customer will not like you so these kind of reasons they are giving to me so how to handle this issue and if you uh uh do as he says he will be pleased with you but if he comes tomorrow and says your beard looks much funnier it is also he told already he told already so shave your beard as well no no no no just how to handle this issue this if he says this what are you going to do are you going to shave your beard no no no actually I have given the explain from my side whatever I knows okay so if I ask you you will give first of all the ruling for men garments below the ankles is totally prohibited and there are two punishments set by the prophet Alat wasam the first punishment is that if you lower your garment your trousers your bunge or uh whatever you call it below the ankles and the ankles are the joint between the leg and the foot these two bones are ankles if you cover them not out of arrogance but laziness then your punishment is whatever area is covered under the ankle this will be tortured in hell and we know that the least person tortured in hell is a man where a fire stone put in his sandals his head his brain boils from it so he becomes heat conductor he's not in Hell only this so this is the least now if you do it out of arrogance out of pride in this case you have four punishment Allah doesn't look at you Allah punishes you Allah does not purify you Allah does not talk to you and this is in hell all of these four punishments so to come back to your question it is totally prohibited for you to do this a lot of the brothers especially from the subcontinent they wear long trousers when it comes to Salah they fold it but they're sinful the rest of the day in the prayer they're okay but the rest of the day they're sinful for what they're doing and one other practice I've seen also which is very very funny they take a handkerchief and they're masses and putting it on their head and tying it for prayer I don't know where they got this practice from why do you cover your head with a handkerchief either you wear this you wear you wear turban or no don't worry anything but to specifically come and pray with it and 24 hours the day you don't have anything on your head this is an innovation and Allah Knows Best"
