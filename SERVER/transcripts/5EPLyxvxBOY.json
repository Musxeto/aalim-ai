  "title": "The three Fundamental Principles (Thalaathat-ul-usool) Part 4 - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it's not complicated or even salawatullahi wa khatim yes secure edition okay so about him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen eyeshadow i laid in the love what you saw him wash head over water so logo salallahu alayhi wa a he was happy I'm about to a ceremony come to live over a kato and we continue with studying the great Khattab the great Book of Allah that Allah soul and yesterday we stopped at mentioning the types of a bada which can only be devoted to Allah Azza WA JAL and we talked about supplication we talked about the fear of allah azzawajal which so many people don't consider that to be part of a bad that he considered a bad that to be only fasting praying and hatch but this book tells us that a bada is far more general than this as it was defined by Sheikh al-islam iemon tamiya may Allah have mercy on his soul elevated to spawn Jeremy only Allah my Allah my Allah you know equality what I find about herati wall bottom which translates to worship or ibadah is a general terminology referring to all what Allah Azza WA JAL loves whether from rhetoric or actions whether a parent or hidden all what is considered to be part of these things then this is a bada and we continued inshallah with what the author has written and included under the umbrella of a bada yes sir no sir it's not funny now with a lot of time we talked about we stopped at the proof of year and we're supposed to go for the proof for hope rajaiah yes and the proof of for hope are Allah is Allah saying so whoever hopes to meet his Lord and let him perform righteous deeds and not mix anyone into the worship of his Lord okay what is meant by hope because this is a general term that can be used in so many things not only things related to art either well what we are more mostly concerned of is with art either when you hope in what Allah has this has to be accompanied by total submission total submission total submissiveness and total humility you don't hope in what Allah has by believing that you are deserving and this is your god-given right you have to be expressing humility showing your poverty and being submissive to him as well sometimes we can have hope in what people who have and this would be considered as minor  so when I know that this person is a rich person and I speak to him with humility and I have a deep feeling in my heart that I hope that he gives me some money or some gifts this kind of feeling is minor shirk as hope in its entire meaning should only be connected to allah azza wajal when there is submissiveness humility and expression of poverty yes sir the other evidence none the other evidence says the the true for reliance the Walken is Allah and upon Allah I don't put your reliance if you are truly believers so this other aspect of a body which is reliance and reliance is to depend on something or someone so to place your full trust reliance and dependence this has to be only to Allah as the origin in bringing what is beneficial for us and in preventing what is harmful from us Allah says in the Quran and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed so those who believe in allah azza wajal they place their trust in him those who disbelieve they place their trust in their banks on their strengths on their own knowledge and there are different types of tobacco so when you have full dependence on allah azza wajal this is a form of worship when you have dependence on someone who's dead like the grave worshipers and they deep inside acknowledge that Al Hussein will save them if you look at the Shia they say this clearly and they ask al hussain to save them from their calamities and this is major shake it defies a person's Islam whether he has such Dawa code on an idol or an angel or a prophet or a messenger it would still be major shirk now if you have dependence that is slight but not full so this dependence is accompanied by considering that person higher than you having more influence than you so this is minor ship because your heart is connected to him a very simple example is when it is pay day and my heart is connected to whatever my CEO or my manager is going to do because he's the one who's giving me the paycheck and I feel that he's a higher person more influential than me and my heart is connected to his kindness this is Schick but it is minor check you should have the trust and dependence only on Allah Azza WA JAL and this is why the issue of tawakkal is extremely important in rectifying your at either imagine employees in their organizations say that last quarter I managed to have the following sales I achieved my target and exceeded it by 35% I managed to open new venues for our product and I had placed marketing strategy of so-and-so I'm attributing all of these to myself as an indication that I'm dependent on myself relying on my power and intellect even our best the cousin of the Prophet Allah saw Sunday with the Peace of them said about an incident when a thief came to broke came to break into someone's house and they were all asleep and unaware of what was going on as he was attempting to do so the duct of their neighbor started quacking and making noise so the thief felt afraid and ran away without accomplishing his mission so the man wakes up in the morning he says had it not been for our neighbours duck our house would have been broken into and stolen even our best says whoever says this he had committed I didn't worship the duck I didn't worship my neighbour where is the Sheikh scholars say and explain this hadith by saying that the Sheikh is in his heart being dependent and reliant on that duck attributing saving his house to the duck instead of saving saying that it was a lost grace and favor and this is why we should never speak about about ourselves and achievements like saying I managed to do this I have achieved that rather we should say with the grace of Allah Allah enabled me to do this attribute in every every goodness every success in your life first of all to Alonzo because without him you couldn't have done a thing so this is when it comes to otaku in Arabic otaku can also be to depend on and in legal terms to give the power of attorney or to authorize so if I authorize someone to do something on my behalf I have Wallach l2 who I have given him the authority and I'm depending on him to do such a thing this is halal and permissible and there's nothing wrong in that remember the ayah that the chef's coat it was while Allah he fought our kallu in kuntum mu'minin' and there is another ayah I don't know if it was dropped by mistake but in the arabic text it is found and there is woman yet our Calallen llahi for who has bow so whom ever trusts Allah Allah will suffice him and this is what Ibraheem peace be upon him said when they threw him in the fire to kill him after he demolished their idols when they throw him he said when they threw him he said husband Allah whenever Milwaukee allah azzawajal will suffice us and upon him we dependent rely the same word the same phrase was repeated by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam after the Battle of when seventy of his companions were martyred and it seemed like a victory turned into a defeat so as they were attending the wounded and burying the martyrs they heard that the idol worshipers army are coming back to annihilate what was left of the Muslims so when this was said to the Prophet s RAM he only said Hasbun Allah WA Nimal wakil Allah will suffice us and on upon him we depend and Allah tells us from color boobie near met him in Allah he were ugly let me obsess from straw so they went back to their homes in Medina in the Grace and blessings of Allah Azza WA JAL unharmed so that fret we did not materialise Oh Cathy now the proof of Lincoln and Reagan rambha and submissiveness is Allah saying verily they used to rush to do good deeds and they will call on us long in his reward and dread in his punishment and they used to be humble themselves submissively before us so that we have here hope fear and humbling themselves these are attributes of the believers and hope and fear we have talked about this and humbling one's self or being submissive to Allah as signs and to Allah's rulings is also among the things that are well known to people scholars say every believer has to have three things in him the he has to have the love of Allah the fear of Allah and the hope in what Allah has and they gave a description of a bird so a bird has a head and two wings they say that the head is a loss love if anyone does not love Allah he is not a Muslim because if you chop the head of the bird you'll end up with a dead bird or dead animal and the hope and the fear are the wings that the bird flies with if there is an error in one of them the bird will be tilted and would not fly normally that's why scholars say at times of prosperity fear should overcome your hope because when you're prosperous when you have wealth and health you tend to transgress but when you're weak poor or unhealthy you should allow the hope to overwhelm your fear so while we are alive our fear from Allah is more than our hope but when we are on our death beds our hope should be far greater than our fear from Allah the Almighty yes Fe the proof for Russia is Allah saying so do not be in you of them what have you of me don't you have repentance before that no not have repentantly folded okay the the text book in arabic so the translation is not very accurate I may send you another translation issue Allah Azza WA JAL which is more accurate which is the one that I have okay so al Russia what is al hasha al kasha is similar to fear which we had explained however fear is of something that may have and may not happen while Hoshi is of something that is definitely going to happen so it is similar in meaning of fear but it has more certainty to it than fear okay yes sir hey naam and plunder the proof of repentance is Allah saying and turn to your Lord in repentance and submit to him as Muslims so it is not repentance it is Inaba and there is difference between Toba and in ewa but in English being a weak language that was made 300-400 years ago and it keeps on evolving and changing and shifting to the extent that if we were to read any play of Shakespeare we need a translator to translate that to us the language has shifted and changed a lot Arabic is a language that Allah has chosen to be the language of the Quran and it is a miraculous language because it is so strong and powerful that it has so many meanings which allows you to portray a scenery with words as if you're photographing it for example the scholars give an example of the word I'm eyeing has many meanings one of it is the alphabet letter I mean my name is awesome the first letter in my name is I'm also I means the organ I worry - Schneider heinie - the I also ein means a spy when you send a spy to bring a news he's called ie it also can relate to the spring of water that comes from the ground it's called the IE and it also can refer to the identity of a thing so I say I English ie the physical material thing itself it's called I and so many other examples in English usually you would have one or two meanings for a word and this changes with time as it has no nothing sacred about it Arabic is not unlike this the Quran was revealed 15 centuries ago it's still in the same language it was revealed in this language is the mother tongue of 400 million plus inhabitants of Arabia and another maybe 400 million non Arabs speak the language so it preserved or it was preserved by the Quran and this is why Arabic is a very strong language so el Inaba what Tova are two different things Inaba is repentance but in a softer way in a more spiritual way that includes depending on allah azzawajal begging allah azza wajal and can only be devoted to Allah the all-mighty yes siree ma'am the proof and the next verse wishes the proof of second assistant miss Tiana is Allah saying you LOV wash are you alone do we seek for help and in Arabic yeah and I would do II reckon Stein so this form of Arabic structure in Arabic we call it al hassle to specify and identify it's not destiny no Vika Nabu dukkha worship you know to you we worship and with you we seek assistance when you proceed with you meaning that no one else de straining this with you unlike when we say we worship you this means that okay we worship you but we may worship others alongside you but when you say you we worship this is called limiting the possibilities so we have to understand that seeking assistance is also divided in two types I can seek assistance from other humans in things that they're capable of producing and helping so if I have a heavy box I can ask others to come and help lift it up and this assistance is holid because it's within their capacity and are their ability if I were to ask a person to assist me in healing my illness which only Allah can hear then this becomes shake so asking other than Allah Azza WA JAL in what no one can do except Allah Himself this is major ship so I ask someone to make it rain I ask someone open the scene so that we can cross all of these are possible for a larger asking it for someone else would be cover would be things that people are capable of doing there's no problem in that insha'Allah yes sir he and in the hadith when you ask for assistant then seek assistance in Allah okay this hadith is the great hadith of Abdullah I'm not best when the Prophet as salam took him behind him when he was riding a mule and he said to him he will m be the shelter has a lila were either stay under first iron billah in a long hadith he said among the things that he remaining if you ask ask Allah alone and if you seek the assistance of someone ask the assistance of Allah alone and this is only in what allah azzawajal can provide for you and this is something that people don't actually worship allah with you will find me you and everybody else knocking on the doors of the rich seeking what is in their hands while our hearts connected to what they have not to Alonso Asia and this is a clear indication that our Eman has a lot of short comings the following things is the following point and the following point is the proof for second refuge is the other is a la Seine say I seek refuge in the lord of the daybreak in arabic i want to be like 'no shaitana roger no good although the robinus follow daybreak will Falak not the cinta distant here yeah afterwards then all our openness which is the second ayah that author has mentioned so two is one seeking refuge in allah who makes the daybreak who makes the seeds open and a crack etc seeking refuge is asking allah azza wajal to give us shelter to protect us and this again is two types one type is of the things that only Allah can do so you seek refuge in Allah Azza WA JAL from illness you seek refuge in allah azzawajal from enemies of islam you seek refuge in allah azzawajal from depression from calamities from pandemics from many things but you can also seek the protection from people if they are capable of providing it as in the case of someone who is trying to kill you and you seek the protection of a policeman so the policeman can give you protection this is a worldly matter that is possible and there is nothing wrong in it so seeking protection usually is related to before anything harmful happens to you the following thing which is what which is um I remember when you sort out for help that is the proof for action for help is too far I remember when you sought help from your Lord and he responded to you it's okay there are two things two versus the one is seeking refuge in Allah from the allah the lord of the people or seeking refuge in allah the lord of the daybreak English huh then the other type which is known as East errata and still artha is the verse that you have recited which is say which is a number yes okay the next verse no the one before that it is the same way now yeah the same one and remember when you're not help from your Lord and he responded to you okay this is in Arabic called St raha because now they are in the midst of the battlefield so they're not seeking refuge in Allah from the enemy they are seeking assistance and help and protection so the difference between East a Ida and East alotta is the other is oh allah protect me from what's coming it didn't come yet if it came and it's with me and it's happening now i say o allah a RIF knee give me shelter and save me from what I am suffering from and this is greatly taking place with the grave worshippers and they in Arabic is called Al house asking for supply for help and protection now from what is happening to us and they the were the grave worshippers use it a lot when they call their the dead people when they call their peers and etc and this is major sure yes I am and the proof of offering sacrifice is Allah saying say verily my prayer my sacrifice and offerings my living and my dying are for Allah laws of the words he has no partner and of these I have been commended and I am the first of the Muslims okay from the shinden and from the sunnah may Allah cause the one who offers a sacrifice to other than Allah so this is this ayah is an indication well in no solidarity you are no tsuki say verily my prayer and my sacrifice can only be devoted to Allah Almighty and the Prophet said that I listen clearly may Allah curse those who slaughtered - other than Allah but remember the slaughtering depends on the intention so if a guest visits me an honorable person of knowledge I would slaughter a sheep and cook it for him would I be committing Sheikh that's definitely not so why because the shirk in slaughtering is when you do that to glorify the person you're slaughtering for so when I go to a grave and I slaughter a camel why am i slaughtering the camel because the deceased the valley of allah or the prophet or the messenger or any any one who's dead I want to glorify Him to praise him by offering the sacrifice this is but if you slaughter it in the name of Allah for the sake of Allah but you want to distribute it round his grave as a charity to the poor this is an innovation because this is not something you should be endorsing others to do so slaughtering for the sake of others to glorify others is but slaughtering to honor people as guests or when you're hungry and you want to keep meat in the refrigerator this is totally legitimate okay nom and the proof of making oath is Allah saying they are those who fulfill their vows and fear a day whose evil will be wide-spreading UFO NAB in every way 1/2 una omen can assure who who most athira making a vow in Islam if it was for the sake of Allah it is not recommended because usually this is something that Allah extracts from the wealth of a stingy miser person when would people usually do or commit themselves to a vow the answer is when they want something from Allah so usually I'm not paying anything in Sbrocco in charity so I'd say oh Allah if my child recovers from his illness I will slaughter a ship and give the meat to the poor if my daughter succeeds in the final exams I will feed to p2 poor people if I get a raise I will fast every Monday and Thursday for 6 weeks so these are things that are being forced upon us we're obligating ourselves with it which Allah did not mandate in order for our wish to come true so this is not recommended in Islam but when we do it and commit to it then we are praised for fulfilling it and there's no way out of it now that Idol worshipers make similar vows but not to Allah so G to their idols to the trees to the mountains to the Sun to the disease to their graves and such vows are a clear sign of Sheikh and associating others with Allah the all-mighty so I think we will stop here insha'Allah at the second fundamental principle in Shama so let us take questions now Shambo okay so the first question is can you repeat the difference between 1/2 and fresh air please how is when you are afraid of something and this thing might happen and it may not happen so I am afraid of an enemy he might attack he may not attack but when the enemy is on top of my head and he is capable of harming me for sure this is Russia so how should only be done from a large division if I'm sitting in my room and no one is watching me and I'm still afraid of a grave or an idol or of someone of authority to be watching me but no one is watching me this house is prohibited because you should only have such fear from allah azza wajal now hasha is something a bit more advanced where the person that I'm afraid of actually is capable of inflicting harm to me and this is similar in meaning but the difference is in the possibility of the harm coming or not and Allah knows best the next question is a sheikh please when someone sleeps during Ramadan I realized that he has a sperm mistakenly while sleeping is this fast what he had his awesome on his body is the first word this is known as nocturnal emission which means that it's a wet dream when someone ejaculates unwillingly or unconsciously due to his sleep then his fast is valid all what he needs to do is to perform motion so that he can pray now the next question is please is it a lot to carry amulets that have was the Koran in it the vast majority of scholars say that amulets or Darwin that has only Koran in it are not permissible it was reported that Omar Abdullah have normally only be pleased with him used to hang such things on the children but this the companions did not approve of that and it would open the door for many bad things and evil things afterwards so this is known as said dudes area as long as we can block the means so that we would protect the sanctuary of the hate then we should do this in addition to the fact that when you wear an amulet with Quranic verses you disrespect it when you go to the toilet or when you are in a place we're sins are being committed and you're still keeping that and Allah knows best now the next question is a shake please what is the different which industry shahadat as I am confused the first one is eyeshadow and later in the law I shadow and Mohammad Rasool Allah or eyeshadow and land and in a lower eye shadow anymore mother rasoolum Abdo who water soon it's the same thing I don't see any difference except the one the first one was Shannon hammid also Allah I bear witness that the Prophet is awesome is the Messenger of Allah and the second one is adding the servant of Allah and His Messenger and both are correct and valid statements now only Allah can cure illnesses right there is a question allah azza wajal is the only one who can cure illnesses allah is the only one who can provide us with food and drink allah is the only one who can provide us with our salaries but he himself told us to work to put some effort and to walk the paths of the earth to eat from his provision from sufi Monaca Beha what cool me respect you have to walk in the paths of Earth so when you say that only unlock yours isn't that right definitely it is right but you have another question attached to it does it mean that if it's only Allah that cures in this case I would not go and check it out with a doctor of course not allah azza wajal is the creator subhana wa ta'ala and he is the cause of everything but he tells us to go and seek the means if we know that he's the provider of food it would be insane to lock yourself in a room and claim that Allah will provide you with food without you attempting to open the door or to kick to cook the food or to buy it at least so Allah is the one who provides cure but he ordered us to look for that cure as well now the next question is what if I say for example I will fast if I fire if I pass my exam but I don't pass do I have to first know because this was a conditional vow you vowed that you will do a certain form of worship if the condition you stipulated was fulfilled and it took place if it didn't take place then there's no vow to be committed or to be performed I'm sure the next question is what is the ruling on those who are called Goffe like a ghost they call them the dareka and the peak and what they call devic both like they are the peak of the sufi they're calling like the leaders once they they are there and move like they are they a little love is a critical than that this is not nonsense all of this is rubbish and nonsense and it's not based in the Quran or in the Sunnah so it's not part of Islam it's part of another cult or a part of another religion we are Muslims we have Quran and Sunna when they come and say he is audible or he is whetted or his house and they give these names to their peers and to their people who are nothing less but insane for coming up with these notions these are all baseless and has and have no relationship to Islam none whatsoever okay and the next question is what is the ruling on a person that watches a movie an end of spoiling his rosary sperm well fast injury remover this kind of ejaculation was caused by himself so it is similar to masturbation and hence his fasting is void he has to make up for that day after repenting to Allah and seeking his forgiveness now I'm sure the next question is what is the sorry my friend a friend of mine made a vow that if one of our friend passes an exam excellent she will the second friend who passed the exam will fast for three days he/she obligated upon her even even though she was at Eve as I discretion I I don't understand the question she nodded about it he's about the vow if exam as well can she was up first the same the same ruling applies if I made a vow that a person X if she passes the exam I will fast am obliged to fast if she passes but if I made a vow that if X passes the exam X will fast a day which is ridiculous I don't have control over her passing the exam nor on obliging her to fast if she doesn't want to fast so such a vow would be a like an oath I have to expiate by feeding 10 poor people on for that naturally so the next question is a bowing when greeting elders in it allowed Islamically because here in Nigeria it is part of our tradition as a sign of respect it is not permissible to bow to anyone whether elders presidents kings prophets or messengers this is an act of worship that can only be devoted to allah azza wajal my other managable may allah be pleased with him when he came back from yemen he was sent there by the prophet s son to teach the people islam so when he came back to medina the first thing he did was to prostrate to the prophet Isaiah the prophet said Mahad what are you doing he said o prophet of Allah I came from a land where the people prostrate to their kings and leaders and you're more worthy of being frustrated too than them my another prophecy to erase awesome omaha's if I were to order someone to prostrate to another I would have ordered a woman to prostrate to her husband so the Prophet told and taught aya salatu salam wad and those of his ummah that such a form of worship cannot be directed to any of Allah's creation it should only be exclusively for Allah therefore bowing squatting and the likes are not permissible and Allah knows best Nana shake this question I the saying please can you shed a bit of light between inaba and tower I did a fee and to tell you the truth I'm dead tired I don't feel like repeating the same thing I would HIGHLY appreciate you listen to the podcast or this video again it's on YouTube and I apologize again but I think I explained it clearly yes so next question is what will shake say we got in the Joomla yeah can a mudra here Kenaston what did the Arab Sarah got in Joomla don't understand what you mean by Joomla yeah the sentence of what the Afghanistan I've explained that I said this is a format made for hustle and this is an ayah and it is exclusively saying that to you we worship and from you we seek our assistance and have yes sir and then the next question is a woman so bleeding after one week of my period is that consider another period if she saw her purity which is known by the white thread like discharge which is not accompanied by any colored discharges or after one week of a period she saw total dryness nothing accompanying that no colored discharges as well then she should perform her whistle and she becomes pure if after one week she got her period the flow of blood the normal one this would be her second period as well bearing in mind that the total of the days of period the first one and the second one should not exceed 15 days within a month so if she got her seven days period then a week of purity then another seven days of period these are 14 out of 21 the following nine days should be pure because the period cannot be more than half of the month so 15 is the max so if it is less than fifteen then it is considered to be her fear now Allah knows best now normally completion the fear of sorcery and sorceress fall again the fear of it being something tangible this is natural fear it's like feeling fire like fearing a lion when I know that this black magic or sorcerer black magician color is nothing he has to be dealing with black magic whether his white or black you guys may have tendencies of racism now we have nothing of such here so a sorcerer can inflict harm to people so fearing him not because of his authority but because of his harm there's nothing wrong in that yet a true believer who observes that car of the morning in the evening has nothing to fear inshallah as no one can harm him shake is it okay to listen to initiate because I think when a sheet and music there is no much different and you clarify please normal machines where it's only poetry stung by a person a man with a nice rhyme these are hella the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam as in sahih al-bukhari said to the camel leader and his name was Angie Asha and he was responsible for driving leading the camels of the mothers of the believers which means that his cargo that the camels are carrying are very delicate so while traveling he used to sing to them so that the camels would move faster so the prophet said to him erase awesome yeah and Josh at a rue Wyden bill career take it easy with the bottles that you're carrying a metaphor for women because they're fragile and can break easy so this was done by one of the companions in the presence of the Prophet Isis Salam if someone stands up and reads in a sheet which is poetry stung in a beautiful melodious voice with no musical instruments this is Helen providing one is not obsessed with it listening to it like 15 hours a day and the words are fine and beautiful as well as avoiding imitating the kuffara so you cannot you should not have what is known as a cappella will you have vocals but the impact of the vocals is exactly as the impact of the song the original song you should also not adopt the music though without music like going to a famous song by a kafir stripping the music instruments away stripping the bad words and putting your own words but with the same tune this is totally inappropriate I've seen some of the brothers from Pakistan doing this and I've heard Muslims saying that his performance was very nice to the extent that I went and searched for the original Haram song that he's mimicking and imitating to listen to it so why this is not permissible and Allah knows best and I'm sure please what is the different between courtesy of Allah and the ark I did the same or they are different no they are different the Corsi is much much much much smaller than the arch the cookie is this too we're usually in Arabic a man puts his feet on while the throne is where a person rises over so thus the curtsy compared to the throne is way way a big difference between them now the next question Sheikh is is auditing Haram knowing I will be checking interests beta transaction but I don't in any way I'm in a favor of each but just I'm checking it if the record is accorded to the what they call it to the company I believe that auditing when it comes to accounts is not permissible because while auditing if there is a mistake in registering interest or in calculating it you part of your job is to point out that oh listen you registered only 5% interest well actually it was eight so you're pointing them out to something that is Haram and assisting them on it and hence this is not permissible now shake please when I need something from a lock and I make sacrifice if you make sacrifice without any conditions yes no problem so I have my uncle in ICU in the hospital and I'm asking Allah oh Allah save his soul and may give him quick recovery and I slaughter a sheep and I give it to the poor I didn't make any pledge or a vowel I'm doing this as a good will gesture there's no problem in that shot I'm Mohammad Shaikh I think that's all the question we take phenomena I think I will seek your permission not to have a class tomorrow we will Sharla meet next Friday as usual be in the na hi soldier okay exactly no Theron over like a la vía commercial mi cámara he over Monica to leverage all right hamdulillah we thank
