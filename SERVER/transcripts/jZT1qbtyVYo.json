  "title": "Does watching kufr in movies (Thor Magic) takes one out of Islam cuz of ayah \"you're then like them\"",
  "transcript": "this guy is at the brink because what we always answer in our website that watching material that contains kufur is sinful and a major sin but is not cover so watching material that has magic that has resurrecting the dead that has Jinn [Music] usage of Jinn and the likes this is kuffer to to act with such things or fortune telling this is kufur but if someone watches it as a movie or a soap opera or reads a novel this is a major sin or sinful but it is not kufur unless he believes in it so one has to refrain from it now saying that a person enjoys it this is problematic I don't dare to say that this is kufford but at the same time I would refrain from saying that this is a major sin and not go for how would anyone enjoy seeing Allah being associated with others or someone knowing the future or someone claiming to have authority over thunder and lightning and claims to be the son of God as in thought for example who's liked by many thoughts like him this is problematic to enjoy and to go all the way with with such kuffer I would hesitate in saying that this is a major sin and not kufford but I cannot say it is kufur I Yani refrain from commenting on this heinous and and any major uh thing and Allah knows best to go back on the original topic because because I heard in a in the Quran I think Allah says when you like hear those who like Mark the verses of Allah like not sit with them because they'll make you like them so like I was just wondering would that make us like it would that be like a state of Qatar this Ayah is Ayah number 140 chapter 4 suratan Nissa and the tafsir of the Ayah the most authentic opinion is that it does not make a person a cafe it makes him as sinful as they are in their sin not in their disbelief not in leaving the fold of Islam unless you believe in it and this is very important because it opens the door for viswas and OCD in your own Islam so the most authentic opinion is that you are then like them in their sin not in their kuffer so I hope this answers your question"
