  "transcript": "so I fear a lot of f in my home so I spend like a lot of time in one of like many DET mosques the problem is people label these DET mosques as like mid Al and say that one is not allowed to pray in them or even be in them since they do like a lot of F and combine the Turkish state with like the religion if I don't pray with the Imam there can I still spend my time in such a mosque because of my situation at my home who is telling you that this is a Masid on what basis are they labeling it as Mas Medina um so I there are many people that say that and like there are also I think quite um know knowledgeable people that I know that I find quite knowledgeable that also say like that these mosques are not good and I don't know but I'm not so sure it's like I don't know what what a m al is and I don't know that's like actually something that you cannot enter okay first of all labeling people is very easy and especially when there is a hidden agenda and a person is driven by political views that may differ with other to us Muslims we don't care about this we don't care about politics we care about AA so if the ma IM of the Masjid is upon the correct AA he's not deviant he's not an innovator then the Masjid is like any other Masjid I can pray in it I can stay in it I can do whatever I want and don't listen to anyone else but if the Masjid is known to be a center for deviant sects and Cults propagating bad information about Islam or has a bad corrupt AA in this case yes this is true you have to stay away from praying there and if you must because this is the worst or the best of the two evils and the lesser of the two evils then you go there but don't pray behind such corrupt uh imams and just be there because it's a Masjid and you can stay safe there Andel Knows Best"
