  "transcript": "like still admin a team at handling that upgrade I mean Oh sallallahu wasallam Mubarak anniversary I mean nabina muhammad in why the early he was a Phineas main am a bar do assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we spoke about Islam we spoke about Eman and we will talk about essential Allah and all of these were mentioned in the hadith known as the hadith of gibreel peace be upon him when he came to the Prophet Allah saw some in the format of a man who has white clothes black hair does not have the traces of travel on him yet no one knows him among the companions and he asks the prophet s some about Islam and the Prophet told him about the first five pillars then he asked profitable een and what is he man so the Prophet answered by explaining to him the six pillars of Eman the six pillars of belief or faith so he said to believe led to believe in allah his books his angels his messengers the day of judgment or the last day and to believe in eternal whether good or bad now scholar said okay this is a little bit awkward he should have listed all six together to believe in Allah his his books his messengers his angels in the last day and in the divine decree missus would have been more logical but why mention and to believe in predestiny whether good or bad scholars say that definitely this was not said for no justification or good reason and the reason behind that is that to believe in Allah and took me to Bela he what matter okati he what could you be he water sudhi he William L asked her to believe in Allah and his angels his books scriptures His Messenger and in the day of judgment this is all not disputed upon among the vast majority of people but even among the Muslims when you come to talk about the preordainments about destiny about Adam the divine decree this is where people go astray in large numbers and why is that simply because pre decree or three destiny preordainments is something that goes beyond our comprehension and this is why the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam got angry when he wants came to the Masjid and saw his companions debating and arguing about destiny he got angry and he forbade them from doing this one would say share we are free thinkers nothing is taboo we have to discuss everything no this is not correct why does Islam prohibit us from implementing our logic and minds and intellect two things in in in this world the answer is yes you know things that you can understand your word are welcome to discuss think that you need means to understand the system oh you should know your limits with all due respect sir I beg to differ I have no limits Allah created my intellect and my mind and I can use it and think with it and come to great this coverage in trying to handle this I say subhanAllah keep allah azza wajal created us and he knows what is best for us and when we come and try to go beyond our pay grade we will fall and break miserably every one of us has limits and let me give you an example I have five senses and some add a sixth sense so we have the sight the heating the taste the feeling what else may I'm not calculating maybe comprehension understanding these are senses that Allah has given us and we must acknowledge the fact that there are things that our senses cannot comprehend or reach for example my sight there are things that are so small I cannot see and just because I cannot see them this does not mean that they do not exist rather it means that my senses are not equipped to see them and there are things that are so mega and huge that if I try to see them it will blind me like the Sun so if in high noon I try to go and look at the Sun it will blind me so being unable to see it doesn't mean it doesn't exist it simply means that my hearing might make my sense of sight of seeing is not qualified to do so hearing is the same thing I can hear noises around me but there are levels of noise that we humans cannot hear dogs can special whistle you blow in nobody hears it except dogs and they come running to you and there are sounds that are so loud that if I do not protect my hearing I will go deaf and it will bust my ears this is on the layman's level we talked about senses now when we talk about something that is far greater than our senses and that is this the knowledge of allah azza wajal and what do we mean by knowledge of Allah al Qaeda or the divine decree is the knowledge of allah subhana wa ta'ala and hence we cannot comprehend it with our own limited senses and our own limited minds therefore the Prophet Isis am in the hadith repeated the word and to believe in the pre ordainment whether good or bad because this is a category of its own an imam ahmed was asked what is the divine decree what is a puddle and he said it is Illman law it is a knowledge of allah and also in mime Shafi before him he said whenever you want to debate those who disregard and ignore and neglect the divine decree debate with them with the knowledge of allah so ask them does allah know what is going to happen or not if they say yes then they're believers and they have rejected their own allegation about the divine decree and if they say no then they are disbelievers they are kafir this is an article of Eman so divine decree is what Allah has preordained Japan Owatonna and the scholars say that the divine decree has four pillars it is essential and important to believe in them in order to be a believer of the divine decree or of al-qaeda and what are these four pillars the first pillar is Allah's knowledge so we have to believe that allah azza wajal knows everything in details and when we say everything we mean everything large and small past present and future and this is why Alma's knowledge is not like ours our knowledge is limited to this room I can see that there is a TV monitor I can see that there are couches around me I can see that there are air conditioning lights things that I can see I have knowledge what's beyond the walls I have no knowledge in what happens in the neighborhood I have no knowledge in what happens in the country what happens in the continent what happens in the whole world what happens in the solar system what happens in the Milky Way galaxy what happens in million of galaxies what happens in this huge universe we have zero knowledge in Alma's knowledge is unlike this at all Allah knows what was in the past centuries and centuries of events and things that took place Allah knows what's happening at the moment in every corner of this universe so Allah is knowledge is so huge that Allah hears the footsteps of a black ant on a soft rock in the middle of the night allah Sojin hears that and counts every step that ant makes a las knowledge knows what will happen in the future not only that a Las knowledge is capable of knowing what will not happen things that will not happen how would it have been if it were to take place a Las knowledge knows this so the knowledge of Allah Azza WA JAL is one of his attributes and this is why when we talk about a ladder is it created or not we have to distinguish between the noun which is a ladder which is Allah knowledge and between Almohad or the thing that Allah has free or ding which is a las creation it is like the mercy of Allah soldier we have a Roma which is an attribute of Allah and all attributes of Allah are not created and we have a loop which Allah has created and the hadith says Allah created mercy when he created it into a hundred branches he placed one on earth and preserved and kept with him 99 this one branch of Rama of mercy is what causes a beast and prevents a bee from stepping in crushing one gramma so is this llama an attribute of Allah or a creation of Allah no this is a creation of Allah the word creation I'll help this is one of Allah's attributes but what Allah has done through his actions are created and look at the creation so we have to when we discussed this thing to differentiate Bay between Al Qaeda and al Mach duel we have to differentiate between the noun which is a las attribute and the actions or the objects which Allah has created going back to the four pillars of Eman and pillar not what knowledge so Allah's knowledge dictates that nothing happens in this earth or in this universe without Allah knowing it it's impossible so this means that Allah knows what we will all be doing before even we were created when we say how it is possible okay this is Allah his attributes are unlike our attributes so his hearing he's definitely not like our hearing and his knowledge is not like our knowledge and sometimes we give the example and Allah has the highest example when we say that a teacher who had taught his students for a whole year just before the final exams looks at a number of students and say you will get a plus grades he looks at an an another group of students and say that you guys will get C's and he looks at a student or two and he says to them you two will fail and get an F and the students object how do you know this do you know the unseen do you know the right and the teachers is known but my knowledge of the subject and of your ability I can safely predict and say that most likely this is what will happen Allah has the hot sample and Allah's knowledge is unlike any of ours and hence we have to have unconditional conviction and belief in it pillar number two of our belief in the divine decree is that everything was written down so it's only not only Alma's none but Allah Azza WA JAL has written down everything that is going to happen and this can never be changed so in the authentic hadith the Prophet says Ali Saleh Tosa when Allah first created the pen he ordered it to write so that when said o Allah what should I write and last to the pen write everything that is going to happen until the day of judgment the Prophet said RA his salat or Sun and this was fifty thousand years before allah azza wajal created the creation so before Allah created the whole universe that we see before allocated the earth and the skies and the Sun and the moon Allah when he created the pen he ordered the pen to write in the preserved tablet everything that is going to happen so this is written in the president applet that I will drop the pen today at this particular time and in this particular fashion and also it is written that I attempted to drop the pen then I changed my mind and I put it back again it is mind-blowing to know these things it is mind-blowing to know that every single leave that falls from a tree it is written when it's going to fall how many will fall with it the down spiral it will take and how it would lie on the ground which side will it be facing the skies and which side it will be facing the earth every single detail that you can imagine or even not imagine when you have a sandstorm it is written how many sand particles are there and how they will move and shape and strike what will strike my face and what will not so miraculous so astonishing this is known as writing our predestined when allah azza wajal wills that the soul is breathed into a fetus in its mother's womb Allah sends an angel when the fetus is a hundred and twenty days old Janna almost four months so the angel is ordered to write four things his deeds his provision his death and whether his pious and righteous or evil and doomed this is the angels duty to write and this is part of what is written already in the preserved tablet and when it come to it being written down so many questions come to my mind so if everything is written down why do we make du'a oh allah give us this so give it that or cure our sick or prevent this from this or that why do we do this if it's already predestined one you do not know what is predestined to Allah made your dua means of this destiny of yours so it was predestined if you don't make dua Allah would not change what's happening to you but if you make dua Allah would change this and there are two types of pre destiny that is written one that is written in the preserved tablet fifty years fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation and this does not change and there is a divine decree that takes place every single year for that whole year and this is written or dictated to the angels every year and this can change an alter according to what is found in the preserved tablet so for example it can be written that this year I should die and the angels write that I'm to die in like two months however it is also pre distant in the preserved tablet that I should go and visit my uncles and my cousins and phone them and connect to my kinship which adds and prolongs my lifespan as per the hadith Stowell Azazel orders the angels to he raised that and add five years to my life I don't see this I I don't notice but this is what is taking place due to our good deeds or bad deeds but what's in the preserved tablet never changes it stated that I was supposed to die two months from now but due to the fact that I had spent my time calling my uncles and aunts and cousins then allah azza wajal a prolonged my lifespan by five years more or something like that so for of all Allah's knowledge second of all writing down of our destiny the third aspect of it is the creation and Allah Oh of deviant sex argued with this and said it is not possible that allah azza wajal created our bad deeds and they say if I rape a woman Allah created this if the Burmese slaughter these Buddhist monks and the Burmese and many more region they slaughter and rape our Muslim sisters from the revenge' Allah created this Subhan Allah and they confuse people with these thoughts and we ask a very simple is there a creator other than Allah so Allah if they said yes despicable if they said no there's only one creator then they have answered themselves Allah says in the Quran when Ibrahim peace be upon him is debating with his people who worship the idols and the stars he says to them look at what you're worshipping these idols well la jolla Packham LaMotta malloon it is Allah who created you and what you make and manufacture and do so this is a clear-cut evidence that it is Allah Azza WA JAL is the one who creates Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and all our deeds and all what we'd you are late by the Almighty Allah Mahalo hakuna che in Raqqa Daraa who talked Adira and it is Allah who created everything and he gave it its destiny subhanahu wa'ta'ala so this is the third pillar and it is essential that we have knowledge in all of these things because without such knowledge we will go astray like all other deviant sex had gone and ended up with a I do Billa so we have a las knowledge we have writing down of our destiny and we have a las creation fourthly the fourth pillar is the divine will what does the Divine Will mean now did Allah will the things to happen as we see them you see good things we have no problem in saying that yes Allah willed that Abdullah marries Khadijah that's a good thing Allah willed that the couple have a healthy child Allah willed that people who study hard will pass their exams all of these things are accepted what causes confusion is when you say was it Allah who willed that his poor girl would be raped or this whole village would be flooded with floods and mud and people would die or a volcano could erupt or an earthquake would take place did allah will this so the Prophet said adding in salat was Sarah what took me Nabil hidari highly he was surely he and to believe in the pre ordainment in the divine decree in the destiny whether good or bad so talk to me explain to me does allah azza wajal ordained something that is bad that is evil i again we come back to the issue of allah as vine Cree as an attribute which is knowledge and to Allah as actions and on what Allah creates the decree itself cannot be evil at all allah azza wajal does not pre-ordained allah azza wajal does not decree except what is good what results from what Allah has created can be evil and can be good but alas creation Allah's decree a large knowledge is all pure good no evil in it and this is why the prophet alayhi salaatu person used to make dua and he says addressing allah well hi you be addict and goodness easy in your hands what shall rue lazy lake while evil and bad things are not attributed to you but who created it Allah there's no creation create order other than allah azzawajal yet a las decree is good we fail to see we fail to sense the goodness in it because when Allah talks to us in the Quran and he says the Horrell facade you feel very well ba that corruption has occurred on land and in the sea so that Allah would make people taste some of what they had earned with their own hands so that they might return to Allah as origin the end conclusion is to return to allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah ordained upon us to fight in the cause of Allah what we know and call as she had but this is abhorred by human nature no one wants to be killed or injured but Allah says in the Quran why I say antequera who shay'in or who hire on luck maybe you may hate something but there is good in it for you so when one says a las decree is always good but what is decreed what is created can be good and can be bad this is understood Allah create Ted a wolf a wolf is bad or good off his bat and Allah created a sheep a sheep is good we can eat it use its wool what good what good is there in a wolf now the concept of creation of preordainments and divine decree a las creation is good what is created the wolf itself is bad but not a las creation one says Allah ordained that there be Satan now what good is Satan a las creation is good what is created that is Satan is evil but through this evil we get people like us entering gender because without this evil if we did not fight Satan we would not enter Jannah so things that may seem to us that are bad essentially they have a lot of goodness in it that we cannot see or feel without the presence of darkness we can never appreciate light without the presence of endemics and illnesses we can never appreciate health and without the presence of evil we would not be able to appreciate the world choosing the righteousness in us that would all that would qualify us with the grace of Allah to enter Jannah so you have to believe that Allah will do everything that HA is happening around us and there are so many evidences of this in the Quran now having said that and I know that I have taken so much time but this is why it is a very important topic and an article of Eman having said that there are two types of divine will so we have el mushiya we have an error odda we have al khattab al kaba all of these things are divided into two types Allah says in the Quran one Natacha oon Allah ie Shah Alam horrible Allah mean you would not choose until allah azza wajal wills it so without going into details because this would take another hour there are two types of will of allah azza wajal there is the legislative will the religious there is the religious will and there is the universal will what is the religious will it is what Allah loves we call it al yada or al mushiya a Sharia according to religion this is what allah azzawajal loves you to do so Emma loves that all people follow Islam there's no doubt in that Allah loves that the jinn and humans worship Him that's why Allah says wa ma khalaqtu l-jinna wa l-insa illa li i wouldn't i have not created the jinn and humans except that they would worship me this is the sole purpose of creating them to worship me now this is what Allah loves that they all worship Him what happens on the ground and in reality may coincide with what Allah loves and may go against it nevertheless this is what will happen and this is the divine will that is universal whether Allah loves it or not so the religious will or the legislative will Allah intends and Allah wills that Abu Bakr accepts Islam and Allah loves that fir'aun pharaoh and abuja he'll accept islam because allah sent to the messengers of allah to call him to Islam so Allah loves this now when we come to the universal will which is what will happen whether Allah loves it or not we find that both whales were fulfilled in Abu Bakr Allah loves Abu Bakr to accept Islam Abu Bakr accepted Islam both wills were fulfilled as for the disbelievers Allah loves that Pharaoh accepts Islam but Allah as universal will stated that he will not accept Islam and he will die as a kafir so this was not fulfilled and this was fulfilled so when you come to the divine will whatever Allah loves whether it happens or not this is called legislative religious will and mushiya i will I Rada a Sharia and whatever takes place whether Allah loves it or not this is known as el yada or al mushiya al Colonia that will happen that would take place and some translate as the universal will that will inevitably happen so this these are the four pillars of the belief in the divine decree or the pre ordainment or in the destiny without it you will not be able to have a full Eman if any there are two deviant sex part of the 72 sects that are all in hell except one we hope and pray that we are among the one these 72 sects among them are sects that said nothing in this world is predestined and nothing in this world is written down and Allah social does not know that things will happen and Allah social does not create whatever happens and this is total blasphemy and this no divine deviant sect is known as Allah Daria those who claim that there is nothing as such and there is Algeria on the opposite side who say that we have no choice whatever takes place is according to Allah's divine will and we have no choice therefore Pharaoh and Abu Bakr are the same in the sight of Allah because they are fulfilling what Allah has preordained upon them and this is definitely blasphemous as well we believe that we have our own choices as our actions are divided into two types something that is voluntary and something that is not voluntary so my heartbeat is involuntary it's not with my own doing I cannot say stop for a couple of minutes and then reactivate I cannot my breathing is involuntary when I have a fever and I start to shiver because of the temperature might my fever this is involuntary Parkinson disease may Allah cure us and protect us or Alzheimer involuntary but when there is food in front of me this is my action and on who's deciding to eat and if there is a lot of sugar in it I refrain because I'm diabetic I know that this is harmful when I wake up and I am sick I take the medicine though I know it tastes awful and horrible and I don't want it but I have to take it and when I see good food that is calling me to eat it but I know that there is harm in it I refrain who's doing this me so I cannot use predestiny to justify my sins okay why did you fornicate with that woman what lie avi Allah wrote that upon me and I had to do it Subhan Allah is he right one would say well Allah did write this upon him I know but is he right in justifying his evil act with Allah's predestiny no because he when he committed zina did not know whether Allah had registered this upon him or not so to fall into sin and claim that this happened because it was predestined by Allah I would advise him to go to the highest building in town and jump from the seat from the roof and if it is predestined that he will fall in his feet and walk home it will happen and if not then this is a las predestiny would he accept that you crazy of course I will not do this who's in his right mind would go and jump from a 40 or 50 stories high you have to be crazy and I would say the same thing who in his right mind would go and fornicate knowing what Allah has prepared for those who commit zina or steal or lie or not pray for own time or be disobedient to his parents because you would be crazy for doing this exactly like that man who is jumping from a high riser anyhow there are so many things that we can talk about but I'm afraid that we don't have enough time in sha allah what i have mentioned to you with be an eye-opener for you to understand the concept of divine decree and Elijah knows best I think we have like a time for a couple of questions Jacques Nasser I'm shallow in the stations and emissions eating in texture no problem take your time all right the first question here is a is invested in foreign currency in order to avoid the risk of another currency devaluation miss upon his name there is no problem investing in gold or investing in foreign currency with the condition of being simultaneous in exchanging what is how bump is that I buy gold not on the spot so the halal is to bring my full suitcase filled with Mira and I give that in exchange hand to hand for $10,000 I take the $10,000 I put it in my pocket Selam aleykum totally Hallett I keep the 10000 under the mattress or in my pillow for six seven months until the dollar goes up near it goes down I exchange it for the current price and I take a bigger suitcase full of me era and I go back this is Helen what is Haram is doing that online a Jamila how are you my friend listen I have about hundred million ii-era how much is that gonna be in dollars mmm good price okay hollows done deal I'll send you the money and you keep the dollars with you or put it in a safe or send it someone else or deposit in my bank account all of this is not Holland why sure because this is what there was no simultaneous exchange it has to be physical in presence hand to hand likewise with gold Highsmith currency exchange I have $100 here you go can you cash it please okay come after half an hour okay thank you and I leave Harlem Arriba he says okay give me the hundred dollars I'll bring it to you in the afternoon Harlem River so I hope this answers your question you can deal in currencies providing that the buying and the selling and the exchange is done physically and simultaneously okay now the next question is what is the ideal time to recite certain work at night and I will study immediately after my show so now or wait till I am about to see no you are you should recite it while you are lying on your bed or at least sitting on your bed before you sleep reciting it after salat Elisha the most authentic opinion is that it is not the appropriate time for it furthermore sugar is it authentic that sucks actually prevents you from the punishment of the grave yes it is alright miss is authentic the extra stone is I will put that kinda Education Foundation and we design images to facilitate demonstration of our message and to aid in our campaign we also sometimes edit photos to suit the message we are communicating does this fall under the category of image creation if you create or draw images of living create pictures yes this falls under the one of the major sins in Islam the most tormented people on the day of judgement are those who create images the Prophet said Ali Saleh to Sarah editing photos is harm when you use Photoshop so you look at my face I'm an old man with white beard with some wrinkles on my face maybe Danny and you come and try to remove some of the pimples old pimples traces put some gray or black tone to my beard try to make me ten or twenty or thirty years younger those snipers adding editing it true Photoshop this is totally Hara editing it in the sense that okay the background doesn't look nice we're gonna put a jungle behind you and the lights are not good so we are gonna put some brightness but not editing my features or my actual creation that Allah has created this is permissible and there's no problem with that now second expression of the samurai from my family and people who do not know arabic so i was told to do touch lead for my family say that this is a blind following and i should follow adi this is not true because those who claim to be following the hadith are also doing taqlid so now when your family says you have to follow the hadith ask him a simple question do you know arabic they said no said okay how do you know that the hadith you're following was authentic they said because sheikh al albani authenticated it so you're blind ly following sheikh al albani because there are many scholars who oppose Albani in authenticating that particular hadith besides do you know whether that person who translated the hadith his translation is accepted or not this is known we don't know but he definitely sure it should be okay then you're blindly following the translator as well so their concept of not following an imam or a sheikh is not 100% true and their concept of following the hadith is not 100% true because they don't have the means and tools to follow the Quran and the hadith properly when they do not understand Arabic when do they do not understand what was meant of that particular hadith and they have to rely on the understanding of a scholar for example like me or a student of knowledge who is conveying it to you so you are blind following me yes I'm saying call allah allah rasool allah says and the power if it said our exercise so you think that you're following what is authentic but you're again depending on what I'm saying and Allah knows best I'm sure next question is Shay can you please elaborate the Haditha bothered or neo-nazi the women's Olivet Osteen this hadith is when a person see a another person who was afflicted by a calamity so the Prophet said I restore some whenever you see someone who is tested by allah azza wajal and you say this Dora al-hamdu lillahi levy I find him a patella who be what for bullying either a Syrian man holla at a villa that Allah would not test him with the same calamity so I enter a room and I see someone who's been tested by Allah and this is a test that is not an indication of a large anger with that person rather it's a test so the man is handicapped he's paralyzed waist-down he cannot walk or he's blind or he has a disability I wouldn't say whoa this guy's sinful and Allah as I understand with him I'd say that this is a test laughs and I praise Allah who had made me well from what you he has tested you with and he favored me over a lot of his other creations a lot of the people I am better than them not that I am in Jannah but I am better than so many people who are poor because Allah gave me money I'm better than many people who cannot walk because Allah gave me legs to walk on I am better than many people who cannot see or who have this or that so this is the meaning of the hadith not to say this into the fur to the face of the person you don't come to a person who is being tested who has a disability and you say to him Salam alaikum ah hey al hamdulillah lady I'm sorry Metallica be here this is inappropriate you say this in yourself to acknowledge Allah's favours and blessing upon you and to be able to thank Allah for his blessings and favours apartment manager Islamic whom I often experience some torts about Allah such as doubt on the creation creators and activities is there anything that I can do to get detached from such negativity most of my counseling sessions unfortunately are being held with people with such intrusive thoughts and bad OCD and most people with the grace of allah azza wajal that when you talk to them in the first 15 to 20 minutes 80% of what they're thinking of it is gone because Shaitaan deals with people according to their religious orientation mice a pond is far more capable than yours my Shaitaan is a student of knowledge he knows the ins and outs where he can confuse me and cause me to panic where the Shaitaan of a normal layman would come and cast a little doubt that is so funny for me when people tell me chef I had a doubt because of this in that season away you kidding me this is normal a sure I'm seriously refused because this is that the listen one plus one equals two end of story the guy says nah I didn't know it was that easy Shakalaka sure so you have to gain a lot of knowledge to reduce the impact of Shaitaan over you 99% of all counseling sessions that I give I find that the vast majority of the people that come to me have zero knowledge the moment I tell them the Prophet said Alice or some so and so they said I didn't know Cheryl I if I knew this single hadith my life wouldn't have been that miserable for ten years des Alcala her end of story so you need to acquire knowledge to learn more and you need to sit and this is not free advertisement unfortunately I wish I can sit with everybody my counseling sessions are too expensive because my time is expensive so one hour is $200 american-us that's a lot of money but at the end of the day I do not have time and I have a website where you can post your questions although I have limited ability to answer 150 150 questions a day this is why I in the moment we open the portal for questions and the first half an hour it's full Lakota is gone but I apologize but I have so many things to do I wish I can sit with everybody and for free which I cannot afford so you should look for someone that we would sit with you and talk to you and someone who has knowledge in order to fix and eliminate these intrusive thoughts easily and you will find no problem afterwards inshallah unanswered question is when I am reciting the Oscar do I have to raise my voice or not no you don't have to do that the most important thing is that you move your tongue and lips so when you make silent at cards do you do like this you're moving your lips but if you keep your lips sealed and you recite the Quran or you make that car or you make duaa in your mind with your lips sealed this will not be answered or accepted now check the next question is please what is the Islamic ruling on a male and a female circumcision as for the male circumcision this is mandatory and this is known to all Muslim scholars that male circumcision is mandatory and it's highly recommended to be performed on the seventh day of the birth of a child as for female circumcision this is an issue of dispute some scholars say that it is not permissible others say that it is mandatory and the middle opinion is that it is recommended providing that there are people who are knowledgeable on doing it because when it is done in Africa specially it is female genital mutilation which is prohibited and Haram and this deprives a child woman from enjoying sex like they are supposed to this is something that is natural and human but if it is done in a vicious and barbaric way this deprives woman from having any feelings or enjoyment and this is totally Haram and this is why nowadays I believe that this is not at all recommended because we don't know if there are specialists and doctors qualified to do this because the tip that is removed if they remove too much a woman would not have the ability to enjoy intimacy and this is why it is maybe becoming something that is not recommended due to the fact that there aren't people who are qualified to do it and Allah knows best I'm sure the next question is what is the ruling on bitcoins trade interests I have a clip that I recorded like two years ago and it as usual made a lot of noise where I believe that dealing in Bitcoin is ambiguous it has no value there is nothing concrete that you can hold in your hand ease is it's untenable and it goes up and it goes down like gambling and the time when I made the clip it was I think twenty thousand dollars for Bitcoin and a week afterwards it fell down to like four thousand so those who bought it lost sixteen thousand dollars in or over night or something like that and it isn't something that you can protect people can hack and get it people can't forget their passwords and lose it and it is something that is man-made to fool those who want to become rich quickly neglecting the fact that they will also become poor quickly and Allah knows best all right shake someone asks a question bill and the first question you're answered about investing or the occurrences so this person is saying from the question does it mean that the use of financial instrument known as forward and futures haram futures are haram of course because you're gambling you're not having something to base it on you just say that ok I will buy something in the future and I will sell something in the future and this is all ambiguous anything that is ambiguous is Haram the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that there are different types of haram transactions among them is by your own mula masa whatever you touch is for ten dollars so I can give you something that is a diamond and I can give you something that is nothing but you are willing to go for the challenge and to take a chance this is Haram if I say that you can buy whatever is in this bag for five dollars and in it there might be my Porsche car keys and it might be nothing except a bunch of keys that open no locks and you go for it so these buying in through merchants or futures and in the binaries and they have different names for things that are all based on gambling on prediction on buying things or selling things that you don't even possess the options but selling something that you didn't even possess or buy yet it's just gambling an on paper and all of this is haram my friend like this will last question for today inshallah can I recite surah fatiha after I recited surah when I think I have forgotten to recite it before I think the person's accident when they are making Sola and they recite surah before fight here can they come back on such party again incense Allah this is one way of understanding it the other way of understanding it is a person reciting the fat you had and reciting who Allahu Ahad and just before he goes for rock or he remembers he said maybe I made a mistake in al-fatiha or I think I did not decide the Fatiha he's got a doubt and fact he's a filler so he says can I recite it again inshallah there's no problem in reciting it again just to be safe but you have to ensure that this is not reoccur in every salat because if it is occurring and every solid this means that you have an OCD and Shaitaan is messing up with you ignore it and just go for rock or and a large surgeon knows best masha'Allah Sheikh I think we come to the end of today's class barakallahu FICO Musa Qala here and hope to see you in Sharla next Friday and until then a little familiar what's American rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh it sounds like it"
