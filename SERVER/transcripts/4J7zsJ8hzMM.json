  "transcript": "foreign huh it was obvious to the muslims that it was almost an inside job now the jews had put their cards on the table and they've declared war against islam they broke all the treaties between them and our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and they said so many bad things about him when saddam said even they informing him about their treason and their breaking up of promises the muslims were afraid because they were surrounded by enemies and there were enemies from within and those were the hypocrites the jews tried to spy on the fortresses where women and children were kept there and they also kept on supplying the mushrikeen the enemy army outside medina and this is one of the reasons that the enemy army lost the battle when they came from mecca and the enemy army that came from west uh from the from the center of arabia from rattafan they came to fight not to surround and besiege a city so they did not have enough provisions and supplies with them maybe it was enough for few days a week at most but not for four weeks for a whole month so when they went they were frustrated and soon they were out of food and water and the jews had to supply them the prophet alaihis a lot of soldiers managed to intercept 20 camels with full food and water loads and supplies to the polytheist army then it was clear that they have declared war the muslims were afraid of what's going to happen and they did not have any support from outside of medina the felt pity on his people especially on the people of medina because the prophet and the migrants who came with him they are considered to be guests so all of these problems were on the head of al-ansar the residents of medina so the prophet came up with an idea and he brought sad and sad the leaders of their tribes and he asked their advice he told them i saw that everyone around you is collaborating to attack you therefore i thought and i'm taking your advice in this i thought that i go and talk to the tribes of ratafan and especially with eben hassan and al-harithev the leaders of the main factions of the army and to agree with them that i give them one third of the harvest and fruits of medina for a full year and in return they would retreat and leave us alone maybe if this happens then we can fight the remaining army of quraysh and the jews so sad ibrahid and saddam said prophet of allah if this is the instruction of allah then you have our full obedience and we will acknowledge and do what you tell us but if this is something from your own thinking and you are doing this for us by allah this is not acceptable o prophet of allah before accepting islam and being honored with this great religion the tribes of ratafan these bad ones could not dream of getting one piece of date except as form of hosting them when they are our guests or when they buy it no way they would have dreamt to get this free of no charge so now after allah has honored us with islam and we have our pride and dignity with this great religion and you o prophet of allah is up you you are among us they want us to give them these dates one third of it freebies for nothing by allah we will not give them anything except the edge of our swords so the prophet saw sallam when he heard this he was relieved because he knew that this was the right thing to do and he just wanted to comfort the companions of allah by offering one-third of the fruits and the harvest of medina to in order for him to ease the pressure over medina and alhamdulillah it was decided that they will not give anything and they will not surrender anything during this period naim ibn masrood may allah be pleased with him reverted to islam and the name of ms oda if you recall long ago he was a trustworthy person for the polytheists in quraish and he knew that they were changing their trading route instead of going through and next to medina to sham they decided once to go to the east all the way to najd and then to iraq and then come back to sham and while he was sitting with one of the muslims they were both drinking he got drunk and he spilled it all out and the muslim took that news to the prophet and they managed to get this uh caravan filled with silverware and gold and and merchandise now it was time for naim even to revert to islam but nobody knew about him so he went to the prophet and told him that i have accepted islam and now i am a soldier of islam what do you want me to do how can i help so the prophet salallahu told him that war is a trick it's a it's a strategy and planning so if you can deter them prevent them from attacking us do whatever you want to do naeem was very smart man he's among the smartest arabs and he had you know wit so he went to the jews and he was an ally to them he went into the fortresses they hosted him they honored him they gave him food and then this went on to discuss things so they told him what do you have name so he said you know that i would never ever betray you and i would always give you the sound and honest advice so they said yes we know what's new he said now your collaboration and coalition with the people of quraish and the people of ratafan is a very dangerous thing if anything wrong happens they will go to their cities their villages their homeland they will go back to their families and children but if anything goes wrong for you you are here in your land surrounded by muslims do you think that muhammad sallam and the muslim army will leave you they will not do anything for you you are definitely mistaken so the jews realized that they were not in a very good position well actually their leader khabib nasa knew this from the very beginning but he took the risk so they told him so what is your advice to us he instructed them that whenever the mushriks of quraysh and ratafan approach you to fight tell them that we are afraid of what's going on and we want guarantees and the only acceptable guarantees to us would be that you give us hostages from your own dignitaries let them come in our fortresses let them dine and whine and you know enjoy themselves but these would be as a guarantee for us the jews liked the idea and they thanked naim and naim went he did not go back to medina he went straight to quraish and to ratafan and he told them exactly the same thing and he told them that you have to be careful of the jews because i know them i'm their ally the jews whenever they find the suitable moment they will attack you and according to my knowledge and inside information i came to know that they have their own negotiations with muhammad the prophet of allah and they showed him that they regretted what they've done and as a sign of good token they've decided to present the prophet allah with hostages from among you so be careful because they do not intend well with you so the polytheist you know had their second thoughts after 24 days waiting in the cold weather and under these circumstances without any food or a water with ten thousand men all agitated wanted wanting to fight or leave so the jews were prepared the politicist army was also prepared the dignitaries of quraysh and ratafan sent an envoy to the jews requesting them from below their fortresses come on let's launch an attack on the on the muslims so the jews replied to them that well we cannot launch an attack at the moment because we're afraid that the prophet's army would come and retaliate from us and whenever anything happens you will immediately go back to your country but we're stuck here therefore as a guarantee we would request you to send us some of your dignitaries to be hostages in not hostages but to be guests in our fortresses until the launch of this war is over immediately as they have said this the politist of quraysh and of ghataphan understood the message and they said this is exactly what na'im warned you about and they did not accept to give them anything and communication was cut from that moment it was cold they were hungry but we have to break now and inshallah after the break we will continue the story of the battle of alhamduck stay tuned hmm to the quran we live in a universe that worships allah it is not just human beings who celebrate his praises but animals as well join us every wednesday at 20 gmt for your show even animals glorify and welcome back the situation is very difficult but now with the help of na'im even massaud may allah be pleased with him the polytheist army does not trust his allies from the jews and the jews do not trust the polytheist army from quraish and from ratafan the time was windy and it it had a lot of cold and hunger in on both sides and allah azzawajal described that the prophet salallahu when he prayed to allah and supplicated that he may send his soldiers to attack these parties allah sent the wind that overturned the pots and took away the tents they had it was a hurricane like and allah sent soldiers from the heavens to put fear in the hearts of the polytheist army now remember it took them two weeks to four weeks to take the trench and it took the polythus army to surround him about 24 days and nights and that was not a very easy thing to do you can imagine the feelings of the muslims at that time and in so many cases one would hope and pray that he was with the prophet sallallahu salaam to protect and defend him is it this what you feel yeah muhammad i believe that maybe i would wish obviously like i wish if i would be there but i don't know which party i would be in unfortunately maybe i would be in the wrong party again what do you think yeah i think that sometimes i feel i want i want to be with the prophet sallam at that time to fight with him and sometimes like said sometimes maybe that the destiny of allah maybe you're on the wrong wrong side yes it is not a very easy choice to do and this is exactly what happened once with hudaifa ibn aliyah may allah be pleased with him as reported in an authentic hadith do you remember how they familiar man what happened with him was a companion of the prophet and his father ali a man was killed on the battle of by the swords of the muslims when they were so confused after they heard that the prophet was killed that is al-salam amidst the confusion they were hitting whomever they saw and they did not recognize recognize that yemen was a muslim was his their brother and they killed him and when the prophet saws wanted to give herdaifa the blood money for his father he said no this is a charity for the muslims and this drew hadifa closer to the prophet as he was known among the companions of the prophet as the one who keeps the secret of the prophet is he the one which prophet sallam left the names of him well he gave he did not give him the names but he was with the prophet allah when a group tried to kill the prophet sallam a group of the hypocrites and this is another issue so definitely even a man tells us that once he was in a gathering of those who came after the companions at tabi'in men who were not fortunate to see the prophet but they met his companions so one of them was saying by allah if i if i were with the prophet i would have done so and so and so i would have done wonders in protecting him and obeying him haditha was there and he said don't say that and then i said why he said don't say that because i was there and i'll tell you what happened only in in one occasion on the battle of al-azab the trench or the the the parties it was so cold it was so dark and we were so tired and hungry and this is a footnote they were so afraid to the extent that they were round the clock monitoring and anticipating the time that the the enemy would launch its attack imagine if you are 24 hours on full alert this meant that you could not sleep properly you could not act normally to the extent that it was reported that the prophet allah is salaam himself did not pray as our prayer afternoon prayer until the sun sat and omar also had the same thing and some of the companions missed few of the prayers not because it was intended to be so but they were so engaged and focused on fighting and monitoring enemy movements to the extent that they forgot it was time to pray so definitely a man is telling us that the night was so cold and dark and we were so tired and hungry that the prophet saws and this is what was at the very end of the battle of al-hamdu the battle stood that the prophet saws stood and said to his companions who would go and monitor the enemy army and bring me the information needed and i will pray for allah that he becomes with me in paradise and nobody stood up imagine the companions ali abu bakr or umar nobody stood up the prophet sallam repeated his request who would go and get me the information and he will be with me on the day of judgment in paradise nobody stood up he repeated that for the third time nobody stood up then he said hudaifah stand up hadifa says well he called me by name so i had no excuse not to stand up because at the beginning it was a choice so whoever wanted to take the chance it was his hadith and now he's like order it is an order straight military order and before it's an army or military it's something from the prophet of allah and he has to obey the prophet's instructions so he says that he stood up the prophet told him go and get the information about the army and what they're doing but do not provoke them do not do anything that would bring their attention to us he says that i walked all that distance in the midst of the night it was so cold but subhanallah as if i was walking in a sauna it was warm i was sweating and i didn't feel anything of that cold weather so i went to a very close area from the camp and i observed what was going on i saw abu sufyan facing the fire and trying to get warm it was so close to the fire and he was so close to me i took an arrow and i put it in my bow and i wanted to kill him to throw him and i could easily hit him with so i had the bow and i had the arrow all what i had to do was to shoot him but then i remembered that the prophet said alice islam do not provoke them so i went back i told the prophet allah that allah the almighty had sent wind over them that all their pots were turned over they did not have any tents because when whenever they erected the tent the wind came and blew it away and they were discussing to leave so the prophet salaam praised allah and told him go to sleep hadifa he said the minute i finished saying this to the prophet sallam i got the chill again and he got called back again and with the grace of allah the battle of al-hamdu was over the enemy armies went back to their countries defeated they could not penetrate medina and there was no point for them in surrounding it and besieging it because nothing was materializing to them the prophet went to madinah alhamdulillah resting and in his peace of mind but he was met by through arc angel gibral and he told him muhammad you've taken off your war gear we angels have not because the war is not over and he instructed him to go to the jews those who betrayed and terrorized the muslims who broke all their promises who were this close to attacking the muslims and causing the destruction of this great religion of allah they actually tried when they send the spy to the fortress yes but they did not attack physically except on this that particular occasion but they supplied if it were to them they would have done whatever they could in order to defeat islam and the muslims so this was grant treason and this cannot be accepted from them so the prophet allah ordered all the soldiers to go and besiege bani koreva three thousand men went there and they surrounded uh the village of bani quraida the prophet said ali allah not a single one of you must pray asar except in banikhareva so they went but it was close to sunset and the muslims were in dispute should we pray or shouldn't we some part of the muslims part of the muslims said that we should pray because prayer is something that is divine is from allah and we have to observe the time of prayers and the prophet told us that we should pray asar in because he wanted us to escalate our movement and to make it much faster than usual and they prayed on the way the other companions thought no the instruction was clear do not pray until you reach and when they reached bana quraydah and they informed the prophet sallam that half of us did this and half of us did not pray the prophet sallam did not comment on neither parts which indicates to us that if a person does his best in accordance to the knowledge he has and his best might be right and might be wrong then he is rewarded at the side of allah if he succeeded in achieving the correct thing he would get two rewards and if he fails he will get one reward because he put all the efforts he could in this verdict i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time via manila was oh oh"
