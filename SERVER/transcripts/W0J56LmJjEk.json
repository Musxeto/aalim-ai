  "transcript": "spending in the cause of Allah is something that Allah loves Allah gave us the parable of those who spend in charity like a piece of grain and this piece of grain manages to grow and produce more than 700 pieces of grain and Allah multiplies to whomever he wishes the prophet told usat that one good deed is multiplied by 10 and then multiplied by an amount that only Allah knows and he told us that whoever pays something in charity Allah takes it with his hand and Allah increases it blesses it until it becomes becomes as big as a mountain without you knowing it giving in charity is praised in Islam whether you conceal it and give it in secrecy or you give it publicly it is praised in Islam and concealing it is better for a Muslim when you give Allah replaces that and blesses it the prophet told usat the wealth of an individual would never decreases through charity though logically if you have an amount and you take part of it for charity that it has reduced has been reduced but the prophet tells us no it does not decrease on on the contrary it increases and Allah blesses it the prophet used to say to spend B give in charity and do not fear that Allah who's over and up uh uh his throne would reduce and minimize your provision those who give they trust Allah they have full dependence and Reliance on Allah because they acknowledge that Allah Asel is the provider the good news is that not necessarily you give money away from those who are around you the best of Charity the prophet says is what you spend on yourself what you spend on your spouse what you spend on your children so the more you give to them the better the charity is charity is a very wide and Broad word that yet the prophet Alam told us that that the best of Charity is providing water so digging Wells bore holes running streams from Rivers providing villages with water is among the best of Charity and the best of Charity is given to your relatives because then you would gain two rewards a reward for the charity over the poor and a reward for connecting to the next of kin even a good word is a charity even your smile in the face of your brother is a charity any good or righteous deed you do is considered to be a charity but Allah says that you will not attain Al until you spend of what you love so we have to give out from our wealth and I'm not talking about zakat this is an obligation I'm talking about what is voluntary you have to show Allah Asel your gratitude through through your expenditure and your spending in the means that pleases Allah AMU alaykum [Music] [Music]"
