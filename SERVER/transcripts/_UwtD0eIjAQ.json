  "title": "Which Islamic banks are truly Islamic? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the next question is from sister amina uh as a layman i do not know which islamic banks are truly islamic if it's a well-known islamic bank can we take its profit wow this is a complicated issue because there is a famous video clip of mine which talks about islamic banks are they real or just a tag name and in a nutshell if a bank comes to me and says i'm an islamic bank i don't have the knowledge to go into the processes and to see how they act and deal on day-to-day basis so the only way to do uh to verify this is to ask the people in the country the the scholars of the country and to check their sharia board islamic banks are divided into two types one that has a real sharia board that governs every single transaction that has spot checks throughout the year every few weeks they go and spot check a branch and look into their transactions why did you do this didn't we say that this is haram you should not sell except what you possess etc other islamic banks have a sharia board but they are in a way an honorary sharia board meaning that they just convene or meet once every uh few months like six months or four months a year and they show them few projects and they look into it and they say yes or no but whether these projects are implemented as per the advice of the sri aboard or not this is not their business so there's no audit that looks into them to make sure whether it's being islamically true or not and the vast majority of islamic banks are like the latter so the sharia board like myself i just sign and i go whether my fatwa is being implemented or not i don't care i'm being paid at the end of the month or the year and who makes sure that this is implemented or not on day-to-day basis nobody such banks are dubious you should not be with and allah knows best"
