  "transcript": "muhammad from india he says one mawlana says that it is prohibited to recite the quran behind the imam and this is a long issue of dispute among scholars and we've stated that the vast majority of scholars say except the hanafi of course it is mandatory it's a pillar to recite the fatiha in silent raqqa's unfortunately the hanafi maslak they don't recite so the guys are just standing there looking at the chandeliers because their imam is reciting the fat in asar for example they don't recite why are you reciting said we have this hadith if the imam recite you listen okay how do you know he's reciting are you listening this is in loud rakhas any arab would know this so in our school of thought it says we don't read to your school's of thought is wrong go back to the quran and the sunnah the sunnah says that there is no prayer varied to whomever does not recite the fatiha yeah but the imam's the hadith says when the imam recites you should listen true but in silence he does not recite for you to listen you don't know if he's reciting or not so it's a must upon you to recite the fatih in silent raqqa now in loud rakhas yes i agree don't recite because it's sufficient and this is the madhhab of imam malik and a lot of great scholars who say that it's sufficient when the imam recites a fact loudly that we are exempted from reciting it we listen and this is the opinion that combines all different hadiths together you"
