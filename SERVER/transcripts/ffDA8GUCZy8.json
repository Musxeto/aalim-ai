  "transcript": "from saudi arabia he says whenever i'm tired i sometimes lie down and remember allah be make thicker make him make takbir but i don't move my lips so some people say that this is not valid what's the truth behind that well as if by this is true in order for us to get the reward of making zikr we have to move our tongues so we have to have an action you just can't keep your lips sealed and make thicker subhanallah you have to actually move it even if you don't whisper the sound even if you don't hear what you are saying you're just saying don't check your volume i'm just pretending to say it but i'm doing it with my uh tongue and lips so all of this is done because your quran would not be valid unless you do this your wiki would not be valid your dua would not be heard"
