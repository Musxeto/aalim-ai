  "title": "An imam in not allowing muslims to enter the masjid",
  "transcript": "is telling me that when he went back home to India the inam said anyone who's not following one of the four schools of thought that is the school of Abu hanifa the school of Malika bin anas the school of Muhammad or the school of uh may Allah have mercy on them all if you're not a follower of these four or one of them you're not allowed in the Masjid and this is uh acceptable if the messaging was this imam's house he has all the right to prevent people from interim if he owns the Masjid it is okay but if it's Allah's Masjid he has no right to prevent any Muslim from entering the Masjid unless he is saying that the follower of of these four School thought is a kaffir and if he says this then this Imam should not be an Imam because these four schools of thought with all due respect they are not revealed from Allah azzawajal they're not mentioned in the Quran nor in the Sunnah and they came after the death of the Prophet Allah and the passing of the companions may Allah be pleased with them there were other schools of thought that were better than them but because these great imams like ausary like sufian like the other great Lathan Saad and you go on and on in mentioning great Scholars who taught the imams of these four schools of thought these great Scholars did not have schools of thought and the reason was because they did not have students to carry their message to carry their IDs and their opinions like the four imams had therefore this is a misconception this is completely and totally unaccepted on the day of judgment Allah azzawajal will not ask you which school of thought you were following would ask you why didn't you follow the Quran and Sunnah that does not mean that the four schools of thought are not following the Quran of Sunnah but they are humans they make mistakes and that is why Allah is referring us every single time to go back to the Quran and Sunnah whenever there's a dispute so if Imam Ahmad says something says otherwise what to do both of them are great imams we have to go back to the Quran so what your Imam had said is completely wrong and it is unacceptable"
