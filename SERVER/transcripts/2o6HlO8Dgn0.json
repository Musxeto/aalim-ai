  "transcript": "baba has a second question and he says that once an obligatory congregational prayer has been completed in the Masjid candle candle late comers make and form another congregation for that prayer or do they have to find someone doing the optional to lead them yeah any are they required to find someone who had already prayed his fault and lead them in prayer or they can form another congregation the majority of scholars say that they can form another congregation without needing anyone who had prayed already and this is not recommended for them to form a secondary congregation but it is permissible because you know that the greatest reward is by attending the first congregation and the hadith where the Prophet Allah saw Sam saw someone coming late after Fajr prayer and he said to the congregation who prayed with him who would go and give charity to that man meaning praying with him and also the hadith of my Adam Jarrell may Allah be pleased with him when he used to pray Risha with the Prophet as serve and then go to his people and lead them in racea prayer for them to him it's only voluntary prayer these two hadith do not indicate that it is a must that the one who leads the second congregation to be a person who had already prayed the first congregation they are just separate incidents and there is no emphasis on that"
