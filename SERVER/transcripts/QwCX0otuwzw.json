  "title": "Should a pilgrim offer Hadiy as well as Udhiya on behalf of his family members back home? - Assim",
  "transcript": "what seem says I live in Riyadh and I'll do Hajj this year insha'Allah my whole family is in India so do I need to do animal sacrifice in my home at India on behalf of my family members or the sacrifice which is done in Hajj is sufficient the sacrifice or better known as Urbani in or do in the subcontinent what you slaughter is divided into a number of things so what I slaughter if I don't go for Hajj is called over here what the pilgrim slaughters when he goes to Hajj if he is performing to matter or Kalyan is called Hadi and if a pilgrim makes a mistake then he has to compensate for this mistake by slaughtering what is called Cydia and of course we know the ruling of our Tilka and other types of offering and sacrifice to allah azzawajal but our brother was what seems question is clear he's going for Hajj so is he obliged to offer sacrifice as adhere for his family in back home the answer is it's an issue of dispute first of all what here is highly recommended Sunnah so the majority of scholars do not consider to be mandatory but rather a highly recommended soon some of them say if you can afford it financially then it becomes an obligation as per the most authentic opinion regarding a pilgrim Shaykh resentment amia nope I am sure been anything me may Allah have mercy on them all say that this is not mandatory not recommended for a pilgrim to offer out here because as per the Hanafi school of thought he's a traveler so a traveler does not offer up here does not offer qurbani because it's only for those whose who are residing as per the Maliki school of thought they say he's a pilgrim and everyone else should offer out here except the pilgrim as per the Shafi school of thought it is highly recommended whether you're a pilgrim or resident but the most authentic opinion as mentioned earlier that it is not recommended nor obligatory norson for a pilgrim to offer out here if he's in hatch he can offer heidi but if he is wealthy there is no problem at all for him to send money or to keep money with his family back home so that when it is read they slaughter out here on their behalf not on his behalf and they eat from it and allah azzawajal knows best"
