  "transcript": "the second question is is it f for me to look after his parents so is it mandatory for a woman to take care of his of her husband's parents and her in-laws and the answer is no this is not mandatory this is not something obligatory it is not F it's not your duty your duty is to take care of your husband and his children other than that it is not mandatory at all and I know that a lot of the families are based as a fact that their daughter-in-law is the servant of the house a lot of the mothers-in-law take it for granted saying that my daughter-in-law my son's wife she's obliged to cook for me to clean my clothes to take my orders not only that a lot of the father and mothers-in-law control their daughter-in-law so they tell her what to do who to see and who not to see when to go out and who not to allow in her house and this is not to them she's not your slave she is your daughter-in law and this is not the Arabic word of it but this is what they say in English she she is your daughter-in-law but you have no control none whatsoever over her your control is on your son and your son can control his wife but you do not have any control over your daughter-in-law she is not obliged to serve you to cook for you to clean the house for you this is not and she is entitled for her own house you don't have the right to force your wife to live with you and with your parents or with your siblings as a lot of the Muslims do this is not right she's a stranger to your siblings so she is entitled to have her own Chambers she's entitled to wear whatever she wants in her own house not to restrict her to wearing hijab and fully covering in front of your brothers and it is even worse if she doesn't cover in front of your brothers these are not Islamic houses so no you're not obliged to serve his parents but it is highly recommended again don't look at your rights but also take a look at your obligations it is highly recommended for you to please your husband through serving his parents though it's not mandatory but it is very advisable because it is the way to your husband's heart and it would be logical for you to do something that would please him rather than insisting on not doing anything except what is obliged upon you because then he would come and say okay I will only do what is obliged on me as well and I would preent uh uh uh prevent you from doing this and that and this is not the way that marriage a successful marriage takes place I believe"
