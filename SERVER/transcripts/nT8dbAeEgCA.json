  "title": "Reciting Surah Yasin over someone who is on his death bed - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm at Hussein he says is there any authentic hadith regarding reciting Surat Yasin over someone who is in his on his deathbed and is approaching his end if not then what is prescribed in the sunnah surat yaseen the vast majority of scholars since decades and centuries ago say that it is a prescribed and recommended Sunnah but when we listen to other scholars who beg to differ we find that they say that this is not a Sunnah so there is a dispute some session as some say it's not sure what to do Allah sol-gel gave us the answer in the Quran he said whenever there is a dispute among you referred back to the Quran to the Sunnah so we go back and check the Quran there is nothing the surah is there but there's nothing recommending or discouraging us from reading it we go to the Sunnah and all the Hadees that are listed favoring reciting it upon the dead or when people are in there dying beds all the hadith are weak and not authentic so now what to do follow the great scholars blindly though we know that the foundation they built their opinion upon is weak is not authentic or should we refrain of course the way we should act upon is to follow the Quran and the Sunnah by the understanding of the righteous predecessors of the three favorite generations and this means that we do not recite the surah upon them and if we were to recite it Danny just to act upon what the scholar said it should be done when the person is dying when his soul is exiting and departing his body then it is okay according to the majority to recite it because during or in the surah itself there is mentioning of that righteous pious person who on his dying bed said I wish saying to the Angels I wish that my people know what Allah has prepared for me and and this gives hope to the dying person to be like him what to do from the Sunnah the Sunnah is that when you are at the bed of a dying person to do Rokia to give him dura and to make sure that the last thing he says is the testimony of truth so the Prophet says as some whoever concludes his life and the last thing he said was la ilaha illa Allah there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah or ash-hadu an LA illaha IL allah i bear witness and testify that there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah if this was the last thing he utters then he will be sent to Jenna to paradise with the grace of Allah having said that you do not repeat until you bore him to death no you simply say say la ilaha illallah he says la ilaha illallah if he remains silent for five hours this is sufficient even if he dies no problem because that was the last thing he said but if he speaks and says after couple hours I'm thirsty give me some water you give him the water and you say say la ilaha illallah so that the last thing he says before saying anything else would be la ilaha illallah"
