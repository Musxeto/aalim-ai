  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah r-rahman r-rahim wa salat wa salam ala rasulillah hand cream alhamdulillah and welcome back for another episode of life's adornments and this episode of Charlotte eyelid will be discussing custody rights as we know children are a great and manner from Allah soprano Tejada there are a great trust in this trust needs to be preserved and the best way by doing so is to act upon this endeavor by way of understanding the Quran and the Sunnah so we know that it happens in life is something normal parents people come together they get marry and for whatever reasons people separate in the event of separation what are the ways we should go about achieving a way of justice achieving a way of peace in this matter about where your father in the Quran is so now who gets custody of the children how do we go about negotiating these terms of charlatans Allah we would like to introduce our guests will shake awesome Luqman Hakeem he is a teacher and that Academy and a teacher and KIU and has been any mam and a teacher for over 30 years in Charlotte sada Saddam are they comin to love the cat ye come salawatullahi vallah catcher so let's get right into this hot topic and Shana share about the custody rights what do we mean in about custody when we talk about Islam she remember him hungry Lila he also lot was said o my lord surely learn he was early he also be a man I tell ya I'm not bad I stated before Islam governs our lives it's not rituals that we bow and prostrate in that that is it it's a way of life so it's a system it is not only related to us worshiping allah azzawajal in certain or with certain rituals and it's not only limited to the masjid to the mosque or to the month of ramadan it governs every aspect of our lives financial political economic social spiritual physical and part of governing our lives that it takes care of a very important segment or a very important level of the community community so this segment of the community is children usually in a family that is or was infested with lots of hatred and meaty dispute the victims are usually the children so Islam stands in the side of the weak and vulnerable an Islam protects them from anything that is ever-changing I get a lot of questions and complaints from women who are now a single mom while the father who divorced her or separated from her does not pay a penny for his children thinking that because she's divorced or separated it's not his obligation anymore and this is a grave sin no matter what happens he's obliged to support and provide so when we talk about custody this usually is referring to when the couple separated before the custody before their separation there's guardianship so the guardianship means that the father of the children is the one authorized to approve for example his girls his daughters whether to marry or not to marry he has the veto so no marriage can take place without the Guardians approval the Prophet said Allison Lonnie caja in Lobby wali washa he dayit there is no marriage quote/unquote valid without the consent of the guardian and he said any woman who gets married without the consent of her guardian her marriage is void her marry his void her marriage is void so this is one part or one aspect of his guardianship the second aspect which is providing so it is his obligation in Islam to provide for his children from birth until they're self-sufficient so even if the child is 22 years of age goes to uni but he doesn't have any income a father has no right in saying well you're old enough you have to go and work no he's still obliged to provide for his son to finish and to start his life standing hit the ground running rather than leave him Midway but what happens if the father is stone broke and he doesn't have any money in this case Aslam says well you are exempted and then it becomes the responsibility of the child himself if the child possesses money whether through gifts or inheritance or any other source the obligation upon the father ceases and stops so if a child works and earns I don't have to pay for him if the child is rich through inheritance I don't have to pay and provide for him if the child himself does not have money the father does not have money it becomes the obligation of the mother now it's mandatory upon the mom if she's wealthy to provide for her child but she has the option whether to provide for the child while holding the husband accountable so that when he is rich again after five or ten years she can ask for the money back or out of her own goodwill she waivers that right and she spends on her children for the sake of Allah then this is a gift from her side and in terms of custody rights an event that there's a split that happens most upon the time that preserve our marriages and our families and what happens in this case who gets the child how do we go about navigating that so this is an issue of dispute in schools of thought and the reason is that there are a number of different hadith and each hadith is designated and designed for that specific incident okay so this is an issue of confusion to some Muslims so when the one of the Companions comes to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and says what is the best deeds at the sight of Allah and the Prophet says to pray on time in another narration or Prophet Allah advised me he does not say pray on time said do not become angry a third one says advised me he said weep over your sins and remain in your home and do this and do that so why are these answers different scholars say because the Prophet is giving an answer to each individual so yes praying on time because you most likely delay prayer on and for you not to get angry because you have rage issues and for you to be dutiful to your parents because they're complaining of you and so on likewise when it comes to custody the separation took place there is a hadith that is well known where the prophet alayhi salatu salam said a woman who was divorced had a child and her ex wanted to take the child away from her the Prophet said that is awesome auntie a Huckabee he madam tonka hey you are more worthy and deserving of the custody of the child as long as you unmarried which means that if she were to get married in this case the custody must be taken away from her because now she is with a strange man and her ex the father of a child would not allow his son or his daughter to be brought up in the house of another man that he does not know of so it's his right and the custody is moved whether to her mother which is the maternal grandma or to the paternal grandma it's an issue of dispute again okay and oftentimes in divorces they end because sometimes a person isn't suitable whether it's the father or mother and because of the issue there at least a divorce so what constitutes a person as qualified to have custody are they certain conditions that need to be met for a person to be able to then parent their child within these rights see again this is an issue of debate the main principle is the mother by default is the one who's entitled to have the rights of custody of her children however scholars say that if the mother is a non-muslim she does not have the right to have custody because the most important thing in Islam is the Islamic upbringing and if I entrust a mother with my child and she is a Jew or a Christian I cannot trust her upbringing my children to be like her so this is one of the disadvantages of marrying from a different religion because the essence and the most important thing in marriage is to have a good Islamic family a Muslim family and to bring up your children as Muslims this here defies the purpose of bringing up Muslim children when they are taking care of by their non-muslim mother so scholars say that she's deprived from custody she is still their mother she can see them she can mix with them but she must not have custody likewise if the mother was an irresponsible woman so if she puts her children in the car in the middle of the summer and goes shopping she's not taking care of them she's probably gonna harm them or kill them if she is an alcoholic if she is having extramarital relationships like many single women who do not have really a good relationship with Islam so she flirts she goes out she dates I can't allow children to grow up in such an environment so this is not your word against mine this is something that the Muslim judge is obliged to look into and he's obliged to give a verdict that is within the benefit or for the benefit of the child and this is his priority and prerogative not to care about what you say what she says it what what is the most beneficial for the child this is what the judge chooses and selects and this is why so many times we have disputes so the child is 10 years of age who should take the custody the mother or the father some schools of thoughts say if the boy is 7 years of age then the father should take him some say 10 years of age some say no we should ask the boy to choose because there are hadith where the Prophet as Salam asked the boy to choose which one you want to go to your mom or your father and whatever he chooses then this is in his benefit if they are both good righteous practicing apparent but if one of them is not a Muslim then by default he goes to the Muslim and the judge looks into what is most beneficial custody does not mean to travel out of the country so if a couple are married in a city and then they get divorced and the mother wants to go to relocate he has the option to veto that and says no this is where the child was born and raised and this is where we live she has no right to take the children to another country and leave me stranded can't see them in holidays on weekends and nothing I don't know what's happening to them this is his right to do that and logic we're gonna pause for a short break and we will continue with the topic of child custody and guardianship Michelle Matata viewers stay tuned we'll be right back until you come back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we were last discussing the rights of children will discussing guardianship and we have awesome who last indicated that the purpose of raising a child is to have a child raised in a righteous way so this begs the question and then who is permitted then to read the child he mentioned the example of one individual which is a Muslim and in the Sharia married to a person either from amongst the Christians or the Jews and they separate he said that it isn't permissible for them to be left with their mother because the intention is for them to be raised in a Muslim household this begs the question then what constitutes as I had the key tab as the people of the book is what we have in the West a constitution of I had a key tab and is it then recommendable for a Muslim man to marry outside of his faith well again this is problematic lots of the Muslims or there is considerable amount of Muslims who tend to give takfeer to one another yes and these are known as a how a rich and these people are obsessed of whatever you do does it take you out of the fold of Islam or not so they neglect everything and they just want to classify to label you this unfortunately now is being cascaded to even non-muslims so they come to the Christians and they said okay at the time of the Prophet Alakazam there were Christians and Jews they're described in the Quran to be the people of the book meaning the torah and the injeel so are these Christians and Jews nowadays identical to the Christian Jews at the time of the Prophet that is a ceramic insinuating hinting to that today's Christians are not Christians they don't go to church they don't practice Christianity they only our Christians my name so what they're doing is actually giving them takfeer of their own religion so not only Muslims between themselves no they go even an extra mile and taking them out of the fold of Islam what does that imply we can't take or eat their slaughtering we cannot marry their women and this is problematic because nowhere in Sharia it tells us to give a placement test to any Christian that you are interested in marrying just to ensure that she is a practicing Christian or at least knows her religion so we're not talking about agnostics or atheists or people with no religion we're talking about someone if you ask him what's your religion there's a Christianity but I'm not practicing well uh if you look at the Muslim world you'll find that maybe 70% of them are not practicing Muslims so would we give them takfeer as well or would we take it for his face value and say they are Muslims until proven otherwise those living in the West Christians until proven otherwise so if I go to a person from Sweden or Finland and they have the flag with the cross so if I ask him are you a Christian he says no I'm an atheist this is a is not from among the people of the book because he confesses that he is not a Christian but the vast majority of people would say yeah we're Christians but we never go to church we never read our prayers or say our grace or whatever in this case they are treated as Christians and as the people of the book and as this with condition what are the conditions for a person okay that we acknowledge that there are collisions in they are Jews are they can are there other further conditions that would then allow a person to marry them as well or is it just open no it should they should be chaste women should be chaste so in the sense that if she's a Christian in you're interested in marrying her we are instructed to say whether she's chaste or not so his chastity is very important if she's known to have different boyfriends partying going out having premarital relationships this is totally prohibited to marry her if she is someone who's decent and there are so many Christians who are decent they don't all fornicate and play around there are families that have decent girls and decent women and people who abide by their books and their beliefs and would not have any premarital relationships so such conditions do would be fulfilled in such a woman and it becomes permissible for a Muslim man to marry nevertheless is it recommended answer's no because we've seen in so many cases of dispute in many cases of change of mind that she files for divorce and usually she gets that easy because she's married to a Muslim or a non citizen and she would take the children with her and the children would be raised up to be Christians as well and this is something that is not at all tolerated or accept in Islam okay and another thing that happens as well is foster care many times of both parents are unsuitable for whatever reason the child would then go into a Christian foster care or and sometimes they even indoctrinated with the religion what they have to exchange their food in their water for their religion we see this happen a lot or even if a mother and child goes into a foster home where they take care of mother and child they have to negotiate certain parts of their religion or how do we manage these sort of things well this is very unfortunate and the most unfortunate part of it is that you can't do anything see this is one of the greatest shortcomings of living in a non-muslim country if you go to non-muslim countries they do not understand your religion they do not understand your culture and they would like all people to melt down in their melting pot so that they leave all their beliefs and traditions out of their country and become like them and this is totally unacceptable is Lama one of the strong points of Islam is an identity that every Muslim is proud of so if you see me in the United States of America or in Russia or in South America or in Asia you will find me the same person maybe I'll change my clothes but it's the same culture the same behavior the same educates the same moral conduct that never changes these countries don't want this and this is why a lot of the locals fight immigration laws they don't want the Muslims to come because they noticed that the Muslims are not willing to compromise the religion for a salary or for some benefits or for a passport and this is what scares them most now it is unfortunate when we find Muslims living in the West whether to pursue a career or to achieve a degree nevertheless a lot of them migrate they settle down and they take this as their home only to be shocked later on and to expose to themselves and to the world how hypocrisy is being done big time so in Islam this is basic knowledge it's part of a religion no Muslim would defy this or say that this is not true the Prophet said that is instruct your children to pray when they're seven and beat them up or spanked them when they're 10 if the you refuse to pray if I do this in the West in non-muslim countries they would take my child away from me why are you doing this they say this is child abuse this is part of who I am this is part of my religion too well this is wrong now you're saying I am wrong or Islam is wrong the enmity is not to me personally the enmity is to Islam as a religion and you can go on and on and on in so many things that as Muslims we cannot accept to be treated in this ill way for example in the Scandinavian countries it is mandatory from an early age even intermediate even high school that there is a physical education classes men and women boys and girls it's a mixed school so if I say that my daughter is not going to participate in a swimming class why Lord she has to what do you mean by law I don't want her to study we will force you and we will take her from you this is slavery you're not giving me the freedom of expression the freedom of religion you're not giving me any kind of freedom you want me to be a slave for the system this is against my religion so this tough luck it is tough luck because this is your problem going to such countries remain in a country that gives you the dignity to practice your own religion without harming anyone I don't want my son to swim with another girl with all these hormones in him and tell him not to do any sin this is not natural and this is why we have so many unnatural things in these countries we have a high rate of suicide we have a high rate of abortion without marriage of course and don't even mention intoxicants and drugs and depression and all these psychiatric illnesses that's governing and and controlling these countries hamdulillah for the Grace and blessing of Islam so this is something that the Muslims should be aware of you don't want your child to be taken away from you and given to a Christian family or an agnostic family just because they claim the social welfare that they're taking care of your kid they're not taking care of your kid okay yeah so this is very central information because many times this is what happened so if I'm understanding you correctly and it's not only focused on the parent that the child has but also the environment that the child is put in both locally is in the community level and as a nation wise and and how that may affect their growing up their upbringing in the future true yeah excellent well Charlotte Rhonda this is our time for today this is a very dense topic very our crucial information it needs to be covered thank you for your immense knowledge and wisdom I mean yyk for our viewership we hope that you'd benefitted greatly from this program we thank you for your constant
