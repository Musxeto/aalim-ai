  "title": "Must I stay in same position after concluding prayer to get the reward or can I move assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shake um we know that we are rewarded for remaining in the prayer as long as we do our atar sitting in the place we offered Salah so my question is do we have to remain in the same position we finished our prayer in for example if I finish four Ras of D and I'm sitting in the position of T ruk do I have to do my atar remaining in the position of T ruk the most authentic opinion that I believe in is that you don't have to remain in the same sitting position you can sit in any different way you wish other Scholars even say that as long as you are in the vicinity of the Masjid even if you go from the first row and sit at the uh back of the Masjid on a chair then you still are in Salat and Allah Knows Best"
