  "title": "Does licking lipstick invalidates fast and looking at women?",
  "transcript": "he noticed that the TV presenters the female TV presenters on TV where tons of makeup and they beautify themselves and they seem to lick the lipstick on their lips first of all Mohammed you're not allowed to watch these hey what are you doing you're fasting you're young yes but you have to train yourself to lower your gaze you cannot look at women and to the smallest details as such nevertheless you should be careful to answer the question is if someone licks his or her lip and there is a mass that is swallowed so if the lipstick has a mass and someone swallows this this breaks is fast because he swallowed something which he's not supposed to do while fasting and I doubt if they would be fasting to begin with looking what they're looking and coming exposing their charm and and beauty and mixing with men during the daytime of Ramadan and saying false things most likely and lying all right I have my doubts but let's presume and think positive that their fasting may Allah guide them and get them back to the loop of Islam to be practicing Muslims"
