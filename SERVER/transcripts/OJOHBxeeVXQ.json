  "title": "Muslims who were killed in Terror Attack in New Zealand Martyrs?Our response to such Terrorism Assim",
  "transcript": "uh hamad says can we call innocent people who have been killed by the terror attack or stabbed or bombed as martyrs example people who were shot dead today in the mosque and that is referring to christ church in new zealand so first of all this was a tragedy this was a heinous crime and this was the result of hate speech that whites supremacists and the politicians of so many kafir countries have been repeatedly stereotyping and brainwashing their people through the media by accusing islam of being a terrorist religion this is the result helpless people defenseless people unarmed people who go like clockwork every single week on the same time to the message to offer their friday prayers a guy goes in opens fire discriminately killing children women men whoever is standing in his face and the justification it is written on his magazines his uh machine gun magazines it's written all over the place in his facebook in his uh uh declarations it's something to do with hatred of a christian towards islam but as muslims our hands are tied we cannot play their game and accuse christianity why because allah tells us in two places in the quran in chapter 5 to be fair and not let our hatred or grudges against people to transgress we cannot it is easy for me to put hate speech now and start saying that this is a new crusade this is christianity all catholic protestants are this and but this is not true they're not all like this and i'm not defending them i am stating what my religion tells me to state the closest to the muslims are those who say we are christians as allah mentions in the quran and the worst and most people with enmity and hatred against the muslims are the idol worshipers whether they're hindus or sikh or or buddhist and the jews as stated in the quran they hate us so we cannot brush them all or paint them all with the same brush and say one individual did this heinous crime all christians are alike no this is unfair this is haram but they do the same to us sheikh when a muslim comes and says allahu akbar and he blows himself up or he kills innocent people they immediately accuse accuse the muslims they accuse their sharia they accuse their religion their quran they talk ill about our prophet well sorry but two wrongs don't make a right when they make wrong statements against us this does not give us the justification to make the same against them this is the greatest difference that we are muslims we always come on top sheriff this is racist no this is not racist this is reality our religion is the best religion you like it you hate it tough bananas this is up to you we are proud of our religion because anyone who's objective who's fair would say this is the time for you to retaliate and to condemn the western world and the christian world and the crusades and this and that no it's not we're muslims we have to be fair even if we're fair against our parents as allah mentions in the quran you must be fair even if against your parents you have to be fair so at the end of the day it's a heinous crime but when we look at facts why did these people go to the masjid in the first place ask an individual before going to a friday prayer why are you going to a friday prayer he would say because allah ordered me to do so then he would say because this is my pathway to paradise this is the way i reach paradise by going to the masjid offering my prayers and i die doing this i end up in jannah so this is what they wanted this was their objective and this killer made them reach their objective a bit quicker so for them we're not sad we are happy because alhamdulillah we consider them to be winners through their martyrdom and this answers your question hamid can we call them as martyrs and the answer it's an issue of dispute as for the hereafter there is no dispute in sha allah they are marchers whoever is assassinated whoever is killed unjustly through bombing through assassination being stabbed from the back like in the masjid being killed without being able to defend themselves they are martyrs in sha allah in the hereafter but in this dunya we treat them like everyone else what do you mean sheikh we mean that they are washed shrouded preyed upon and buried while the people who die as martyrs they do not have this they are buried with their own clothes and own their own blood etc what is the evidence sheikh the evidence is that in the authentic hadith the prophet alaihi salazar was once with abu bakr umar and uthman and they were walking over mount ushud and mount uh started to tremble so the prophet islam struck the mountain with his foot saying stay still because on top of you there is a prophet and a and we know that omar and earth men were assassinated they did not die on the battlefield which clearly indicates that people who are assassinated or who are killed and being transgressed upon they are considered to be martyrs and we hope and wish for them insha allah to be real martyrs but having said that now the issue is these 50 people who had died on a friday it's a beautiful death to for a muslim to die on a friday he would be exempted from torment of the grave and it's a sign of a good ending we all hope for this death on a friday it's a good death insha allah but it is not the end of the world how many on daily basis die in syria in libya in afghanistan in iraq in burma in the among the hinges being raped being killed being tortured being kicked out nowhere starved to death how many muslims among the yogurts in china are being detained unlawfully putting put in concentrating uh concentration camps by the hundreds of thousands and some say a million prisoners just because they say and they believe in allah so 50 is a big number and we are saddened for what had happened yet we are happy that inshallah their martyrs but this should not makes make us neglect the plight that our brothers worldwide are suffering just because they are muslims and this makes us an obligation this makes an obligation upon us to utilize this incident and show the people that islam is not a religion of terror 1.7 billion if our religion dictated that we terrorize people and to kill them and to do heinous acts wallahi no human being would be living on earth now because we are devoted muslims we are committed muslims if our religion tells us to kill you we will kill you but it doesn't if our religion allows us to lie we will lie and say that christianity is the cause but the root cause of all of this but islam doesn't so this is why we have to abide by a religion stick to it and walk the talk and allah's religion would prevail without any doubt"
