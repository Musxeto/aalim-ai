  "title": "Marriage without the consent of the woman's wali - Hanafi Madhab - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "soon from India so not a lot I have two very important core something we say I need your guidance my first question isn't like in subcontinent countries in fourth where they follow Hana thesis Danny cause without belief valid its course a district so my question is did any boy gold also hadith anomalous and prohibited the validity of nakama doubtfully so in that field if a boy or a girl school in Sharia Court in case their parents and every relationship who can be very are disagree for them marriage than any mama just become body often so in that case because it'd be valid in index could build the relationship d haha no forget what about the authentic are these eternal our it's an undeclared time validity of because without relief okay my second question is will like for advice there are many many wise who need advice on negligent husband won't feel that what fulfilling their responsibilities as a husband all of these provide financial support and all but she understand it comes to supporting the physical and emotional needs of their life reason could be any I hope in China you will understand what kind of reasons for me so what should avoid mean for the scenario we had sent a team to cater his wife's physical me for over a year or more than that will white be held accountable if three signs of a keep ourselves away from China that's what my question was okay I will answer no shama would you suck my ass from Saudi law alaikum Jeff is the name right or aleyk√ºm selam yeah yes yes ma'am yes ma'am with an end yeah yeah okay Naas yes knew how finally about a collision yeah so call me I would like to wish all my Muslim brothers and sisters in the whole world the new Islamic New Year and II went to you jalaja inshallah will be traveling to Amara small daughter here eleven months so we make her near for her on behalf of her and take her former and what is the reward for that he read who are is it necessary or is not necessary we just take her to Cumbre okay any more questions alifair and I know English I just wanted your number okay the brothers in the control inshallah will provide you with my number my mobile number now inshallah barik alaa fee consume from India had two questions first of all according to the hanafi madhhab it is which is prevailing in the subcontinent it is permissible for a woman to get married without the approval and consent of her guardian and usually the guardian is the father so she is saying what is the nature of such a marriage first of all the vast majority of scholars say that it is not permissible to have a niihka in the beginning I thought she was referring to any table it is not permissible to have any cash which means marriage without the consent and approval and the proposal of the guardian so it is the responsibility of the Guardian to say to the one proposing I give you my daughter in marriage this is called proposing this is called a jabber and one proposing he is the one who gives his consent by saying I accept her marriage now the marriage is done if there are two male Muslim witnesses and the consent of both the boy and the girl is present in the Hanafi firk it is not required okay can you give me concrete evidence because I have the Prophet saying a little ofsome in an authentic hadith lani kaha allah by allah o shahe yet there is no marriage quote-unquote valid without the presence of a guardian and two male witnesses trustworthy so I have this command from the prophet alayhi salatu salam telling me that the marriage is invalid so you mean the hanafi madhhab can you give me something from the quran or from the sunnah that proves that this is okay allah azza wajal stated in so many places in the quran that the men are the ones who get the women married to others well at Uncle mushrikeen hat tell me know in the women part well at ng whole market had 2 min wear a chunky ho well at ng ho what's the difference well I think e ho mushrik at it's addressed to males do not marry so I'm the one who's getting married in terms of women do not get the women under you married to disbelievers meaning that the marriage cannot happen without the Guardians approval hence when we ask them they say isn't a woman allowed to buy and sell were with her wealth she can sell her house she can buy a farm with her money that's yes definitely they say in this case isn't her body more worthy of her own control and own permission rather than the permission of her guardian and we say subhanAllah how can you say such a thing in contrast to or in conflict to the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam you yours using your logic with the evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah this is unacceptable it's like someone saying okay if I pass wind does my word will break and I say this is a consensus of scholars he says why it is only gas coming from my stomach so if I burp would I also break my water I said no said what's the difference Anala well what logic are these people using so this is the benefit of always abiding by the Quran and the Sunnah and giving them presidents giving them priority giving them the lead in our lives to decide for us rather than using our logic or listening to Tom Dick and Harry and therefore such a marriage is not valid but and you underline the but with two red lines if you wish the issue is that if the people of the subcontinent are laymen and are ignorant of the Quran and of the Sunnah like the vast majority of Muslims worldwide they don't have the knowledge or what they know is that this scholar of mine he knows best the Imam of my Maslach is the best and I don't know a word of Arabic so they fully give their harness or give their rope to be led by their Imams and by the judges and by their scholars in this case such individuals if their scholars said to them that your marriage is valid we say that your marriage is valid not according to the Quran Sunnah but according to your ability of understanding according to the scholars who told you that this is permissible and you have your full trust in them and Allah knows best"
