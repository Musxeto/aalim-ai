  "transcript": "she says I made a vow to read a particular portion of the Quran every day and one day I forgot what is it for me to do I believe that this falls under the last verse of Surat al-baqarah chapter 2 where Allah says Muslim but fault oh Allah don't hold us accountable if we were to make an error or to make a mistake or to forget and Allah said I shall so if a person vowed to do something or not to do something and by forgetfulness did or did not do it then there is no expiation in sha Allah upon that individual"
