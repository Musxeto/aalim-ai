  "transcript": "me that and she's always nagging she doesn't make me sleep if I want to go to sleep she turns on the lights and she says I haven't finished talking to you and she turns off the air conditioning and she W for 2 and a half minutes almost I was just bombarding her with this after I finished she said yes this is what he says so I said alhamdulillah now I've got it made I know that this happens Khadijah was never like that ever what whatever the prophet wanted he got it made so not only that she did not make him work in the house when he came to the house he was like a king she did all the shores of the house and she did never ask him to do this or to stitch his clothes or to clean the dishes or to uh uh take the garbage out she never did that on the contrary in medinaa tells us may Allah be pleased with her when the prophet used to enter his house he used to serve his wives so he used to stitch his own th he used to fix his own sandals he used to milk his own goat which means that AA who is a righteous and Good Wife she is nothing compared to Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her nothing so this is the reward of a woman who sits home and doesn't go out and brings up the children in the way that Allah loves and look what happened to one of her children who is what Fatima both of them are the head or on the top of the list in Paradise why because of how she was brought up by her mother a woman how much time do you have 15 15 minutes yeah enough inshallah now the there are things that every woman has to know at the back of her mind and these are Essentials and that is a man like me is in ordered to do so many things we're ordered to provide for our wives so even if my wife is a multi-millionaire and she has millions in her bank account she is obliged to spend nothing on herself or her children I have to be the bread earner I have to give her money for their clothes and for the house and support everything she's not in obliged to do anything I supposed to go down the market and if I see something wrong I have to enforce virtue and forbid Vice I have to attend the prayer five times a day in the Masjid I have to go and work and to teach people in the Masjid and to uh uh do Jihad if I'm required to defend my country I have to do so many things I have to be obedient to my father and to my mother do I have a wife and a family but still they have priority over me as well so many things for me to do and maybe and maybe not I will enter Jenna because the Temptation is so great wherever I go it's Temptation everywhere while my wife Allah orders her to do four things and she will enter Jenna is this fair if a woman prays her prayer fasts Ramadan preserves her Chastity and obeys her husband she will enter Allah's Paradise the prophet says four things now us men think oh this is easy they've got it made no it's not easy praying yeah half of the month they're off fasting it's one with the same thing preserving their Chastity women by Nature are shy and and they don't play around like men do the fourth thing is the most ex difficult which is obeying their husband this is the most difficult task ever because now with the media men and women they think of each other well me women think they're equal to men so she thinks that this man why should I obey him look at him he never calms his beard he's smelly he doesn't shower his mouth is and his belly is half a meter in front of his uh body he hasn't seen his toes in ages he doesn't look how they look like and whenever he comes out of the of the bathroom he flexes his muscles as if he Arnold Schwarzenegger he doesn't know that he's a big fat bunch of of fat and I have to obey him is this fair this is your test it is fair Allah does not rule anything except fairness so Allah is testing you and if you obey him you will enter Jenna she but he is not romantic he never gave me a candlelight dinner he never said to me I love you too he never kisses me when he comes home or goes out of the house if I call him while he's in the office he hangs up in my face if I send him a long Poetic romantic poem and say that how I love you and he sends me back what nonsense is this what what do you want me to do this is Men by the way this is how Allah created us without any feelings without any remorse with hearts as hard as Stone but this is a test to you as women are test to men if you do these four things you guaranteed Jenna and I know that a lot of the times the media comes and say why stay home when we ask women not to work and to stay home as if we are asking one of our lungs to stop working and this is wrong the place the original place by default for a woman is in her home to take care of her son daughter and of her husband in theah alkari the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said there is no one like the women of quray the best women ever to ride on camels meaning that they are the the this is the description then what the prophet said they are so merciful on their children and they are so careful in preserving their husband's wealth they don't spend a lot they don't ask their husbands for money to spend so they take care of the household they take care of the children never the prophet said they go out and they do this and they do that does this mean that a woman does not is not supposed to work no if her job is halal and it does not compromise her house her W her husband and her children and she does a good job in it and she is observing her hijab this is okay but if she's working in a mixed environment I went to Abu zabi couple of months ago on business and I went to one of their media uh uh companies and I saw the local women and men sitting in the same offices next to each other so I was sitting in one office and there's a partition and next to me two three women and two three men W you hear the laughter from Miles Away laughter the women are laughing this big and the men are cracking jokes and and I was saying would I like my w my daughter to work in such an environment in such a place definitely not and would anyone in his sound mind would say this is normal this is just friendship would anyone accept this definitely not so working where it's suitable is good but you will not be productive more than you would be in your house look at the great Scholars of Islam look at for example mua AB sufyan one of the Muslim KHS a companion of the Prophet Alam one of the scribers of the Quran and the prophet said that mua is a m is a Believer who brought him up hint B may Allah be pleased with her when he was born when she gave birth to him she says may I lose him and become the mother of a dead man if he doesn't rule the whole world look at the aspiration she had when giving birth to this man and who did he become mua Abu sufyan the great khf of Islam since he was born the mother had set the objectives and the plans to execute and reach these objectives what do we have for our CH children when a mother now gives birth to a a baby boy may I may I lose him if he doesn't become the first in Playstation 3 or becomes the best rapper or the becomes the best uh uh Arabs Got Talent now we have Arab Got Talent So You Think You Can Dance in Arabic I don't know what's in Arabic it's all everything brainwash they want you to become westernized leave your Islam leave your ABA leave all these bad things come on you can be more than that sufyan one of the great Scholars of Islam his mother said to him leave everything I will work and sewing clothes and making things but devote yourself to memorizing the Quran and learning the Hadith she was a single mother and she made sure that her son became one of the greatest Scholars of all times in Islam so everybody knows him if you look at Ahmed hbal Ahmed hbal was raised by by his mother she was a single mother he said that my mother made sure that I memorized Quran when I was 10 years of age full Quran and she used to wake up in the morning for FJ prayer warm the water prepare the clothes and make woodo for her 10-year-old child in the freezing weather putting a warm clothes on him taking him to the Masjid and waiting outside until he finishes prayer and walking him back look what happened to that young man and so on and on and on so that's what or how you can be productive if you sit home and you raise your children W your children will bring miracles to this world and finally the most important thing in being productive is to know your responsibilities your obligations of course this is mutually said to men but I'm not addressing uh uh men I'm addressing you so if you know know your responsibilities and obligations you will be the most productive person uh uh ever Why by nature men and women neglect their obligations and responsibilities and only know and demand their rights and that is why most of marriages collapse when the two parties abide by their rights and neglect their obligations and resp responsibilities so I as a man I want my wife to do this for me and this and this and this and this okay what about your responsibilities and obligations this is not of your business do what I tell you now this is wrong because she on the other hand says well you have to do this and this and this for me and then I will think of doing to you what you need and there's no marriage it takes two to tangle you have to know your responsibilities and obligations and do them and then ask for your rights or some of them and this is portrayed in the Sunnah the prophet saidat wasam said do what you're obliged to do and ask Allah for your rights so imagine being in a country and there's a red traffic light and I go and cross it and the police Poli man stops me says why did you cross a red traffic light and I say because the government did not give me my benefits these are my respon my my rights so once you give me my benefits once you give me free uh uh Health Care once you do this and this for me and then I will obey you this is that it's chaos if this happens this is chaos if you know your responsibilities and obligations and fulfill them you will become the most productive woman uh uh around but this doesn't mean that you should not ask for your rights always ask for your rights but let this come as a second uh uh a stage and Allah Knows Best question I have one more question we receiv from as we say syst we have received a phone call from she was to about her Cas was very very sad to hear this thing I would like to pass this question for you um I remember this in over some stor of to go for her husband and whatever she he told her that you I'm just an interceder between you and whatever she say he just accepted it and it's indicate that is accept and respect the choice of and even the story of he just waited and he asked her to be patient but it wasn't a long period until the ration came and the story has from the Judgment from Allah the woman who called me she was suffering from a husband there's vience there's oppression and the weird thing that and the Cs the judges are asking her to be and the case has taken maybe one year so I want to know what is the for me to the because we see the story we should the choice of woman so what is the point I know Jud consider Jud even justice so you can just talk about okay first of all alhamdulillah that Allah did not make the sisters judges because then divorce cases would be in a spit of a second when someone comes to you with tears filling his eyes and crying and weeping don't look at his tears look at what his hands had done and that is why in judicial Affairs if someone comes to you with his eye poked one eye is gone complaining don't give him the verdict until you see the as salant because then you would probably find someone with two eyes gone and that is why the sisters when they come and call me and complain I don't give them a judgment because in the beginning of my life a sister used to come to me and say oh she he did this he did that and she cries and my heart is breaking We're Men we feel emotional very quickly in front of the tears of women if they're not our wives so I feel so bad and I say your husband has to be hung for 6 days and seven nights because of what he had done to you and then the husband comes and I when I listen to him I say your wife should be put in front of a firing squad with clash nofs and when I put them in front of each other to talk in front of me 50% of her talk is gone and 50% of his talk is gone because they're in front of each other so never ever judge for one person until you hear the other person's story now I I heard your allegation and you were emotionally affected by the sister's call and you did not speak to the husband I presume nor you did speak to the judge but you heard her story now I'm not betting I believe in the the judicial system and I believe in the fairness of the judges because there's nothing personal but most likely I don't know rape I don't know the Unseen most likely if you go to the judge he will tell you that the husband is not as as abusive as she says he might have hit her once or twice but he brought medical reports that she threw him with the ashray with six stitches in his forehead and I know personally a teacher a friend of mine not a friend an acquainted who when I ever speak about this he said well yesterday I threw my wife with a a coffee pot I said are you crazy he said no no it's okay we had a fight and she threw me first with ashray but she missed I didn't I I'm shocked of the way of people treating each other spouses and the amount of violence so most likely that this sister who's calling you she complained to the judge and the judge looked into her case and found that she is not right she is not correct the husband also has been abused and both of them have done so many wrong things but not to the extent to dissolve the marriage once and this is why I say to the sisters don't jump the gun don't always go for divorce a brother came to me and he said my wife does this my wife does that she wants 5,000 r as a monthly salary she wants to have her Freedom she or I divorce her he put in front of me a list of things that were horrendous no man would be a man if he accepts these and I told him if this is the way I see that you have to divorce her and that was my mistake the guy said I love her but uh she is asking for things that are unacceptable for a man to to to adhere to so what do you think if we sit together in the house of Fatima you know fa she's a well-known celebrity a reformer in jeda so said okay I went there I've never met F she was fully covered alhamdulillah and she knew one of my wives how is your wife how is doing alhamdulillah okay and she sat with them and she spoke with them that was about 7 8 years ago and they're still married the point is that sometimes in the life of the spouse you may get glitches and you think that this glitch is the end of the marriage not knowing that if you are a little bit patient it will go away so I cannot judge the sister's case going on for one year is too long but probably during that year in the second month things went to good for three months and then they had a fight so she forgot everything and went to four or five months ago and then for three more months they were living fine and they got the trouble again you cannot judge this and you cannot be so impulsive in saying that yes divorce the best thing to do is divorce most of the sisters I get about 200 questions a day on my emails most of the sisters say she my husband doesn't pray my husband doesn't fast he takes alcohol he cheats on me he uh chats with women and he fornicates and he's abusive and so can I ask for divorce before I used to say definitely you have my blessings now with time I say how long you've been married to him she said 35 years mallah 35 years only now you come to discover this no because this week or two she is depressed and she doesn't feel like being married to him she wants to call it off so if you say yes you will bear the burden of breaking such a marriage and if you say okay call me in a week time and she calls you after a week everything is fine alhamdulillah we were in alur we went to nce we went to can we did this and that our marriage is beautiful and that is why divorce is in the hand of a man usually usually men are not impulsive they think twice before divorcing and they don't change their mind six times uh per minute they usually are fixed on something and they're slow in taking decision and decisive women on the other hand are way different you wake up in the morning your wife has a very big smile after breakfast why did you do that why did you do that and you feel the most horrible person on Earth 10 minutes later she gives you a kiss on the cheek have a good day she calls you in the middle of the day bombarding you your mother did this and that she sends you SMS hate mail and and and hate messages when you come home putting on your helmet and your armor don't don't know when your blow is going to come mashallah she's wearing nice clothes and having her hair worn in a a beautiful way you are walking on a landmine this is what husbands feel you don't know when it's boom end of game start again I have three lives left you don't know so my answer to the sister who called you is I don't know your case but yes judges should be quick when they know that it's a hopeless case when the judge know I know sisters that their took about 6 to 8 months and I know a sister who called me and she said I filed for today and 5 days later I was free in jida so it depends on the judge how he looks at the case if he thinks that it can be fixed and amended and Allah knows [Music] [Music] beston first of all this is one incident that took place in the whole of Shar when a woman came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah I want to separate from my husband and he said what do you not like in him she said nothing in Islam mallah he's perfect but I hate kufur after IM I hate to become in a state of disbelief after believing now this statement by itself means that there is a reason and the reason was there is no chemistry and because there is no chemistry she cannot satisfy him she cannot fulfill her duties and this would make her she would not fulfill her her duties to him and this would make her not a a disbeliever a cafir but she would not make her do what is right in return for the blessings and Grace and favors of Allah so the prophet gave her divorce this is an incident not there are incidents first of all second of all Z came to the pro Z the cousin of the Prophet came to him asking divorce from Zade oh Prophet I hate him I don't love him he's a fre slave I'm an original qurayshi woman of of of of uh dignitary and and and lineage I cannot stay with him and the prophet did not sayas go ahead he kept on saying no it's too early come on Allah would me things Allah would fix things which means that this is the role of a reformer asking people to give divorce is the easiest thing on earth some say say she my wife is abusive divorcer it's easy to reconcile and try to mend things and try to reach the best thing is the most difficult thing and when you say that the prophet was only interceding and was not ordering yes because this not was not a proper marriage B was a slave and Thena helped her may Allah be pleased with them to free herself and now she's a free woman and her husband is a slave and a free woman cannot be forced to be with a slave there is no equality no uh I don't know how do you say it cohesions maybe between them so Islam gives her the right to cancel the marriage this is her god-given right yet the prophet was giving an advice if you wish you may stay with him so she said are you ordering me or interceding said no no no no it's not an order it's an intercession so that she said I don't need him I don't want to be married to him so I think this clears the matter a little bit but this is the last comment inah okay I will take you to the the what I will take you to the Cur and you will the torture because know is a torture for them so they are using it for example the husband is alol so it's very prominent thing and still so I think the Judgment what did the prophet Alam describe women as in in the farewell pilgrimage they he described them as what does Awan mean Prisoners the prophet described women as prisoners so he said to the men fear Allah in women because they are prison prisoners in your houses so a Woman by description she is a prisoner she is the weakest link no one says that no no no they they are oppressed they there are men who do not fear Allah who make their life difficult I fully agree with that but at the same time I fully agree with there are lots of women making the lives of men ex hell I have to admit this so it it goes both ways now men abusing women is not a cause or a justification for divorce to take place immediately or for women to retaliate by abusing their men in in return there has to be marriage counseling there has to be involvement of wise people in the family to sit to each other and clarify things and this insh would take care of of that and Allah knows best question and from Sister what should a prefer getting married or not getting married and taking care of her parents this is a difficult question and she's the only one who can answer that taking care of the parents is a good thing to do but sometimes the parents have other offsprings of their own that could take care of them so in normal cases all the boys and girls were married and there is this girl living with her parents and she gets proposals if she's extremely beautiful and talented and educated she can afford to wait like three four more years to take care of her parents but if she's not that beautiful and talented then the demand is far greater than the supply nowadays and the biggest example is I have 13 girls no boys so I'm not in a POS position to just sit and wait say no no I'm waiting for my knight in shining armor to come on top of his white uh horse to marry me maybe he comes in a high looks Toyota truck or whatever I don't know so it depends if there are other to take care of your parents no get uh uh married if you can financially afford to get someone to care for them phys physically a maid a servant who would take care of them get married the priority is to get married and there are very limited cases where yes your sacrifice is appreciated and you should stay with them because there is no one at all who can take care of them and they are handicapped or crippled or too old to serve themselves and yes in this case Allah would reward you but in normal cases if they are in their 50s maybe or in their 40s and you say I'd like to serve them no they're young you just go ahead and move on with your life canity between daughters and sons because some families are restricted withs and for okay most likely these are not practicing families in Arabia unfortunately we tend to give the freedom to the boys more than the girls I'm talking about non-practicing families so the boy we buy him a sports car we make him stay out late until 10 11 uh or 11 or 12 and maybe come before fer we allow him to travel to Europe on his own knowing that what would a punk like him do in Europe alone he's going to the Masjid mallah to visit Islamic centers in in in in Paris and in in in London definitely not he's going to nightclubs and fornicate and fall in Zena while the the daughter his sister who might be a little bit older than him or younger she is restricted from going to anywhere without the company of her mother and she cannot come back back after 10 and we have to know does the family have boys or not is the husband of the or the father of of the girl she's visiting is in the house or not and so many restrictions we have and this is normal this is logical when it comes to the girl because the girl is the most precious thing in our life and girls are like glass if broken it cannot be mended boys are boys no no matter what they do externally nothing is different no one could say ah we discovered something there's a defect in this brother no there was nothing like that that does not justify giving the boy freedom and it's also does not justify being so strict with the girl but I know girls that go out with the driver in Saudi alone telling their parents that I'm going to my cousins only to be ended up by you know the the the the religious police calling her father we caught your daughter with other girls in a disrespectful Place partying or whatever so over trusting them is wrong SE differentiating inequality in treatment is also wrong because he is also accountable at the side of Allah you cannot let him do whatever he wants to do but there always will be a difference girl is more precious if you have a jewel you would not expose it and give it to anyone to take it you will put it in a safe place and lock it because you care for it not because you want to oppress it and Allah knows best there's a question about um if we women want to stay home has wants us to go to work his advice because in this case we be okay again I've reiterated like six or seven times through my talk that you have to abide by the Quran and Sunnah so if your husband tells you to do something that goes against the Quran and Sunnah he has no right to be obeyed there's no obedience to him there is no obedience to any creature in disobeying Allah so and and by the way obedience should be in meaning that something that is accepted if your husband says didn't the prophet wasam order you to obey me you'd say yes my my dear say say okay I'm ordering you to stand on one foot for half an hour stand on one leg for half an hour and don't move should you obey him should you obey him if you say yes then wow I should get married again no you should not because this is not if he tells you don't sit for an hour or sit don't stand for an hour it's not Simon says you should order him in the parameters that Islam told you to or to to obey him in you should obey him only in the parameters that Islam tells you to obey him such as he tells you do not leave the house tonight she said no I'm going to my friend's wedding whether you like it or not and I'll show you who the man is this is Haram you cannot do this if he tells you I don't want your friend to come to you my house this is his god-given right the prophet saidham you may not allow anyone in his house except with his permission even if if he says do not get your mother inside my house do not allow your father inside my house this is his god-given right and that is why Asma AB Bakr may Allah be pleased with her in Medina she said my mother is coming and she's a disbeliever and she wants to connect my kinship should I honor her should I allow her home the prophet said yes and this is with the permission of her husb husband other than that it is not permissible so obedience has to be through the Quran and Sunnah if he tells you I'd like you when my friends come to bring the coffee and serve them definitely this is unacceptable if he tells you we live in a joint family and my brothers live in my father's house we all live in the same house and I don't want you to wear the hijab in front of them you must not obey him this is totally prohibited because it is going against against the Quran and the Sunnah so I hope this answers the question another question is it okay for a girl to pursue vacation in things where she has to make wom coeducation [Music] for it is permissible for a woman to pursue her education to the highest levels providing she's abiding by the Quran and Sunnah so if if there is a university that is segregated and she is studying whatever she wants to study that is halal in a segregated environment she could get her PhD and master's degrees without any problem Islam supports her and tells her that's a good thing to do but if it is mixed uh uh environment if men and women boys and girls are studying together this is totally prohib ited and no matter what it's better for her to sit home being uneducated and entering Jenna rather than getting a PhD through a mixed educational process which would might end up with her flirting or having a relationship with uh another student and Allah Allah knows best this question also seems like asking for stays away in another country and the husband is another country like 7 hours long journey f is it permissible for her to travel to see her husband and if the husband actually gives her permission well if even if the husband gives her permission Allah did not give her the permission the fatwa was answered by the prophet in theah when the prophet once addressed his companions and said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a m who said this who said this the prophet wasam now a man stood and said oh prophet of Allah my wife went for Hajj and my name was registered in an expedition of so and so to go for Jihad so what to do the prophet Alam said go and accompany your wife because she has already traveled you have to rectify this by going going and following him and leaving Jihad so now this is the verdict if the husband says I want you to come and the prophet says it's not lawful it's not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel without a Mah who would you follow but Im so and and so and Scholar so and so said it's okay and I am shocked the prophet said says it is not permissible and you say that so and so says it's okay are you a Muslim do you say and XY Z is rasool or Muhammad sallu alhi wasallam therefore you have to submit your will to Allah you have to abide and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Sall wasam and Allah knows best question sister is saying home is the the place for women as you mentioned what about going up only for is there difference between sing and first of all it is one of the greatest forms of Da and and greatest forms of worshiping Allah to go for studying Quran and Sunnah and giving to women in segregated places and safe places there's nothing better than that Allah says in the Holy Quran there is no one better in rhetoric than he who calls to Islam and does righteous deeds and proclaims that I am among the Muslims there is no one better than him so if yes the sister can go and and participate in Daw in giving dawa in learning and teaching the Quran or the Sunnah this is extremely beneficial and good whether she's single or married if she's single she has to take the permission of her father and if she's married she has to take the permission of the husband and if both refuse she has to adhere and obey that he uses all of us in his way and his cause and to accept all of our good deeds and to make our lives better in this life and in the [Music] hereafter"
