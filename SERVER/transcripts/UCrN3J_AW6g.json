  "transcript": "uh dear brothers and sisters in islam among the most famous women around the prophet is his beloved daughter may allah be pleased with her and with her mother she was born five years before the revelation which means that she was 18 years old when the prophet isa migrated to medina she was the youngest of the prophets alison's daughters and we all know that usually the youngest of our children are the most beloved to our hearts we tend to care for them love them give them more affection than any of the other children because they're the youngest they're the most vulnerable and this is human nature with fatima it was different though it was human nature but she had a character that made the prophet alaihis love her more and more at an early age she used to defend the prophet ali and take care of him even after the death of her mother may allah be pleased with her khadijah she took care of her own father caring for him catering for his needs abdullah tells us about an incident that just gives you a glimpse of what caliber this great woman was made of he said that when we were in mecca the prophet came ali salatu salam to the masjid prostrated to allah azzawajal during prayer so the prophet prayed on his own he's a muslim to them he's an infidel to the idol worshipers so he prayed on his own minding his own business and when the prophet is prostrated may allah curse him the pharaoh of this ummah talked to his companions and said who among you would go to the house of so and so and get the placenta of their camel so one of them went there and took that placenta and all the dirt that was attached to it and while the prophet was prostrating on the ground facing the kaaba in the sacred masjid of mecca the masjid al-haram he came and placed it on his head and back the prophet salallahu was not startled he did not move he continued in his position of sujud abdullah mr ud who was a companion a muslim he said none of us could do anything we were weak we were vulnerable we did not have anyone to protect us had we stood and objected to that so we remain silent with our hearts being torn apart but being unable to do or say anything until someone went to the prophet's house and informed fatima who was a child of maybe 7 9 years of age she came running removed that filth from her father's back and head and addressed the dignitaries of quraish this little girl addressing these fearless warriors saying to them may allah curse you swearing at them cursing them and it shows you how strong she was even at an early age and the story as you all know from the secret that the prophet says i'm concluded this prayer and then he started to make dua against them by saying o allah destroy quraish or allah destroy quraish o allah destroyed quraish and they went into silence mode because they hated it when someone made dua in the masjid against them and they knew that allah would respond and then he made dua specifically on these tyrants later on on the battle of badr i saw all of those whom he made dua against killed and thrown in a well in badr fatima may allah be pleased with her is also nicked named as as zahara and there is not a single authentic hadith authenticating that she is to be called like this yet great scholars of islam such as imam zahabi imami imam and many more used to always call her fatima therefore means the one with the white and illuminating or shining face so there's no harm in calling her with such a name fatima as we all know got married to the cousin of her father so the prophet saw and ali were cousins and we know that among the children ali was the first to accept islam and he was raised in the house of the prophet so later on when they migrated to medina he went to speak to the prophet salam and he used to be not afraid but sort of having this respect great respect to the prophet alaihis saw some that intimidated him in a sense so he says about himself when i went in and sought permission to speak to the prophet al-islam and i was allowed to i was baffled i couldn't say a word i didn't know what to say so it was the prophet who also said are you coming here to propose to fatima and that was a relief he said yes so he said what are you giving her as a dowry this is his beloved daughter so it has to be something worthwhile ali said i don't have a thing and ali was stone broke because his father abu talib though was he was one of the dignitaries of quraish but he has had so many children and not a lot of property or income so ali inherited literally nothing so the prophet asked him what about your al-hatmiya the shield that you had and it was of the value of 400 dirhams not not a lot so yes i still have it so the prophet said give it to her as a dowry and they were wet simple dowry a simple wedding a simple furniture of the house it was only a small mattress and a pillow filled with sponge or such a material and two jars and one grinder where they put the grain to make it or change it into flour that's it this is the house of the daughter of the prophet himself alaihis allahu salaam yes this is the house of the mistress of jannah the prophet alaihis salam said in an authentic hadith this is an angel coming down for the first time in his life requesting permission from allah to give salam and to give the glad tiding that fatima is the mistress of all women of jannah and that al-hasan and the hussein they are the masters of the youth of the people of jannah subhanallah what a blessed progeny what a blessed lineage she was the daughter of the prophet alessa without any doubt and she had a happy life with ali what we know is that she had the famous al-hasan and al-hussein whom the descendants of the prophet alaihis salazar come from them but a lot of us don't know that she gave birth to five children hassan al-hussein and she also was oh gave birth to two daughters um and zainab um was married to rumar ibn khattab when he was extremely old and she was extremely young her father ali gave her in marriage because umar wanted to keep a lineage between him and the prophet alison through marrying her and she gave birth to his son zaid so five children she gave in the span of nine years may allah be pleased with her and we know the status of al-hasan and hussain in the prophet's heart fatima used to be next name also the mother of her father how is that possible how can a woman be the mother of her father this means that she was caring for him and she loved him like a son not as a father she had so much love for the prophet salsa and care since a very young age and it would be no doubt to us when we hear how mother aisha may allah be pleased with her described her she said no one resembled the prophet in the way he looks in the way he talks in the way he walks more than fatima whenever she stood up or sat down you could tell that this is the prophet and whenever she would enter a room where the prophet assalam was sitting he would stand up for fatima and he would kiss her and he would make her sit in his seat in his place and whenever the prophet would enter a room where fatima is she would stand up for him kiss him and she would make him sit where she was sitting fatima was a patient wife acknowledging that she is the mistress of the women of paradise acknowledging that her father is the best man allah ever created and the most beloved to allah almighty yet this did not make her arrogant she was an excellent wife a superior mother and she used to work in her own home with her own hands without the assistance of a servant until it made an impact on the palms of her hands it became rough like a man's hands so ali advisor may allah be pleased with him to go and ask from your father a slave from all the slaves that the muslims have so that she can serve you and help you with the shores when she went the prophet al-sassam who had all the means to do that directed her and him ali to something that was better first of all he did not want to do any favors for them just for their relationship to him secondly he wanted to tell them and show them that life is not worth all of that and thirdly he directed the um at large to something that was beneficial and that would grant them the energy to behave and act so he came to them just before they went to sleep and he taught them to say subhanallah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times allahu akbar 34 times the total is a hundred saying it as you are lying on your bed as part of your bedtime at car would be more beneficial for you than having a servant to assist you in your work even tamiya and many scholars said that whoever observes this vicar before going to bed at night allah azzawajal would grant him the power and energy and the agility to do what is needed to be done with a helping hand and in this hadith it shows clearly as imam tabari says and others that the prophet al-islam did not order ali to provide his wife with a servant because this is not her right when it came to dowry though he can postpone the dowry make it in installments delay it a year or two he insisted that he give gives her his shield al-hatmiya because this is mandatory but for the servant he did not even ask ali to provide her with one because outside or external service it is the man's duty inside of the internal service of the house it is the woman's responsibility and duty fatima was a woman whom the prophet alaihis entrusted her with secrets and she would never reveal the prophet's secrets aisha tells us when the prophet saws was on his death bed aisha came and we can barely miss the way she walks resembling it to the way the prophet walks ali it's almost identical when the prophet saw her say he said hello my daughter marhaban bibnati and he made her sit next to him and then he whispered something in her ears and she cried and wept heavily and when the prophet saw ali saw some how distressed she was he whispered something again in her ears and she laughed so haisha went to her and said what did the prophet allah saw tell you fatima said i would never disclose and expose a secret the prophet salallahu and later on the prophet susan passed away after his death aisha went again to fatima and said now the prophet is gone now the prophet is dead sallallahu alaihi wasallam tell me what he whispered in your ears fatima said as of now you're right he's dead so i am at liberty to say and disclose it the prophet told me that every ramadan jibril revises the quran with him once except this last ramadan he revised the quran with him twice and i feel that this is my year that i will die in so i wept and cried being sad to depart my father then he whispered in my ear again telling me won't you be happy to know that you are the mistress of the women of jannah and i laughed in another narration if i do not i hope i recall correctly he said to her that you are the first of my family to die after me and she died six months later as we know how was her relationship with her so-called stepmothers she had nine of them may allah be pleased with them all the mothers are the believers they all loved and respected fatima even when they needed someone to mediate between them and the prophet islam they would send fatima mother aisha said that one day the other wives of the prophet saw sent fatima to ask the prophet alai salatu to be fair with all of the his wives including aisha because as you remember men of medina used the people of medina used to send their gifts to the prophet food and other stuffs when he was at aisha's day and house and then when he went to other houses they would not send a thing to them so they sent fatima asking and demanding that the prophet islam put an end to such a practice because it's unfair for us and it wasn't the prophet who was asking for it it was the people who were doing it from their own selves so fatima went and said oh prophet of allah she was sitting o prophet of allah my father your wives are demanding justice so the prophet looked at her and said my daughter don't you love what i love and fatima said by allah i love what you love o prophet of allah so the prophet said o my daughter i love her meaning i love aisha and i did not do any injustice it's the people who are giving it to me so why would i stop people from doing that so she went back to the wives of the prophet and told them about the incident so they objected and told her you didn't do anything for us go back again and speak to him and demand justice fatima says by allah i'll never speak to him about this subject again in my life now the incident that a lot of the muslims know about is that the prophet allah prohibited ali from taking a second wife and they always spread this among the people saying oh look if the prophet haslam prohibited ali from taking a second wife then you my son-in-law are not allowed to take a second wife and your wife has all the right to be mad and jealous and refuse this and that this is misunderstood incident you have to look into the hadith and understand it as the scholars had and not improvise or come up with opinions that are baseless the story goes that the family of abu jahl the pharaoh of this ummah and the enemy of islam and the muslims proposed to ali to marry the daughter of abu jahl so he was contemplating about it and when this reached the prophet salatu salam he became angry and he addressed the people saying that my first son-in-law abu al-asbr and was truthful to me and fulfilled his pledge to me meaning he did not take another wife over his daughter zainab may allah be pleased with her and now i hear that ali wants to combine the daughter of the messenger of allah that is fatima alongside the daughter of the enemy of allah the daughter of abu jahl by allah this hurts fatima and whatever hurts fatima hurts me as she is part of me and a flesh of mine by allah i do not make haram or meaning that marriage is halal i'm not making it prohibited but due to the fact that hurting fatima hurts the prophet and we know that hurting the prophet islam is an act of apostasy therefore the prophet islam prevented such a marriage due to the reasons that he had given you are not the prophet of allah to be hurt by your daughter's hurting and your daughter is not the daughter of the messengers of and the one your son-in-law is getting married to is not the daughter of the enemy of allah so all of these justifications and conditions clarifies why the prophet isaiah prohibited ali from marrying someone else when did fatimah die fatima may allah be pleased with her died in the month of ramadan six months or less after the death of the prophet alaihis salatu wasallam and when she was on her deathbed asma told her that in abyssinia she saw a practice that was very beautiful and that is they put a body over the deceased body they put something like an arched arch uh like a fence a k a a cage over a woman's body and then they put a cloth on it so when men are carrying the deceased body no one can tell her figure her body her curves while she's lying on that um piece of machinery or piece of equipment they carry disease over or on and fatima loved the idea because it helps conceal her body shape so she made it in her will that when she dies they put this cage on her entire body and put a cloth on top of it so no one would recognize her body when she's been carried to the grave and she was the first one to do that she died and she was 29 years of age may allah be pleased with her hathawallahu foreign you"
