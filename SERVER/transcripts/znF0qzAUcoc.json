  "transcript": "now Jabbar who claims to be calling from Saudi Arabia he says that is it permissible to force one sister to marry from a man that serves no no one has the permission or the ability to force a woman to marry against her will except for the father and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is that he as well is not permitted to force his daughter to marry someone she doesn't want and Allah knows best"
