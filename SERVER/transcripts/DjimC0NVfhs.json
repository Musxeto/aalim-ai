  "title": "Ruling on signing a lease document that consists of late payment penalty (interest) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ibrahim from the emirates he says he's going to study abroad in ireland and they like have a lease contract for the rent of the apartment he's renting and they have a late payment penalty if this is in all the places and the buildings and the residential areas you're applying for and this is the norm in the country you have no other alternative because you can't live on the streets so you have to opt for it but i would highly recommend that you pay up in advance so that you would never reach a point where you find out that you don't have money or is going to come after a week or two and it's late due to covered or whatever and then end up having this riba occurring in your account so if there's no other alternative it's the norm and the law of the country you can go for it but pay in advance you"
