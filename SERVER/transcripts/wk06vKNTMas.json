  "transcript": "i see my question is that everyone is mandated to use a catholic filter but if one is still going to school don't have a job and still rely on their parents uh what will be the ruling for them okay the cattle feather is man the cattle fetter is mandated at the end of the month of ramadan before offering salatul this is the timing and it is a negligible amount so it's one sar approximately 2.25 a little bit less a little bit more let's say 2.5 kilograms of rice or of dates or something else that you give to the poor so the amount in money is very little and usually the head of the family the father is the one who calculates for his children living under his new his roof and he gives zakat on their behalf so if your father or your mother or your elder brother does this on behalf of the whole family this does the job alhamdulillah if not then if you have the amount that exceeds your need for today so i have to to buy rice i need 15 reals for the cattle footer and i have in my possession 30 reels which means that i'll have 15 reels that would feed me the whole day and another 15 i will dedicate for the cattle footer i have to give it myself but if your father your brother or someone in your family is doing it then this is sufficient inshallah you"
