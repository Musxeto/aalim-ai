  "title": "Can we mortgage our property to someone & ask for a rent as well? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says we have a property and we are mortgaging it to some people and at the same time taking rent from them this can't be done unless you understand the process and the transaction itself so are you selling or leasing if you're selling through mortgage this means that this property costs a hundred thousand dollars and they will pay for it within the duration of two years agreed agreed we sign a contract finalized after that you can't ask them for rent because rent at that time after the contract was signed would be considered riva the hundred thousand dollars there is interest which is the rent they're paying okay before we sign can we include it yeah you can say the value of the house is a hundred and twenty thousand dollars being a hundred mortgage twenty thousand dollars to be paid over the duration of two years ten thousand each year which makes it 800 a month in addition so what's the difference here the difference is that the final price of the transaction which is selling the mortgage is fixed because the mortgage is alone the moment i have one percent or half a percent over the final price increase this is reba so include the final price package 120 000 break it over 24 months duration as you wish as you agree but nothing more that you are allowed to take and allah knows best"
