  "transcript": "beyond beyond I know him a hundred aminosilane mubarak ali muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in quarter early he was happy admin and my back dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Baraka - and welcome to this new episode of mercy for mankind sallallahu alayhi wa sallam this is a daily show insha'Allah throughout the month of Ramadhan we began 5 days late but it's better late than never and this is not an academic program it's not technical it's just a cordial dish discussion and an insight over the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam over the sea and biography of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who was sent as a mercy for mankind and the reason behind this is that we are in a time of chaos of turmoil we are in a time that people seem to fail to know what is right from what is wrong and it was our prophets instruction sallallahu alayhi wa sallam he said I have left with you two things you will never be lost you will never go astray if you abide by them the Book of Allah and my Sunnah so the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam is crucial and important in islam in our religion and in our lives because it is the beacon that lights the way to us in the midst of a storm therefore this program is just an easy way of looking into the Sunnah of the Prophet s salatu salam it is an eye-opener that I pray to Allah that would increase our love to our prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam through learning and going through his serie and his Sunnah the format of the program hopefully that half of it which is half an hour would be dedicated to the hadith or the story and the lessons learned from it after the break you will see the phone numbers insha Allah and you may call if you have any questions preferably related to the topic and if not as usual as every Ramadan this is like a miniature ask hooda you may ask any question insha Allah and may allah azzawajal accept our deeds may Allah accept our fasting and our prayers and make all of them sincere for his sake the hadith we have today is a very famous hadith narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that I was behind the Messenger of Allah one day and he said oh boy I shall teach you some words safeguard or observe Allah and he will protect you observe Allah and you will find him in front of you if you ask then ask of Allah and if you seek help then seek help from Allah know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way they would not benefit you except in something that Allah had decreed for you and if they were to greet to gather together to harm you in some way they would not harm you except in something that Allah has decreed for you the pens have been lifted and the pages have drawn this hadith was reported by the mantle medium am i mad in the Mossad etc so it is a well-known hadith it is a CENTAC and there's no doubt in it but what are the benefits we can learn from this single hadith first of all the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was given the concise of speech meaning he speaks few words and you can interpret that in two volumes because there is so much wisdom in them and this is without any doubt you will not find an authentic hadith that has any nonsense in it or that it is just a repetition of the same thing no every single hadith is a whole semester by itself to study it is something that needs thorough contemplation to know and understand and benefit of it and if we look at this hadith you have to learn the background the background was Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu are you able to sell them when he was sent to mankind he was 40 years of age and he was residing in Mecca surrounded by all pagans and idol worshippers he came out of the blue telling them that your culture that your religion that you gods that you believe in are all false and there's only one God one creator of this whole universe and there's no one worthy of being worshipped except him and he's a provider he's a creator he is the giver of life and death and you must worship Him they did not accept this and for 13 years in Mecca he was relentless in calling them to Allah trying to get them out from darkness to the light and saving them from Hellfire few people accepted his call the believers were among the weak and the vulnerable and then he migrated to Medina where he was surrounded by the Jews who were trying relentlessly to attack him ridicule him or kill him if they can he was also surrounded by the hypocrites who were trying to find the right moment to strike nevertheless the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam was the mercy for mankind he had the time to move from one place to the other without an entourage without any convoy or guards in front of him or behind him he was trusting allah azzawajal and his means of transportation was not a fancy camera though he had won for battle he was not one expensive horse he was riding on a mule and this shows you the humbleness of the prophet alayhi salaatu sam who was not a king he was not a tyrant he was a slave of allah he was a servant sent with a message and was waiting for his time to be up and to be the companion of the righteous among the prophets among the martyrs among the Siddiqui and among the pious so the prophet that is thought to surround and this is one incident he was taking his cousin Abdullah hip not bath Abdul Mutallab and he was accompanying him and he was behind him on his right and from this we also learned that it is permissible to have to riding a mule or a horse or a providing that this does not harm the animal and if we were to speak about animal rights in Islam this would take us ages because it is the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam who ordered us to take care of animals nowadays people advocate animal rights like an actress who is over 70 or 80 years of age condemning Muslims for offering sacrifice in Eid al Hajj in the Eid of pilgrimage and she says that this is against human rights as if Islam doesn't know what human rights is or what animal rights is what they have a problem with is human rights they care about these animals and they neglect what is more important and that is the rights of the humans worldwide anyhow the Prophet Alastair son told us that Allah forgave a prostitute because she gave a drink to a thirsty dog and he also told us that Allah admitted a woman to hell because she kept a kitten locked in a room until it died out of hunger she neither fed it nor let it go and look for food so this is real human right the real animal rights when it tells you being kind gets you to paradise to animals and being harsh gets you to hell if you are that harsh with animals so the Prophet al-islam had his cousin with him normal thing so what's so special what was special was that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was almost 55 or 57 years of age while I've been under live in our bath was about 13 years of age look at the difference in age yet the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not choose and select someone his age to teach him rather he selected this youngster and he gave him words of wisdom he gave him this precious advice because in a sense the prophet alayhi salatu salam knew with his insight with his intellect that this boy is not like any other boy this boy is to be invested in and definitely the prophets insight Alistair awesome was accurate and up to the point Abdullah grabbed us in few years time after the death of the Prophet irresolute salam became one of the greatest scholars of the companions to the extent that omar himself may Allah be pleased with him would not do anything without consulting him he was so close to all of the great caliphs and the great rulers because of his knowledge and the Prophet himself are in salat wa sallam prayed to Allah that he increases him in knowledge and to give him insight in understanding the Quran he is known as the hubber of this Ummah the highest-ranking scholar of this Ummah so the Prophet and I saw some in modern times human resources HR he was doing what is known as succession planning he was preparing those in the third level to be in the second and those in the second level to be in the first level and this is part of the teachings of the Prophet Allah saw some that we should not depend on one particular individual when he goes the Dawa goes we should not depend on a scholar when he dies knowledge dies with him on the contrary we should be on a constant process of preparing Diaries of preparing scholars of preparing people of knowledge and not only in Islamic aspects but also in engineering in medicine every aspect that the Muslim Ummah needs we have a problem with this and as Benjamin Franklin says if you fail to plan then you are planning to fail if you fail to plan if you don't have a plan then this is your plan for failure so the Prophet Alice Austin took out of his precious time this time to take his cousin and teach him and also this is something that we have to look deep into what do we do with our day and night what do we do in the hours that pass over us do we utilize our youth do we utilize our age do we utilize our time that Allah has blessed us with this is a big problem people go from point A to point B in their vehicles wasting an hour maybe less maybe more and if you ask them okay what did you benefit from this past hour you said nothing I was just listening to music maybe the best one of them would be saying that I was listening to the news as if he's a decision maker as if he has to monitor the news to make his signature at the end of a declaration of war for example we don't have any say in what's happening in the world so why do you care about the news so much if you're not gonna positively contribute so we waste a lot of time doing nothing it was so beautiful to see people in the waiting room in a hospital waiting for their appointment grabbing a must-have and reading it or reading a book of knowledge or calling some of the shoe asking them for fatwas or answering a question or an email regarding something of knowledge utilizing your time when we go to the west to the kafir countries we see them in the subways we see them in the tube on their buses in the trains holding a novel holding a book and reading it every single day on their way to the office and on their way back how many books do you they finish per year and how many books do we finish per year so the Prophet Ra selasa was giving us an example of how to utilize the time though this was a simple right taking his cousin from point A to point B the Prophet Elisha rajasam did not let this go he said to his cousin oh boy so this is like a warning letter a warning shot this is something to attract his attention oh boy I'm going to teach you words so pay attention so now I'm the lion our bus is ready what is it o prophet of Allah I'm gonna absorb it all of it and then the Prophet tells me so Salaam observe Allah meaning safeguard Allah Allah doesn't Nate need safeguarding this does not translate literally it means that you do what Allah tells you to do and stay away from what Allah tells you to stay away from and Allah will protect you if you have this full trust in allah azzawajal and you observe Allah in everything you do then allah azzawajal will be in front of you whatever you do he's always there caring for you protecting you and this by allah azza wajal is extremely needed not for the youngsters but also for the grown-ups however the youngsters may need it more because this is the foundation that they will grow up on so if you manage to take a youngster a child and bring him on Islamic values this man or this woman would be something in the future there will be leaders with the grace of Allah soja because the foundation is firm and strong and this is one aspect that we Muslims may have failed in seizing the chance we have so many children and the youth are the majority in the Muslim Ummah however they are being neglected and it's not always the role of governments see we always tend to blame the governments for every small thing as a joke there was a an earthquake in one country one Arab country and the tyrant Minister of Interior sent a memo to the president saying that we have captured a number of extremists and insha Allah by the following two days they will confess of their responsibility over the earthquake and the president was happy of course we fail to do this it's not only their job it is part of their job description but it's also our jobs as parents as teachers as community leaders as Imams as judges as scholars we have to take care and cater to the needs of the children Islamically we have to raise their awareness so this was the prophets role sallallaahu lamp with all and part of it was to dedicate it to the children he would never neglect children like we do if I sit with my friend and the children come in I tell him how he take your kids out or I call my wife take the kids out we want to talk no this wasn't the case with the Prophet Alice a lot of Salaam he knew how to utilize every single situation he was in for the sake of Allah not for personal gains and those ignorant those disbelievers who mock him and depict him sallallahu seldom and tried to criticize him all their efforts are in vain and when they will go to the junkyard of history like those before them the Prophet that is our ashram no one can come close to him and no one can harm him his name is always mentioned with the name of Allah Azza WA JAL five times a day all over the globe when they call for the salat is being called so no matter what you say or do it's not gonna harm him so Allah how do you what he was in them however the ignorant is taking over them if they spend some time to read his biography if they spent little time to sit with a real scholar and they would bombard him with their doubts and with their critiques and he would know how to address every single point well why they would have loved the Prophet that is awesome but it is ignorance it kills those who embrace it so the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam used to pay a lot of attention to the children i'm ribbon ibis ARIMA was a four year or five year old child was eating with the Prophet sent from the same plate but his hand was going left right and center he's picking whatever he wants from all over the plate and the Prophet said Ali so Sam Yahoo LOM oh boy Sam Miller say bismillah eat with your right hand don't eat with your left and eat from what's in front of you three statements that you need a book to explain the etiquette of eating and the moral conduct of the Prophet Alistair Sam in teaching the children he did not spank him on his hand he did not reprimand him he did not insult him but he spoke to him nicely with beneficial advice and this is what we should do now moving on to this beautiful hadith and I doubt that we will have time to go through it because it as stated this hadith has so much in it and I wouldn't be exaggerating if I say maybe not me but a real scholar would be able to go through it throughout the month of Ramadan and yet maybe maybe not the hadith has so much in it that we need to embrace it we need to study it and if he if I say we need to memorize it well like that that would not be something far the Prophet said Yahoo lam for the logic of f of safekeeping safeguarding observing and this is similar to elders instruction half ago Alice Aloha tea was so little Woodstock when Allah says in the Quran hey follow so observe Oh safeguard it translates to guard strictly your habit of prayers especially the middle prayer so this is another instruction but from a large ocean so part of safeguarding part of observing allah azza wajal is to fulfill his commands and among the greatest commands of all is prayer so no matter what level of education you have reached no matter what level of intellect you are no matter how many diplomas or PhDs you've got if you do not observe the prayer and safeguard it and pray it on time you are in great loss if for the logical observe Allah and he shall protect you and if you do not protect the Salah itself if you're not keen on praying on time and we are in Ramadan and one-sixth of Ramadan is almost gone imagine this is the fifth day of Ramadan isn't it a time for you to pause and reflect how many prayers have I missed how many Jews of the Quran or how many times have I finished the Quran altogether how many times have I made still far they care how much did I spend in charity how is my fasting how good am I or was I in staying away from Haram throughout the whole month of Ramadan this is an eye-opener because you cannot observe allah azzawajal as we will come to discuss inshallah later on maybe after the break but if we get calls then maybe tomorrow insha'Allah you cannot observe allah azza wajal if you do not audit your own life Ramadan has to be different than any other month is it to you seriously this is the fifth day ask yourself frankly has anything changed meaning the week before Ramadan and this week of Ramadan are they the same with the difference that I don't eat and drink until sunset or are they different I have friends coming to me and telling me alhamdulillah things are much much better and different than before Ramadan so I asked them how they say we stopped watching TV altogether so no news no sports and of course no soap operas or films etc we stopped accessing Facebook and Twitter because this is a waste of time and instead we started reading the or an excessively and we stopped entering and seeing and checking what's up because this is a total failure and and loss of time and hamdulillah we are finding that we are getting closer to Allah our hearts are more cleansed for the sake of allah azzawajal so their Ramadan is definitely a blessed one insha'Allah and they are closer to Allah more and more we have a short break you will find the phone numbers if you want to post a call or to have a question and we will be right back insha allah assalamu alaikum and welcome back just before the break i was informed that this is not a live show and hence we will not be able to take any of your calls so i do apologize but these technical errors are becoming sort of ongoing unfortunately let's think positively about it and pray to allah azzawajal that these technical errors do not come on and on and spoil our programs going on to the hadith the Prophet said that in salat wa sallam safeguard or observe Allah and he will protect you observe Allah and you will find him in front of you now if you look at this advice of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and other advices you will find and learn because how is it possible for us to understand a verse of the Quran you cannot understand a verse of the Quran except through understanding the rest of the Quran now I have been told that we're live again hamdullah who gave us life after our death and that we will be receiving phone calls so if anybody is watching the program and has a question you may go ahead and make a phone call you will find the numbers in Charlevoix displayed at the bottom of your screen so going back to the real hadith how can we understand the quran you cannot understand the Quran in isolation you cannot come to one ayah and said yes this is it you have to go through the whole Quran so that it all falls in the same line and you understand it understand it throughout the context of the Quran not only that you need the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam because without the sunnah of the prophet sala rezulin you will not be able to understand the Quran not because the Quran is ambiguous I would've Allah I seek refuge in Allah Azza WA JAL on the contrary Allah has made it easy to remember easy to understand but it is a general book for all times and for all countries and hence you are supposed to look into it and to study it through the Sunnah of the Prophet array salat WA Salam otherwise Allah would have revealed the Quran without the need for the prophets Allah Allah Allah and everybody would take a copy and go on but this was not the case Allah Azza WA JAL had made for us the prophets allah salam to be our role model and to tell us about what Allah wants from us from the Quran we have something LA and to you as well my question is we go further are we and I just to know what is a Sharia ruling if you open the Quran and try to recite it when the imam is reciting the Quran so some people say that we should not be reading the Quran we should be only listening to what the Imam is saying so I want to know what is a Shariah only okay Omar's question is a frequent question she goes to tell away and when the imam is reciting the Quran she opens the Koran and she follows through reading what the Imam is reading so what is the ruling on this whether you're asking about is it halal or Haram in his Hallett it is permissible whether you asking is it recommended or not the answer is it is not recommended and we have to understand something the Quran was revealed so that we would listen to it and Allah ordered us in Chapter seven surah al-anfal that whenever the Quran is being recited you must listen and adhere to it so this means that when the Quran is being recited by the Imam we should not be engaged in something else however if a person follows behind the Imam in Arabic then this is no there's no problem if he wants to read the English translation then this is totally prohibited because now he's not engaged in salat anymore he's engaged in something else now why do we say then it's not recommended first of all because there are so many Sunnis that you will abandon the first one is placing the right hand over the left while in the standing position you will not be able to do this because you will be holding the Koran in front of you the second sooner you should be looking at the place where you put your forehead at the time of prostration when standing now you're not doing this you're looking at the most half the third sooner you will be bothering those two you're right and left because every time you turn over a page or the way you're holding the most half you'll distract them while if you're putting your right on the left on the chair on the chest as the Sundays then everybody's calm and concentrating in their prayer fourthly when you prostrate and bow you put it under your arm or you hold it in your hand which means that your student record would not be proper and maybe you put it on the floor and somebody would complain and say unobjected at this is what are you doing this is respectful and this would cause a lot of oil so it is not recommended yet it is we have this a result of urine or passing gas or normal passing us okay I will answer in sha Allah now Malita is asking a question that a lot of the Muslims ask and subhanAllah Shaitaan the devil Satan always creeps in through these matters matters of purity matter of with wasps and whispering matter of obsessive compulsive disorder OCD and this is what the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam the mercy to mankind addressed and tackled this issue and this was present at the time of the Prophet Elisha salatu salam so we have to situations either you are medically ill and it is a proven medical case that you have a problem with passing gas and you have no control on that and it is continuously coming out so this is one scenario the second scenario is that no you don't have a medical problem but it's all in your mind i think i feel i assume that this happened but nothing happened for the second scenario the Prophet told the Salahi's salatu was-salam when one of his companions complained he said one of you must not leave the prayer unless he hears the sound or finds a smell meaning that you should not leave prayer just for the assumption or for the suspicion or for doubting that you had passed wind unless you are certain and your certainty would be translated through hearing a sound that you passed wind or finding a smell of the wind that had was passed if not then continue your prayer and your wood is valid so what about genera one the medical condition if you have a medical condition then this is easy if it's continuously truly happening then there is no problem on you inshallah this is known as Almohad or the one who's excused so this is a medical situation a medical case the remedy for it is when the iron is being called for for example Aisha you perform woudl and you go and pray Asia oppression pressure are we regardless of what comes out of you don't I go and pray perform what no you don't because this is continuous and it's a medical case what about Umbra there's no problem do or umrah no matter what comes out of you and hamdulillah and this makes life easy insha'Allah Suleiman from you a 23 Salim on mute your TV please and talk to me through phone only my question for the tryi yes yes what is the question of him some people 23 and under some people is 18 yeah okay 18 what three what yeah 23 some people 23 from different at 11 which one is right okay I will answer insha'Allah last year from Saudi nice yeah I think I have to question we have already done the Umbria as own Umbra and now we on to do the Ummah on behalf of some other person so we are not going to get the ire of Umbra only that person will get i J this is my first question and second question suppose if the person misses the Salah of finesse Allah in a fortune in the morning and if there is a comet and he and he goes for the fudges and later on he can come and play the Sunnah at home or he has to wait for the sunrise okay laughing well you can sit on brother Salim as question was unclear and he was asking about two separate questions to my understanding witr prayer three Rockets can they pray it in a row or not the answer is the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to pray whitter salat in two plus one meaning two then salaam then one isolated raka and he used to prayed three rockets with one selamat a third raka but he would not sit in the second raka for Tasha who'd like Maghrib he would stand up without sitting with the jihad and he forbade us to simulate it to MRIB unlike what the brothers from the from the Hanafi school of thought apply this is wrong this is not in accordance to the sooner the Prophet forbade us from doing this so the question would come and say okay what about those who pray behind the hanafi imam and who praised the Whitter like margaret pray behind him and follow him he's wrong and you know it and he hate it but you may do this because he's following a reputable school of thought and you would like to get the reward of praying the whole night and you cannot attain this except if you pray with him from the very beginning to the end of the Whitter the second question that probably he was asking about what are the numbers of raka of taraweeh you can pray a he 11 records you can pray 23 records you can pray more you can play less there isn't any specific number for taraweeh the Prophet eraser and prayed 11 and some narrations he prayed 13 so no one can say no you only pray 11 or only prey 13 he did not make a seal into it and and you can do whatever you wish insha'allah draw from saudi hello to you as well I have a question actually it is my mom's concerned my mother she usually has a concern that while reading Quran do we have to wear the hijab okay you have this question because I've heard from you that you said it is not required but she constantly you know she pays me that no you have to cover your heads on the cloud can you please explain everything okay I will examine your welcome she mean from sodium in by and to you as well as ecology Rahim I just wanted to know in my hospital where I was working they were building a mosque they wanted donation for it so I gave a donation for that that was a few years ago thinking that it will be South Korea now that mosque has been demolished and they have turned it into a parking lot does that mean that much of the area is wasted okay inshallah I would ask him thank you yeah Kentucky okay I from Saudi Arabia she says that if a person makes a ombres on behalf of another person what is known as a mortal burden is the person performing the Umrah will he get reward for that the answer is he will get reward for the good deeds he's doing for the care for prayer but he would not get the same reward as of a person who makes a full-fledged Umrah for himself which means that Allah would erase the sins from the first number to the second home run he would not get that because the Ambra is not for himself it's for someone else but he will get some reward for the vicar he makes that this be the salat if he offers a lot of fault in el-haram inshaaallah and her second question was that if a person misses suna tell fetcher is it permissible for him to pray it afterwards when he reaches home or he has to wait until the Sun rises he can do both the Prophet array salatu salam once concluded solitaire fetcher and he saw some of his companions one of his companions praying behind the pillar two Rakas so the Prophet went and stood by him and angrily saying is fetcher 4 is fair for repeating it and the mare was praying so the man concluded his prayer quickly and said o prophet of Allah explaining himself Oh prophet of Allah the the call for the a farmer for the prayer was done while I was home and I did not pray the Toraja of sunnah so i rushed to the masjid and i prayed with you the fault and now i'm making up for the missed sunnah of roger and this was immediate and in the Masjid and after the Salah so the Prophet Isis and did not say anything did not comment which means that this is a sign of approval because we know that the Sunnah of the Prophet is awesome it's either verbal he said do this or don't do that or it is by actions he himself did it or he did not comment on it and this is and known as the Sunnah of approving something so if he saw it and did not comment on it this means that it is permissible therefore whether you pray it in the message after the fort immediately or pray at home when you reach there or you wait until the Sun rises and then you make it up all is permissible inshallah dua from saudi she says that her mother has a problem because it is a cultural thing they have and this culture has nothing to do with Islam so it's part of their culture that whenever they want to read the Quran they wear the hijab and whenever the van is being cold they cover the hair and this is baseless in Islam it has no basis none whatsoever and unfortunately I've seen this in some communities women don't wear the hijab when they go out in the street or when they sit with the cousins and their brothers-in-law they do not wear or abide by the hijab but when the Adana is being called the immediately go and cover the hair and also when they recite the Quran and this is completely distorted way of understanding Islam now DRA is saying can you please give us the lil evidence from the Quran and Sunnah to prove this and I would say it is the other way around it is not us who bring the Delisle from the Quran and Sunnah to prove your mother wrong if she claims that this is part of Islam she is obliged to produce to us the hadith where this is instructed by the Prophet eyes of Salaam because I can come to you now and say it is part of Islam that you pray after Maghrib seven ragas so that three plus seven makes them ten even numbers Wow what did he bring this from so this is from Islam so no this is not from Islam this is beta this is innovation this is totally prohibited I would say what is your Deline now you can't get a Delisle because this is something that is not part of Islam so the Delisle we provide for these people is the lack of or the disability from their side to produce a Delisle backing what they had said so anyone who innovates something in the deen and claims that it is part of Islam we asked them to provide the Delisle from the Quran or from the Sunnah that it is part of the D now when we say that it is not part of the deal we are not required to bring a Delisle because we have the Quran and the Sunnah it's not there so now you claim it is from the Sun or from the Islam you bring us the evidence and from Kenya Amina hello yes mute your television and listen to me from the phone Amina hello yes Amina yeah I'm calling from Kenya my pleasure lives if I brought my son from my Tulsi all the funds going far away and then because I have a young child a lady whom I cannot live in the house alone can my country old son with me in my house at home in train fare away because I cannot live her a young lady alone and I want to pray to Allah and I wanted my young son with the hospital in the prayer with you Allah okay Shamim from Saudi is saying that the hospital he used to work for requested donations to build the Masjid so he gave donations hoping that this is a sadaqa jariya a continuous charity and lately or recently discovered that they demolished the Masjid that they had built after a few years and now it's a carpark so does this mean that his soul is gone and answer is yes unless the sadaqa was transferred to somewhere else then it's not ongoing anymore and al-ahzar would not have any volume on you he will reward you but to build a message it it has to be full-fledged Masjid in order for it to be a sabotage area what people do by building a prayer hole or a prayer room or contributing and doing this in a mall for example or in a shopping center or in a hospital or in their offices this is not a message it because I corporate decision could change it into another office or another store therefore this is not a full-fledged message it but you are rewarded for what you have contributed now usually if it was a real Masjid they cannot demolish it without the instruction and the clearance from the Muslim judge who would let them relocate another Masjid in a similar area so if this took place and the hospital did this then insha'Allah your sonica is still going share the yarn from Gambia mute your television and listen to me from the phone please yes Diane yes your question please yes Fe mute your phone mute your TV and listen to me from the phone okay what I want to ask is that you know in our country we don't have a human about this month of ramadhan okay this is day of the Ramadan because whenever we see when we normally fast nobody you know we nobody fast I would answer the question insha'Allah he I would answer the question Amina from Kenya says that she has two children one of them is half of masha'Allah he memorizes the Quran and a younger one in the home and she wants to let her son lead her in prayer in taraweeh instead of him going to the masjid this is wrong first of all praying tell me and the message is not mandatory so if practice Islam correctly not because you want to pray tell we you prevent him from going with the congregation with the Gemara and being with the Muslims so I would if he does he's not sinful and you're not sinful but this is a lower level the best level for him to do is to go and pray with the Imam and to conclude his prayer with the Imam and he goes back home and then he may lead you in whatever prayers you wish him to lead you but he should not pray another Sarah a Witcher because The Witcher he prayed with the Imam is sufficient he must not pray to withers in one night so he can pray 2 rakaats two Rakas two Rakas endlessly until you are through then you pray on your own your water chef Diane from Gambia says that every year we have the same argument about the beginning of the month of Ramadan and I didn't need to listen to the rest of the question because of the he was on and I was able to hear the echoing like wise for most of the callers and they should try their level best that once they are on the phone they mute the TV and listen to us from the phone so that we do not waste time repeating the same message again so he's saying that some people began Ramadan with following Mecca sighting and some of us go personally to sight the moon and fast accordingly Aki Gambia to my knowledge and correct him of if I'm wrong it's a Muslim country and it's led by a Muslim ruler so he is the only person who has the power and authority to decide he may say no we begin with Mecca Halas you begin Makkah the whole Muslim community must begin with Makkah and he may he may say no we would like to have moon sighting and then you have to follow whatever he says I mean from Bahrain and that's the last caller hello Santa ma I shake I have one question yes see in JAMA and there is a Sunnah that if you want to pray aha job you should do not pray Whittle so my question is whether I should continue praying Yama curavi for the Widder and then before yes okay your question is very common and it's very good people who would like to increase in their night prayer so they pray with the Imam the taraweeh now they know that they were going to go home and finish more prayers on their own so they have two choices and two options one to finish the full prayer with the Imam and when he offers Salam from the whitter they stand up to add an extra raka so the total rock as they had prayed with the Imam would be 12 the man prayed 11 they had pray 12:00 and then when they go home they pray as many as they wish and then they conclude that with whitter option 2 and this is more preferred to me is that they pray with the imam and when he concludes his prayer from whitter day of also pray with her and conclude their prayer when they go home they may pray as many tahajud as they wish but without repeating the whitter again so they only pray even numbers - - - - until they are satisfied why is this better than the first option because the first option would probably open the door for Shaitaan when everybody is offering serum after whitter and you are the only one who stands up to bring another raka as if you're saying holding the flag look at me I am going to pray home to head jute I'm better than you and this opens the door for Shaytan to make you boastful and look at yourself and admire yourself more than them and this is wrong so my recommendation would be that you conclude your prayer with the Imam and when you go home you pray 2 rakaats 2 rakaats without offering another with you and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet you tomorrow same time and insha'Allah with a continuation of this hadith maybe another hadith depending on the information they tell us whether they had aired the first segment or not then we will see you same time same place until then I live with him and Allah was salam aliekum wa know how to LA he I'm beyond happy and blessings beyond"
