  "transcript": "So if I'm in a congregational prayer and uh the imam prays in different way like let's say the imam does not include certain like you know voluntary acts in the prayer but I do is that permissible for me to do congregational pray? Yes it is permissible for you to follow the sunnah even if your imam skips it. So for example, if the imam does not do like the skip it, you can do it. If your im does not say mean, you can say it. If the imam does not point his index finger, you can do that. If your imam does not spread his arms when making prostration and the likes, you can do that. If he doesn't do tawaruk in the last sitting, you can do that without any problem."
