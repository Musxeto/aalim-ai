  "transcript": "um I had a question about um a man who was physically capable and has the strength wants to pray sitting or lying down does he have to do a Roku or standing up and to do like on the floor or can he do the recurrence like Quran to do it like by lowering his head uh Lord is HE capable of standing up yeah he's capable of standing up okay first of all it is not permissible for a person who's capable of standing up to pray for prayers the five fourth prayers sitting down his prayer is invalid zero why because one of the first pillars of prayer is to stand up when you're able in thought prayer so if you're able to stand up and you said nope I'll take a rain check I'm gonna sit down your prayer is invalid there's no dispute in that Point number two if this is a voluntary prayer then you have the option either to pray it's standing up and being accredited for the full reward or pray sitting down and you'll have half of the reward of a person standing up so I wake up for night prayer for tahajud I'm too old I'm too lazy I'm this I just sit down and pray sitting down no problem my prayer is valid it's voluntary prayer it's not fought but I have half of the reward because I'm capable of standing up lying down this is totally unacceptable whether you are capable of standing or not as long as you're capable of sitting if you're unable to stand up nor to sit down then you go to stage three which is lying down how does a person sitting down prostrate like normal people you prostate on the ground how do they make rukur you have an option one of two either to stand up and make record like the prophet used to do Allah or to lean down a bit forward like this while sitting down on the floor you go for your prostration as for the person lying down it depends on his condition so likewise if he's lying on his back with his feet towards the Qibla and this is a response to those when they see people sitting in the Masjid extending their feet towards Haram this is not true this is totally Bogus the juror said that those who cannot stand or sit or they're lying down praying they should lie down with their feet towards the Qibla where is the Haram in that there's no problem in it there's no disrespect in it so they make Ruku and sujud according to the best of their ability and how they are seated or lying down on Allah Knows Best"
