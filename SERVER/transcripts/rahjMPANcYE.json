  "title": "Can I eat groceries left behind by a shoplifter friend? Ruling on using stolen items assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sh I used to live with one of my friend and he used to do shoplifting for groceries so suppose if he did a shopping of $100 he would only play pay $50 so now he left the house but he uh left back some uh groceries like oil sugar uh almonds and everything and I do not know if those are stolen or paid for so is it permissible for me to use those if you know that your friend is a shoplifter and he's a thief how could you live with someone like that and consume the groceries he bring this is not permissible and hence whatever he brought to the house of his own not from your money but of his own you have to dispose of that and give it to charity because you don't know if it's stolen or not and as you say 50% of it is stolen how I don't know how you could even have a friend like this may Allah protect us"
