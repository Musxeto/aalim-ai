  "transcript": "I found the light after those long dark nights. Now my world is bright. Islam is my sight. Now I found the light. After those long dark nights, now my world is bright. Islam is my welcome to the straight path. I'm your host Fuad Muhammad. Every Muslim should be ideal in whatever job he or she undertakes in this life. An ideal Muslim not only helps himself but helps the community to be ideal. And they're very different individuals who tries to be ideal. And one is it is the family. But who is the head of the family? The husband. And that is why we choose today's topic to be the ideal Muslim husband. And the person who we're going to discuss this with is no other than she alsum. Thank you for having me. We've chosen this topic because we have the ideal person to speak about it. Okay, we're talking about the ideal husband, the ideal Muslim husband. In our previous episodes, we mentioned about the ideal family, bringing up the kids, um ty, we also talked in some of the pre our previous episodes of being the ideal wife, but we've never really touched the topic of being the ideal man, the ideal husband. We've and the ideal father of the family. Um let us look at the stage before marriage when a woman is looking for a husband. What are the qualities she look for in a man to be the ideal husband for her? And we're talking from an Islamic perspective. Okay. It's very good that you've said from an Islamic perspective because I would have answered you by saying he's a knight in his shining armor. So that would be on his white horse. That would be the ideal husband. Mhm. See, the problem is our society is so influenced by the media that it has this vague way of looking at things and it's clouded. Their vision is clouded. They can't see clearly through the fog. Now, Islamically speaking, the prophetat wasam mentioned two conditions that a person is practicing and you accept his religion. You accept his level of practicing and the second condition is his behavior, his manners, his conduct and his ethics. Mhm. So if these two were fulfilled then he would be the right husband the ideal husband. Now this having said that does not mean we should neglect anything else. Mhm. But these come on the surface on the top and everything else comes or follows afterwards. But what the Muslims are doing nowadays is the other way around. Yes. So the first thing they check about his his education, his bank account, whether he has a good job or not, how does he look, what family does does he come from? And then at the very end, oh yes, before we leave, does he pray? Mhm. So this is the wrong way of looking at things. Okay. Um so what when a when when a young girl is thinking about marriage and when we talked about in the episode about the child upbringing we said one of the first rights of the child upon his mother is to choose the ideal father especially in today's world we are only speaking about the young people growing up now and of course we know many of the women now are studying in universities um they're academic they're professionals um what are your advice to sisters when they're looking for that ideal person what are some of the qualities they look for especially in today's world and how can they really recognize those qualities I believe that it all revolves around these two characteristics that the prophet mentioned because analyze this a marriage has an understanding so I would ask this girl who is looking for an ideal husband what are you looking for when she lists down her demands and requests, you definitely find that they are not realistic. Mhm. Now, she wants him to be 23 years old. Mhm. With a PhD, which usually people when they're 27 or 28 years old, maybe they can achieve that. And he has a prominent managerial job, preferably CEO, if not a VP would do. Mhm. a big uh uh fat salary paycheck at the end of the month, a big mansion, uh a driver, couple of cars, um uh beach house, a boat, it what is this? Mhm. This is what they think of an ideal husband. Mhm. But they don't look beyond the tip of their noses. Look a little bit further. A man with such attributes, he would cheat on you. He's not going to be loyal to you. He's not going to get this wealth except from wrongdoings. So, is this the man you want? Yeah. Yeah. He has to be also, mashallah, an imam and a scholar. And what is this? This might be found in paradise. Yes. And if Allah is willing, but not on this world. So, I always tell my daughters when they're they're in their marrying age, what do you want in a husband? What I feel that you should look for uh in a husband is one who loves you, who respects you, who fears Allah when dealing with you. Why is that? It's very simple. Because if he's happy with you, he'll cherish you and love you. And if he's unhappy with you, he will not do you wrongdoings. He will be fair. He will not be unjust with you because he fears Allah. So, this is the win-win situation for me as a father. I'd love to choose for my child someone who would respect her, who would love her, and who would try his best to make her happy. Now, he may be rich and he may be not. He may be fairly, you know, well off and he might might be poor. Now, do I have to give my daughter to someone who is poor? Is she obliged to choose someone who could barely put food on the table? No, of course not. Allahel told us that the men are the guardians of women because of what Allah has blessed them and because their provisions because they're providing for the family. So if they cannot provide for the family, then they don't have the guardianship over the women. But having said that, I don't have to go to extreme in the sense that he has to be multi-millionaire. Mhm. Anyone who is well off, he who could open a house and support a family and who is practicing and at the same time who enjoys being a good uh um character, who has a good character, good ethics, well behaved, good conduct. This would be the ideal husband. Yeah. And as you mentioned there, you encourage telling your daughters, it's it's a very big role for the parents, especially in these times. They put a lot of pressure on their daughters, especially fathers and mothers. They put a lot of pressure on the daughters in terms of making that choice. Unfortunately, it's true. Now, if you have a a son, it's much easier for him to pick and choose. When it comes to the daughter, they're racing against the clock. Mhm. because the more they're the older they are then the lesser chances of them being uh or getting the nice or the suitable spouse. Mhm. Maybe in the west it's different, but where I come from in Arabia, if a girl is 18 or 19 years old and she's not married, she's, you know, being frightened. She's panicking. Mhm. Because getting married at at an early age for girls is not like getting married at an early age for boys. Mhm. And and that is why some parents make the mistake of pressuring their kids. And this is wrong. And some go to the extreme of forcing their girls to get married. Even if the girl is not interested or does not want to do that now, they still force her to get married. And this is a sin and it's forbidden. Okay. So we look at the perspective from the girls. Let us look at the perspective of a young man growing up now. Um 15 16 just out of secondary school going into university. What are some of the things he has to do from now if he wants to be the ideal person in the future? What are some steps he takes? Well, among the very first is to be a practicing Muslim. Mhm. So definitely the more you are practicing and you follow the Quran and Sunnah, the more your life is blessed, the more everyone around you is blessed and they're touched by your righteousness. Allahel blesses a person who's practicing and everyone around him. So the minute this young boy is practicing and following the Quran and the authentic sunnah to the letter and going uh acquiring knowledge from uh scholars and students of knowledge trying to please Allah, Allah will make everyone pleas with him first of all. Mhm. Second of all, he has to be considerate. He has to know that as he has rights, others have rights as well. Yes. So once you look into the mirror and you see your own shortcomings and your disadvantages, you realize that no one is perfect. And this makes life much much easier. When I look at my wife's shortcomings, I never get angry why she did not cook the food well or why was it full of salt. I don't get angry with my wife when the house is not tidy or clean. I don't get angry with my wife when she does not iron my clothes. Why am I I'm just a normal person like everyone else? simply because I look at my own shortcomings and I look at the things that my wife has to live up with and then I start appreciating my wife and say, \"Wow, if she can cope up with me and I'm a bad person with all my shortcomings, then the least I could do is cope up with her and appreciate the good things in her which overwhelms the the shortcomings.\" Okay, let's go back to the to the young person growing up and wanting to be that ideal husband as well. Um the concept is out there now and I many of the youths they complain of this. They said for the young man he says okay I'm going to have a beard after marriage. Okay I'm going to wear I'm going to have my trousers cut after marriage and same thing for the girls but as we're concentrating on the boys they said girls don't look at us it's going to be difficult for us to find a wife. How do you respond to these uh these questions and and comments from the young from the young guys that the young Muslims? We have an Arabic saying that for every apple that falls from a tree, there's someone to pick it up. So if it's a red beautiful apple, a healthy person would come and eat it. But if it's a dirty rotten apple, the worms will come or the animals will come and collect it. Mhm. So this allegation is not acceptable. It's not valid. When they say that we have to be uh not practicing so that women would accept us or girls would accept us. Yes, girls like you would accept you. But if a person like you goes to a practicing girl who is wearing the hijab fully, who's practicing, praying on time, not listening to music, not uh mixing with the opposite sex, obeying her parents, trying her best to uh give out uh uh leaflets and and booklets to people, calling them to Islam, giving charity, praying night prayer, fasting Mondays and Thursdays. If some like this person proposes to her, she would definitely refuse him. So he would not be an ideal husband. And we are faced with a lot of similar scenarios where the father gives me a call and says, \"She my daughter is like I've just described and this boy proposed to her. He comes from a very good family. He's very rich. He's very well off. He's got mashallah a good job, a nice car, a a big house, but he works in a bank. Mhm. And my daughter refuses him though. He say is handsome. He's nice looking. What should I do? I said definitely this is not the suitable man for this girl for your daughter because I know personally I know a lot of families that started like this and I know for sure that the women are living in hell. I know a lot of uh uh callers to Islam. Women nice uh uh educated mashallah women with lots of children. They're in their 40s or 50s calling others to Islam, giving dus, giving lectures, but their husbands are making them live in hell because they are not practicing. And who was responsible? The father when he pressured his daughter. No, no, no. You marry him, inshallah, Allah will guide him. You will be the source of his guidance. And instead, this is the result of such a marriage. Okay, let us look at the time of marriage. Now um of course we don't want to go into when that person they agree to marry the ideal husband in the very first couple of years of marriage. Most in most cases it is out of um children. There's no children in the first couple years of marriage. Um how does he behave? How does he build his relationship with his wife? There is no procedure manual that they should follow. Mhm. In order to have a good marriage, the husband must respect his wife. Yes. And he must cherish and love his wife. And of course, the wife is obliged to do the same. But I'm not talking about the wife's role. I'm talking about the husband. The husband should be loving and caring. The husband should be considering. He he has to be considerate in the sense that he only looks at himself whenever his wife is upset. He says, \"Listen, I spent nine hours at work and then I went for a couple hours shopping for the groceries and I have debts to pay. I have bills to pay.\" And all what you do is nag that you're alone at the house. You need someone to talk. I need my time. I need my space. M so everyone looks at his own needs and desires. Uh ideal husband is not like that. He is giving all of his life to his wife. He works and he's happy while he's working because he knows that this puts the food on the table so his wife and children would eat from. When he goes back home, he's considerate. He looks at this wife who was waiting patiently for him, cooking the food for him, cleaning the house for him, and he knows that she needs recreation. She needs someone to talk to, to uh um put her head on his shoulder and complain about things that bother her, bother her. She has feelings and he respects these feelings. It's not like they say men are from Venus and women are from Mars and they're from different uh uh planets. No, this is not true. They are different. But men should be considerate. They should always care for their their wives. Having said that, it is not normal to expect that everyone, every husband in the first couple of years would be a don Jan or uh he would always cook the food for his uh wife, beloved wife um have a candle light uh dinner and maybe bring a violinist to play for him against Islam of course but you cannot expect the man and so ideal to be like this. Okay. But the least he could do is to be considerate. Okay. You mentioned the husband should be loving and uh this is a question that is asked repetitively. What's the meaning of love? But we'll take a short break inshallah and we'll be back right after this. Now my world is bright. Islam is my sight. [Music] Earth, the human heart, greed, exploitation, hatred, all diseases of the heart. For the cure, join Huda TV every Sunday at 20 GMT for Moments for the Heart. [Music] D my world is bright. Welcome back. You're watching the straight path. Our topic today, the ideal Muslim husband. Um, you mentioned the husband should be loving. Um, and then we hear a lot of people saying that, \"Oh, but love doesn't exist.\" What does love between a husband and a wife means in Islam? Well, this is quite tricky. Mhm. I wish and I hope that my wives are not watching this cuz then I'm going to be be battered uh alive. See, love in the minds of people is the interpretation of the relationships they find in novels and movies. Mhm. The romantic scenarios. It's even worse than romantic scenarios. It's the feeling that one gets. So people think that love is when my wife is not present. I feel stomach ache, nausea. I I'm I'm I'm restless. I have to see my wife and and embrace her and then ah I found love again. Mhm. Well, this is fictional. Mhm. This has nothing to do with love. The prophetat wasallam was the greatest lover and his wives loved him a lot and he loved them a lot and he used to love may Allah be pleased with her the most of all women. Yet when you look at how he used to treat her, this is an clear illustration of true love. It's the respect. It's the kindness and tenderness in dealing. The prophet wasallam whenever she used to take a bone with meat cooked of course and she would eat it. He would take it and he would eat from the same place that she had her bite from. Whenever she drank from a cup, he would put his lips in the same location. I know spouses whenever his wife eats with a a spoon and he goes say go and get a new one and he refuses to use the same spoon of his wife. And when asked, I said, \"Are you crazy? She just ate from it. I ain't going to eat from this.\" And as if she is, you know, with a disease or an illness, this is the love we're talking about. I met, well, actually, I was not met. I was stopped. Mhm. While driving once with this by this man. Mhm. Who gave me high beams and and and and horning. And I went out of the car, you know, wanting to go for a fight. What is this guy crazy? And he was one of the people that pray in my masid. And then I started being calm and and soft again. And he said, \"She, I have a problem.\" Said, \"What's your problem?\" And I was in the middle of the road. He said, \"I have I've been married for two years and my wife is is so devoted to me. She's loving, she's caring, she's kind, but I want to divorce her.\" Subhan Allah. Why is that? I don't know. She I I don't have this love for her. And I said, \"Subhan Allah, is she bad to you?\" He said, \"No, my house is beautiful. It's clean. My child, I have a one-year-old child is always tidy and clean and she is always taking care of herself and she is going out of her way just to please me, but I don't have this love. Mhm. I said wall my friend, the only thing I could do is take my shoe and beat you with it. Mhm. You not you crazy person. And he said, he was startled, why is that, sheh? I said, \"Are you crazy? You have a jewel in your house. I bet you, of course, betting is not permissible in Islam, but it's a figure of speech. I challenge you that you spend your time watching soap, opas, movies, and video clips, songs, and and MTV and the likes of.\" And he said, \"Yes, I work for 10 hours every day, and this is only recreation I have at my work.\" Yes, I do do this. I said, don't you fear Allah? This is what's corrupting your h your household. This is what's destroying your marriage because you see things and you imagine that marriage and love is like what you see and it's definitely not what you see. This what your wife is doing to you is the true love. And this is what the prophetam used to do. may Allah be peace with her tells us that whenever he enters the house he would not sit on his couch put a leg over the other with the remote control and watch movies. He would be servicing his wife and he was he would patch his th was fix he would fix his shoes. He would milk the goat the prophet himself. He would do this because he appreciates the work she's doing and he's contributing. This is the love we looking for. Okay. I just want to take you back as well. Age gap um is something that is talked about especially in the west and it's they really talk against the Muslim Muslim countries about it. What is the ideal age gap between a man and a woman? There isn't any. Mhm. It's as simple as that. The I would be lying to you if I say that it should be 5 years, 10 years, 30 years. There isn't any suitable age gap. You could get married to someone who's the same age as you and she would be the silliest person on earth. Mhm. And you can marry someone who's 20 years younger than you and she would be the most sensible person on earth. It depends. People vary. The prophetam when he married Khadijah, may Allah be pleased with her, she was about 15 or 20 years older than him and they had the perfect marriage. Mhm. To the extent that Allahel sent the archangel Gibl peace be upon him to the prophetam while he was sitting with Khadijah and he said oh khadijah Allah had sent Gabriel and Gibl says assalamu alaykum and he is giving you the glad tidings of a house like a big pearl in paradise where there is no tiredome and there is no shouting two Mhm. So one would ask why is that? What's so special? Well, because she never raised her voice or caused any of her children to raise their voicees in the house of the prophetam which meant that he was always comfortable and tidy and at the same time she would not make him work at the house. So Allah substituted her. Allah rewarded her with this big house or palace in paradise made of pearl. a big pearl with which does not have these two things in it. Okay, let's look at the quality of patience for the ideal husband. Um, no one is ideal as we said but we're just talking about if at least the husband can grasp and we as husbands can grasp what most of these qualities inshallah then will be as close as ideal to as possible. Um the idea the the idea of patience um man has a man having a wife that is nagging all the time. She's nagging all the time. um how does he how does he balance it out? What are some of the stages he does in terms of correcting his wife and the ideal husband as well can be the person who divorces his wife at the ideal time right if it's not working if you can quickly shed some light on this first of all let me rephrase or correct in my opinion okay what you have said that there's no ideal husband there is the prophet is the ideal husband without any doubt and A um a sensible husband has to weigh things. Ahmed Hal, may Allah have mercy on his soul when he got married to his wife and he got married late. Mhm. He spoke to her and told her, listen, let's agree on something. If you see me flared up, you calm down and don't talk. And if I see you flare up and angry and and agitated, I would not talk to you until you come down. He said, \"I remained with her for 20 years, and we never quarreled at all except once and I was the aggressor.\" Mhm. He's he's saying how good this wife was. So, it's always best to communicate. A woman would not reach the stage of nagging and continuous nagging every single day like seven 10 times a day unless the husband from the very beginning did not set the rules and did not communicate. So by neglecting your wife, by ignoring her feelings and her needs, this calls her to nag or by submitting to her nagging, she feels that this is the right way of solving things. So an ideal husband would look and control his house because after all, he's the man. Mhm. And if roles were reversed, then you have a problem. The marriage would not go on. The prophetat wasallam, the perfect man once was at the house of may Allah be pleased with her and came in a servant with a plate of food from Safia. Mhm. May Allah be pleased with her, the second wife of the prophetam. And he was at the house of And the servant came to give the food to the prophetam. Isa was outraged and this was before the hijab. Mhm. And there were people at the house. Aisha went to the servant and hit the plate. The plate fell in the air, fell down, broke, and the food was scattered. Now I tell you, 99.9% of the men I know, if an incident like this takes place, the first thing he would say, \"My wife, you're divorced.\" Because this is an insult in front of everybody. She's not respecting me. Shah blah blah blah. This was the prophetam. Yet what did he do? He went and he looked at the gatherings. He said your mother Aisha is jealous. So this is he's giving her justifications and he went and collected the foodallatam and he gave his ruling. He said a dish for a dish and he took one of the dishes of Aisha and gave it back as compensation to the dish that was broken of Sopia. Mhm. Now this is the act of a man of a real man who knows how to observe this an uh absorb this anger and at the same time control the effects of it. Yeah. And it's also balancing it out because uh he didn't totally submit to her because uh he said you he said he took her dish and this this had established that he is the one who is responsible. Yes. And and and she has to pay for it. Mhm. And that's why the prophet made it clear for the those around uh uh him that she did this out of jealousy yet this is normal. Women are jealous by nature. So he did not uh um reprimand her for that. But as a form of being fair, you cause this dish to uh uh get broken, you have to pay uh the compensation. Okay, we're still on on the um the the the we're still on on patience as a matter of fact. Um but we also said that the ideal person, the ideal husband as well divorces at the right time. When to what extent can he allow his wife to behave in such a manner? Divorce is a very critical thing in Islam. The ideal husband tries his way to correct any wrongdoings of his wife. Mhm. And the first thing as mentioned in the Quran in three stages. The ideal husband who's the man who's the captain of the boat. If he sees things that are not in the right position, he gives advice to his wife. He constantly remind her, giving her advice because the easiest thing for a man to do to divorce. Mhm. So if I have a problem, she's divorced. End of story. Let's marry another one. But Islam does not promote this. Islam promotes protecting the house, protecting the marriage because this is the nucleus of a society, a Muslim society. So if she is doing something that does not fall into place, Islam tells the husband to advise her. So I keep on advising her, trying to bring sense into her, remind her of Allah, of her duties, of the punishment that Allah has made, the reward of those who are patient. And I'm patient with her. If this doesn't work, Allah says go to stage two. And stage two is to avoid her, not have any intimacy, no intimate relationship with the wife. And usually normal wives, this is a punishment because the affection that the husband shows to his wife usually happens there. So if he abandons her and gives her her back and does not pay any attention to her for a period of time, this is a great punishment that might bring her back to her senses. If this goes on, and I'm talking if this goes on for a week or two, advising her for a month or two, not if this goes on in the same day. I advise her in the morning, I didn't go to bed with her in the evening, and at night I'm going to spank her. No, this is not the the way you give everything. It's a proportion. the last and third stage. If all of these advising and and and neglecting her do not pay off, Islam, the Quran tells us to spank them. But the prophet tells us do not spank the face, do not break a bone, do not shed uh uh blood, which is something negligible. It's like bringing the toothbrush and just, you know, spanging her on her hand. This is a punishment. Mhm. But unlike what they say in the west, this is abuse. Well, Islam looks at the greater cause and benefit which is protecting the marriage. Now if you go to any divorcee, any woman who divorced, would of you uh uh um preferred that your husband spanked you on your hand and reprimanded you so that he would bring you back to her senses or what you're doing now in living as a divorced woman. I bet well again betting is not in Islam. I challenge you that 99% would have said I wish that things would not have come to what they are now at the moment. Yeah. But during this whole process, how does the man behave with the woman? He treats her with anger or he be or is he because when a woman and it's a human thing in us as well that when a woman behaves in such a way how does the man what what face he shows to his wife when he's going through these processes. First of all, the prophet wasallam advised us and said, \"Fear Allah in your wives because they are like prisoners in your houses.\" And this is the fact. Wives are like prisoners. They can't go without our permission. They cannot do things without their permission. They're obliged by Islam to seek our pleasure so that Allah would reward them paradise. So we have to not we must not take advantage of this and uh uh abuse them. If my wife is treating me badly, the easiest thing for me as I said is to divorce or to spank or to be abusive. Yes. But this is not the ideal husband. The prophet said, \"The strong person is not a good wrestler or a good fighter. The strong person, the actual true strong person is the one who refrains from being angry and who controls himself in times of anger. She's a woman. Mhm. And the easiest thing I could do is slap her on her face. But this is not a man who does this. May Allah be pleased with her. And may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet alisam never ever spanked or hit or beat a woman or a child. Subhan Allah. Subhan Allah. We continue to talk of some more characteristic of the ideal husband here on the straight path, but we'll take a short break and we'll be back right after this. Now my world is bright. Islam is my sight. [Music] We are excited to inform our viewers that the Quran in depth with Sheikh Ibraim Zidan will be filmed live starting on Mondays at 1800 GMT. Allahh says about the Quran that we reveal from the Quran what is cure and mercy to the believers. So the Quran is the cure. Cure physically to the diseases physically in the body and in the heart. We were ordered to recite fat and every time we stand in the salah pillar of the salah we need to change our life according to what Allah subhana wa tala wants from us. According to this book as the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that the Quran is the thing between us and Allah subhanaa tala. Whoever hold fast to it he would never be led astray. We will take your cause and answer any questions you may have as well as help you in your journey to understand the Quran properly. We hope you will join Huda TV and she Ibrahim Zidan every Monday from 18,800 GMT until 1900 GMT for the Quran in depth. [Music] Now my world is bright. Islam is my welcome back. You're watching the straight path. Our topic today, the ideal husband and we're discussing it with Alimman Alim from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So we talk about the the the characteristic of patience. Okay. Many men today as well when it comes to the family and the responsibility of the family and the children they place it on the wife. How does the ideal husband support his wife in the upbringing of kids? We cannot neglect the role of the man in the house. Mhm. The woman by nature is kind and merciful. So she gives a lot of love to her children. Mhm. She gives a lot of consideration. She's tutoring them. She's taking care of them. She's so fragile. And that is why the prophetat wasallam when asked whom should I seek with my best companionship? The prophet said your mother. And then he said then who? He said your mother. And then I said okay then who? Your mother. The the guy wanted to know what's the end of it and then said then who? The prophet said your father. So the mother has a great role but the the father has an extremely big role as well because he's the one who disciplines the children. He's the one that they fear. Well, let me rephrase that. He's the one that the children respect most. And that is why he has to have a say in how things are. So many times the mother is emotional. She would say that come on allow the children to do this or allow them to do that. Let them spend the night here or there. The husband is the one with the proper judgment. So he's the one to say yes or no. He has to contribute but his contribution would not be compared to the mother's contribution. Therefore, it would not be fair to say that well, he should have 50% of uh the upbringing of the children as the mother would have the other 50%. This is not logical because he spends most of his times outside of the house. Maybe he would not get the time to spend with the children except an hour a day. An hour would be great. And that is why the ideal husband tries his best to assign quality time to spend with his children. Now I hope that I'm not being a hypocrite by saying this because I am the most person who is in need for such an advice. Mhm. Unfortunately, it is not sometimes possible. It depends on the people's obligations. And again one would say and I I can hear this echoing in my ear. My wife saying that your kids have rights over you. It is not only traveling and giving lectures and making da and this is true. But I always answer her by saying and that is why I chose you. I made the the the wisest decision possible to take care of a great deal of the things that I cannot do. Yet this is not an excuse. Mhm. We as men, as husbands, we have to spend quality time with with our children, with our wives and to do some of the obligations Allahel entrusted us with. Okay. Mentioning of quality time, what does it mean recreation? Does it mean sitting and chatting? How do you how does a husband spend time spend time with his wife and his children? I'm gonna avoid the children because children is is is is a big topic. I remember one uh wise person was talking to me and said that listen when your children are 6 7 8 years of age they run after you so that you sit with them but when they're 15 16 or 17 you running after them because they have their own friends. Now I'm not going to talk about the children. I'm going to talk about the wife. Mhm. The wife, even if she's a righteous person and a practicing person, she needs a shoulder to lean on. She needs to feel the husband's support. And the quality time would be, and you'll be surprised, maybe two or three days on your own and consider it to be a honeymoon. As Muslims, we believe the whole year is honey. and and and and we don't need to celebrate our anniversary or so on because we respect and love our wives throughout the whole our whole lives. But it is very important to spend quality time with your wife that gives her a boast for a couple of years. And you try this. If you take her to a hotel room, just you and her for two or three nights, preferably in Mecca or Medina if you can afford this. I can because it's next door with the grace of Allah. But taking her down to the restaurant to have breakfast or better more bring her breakfast in her bed, trying to do whatever you can to please her, to uh remind her of the beautiful days at the very beginning of your marriage. These days you spend with her, these quality time uh you you spend with her will give her a boost for a couple of years more in advance. But we neglect this. Mhm. We're so busy with what we do, with our work, with our hobbies, with our sports, with our researches, and and some of the things that we're occupied with, they might be legitimate and and and rewardable at the side of Allah, but we have to know uh the priorities every now and then. Okay. Let us look into the the ideal husband in the home a bit more as well. Um many uh Muslim men see it as as as something that is um a challenge to their manhood when they help the wife to do the dishes, maybe to to clean the the house. Um what is the to what extent can the husband play the role of of helping his wife in the home? Well, I've mentioned uh a while ago that the prophetam as described by may Allah be pleased with her when she was asked how was the prophet inside the house sallallahu alaihi wasallam and she said he was in the service of his family. He used to patch or sew his his his stove. He used to fix his sandals. He used to milk the goat. He used he used to work in the household. So this was the greatest man ever walked the earth. M and nobody doubted his manhood. Mhm. Yet because of our narrow way of looking at things, we think that doing the dishes would be an insult to us. Subhan Allah. The prophet didn't look at it this way. We shouldn't. We can't justify our laziness by saying we're lazy, but we don't have to say or justify it by saying, \"Well, it's against my manhood. I'm not a man.\" Well, you would walk on your knees and and hands if you have to if to get an extra dollar on your paycheck or to get overtime or to get a bonus and you would accept humiliation for worldly matters. Why not accept not humiliation but participation at the house so that you bring joy to your wife? Okay, let's look at the ideal husband in terms of the wife parents. This is a question we in in in in our fatawa program which you've been with um many times the wife keep asking that my wife my my husband prevents me from meeting my parents. How should a husband behave with his wife towards her family and how does the husband as well behave towards the wife family? An ideal husband is a considerate husband as the husband loves to see his parents, his siblings, his family and visit them probably once or twice a week and maybe have a gathering or Friday lunch at his parents' house. He also has have he also has to be considerate of his wife's feelings because they also have a gathering every week at one of her siblings houses or her parents' house. Mhm. So he should allow her to go. He should treat her as a jewel. No matter what I feel about my wife, no matter how many disputes we have internally, the minute we go to her uh uh parents' house, I flatter her. I say so many good things about her to bring joy to her parents' hearts. Mhm. Thinking that, wow, mashallah, our daughter is living in paradise. Look at this caring husband. Look at this loving husband. This is an ideal husband. Now, a husband who is not like this is a nightmare. I know a lot of men who would go to their uh uh in-laws houses and they would spend 6 hours complaining of their wives. She did this, she did that, she doesn't know how to do this, she's ignorant, she is so and so, she's filthy, she's not clean. And this would depress his in-laws. And he seems to enjoy this. He seems to be like a vampire living on such blood. And and and this is not a man. Believe me, he is not a man. A man, a true man who would bring joy to his in-laws hearts. And what's between me and the wife stays at the house. And she appreciates this. And she thinks of that husband as someone that she should try her level best to please because someone who treats her like this in front of her family should be uh uh respected more and treated better. Okay, we're coming to the close of the episode. Um quickly, myself and many of the brothers might look be looking at you and listening to all what you were saying and mashallah. Um but they're saying, \"Okay, she I've not really been that ideal husband. um how can I make the change? I want to make my the change right now. Um what are some of the steps I would I have to take in order to be that ideal husband that you've just mentioned in the episode? Well, first of all, my advice would be put your shoes in your wife's shoes and don't look look don't let anybody look at you because then they'll think bad things about you. What I meant is how would you want your husband to treat you if you were the wife and do it exactly? You will find that you have to be more loving. There's nothing wrong in buying flowers when going back home tonight to your wife and just giving it to her. There's nothing wrong whenever you travel and come back from buying her a nice gift, taking her taking her out for dinner. When was the last time you took your wife for dinner on your own? There's nothing wrong in trying to look in the mirror and see your shortcomings and see what she has to live up with and then appreciate her. Try your best to bring joy and love because after your death, she'll be praying for you and she'll be supplicating for you and she'll she'll be seeking Allah's forgiveness for you. Okay, I think that mashallah is what we we should end the episode with and we do hope that Allah subhana t accept us all to be ideal Muslim husbands inshallah and for being on the episode today al-Hakim they're from the United from the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
