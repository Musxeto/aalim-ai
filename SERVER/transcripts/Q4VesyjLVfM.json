  "transcript": "i think we had a long break and hopefully that we will be able to move on to the characteristics of [Music] a husband now it is the time for the ladies to have fun first characteristic that are required in a man and each one of us must you not utilize scrutinize himself and see does he fit these conditions because i believe the last session you were only nodding your head and looking down whenever i mention the quality of the wife i said nope nope nope everything is no so now you're thinking am i leading a happy life should i continue in this marriage before you take a decision let's check your checklist yourself so among the characteristics of a husband he should have moral conduct and good character and what is meant by moral conduct and good character he should be a nice person to live with there are certain characteristics in an individual that makes it very difficult to do so i have friends among my friends there are people that are so sensitive i do not want to be friends with them jani some of my good friends now alhamdulillah managed to change them with the grace of allah but it was very difficult at the beginning because after every time we meet when i go home i receive a phone call you said this and this was not appropriate you know i i had it in me i had to tell you about it i felt very sad because you said this joke or because i'm looking at the guys he's not looking at me because the phone why are you doing this so i feel guilty whenever i sit with him i am always conscious of let me not say anything wrong but then i found out that this is not a good quality i as a person i'm never offended if you come to me and you say share your this you're that and you laugh and you joke about me i'm an easy going person if i don't like it i'm going to tell it to you in your face not instead in in reference to disrespect no no i'm talking about if you make a joke about me that i do not like i'm gonna give you another joke in your face but i'm not gonna go home depressed and when i meet you next time i'm gonna do this to you now i'm gonna plot how can i undermine his work how can i do this and destroy no there are people like this there are people who you feel talking to and that is why the prophet allah said among you you will find the worst of men are those who people avoid being afraid of their foul language or of their evil acts there are people good muslims martial are practicing but when people mention their name say oh don't invite him he's bad company we would like to have you know our comfort and we have to sit we'd like to sit together if he comes he's going to destroy it some husbands are like this no a real husband is easy going if your husband and excuse me husbands if your husband is the one who is picky you're making your wife live in hell i know one of my close friends and relatives when he goes home if he sees something like this he'll go in front of his wife so the wife is always intimidated in fear everything has to be the smallest detail if the wife cooks for three hours in the kitchen and brings the food and happy and puts letters and puts cucumbers in decorating it the first bite is no salt the second bite it's not cooked well the third bite he grabs the dish and he throws it in her face i know this i have i have lots of stories to tell you but i don't want to make the brothers who are not married afraid no let us continue so we ha he has to be in an excellent state of moral conduct and good character give me examples i'll give you examples he has to be generous so generosity is a beautiful attribute in a man and so many i repeat so many of your shortcomings disappear when you're generous now married people when was the last time you brought a gift to your wife less than a month raise your hands masha'allah come on don't don't ah if you if you think and you're okay uh less than two weeks raise your hands the same people are so less than one week masha'allah okay less than six months so we have a problem huh the prophet says taha do in arabic nobody knows arabic tahadu means give exchange gifts to have boo and you will fall in love and this is something i love in the people of india i don't have this huh so please do not do this to me whenever they come and visit me the brothers that come and visit me in my home they've been gifts when i come here they bring me gifts you're making me embarrassed we don't have this culture in saudi arabia we don't exchange gifts the people of india from all types of india they always give me gifts small gifts was very good but this is embarrassing because i cannot repay them for this but this shows you that the muslims of india have love in them because they exchange gifts and allah azza loves them for this so the husband has to be generous now being generous that does not mean that he spends his money unwisely no he being generous to your wife could be very little yanni whenever i travel on the plane there are sales for for um air sales so i get the catalog then i look at the cheapest thing this is only on this one this one and i take two it has to be the same price unfortunately because i don't want to go to hell it's difficult well think about it again huh even the perfumes the five reals difference not good has to be exactly the same so i have to and i bring it to my and they're so happy with this they love it although it's nothing if i see and this is not very often but sometimes you know they sell flowers and you if you run the car and necklace of flowers this is an egyptian uh way of doing it and it's it's happening five reals i buy one and one i have to hide the other one because it's not in the day of that one it's a lot of pain and headache but it has an impact it has an impact on your spouse now compare this with someone who does not give gifts with someone who makes very rational he rations the food he brings and every time he checks the the the refrigerator yesterday there were five uh sodas now there is one who drank the four she says i i drank two and your son and we had the guest why did you drink two two is too much come on we have to save money we have to do this we have to do that now this is a very bad character in a man it's a very bad character now second part of moral conduct he has to be truthful he has to be honest he has to say the truth and a lot of the men lie are professional liars now saying this lying is permissible in islam only in three cases one to reconcile between two who are having a fight so it's you lie to him you lied to him and get them together good two in war and three husband and wife which is a minor war so we have major war we have minor war so a lot of the brothers misunderstand this hadith where are you i'm at work he's telling his friends when are you coming i have late shift and some of them awesome come to work please come we have a lot of job to do and he hangs up he said the prophet said lying no this is not the lying that the prophet meant allah what kind of lying then it is the beautiful permissible lying that increases the love my wife comes to me wearing a dress she said how do i look and i say if i pose then i will get one of the high heels just posing so imagine if i say what is this come on this is 15 years old dress someone who's 15 you are a grandmother what are you wearing you crazy people who laugh at you this is bad so seriously when my my wife comes with a a new dress she says what do you think i said masha allah you're making the dress look very beautiful she smiles and looks at me says liar she knows she knows how i often try to make her happy by lying but this is alhamdulillah halal line now imagine if this kind of lying is not there would they love each other sometimes the husband you know after coming from the toilet putting on his shirt he's doing this in the mirror she says honey how do i look she said you look like a bee a big piece and chunk of meat what what do you look instead no a a wise and sensible wife is martial allah you are my knight in shining armor this increases the love and so many times truthfulness is a cause of destruction of your marriage and the people come and say well i don't want to lie my wife told me do you love me ask me do you love me i said no i don't want to lie no this is stupid you are truthful in everything else but when it comes to your love to your wife you have to sugarcoat it you have to be diplomatic so that you would increase the love and this is halal but in other things no you never lie a muslim never lies so many times i see brothers going out this young child three years four years daddy can i come with you said no no i'm going to the hospital to take an injection he's lying what would the child do i don't want to go i'm not crazy but this is very bad because the child would grow up on lying a friend calls the child answers yes daddy it's it's your friend tell him i'm not here my father says he teaching your child to lie a true practicing muslim never lies so the third is uh lowering the gates so many times i walk in the market in the streets in the souk i find a brother with a practicing sister mashallah walking and the guy you know a wax you don't know a wax because we're from saudi we know a lot of military stuff a wax is a plane that has a radar on top of it and this flies all over and it controls all communication and it monitors anything that is flying this man is like an airwax and whenever he sees a woman he looks her up and uh and with his wife a lot of the sisters call me sheikh my my husband is doing this and it's hurting me it's beside the fact it's a sin it is killing me that i'm walking with my husband and he's looking freely to women no part of his moral conduct and good character that he lowers his gaze because if you allow yourself to do this then you may might as well allow her to do this as well would you accept this no why i'm a man it doesn't seem so it being a man does not permit you to do this and the last point it's not the last it's one of so many but this is just an example he should be tolerant he should be tolerant tolerant to what to his wife as we've seen the prophet haslam do with aisha when she was jealous did he react very tolerant didn't do anything not only that sometimes your tolerance is your survival aisha was with the prophet allah in her house zainab bin josh may allah be pleased with her the cousin of the prophet has she so she is related to him and she is one of the most beautiful wives of the prophet she comes and she starts to curse aisha you did this you always take him with you he loves you most you do and she starts and aisha says and i'm looking at the prophet allah i'm not replying i'm not saying anything respecting the prophet hassam until i saw the prophet's face change as if he wants me to what to answer back and when i saw this i gave her and i returned everything that she had and a little bit extra and i can see the satisfaction in the prophet's face and he and and when i finished he said this is the daughter of abu bakr being proud of her so he tolerated zainab he didn't speak why because we need tolerant husbands i don't think our husbands don't they need huh don't get me wrong women need tolerant husband why men would justify this yeah yeah sure because they have little brains in the no it's not because of that their nature is full of passion compassion love and impulsiveness they don't hide they speak on the spot if you're like this the house will ignite so the best way of having a good marriage is compromise if the husband pulls the wife let's go and when the wife pulls the husband pulls no you also let go so this way you have the perfect marriage you'll always be happy if you tolerate your wife you will find out that she will come and appreciate it in a very strange way my wives will not watch this so inshallah i have no problems sometimes one of my wives would be so angry she would curse she would break a dish she would say bad things about me and i would not open my mouth one word nothing until after an hour or two she comes down what does she do she comes and kisses my foot wallahi i didn't do anything she kisses my foot and says i'm sorry i know i i crossed the line for tolerating me now do you think this is easy for me as a man to tolerate not that i'm a good husband i have a lot of shortcomings if she talks who you will listen to too many stories more awful than this but it's hard for me to tolerate but i do this first of all for the sake of allah second of all because i know her character and whatever she's saying is not correct people come to me sheikh i divorced my wife why she kept on saying divorce me divorce me divorce me for three hours and i say okay then what did you do divorce her okay what did she do she started crying you divorce me this is natural this is nature human nature when a woman asks for a divorce do you think she wants divorce no but she's impulsive when she asks for divorce you tell her i will not divorce you i love you liar you do this you do whatever you do i still love you calm her down come home but if you divorce her or if you fight against her then this is not what a woman needs this is not what a woman wants you have to be tolerant and this is a sunnah what is the evidence behind or uh this one and this one the hadith of mu'awi uh fatima bin khasi if i'm not mistaken may allah be pleased with her she came to the prophet and she said that i have two proposals one from us from abi sufyan and one from abu jaham may allah be pleased with them both what did the prophet say he told her as for muawiyah he is broke he doesn't have any penny which means that he cannot be generous because he doesn't have money so he's not your type as for abu jaham he is a man that never takes his stick off his shoulder it has two interpretations two people always keep their sticks on their shoulder one is a person who always hits people with it which means that he's intolerant and he will hit you with his stick so you don't want him the second interpretation is he is the second person who puts the shoulder the stick on his shoulder meaning he travels a lot so you don't want a husband who is two thirds of his uh life away from you traveling all the time no you need someone to be with you so this these are the two characteristics that are required in a person when he has good moral conduct and good character the second characteristic is he should be practicing a woman wants someone who's practicing one these are in one so this is importance is not uh in category so any the brother is asking why didn't we put the first things first and so on this is when i wrote it i didn't anything of categorizing it or putting it in order in regards of what is most important but definitely uh it might be also because see i can always find i'm good in interviews it is not it is it might be it is the hadith order the prophet said allah whenever someone comes to you with good moral conduct and character and deen so the prophet made it number one so i'm following the sunnah sorry um yes okay this is hadith by the way so this is order of the prophet but linguistically and whenever we have two or three it doesn't mean that always the first one is a priority because in some ayas we have haruna musa and we know that musa is the majority of mentioning it's musa first but there are one or two places in the quran where harun is preceded and the scholars say in arabic the word the letter this is conjunction and this does not mean order while means order fa means order uh uh there are many many examples i can give you so here it doesn't yet mainly speaking usually it is that's why the prophet says when he climbed safa he recited the ayah inna safa well marwah he said after that i begin with what allah has begun with that's why he started from safa and then marwa because this is the order but in arabic no it does not mean it has to be in sequence what what are we talking about ah being practicing i don't know if we have anything else no practicing meaning that he has to be a person committed to his religion not necessarily a scholar not necessarily a half of not necessarily even someone who is literate he can be illiterate the prophet was illiterate but he was the best of mankind so when we say practicing meaning that he knows that this is haram and he stays away from it and he knows that this is mandatory and he does it now if i have someone with masha'allah degrees and experience and a narrator yet he doesn't pray on time he doesn't lower his gaze he doesn't speak the truth all the time would i call him truthful i know a lot of brothers with this long beard that are the biggest liars this is a sign of hypocrisy and also among the sisters you know a lot of sisters among you that may lie that may cheat that may never keep a promise that when they have a dispute or an argument they excel in evil or either hasam fajr the prophet says this is a a very big defect so allah says in the quran this is too small okay bad statements are for bad people or bad women are for bad men and bad people are for bad statements or bad men for bad women so this is by default this is the norm and this can be in this dunya and it's also going to be in the hereafter because one would complain and say okay prophet lut his wife was his wife was likewise so how can we combine we combined by saying that this is the norm there can be exceptions or we can say that this is on the day of judgment so only the righteous men would have righteous women but tentatively speaking you have to have this as a choice now unfortunately we find the defect in marriage when sisters compromise so the sister as in the questioner she's religious she's practicing her the one proposing to her is not as practicing so we get cis i get questions sisters coming and saying uh a man proposed to me he's a good family he's rich he's so and so but he works in an interest-based bank that deals with clear cut riba no doubt in that or he works in tv and he shows he's part of showing movies and music and haram stuff or he sells forbidden things alcohol works in a a restaurant that sells unislamic food pork etc so is this permissible and the answer is no she says he says but i i will inshallah try to guide him the answer still is no you should only take someone who is practicing a lot of the sisters unfortunately disobey my advice they go and marry and they either deteriorate or divorce they would give in compromise do not compromise your religion allah azzawajal would send you someone who fears him thirdly lineage so now the brothers are looking into their lineage a woman should take someone in her same social status or better but is this a must no it's not this is part of being or having a perfect marriage when these conditions are fulfilled and in some schools of thought if a woman marries someone who is below her social status the cousins have the right to nullify the the marriage contract imagine that they have the right to go to the judge and complain and they say our cousin married this man and he's not from our type he's not from our status and we're affected by that that's why we would like you to void the contract and the ma and the under kavi does this and we have cases in saudi arabia like this this is not correct this is not authentic but it is found in the schools of thought so when you take someone take someone try your best to take someone that does not offend the rest of your family because you do not come from you're not an orphan you come from a tree so you have to honor the whole family as much as possible among the characteristics that is required in a husband he should be strong and honest and this is mentioned in surat al-qasas when musa peace be upon him fled egypt he found two women unable to water their sheep so he volunteered and then he went to a tree to rest then one of them of the girls they yo she suggested to her father to hire him she said oh father hire him verily the best of men for you to hire is the strong and the trustworthy so these are two characteristics a woman requires in a husband being strong that does not mean he has to be a bodybuilder this is not the what is meant by strength though it's it's nice to have but not necessarily why if you remember the hadith of the prophet islam a strong believer is better than a weak believer and in both of them there is there is goodness what is meant by a strong believer scholars say a strong believer physically emotionally economically knowledge wise fighting skills wise so all aspects he's considered to have strength so if you have a five-foot tall husband and he weighs 45 kilograms you don't file for divorce he said no he's not strong here whenever i walk with him the air comes and the wind blows it i have to hold him with a string like a kite and sometimes no no no no look at the other features how is he when it comes to honoring your family oh sheikh he masha allah he respects my mother and my father loves him so much he's strong how does it how is it when he is in his office oh masha'allah he's very good he has good position respectful and the managers love him and his subordinates respect him good how is he financially how then this guy is strong he's not necessarily physically the second is he should be honest and honest is different than truthful truthful is what you say honest is a mana i can trust you and that is why when i choose someone to marry my daughter i trust him i give him the most precious thing in my life my daughter and likewise when i treat my wives i treat them in a way that their parents entrusted me with their daughter so i should never betray that trust i should give her the best life treat her the best way i can i fail but i tried okay we move on to the third fourth fifth cooperative in learning obeying allah and advising if a girl marries a man she wants her man to cooperate with her why a practicing sister her vision her mission her statement is i want someone to take me to paradise i don't want to live here forever can we live on earth forever our days are counted we have very few days left allahu alam a thousand day hundred day one day allah allah knows best so she wants someone to be cooperative in learning in obeying allah and in advising so she needs a mentor she needs someone to help her but if she gets a husband that prevents her from going to durus from going to workshops from going to circles of memorizing the quran and he deprives her of night prayer he deprives her of fasting voluntary fasting he deprives her of doing a lot of good things what kind of marriage is this she is like asia the wife of unfortunately a lot of the sisters suffer from this i got a lot of complain not a lot any few complaints from sisters married to practicing brothers they are squeezing the circle so that they would not acquire knowledge and when i speak to the brothers i can sense that they are jealous they don't want their wives to be more knowledgeable so they try to pull them down and this is very very dangerous a woman loves in her husband to be able to provide for his family i get a lot of emails and and queries especially from sisters in britain in uk where the husband is a bum he doesn't work he doesn't go out he just sits there on his laptop of course giving his back to the wall facing the family with the headsets and he stays up till two or three o'clock in the morning doing nothing except chit chatting and sometimes doing haram he's practicing but he doesn't work and the sister works in a hospital in a school she provides for the family she provides for the kids she provides even for the husband what kind of marriage is this allah azza says in the quran i'm not going to quote this in english i don't know how to say it in english i can't find it but sixth line you know it so they are the controllers the providers the guardians of women providing they do what they spend money but if the man doesn't spend money then he loses his taiwan then his kiwami is under suspicion under doubt you're not spending and you're also commanding me to do this and that who's the man of the house this is a problem so a woman wants a man who's able to open a house not necessarily a big mansion maybe one room is enough but at least provide for me a decent and dignified life where i don't have to go and beg my family where i don't have to go and work to support you you should do this and this is the responsibility of the husband by the way some of your brothers say okay i don't uh spend money to my wife why she said she's a millionaire masha'allah even though even if your wife is a millionaire you are obliged to provide for her so my wife comes and says i need a dress so no you have money you go by no this is not allowed now if the wife is generous is kind is caring is loving may allah grant us all those such wives and rich at the same time if she's rich and she's providing yes no problem but it is your responsibility to open the house to support the house to give her even if she's a millionaire a husband has to be providing for his wife her natural needs and i will not elaborate on this but you know what i mean some and and this is a big problem abdullah ibn al-ass may allah be pleased with him when he got married a couple of weeks later his father amras went to see his daughter-in-law so he came in and said masha'allah daughter-in-law how are you how is your husband with you she said masha allah he is the best of all men he prays all night long and he fasts every single day amram last was one of the smartest companions ever he was very masha'allah a genius he understood it like this if a man prays all night and fast all day when is he going to have intimacy with his wife this means for two weeks since they wedded since since they get married he did not approach her immediately he went to the prophet and the prophet told him this is not the way and you know the hadith he restricted him to to pray or to finish the quran once a month he used to finish it once a night he instructed him to fast the maximum a day and skip a day like dawud and he used to fast the whole month etc and then he told him that your lord has rights over you the same uh the same hadith of salman same thing he told him abdullah your lord has rights over you your guest has rights over you your body has rights over you and your wife or your family has rights over you so give each one it's due right so a man has to give his wife her rights you cannot neglect her rights you cannot because she's human and likewise she cannot neglect you're right she has to also give you your rights and we will come to talk about the rights later on in sha allah but this is one of the things that are required in a man also a man has to look good and smell underline and smell good a lot of the wives complain bitterly about this we are unable to find any we are able to understand it because if we smell our bees it sounds it smells good but it's not what who you smell your wife doesn't have a beard so if she comes close to you and she finds this odor this is bad some of the brothers do not shower their personal hygiene the prophet isam instructed the men and the women to pluck their armpit and to shave their pubic areas right this is part of islam cleanliness you don't hide when you say this you have to say it openly some of the brothers have a strong smell they don't want they don't shower some of the brothers shower twice a day that's good some of them carry twice a month this is bad some of the brothers have odor strong odor but some of the brothers when you smell them you say they have oh deer not an odor wow it's any deafening and it's going to make you faint a man has to look good for his wife otherwise she's going to look somewhere else he has to smell what is the first thing and this is not authentic but the scholars you always mention it the first thing the prophet begins when he enters the house is the swag cleaning his mouth the i've been abbas may allah be pleased with him they saw him his companions you know calming his hair putting jill didn't have jill but the oil to come in and taking care of his beard and wearing beautiful clothes putting perfumes and this is what are you doing he said i like to beautify myself to my spouse as i like her to beautify herself for me it's a two-way two-way street so a woman wants in her husband to to look good to smell good as you want her to do the same so this is natural always take care of the smell of your mouth always perfume your beard always shower at least once a day so that you can ensure you don't have the smell of the sweat sometimes i sit in public transportation i have some i bring a straw and put it out of the window so that i can breathe from it's very bad how can you tolerate this in the masjid you know in the masjid people stand next to you and you cannot concentrate in prayer you just want the prayer to be over sometimes when you prostrate because of the smell of the socks in front of you you [Music] i said wallahi i am serious i'm not saying this to make you laugh i do this sometimes i cannot breathe so i as if i'm diving so why is this yeah you should be always clean you should always be and the prophet isam is your role model isn't he uh may allah be with him said i accompanied the prophet islam for 10 years wallahi i never touched softer than his hand it's softer than silk and i never smelt anything better than his smell better than musk and in surat you know the revelation of why it was revealed anyone honey because hafsah and aisha it was one of the narrations uh collaborated because the prophet used to go to zainab and eat honey called the maga so they collaborated to listen if the prophet comes to you say oh what is the smell so the prophet the most awful thing he ever disliked was people to find a bad smell from him this is the prophet our prophet as a role model so she he went to aisha and she said what is the smell he said it's honey i ate it at zanem's house oh okay he went to have some i said what is the smell he said well i will not eat it [Music] that you should not have done this but the point is the prophet always had the best of smell so you also should do this give me five seconds only i have to clear my throat there is sugar in it there is sugar green tea no sugar coffee sugar please uh bye uh one of the no no no no no no no no one of the most important same as the woman one of the most important characteristic is keeping secrets a man is the confidant of his wife you never ever spread the secrets of your wife do men spread the secrets of their wives raise your hands liars do men spread the secrets of your wife of their wives yes raise your hands all lying well i well i don't want to swear but believe me you're lying or masha allah you don't have any secrets because you live with your in-laws maybe i'm talking about ideal places in saudi so many men spread the secrets of their wives to their mothers and this is the biggest mistake the biggest mistake a man could do is complain to his mother about his wife because you are destroying the relationship between the wife and the mother you're agitated you're angry with your wife you go your wife is not with you well i my mother my wife did this did that imagine she did this and she said that imagine she could didn't make me sleep how would your mother feel your mother would be very protective if she saw her daughter-in-law she will kill her because she is harming my own son originally speaking a mother-in-law hates her daughter-in-law true because she took my son so if you add insult to injury and you go to your mom and say well she's doing this and she's doing that you even make her more angry never ever speak against your wife in front of your mother or in front of your father always say the best of things so that you would bring joy to them and you also protect your wife's reputation keeping the secrets the prophet saw went to the companions women and men and said does anyone among you talk about intimacy issues in public does anyone among you raise your hands anyone okay the same thing happened to the prophet allah companions did not raise their hands because they were i wouldn't say they were lying but they were hiding the truth one woman stood up and said prophet of allah by allah they do it and all those who did not raise their hands were ashamed you were afraid i wouldn't say they were lying like you but they didn't he didn't they didn't talk a woman said yes by allah we do it all of us and the prophet said whoever does this whoever spread the secrets of his spouse is like a shaytan and a shaytan a male and female devil having intercourse in the middle of the road it's an awful description so keep your secrets to yourself marriage is never successful when the dirty laundry is spread all over keep your laundry in your kitchen characteristics he has to honor his in-laws so a woman feels proud when her husband honors her family how does he honor her their family your your wife says my father is coming over and my mother are coming over for dinner tonight so um okay i'm going to my friend's house why i don't want to see your father and your mother always nags a lot so i don't want to go she feels hurt she feels betrayed would you like her to do the same when your mother and father come over no she can't who will cook subhanallah so you have to honor your in-laws and honoring uh the in-laws have a lot of means you can honor them financially bringing food for them you are welcome my house is your house getting them food getting them decent hospitality things that are good for you and also i would think that honoring the in-laws the best way of honoring them is to complement their daughter what do you mean by this i mean this is what i do and again i'm not bragging of what i do i'm just giving you an example i am one of the worst husbands ever if you ask my wife they will tell you i don't think so but i always do this because i want my wife to do the same to me so when her father and mother comes to the hole to the to the house i spend half of the time saying well this is the jewel of your family so-and-so if for example the family of uh so-and-so muhammad's family i said this is the jewel of muhammad's family oh masha'allah i cannot live well i i lie until i feel sorry for myself i keep on lying and i say when she cooks food masha allah look at this food my wife i love the way you cook beautiful hands look at the food mashallah eat eat and it is uneatable but i and i when i look to my parents-in-law and i see the joy coming out so happy well i feel good although i hate my wife but i feel good why because you're making muslims proud now imagine and compare if they come to visit their daughter and the husband says why is the food late come on go and bring me this bring me that how would they he did not insult but how would they feel they will feel insulted her father's heart is going to be like break her mother also is going to be sad if he's treating her like this in front of us how would he treat her when we leave honor your in-laws they entrusted you with the most valuable thing in their life and that is your their daughter so don't make them feel sorry no matter how much trouble you have with your wife no matter how angry you are with her when they come always put what they call in we don't have alhamdulillah poker face be any act that you are happy and she is caring and you're loving because you will gain a lot out of this a husband has to have an a recommended amount of jealousy what do you mean recommended amount isn't jealousy required all the time no jealousy is divided into two types praised and acceptable and unacceptable the unacceptable jealousy which we do not want is when it is only suspicion i want to divorce my wife why whenever i come to the home i find her talking on the phone when she sees me she says okay and she hangs up she's definitely talking to a man what kind of suspicion is this no no this is haram most people most women even most men when someone comes into the room says i'll talk to you later i'm not feeling having the privacy of talking and they're talking to the same sex not the opposite sex so this is doubt that is not recommended i know i don't have to swear i know i know people that when they leave their houses they lock the outer door i had a teacher a friend of mine working with me he used to do this his house got burnt while he was at school and his wife and child were inside could not get out but with the grace of allah their neighbor broke the door and got them out and imagine the amount of insult we all teachers gave him because of this why do you lock the door you crazy you're having animals in your house they're human beings you took free a free woman from her house to your house why do you enslave her in such a manner so this kind of jealousy is definitely unacceptable in islam now on the contrary on the opposite side there are men who have no jealousy at all so the wife says we need these groceries you go you go and buy it take money uh the kids you have to go to school and talk to the teachers in saudi we have segregated schools wallahi the woman goes and talks to the teacher of her son why because the man does not want to waste the uh football game between saudi and uzbekistan it's live in uzbekistan it's early morning is this acceptable no some of the men have no problem asking the driver or asking the doorman to bring the plumber into his bedroom to fix the kitchen or to fix the bathroom while his wife is inside okay what about you while i have work i'm going where is the jealousy how can you enter allow a man to enter a stranger to enter your house don't you have any jealousy in you this is a necessity subhanallah this shows you and and women love it women love it when men feel jealous when i walk with my wife in the market which is i do mashallah every five years or six years and i will notice that herniakab she does a very good nikab they wear this zoro mask and she puts another or ninja mask somebody said and then they uh put a veil that is like this so you cannot see her eyes it's like this but she can see the road and if she wants to see something she raises her head sometimes it goes a little bit up and her eyes are visible or she wears gloves in women gloves is like this so if she does this the abaya you can see maybe a small part and i say cover your hand she immediately does this and i love this when you say that so now whenever i see her walking cover your hand she says cover i know but you love it you told me you love it so anyhow um so recommended jealousy is very good women love it show your women your woman your wife show her that you are jealous show her that you are a man and you're not another scumbag who doesn't care if she comes or goes show her that a recommended jealousy tolerance and forgiveness we spoke about this why did i mention it again ah forgiveness is a big issue unfortunately men are like camels are like elephants they never forget so so many times women have shortcomings and then hala's weakness and makeup we forget the man still keeps it in after one two five years he's still it's like that time you never change subhanallah five years she's with you she never repeated it and once she does it again you never change lucky for you men that the prophet isam did not say that you are the majority of hellfire he only said it to them but unfortunately you also have it in you you complain a lot and you don't appreciate what the women do women need men who are forgiving if they make mistake and the best of men is the tolerant and forgiving men do not become a sponge as i said yesterday today i don't know yesterday do not become a sponge observing all the problems or until you become very heavy and you fall no become like a glass anything that comes on the glass is reflected it's gone and you always have a clean and pure chest okay before that among the men who considers himself to be tolerant and forgiving to the wife only three this is a big problem seriously this is a very it's good i i appreciate your honesty but we're here to fix things uh we're not here to pretend we're here to fix our relationships i told you i did this in a year and a half ago in the uk i was the first one to benefit from it i went to my home i changed a lot of things in the way i yeah i treat my wives alhamdulillah it lasted for three days but then but i tried now to this time inshallah i'll try to make it last a little bit longer inshallah the last point is sharing the responsibilities and the men are irresponsible unfortunately when it comes to the children we're very irresponsible i'm talking about myself i never sit with the children to teach them mainly because they're girls you know why i tell her listen you gotta work hard you're gonna study you're gonna be the first over your class then what you're gonna get married and sit home so sit home daddy i need you to explain this i don't have time and i know this is selfish from my side but i have 13. and if i'm going to teach each and one of them only english this will take my whole day so i tell them depend on yourselves when i was young i depended entirely on myself when it comes to studies in school etc so i tell my children to depend on themselves i never believe in getting a teacher to pay him money to teach them i never believed in getting extra classes alhamdulillah my girls are very very well educated alhamdulillah one of them yeah i need the average is i have two of my girls getting 99.9 in in their high school and one of my daughters in her for a fourth and last year in germa at le mans studying sharia and she's among the the best three or four i think and the other one also is doing very well the third one is doing they depend on themselves sharing the responsibility is not only in teaching them sharing the responsibility in the house who among you washes the dishes in the kitchen over the men masha'allah one two three four five which is very good allah is very pleasing in saudi arabia everybody raise their hands and say sheikh we have plastic dishes well disposable we don't we don't need to wash which is good the prophet who cooks in the house one the same one who does the dishes very good i cook sometimes i i make excellent steaks i make excellent hot dogs that's all the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when aisha was asked how how is the prophet in the house the she said when the prophet enters the house he used to sallallahu he used to work for his family so he used to sow his clothes he used to fix his shoes himself and he used to milk the goat but when it was called for was calling for the salah he would go to the salah now compare apple to apple how are you in the house when i enter the house i throw my clothes everywhere in the bedroom i don't care about the bathroom i sit and extend my legs and have the remote controls and i just make orders bring me tea bring me coffee go and get me some water turn on the air condition i don't move in the house i just instruct people to do things okay do you help with the family with the wife no why did i get married she's supposed to do everything no this is wrong you will not be fulfilling the needs of a woman if you do not share the responsibility now a great deal of responsibility lies in doing the things that your wife do not like to do a lot and i'll give you example personal example one of the most horrendous tasks for my wife is take a guess i reading no no not much ironing is good until now they did not complain take a guess cleaning the dishes the daughters do it right dry cleaning no no we don't have we sold those we don't it's all in the washer toilet cleaning the girls do it and the wives do it they don't have any problem the most difficult and horrendous task to them that they want me always to share in waking the kids for fajr do you find this difficult the i see i sit i pray fajr and come back home and i sit in the living room answering emails and i hear my wife aisha aisha aisha come on wake up fajr you have school asha and this goes for half an hour and the girls do not move at all and finally she comes can't you see what's happening do something i say you're always nervous you're always shouting i go said exactly aisha wake up is it my voice i never beat my children well not for the past 10 years i haven't beaten them alhamdulillah is it my voice or is it the way that the wife talks to the children to the extent that they don't pay any attention they're always tense they're always hyper there's always nervous so calm down in the beginning it was difficult now halas we're used to my mother's voice so the best thing i would do to my wife is to relieve her from this so you need the sharing and the responsibility with the children so many times the kids come they have a lot of problems the mother talks to them this is haram you should not wear this this is inappropriate this is this is this is and they cannot communicate with the girls they don't listen i sit with them five minutes i give them a story and i tell them in a nice way and i ask them what is your problem what what do you do not like in what i say and this you know this isn't and i give them another try to yanni uh bring them in a nice and peaceful way and they like it this a mother cannot do so a mother needs a good husband to take care of the responsibility a mother can shout for 23 hours this is how allah made her she is affection affectionate no is it is this an english word affectionate no this is more like a frankenstein word anyhow she has a lot of affection to uh the children she is loving she is caring she is giving without any limits but there is a gap and this gap is closed by the husband the man but at the same time the man cannot give love and affection and care and compassion a lot of the times my daughters complained that i don't hug them and i don't kiss them a lot what against you why they complain so i have to oppress my feelings i love you so much i have to do this on the other hand the mother is nature to her kissing and cuddling and embracing them this is their nature so it's a gap each one of us has to fill it a man has to share his responsibility in the house as men we have ready-made excuses when my wife says why don't you do this i work i bring money i go eight hours i do the shopping and you want me to do this and this and that we have ready reasons and justifications the simplest answer my wife says okay sit home i'll do it seriously you're enjoying yourself you're going out you're meeting people you're driving you're having fun you're i'm here cornered in four walls i'm doing all your dirty work and you are refusing to share something with me with the children this is a big problem we have to take care of break finally okay we shall start inshaallah in mentioning engagement and by engagement we mean what is known as in arabic do you know arabic nobody speaks arabic engagement is called and a lot of the arabs make a mistake between and so brothers goes he said masha'allah yesterday i made khutbah and i said masha'allah what masjid said no no i got i got engaged so this is not khutbah so we have to go and discuss how is it possible in islam to get married and first of all we have rules of engagement and this statement is usually used in wars the rules of engagement but as i said there are similarities between marriage and death and war as well so first of all engagement is it marriage no it is only it is merely a promise so you have to know that if you propose to a woman and they accept but you're not married the consequences are great because in arabia in arab countries once they approve of the engagement what happens she becomes like his wife they go out to the movies he may give her a ring or a bracelet and he himself touches her and and and put it on her all of this is haram she is a stranger still you two are strangers nowadays when a person gets engaged he talks with his fiancee on the phone he taught he sms is her he maybe video chat and all of this all of this is not acceptable in islam it's haram she's a stranger to you what's the formality of getting engaged how do a man gets engaged is there any certain it's not my phone my phones are here okay uh how is it is there any certain formalities no the sky is the limit it depends from culture to culture there isn't any recommendation if a person likes a woman he proposes to her father to her guardian still the i have it in my pocket and my phones are here so the norm i don't know how do you propose here in india all married people are not talking this is not you're not going to propose again huh the groom parents go okay yeah but there is a problem here it's cultural but also islamic the parents go to the parents men and women they sit together the majority this is haram this is unacceptable i know this is culture and people do people do it no way you have to segregate men from women and not only that in arabia and maybe some some parts of arabia maybe not in saudi this is not hamdulillah practice yet the father has to see the the girl what what what are you doing he's the one who's getting married once he gets married she becomes your daughter-in-law but before that you have the ability to stay away my son i'm going this happens this happens it can happen and therefore there isn't any certain procedure how to get engaged how to propose to a movement the norm in saudi arabia is a woman's job everything is brewed and cooked and prepared by the women so the the the the mother of the of the boy salaam alaikum my name is so-and-so and we heard that you have a daughter by the name of so-and-so okay on the phone they start exchanging information data gathering so he works he doesn't work his education and so on so the the level of practicing he is allah define what do you mean by practicing and he doesn't listen to music he doesn't have a tv in his house he prays five prayers and the masjid his beard did he stops okay then we go to who are his so you have to label him is he one of the shi you know half half or mashallah then we okay everything is okay she conveys a picture to the father a man came with this uh uh quality is this a okay let me check he checks okay then nothing happens the mother comes for a visit usually the mother with her sister with few of her daughters three four females just to drink tea of course it's not drinking tea it is checking time they check up so mashallah who's the the bride who is our bride they say nothing happened no engagement so she comes with the tea or with the jews and she sorry just to prepare her mother-in-law but and they took they check they look at her if they think that the features would appeal to the boy very chit-chatting very friendly nothing they go to the boy and they say wallahi we find her to be so and so and so i as a mother i think that she's suitable for you the boy feels good about it he goes and proposes to the father directly not his parents so he talks to me i say okay let's meet come in my office come in this place we sit for an hour or two i interview him i like him i go to the daughter and say well i met him he's this high he's this short he's this fat he's this thin mashallah he's very pleasant when he speaks he's knowledgeable i give her the good qualities and if there are any bad qualities as well of course i do my investigation i check before everything is khalas ready i checked i thoroughly checked on him then i tell him come to visit me in my house he comes he sits with the girl talks with her for half an hour let's see if there is chemistry they leave he likes her her mother his mother calls she approves of it alhamdulillah then the father calls me salaam alaikum how are you we would like to come and visit you she's the most welcome so he comes with his son two three four of his brothers maybe cousins you know we call it meaning that he wants to show up himself and his family of course he's not going to bring the whole tribe but four or five maximum seven maybe to come and produce and introduce themselves and i would also call my brothers my sons-in-law and my the one my in-laws the uncle uh of uh the girl they would come they would sit for half an hour howard thinks oh you know this one yeah he worked with me you know this we start to make connections saudi is as big as chennai population wise we have very little people so we can get connected together after that the father says we would like to propose to your daughter so-and-so for my son so-and-so and i would say you're more than welcome we will not find anyone better than you we bring a cheap uh a goat and we eat masala this engagement is done end of story now they're engaged do they talk to each other no do they communicate does he call her mabrook congratulations no nothing so you're still a stranger to him but then what is the use of such an engagement it's just a promise there's nothing binding meaning that after all of this a month later he says tell you what i change my mind i don't want to continue is this permissible no problem is it permissible for me to say i change my mind as well i don't want to give my daughter yes not only that it is not permissible while she is engaged to approach uh well not not this one yeah this is the second point but we will go on to it now this is the normal way of getting engaged it is not permissible for a man to go and approach a girl directly as i've mentioned in the early session this morning to go and say well i love to get married to you you're a practicing woman masha'allah your god feeling can i have your number this is not proposing this is dating it's haram so it is not also permissible for a woman to throw herself to a man i had so many emails sheikh there is this imam in my community he is young he is unmarried in masha'allah his recitation is very beautiful and i want to get married to him so can i call him is it permissible this is immodest this is strange in our society as muslims and this is degrading for a woman if a woman proposes to a man this is very degrading how would a man look at her men how would you look at a woman proposing to you in marriage happy truthful he is truthful true some would feel happy but i tell you the majority might feel happy but after marriage every day every night he will insult her you threw yourself on me is there any woman with pride and dignity come and propose to a man no matter how rich how influential how knowledgeable this man is this is degrading this is not permissible one would say her friend said to her that muhammad is a good man how what if i propose to him and he just mentioned your name she said okay i didn't initiate it so she went and she proposed and not proposed she suggested would you like to marry so i i would but i'm i don't think she'll accept me then she will accept you it's a different story than a woman calling and a woman i don't want to mention names or countries because this would be any very easy to find for the people but this happens a lot of the brothers the dies get similar requests from sisters this is haram you have to draw the line a scholar is a man at the end of the day i get people on huda you know as kuda program where i answer q a live on tv people calling i love you for the sake of allah and and you can imagine my wife what she did when i went back home from the studio this is bad this is haram yeah but didn't the prophet said if someone loves his brother muslim he should tell him that that he loves him for the sake of allah the same sex not the opposite sex the hadith is directed to the same sex it's like coming and saying the prophet says sallallahu that when you smile in the face of a muslim this is charity so you go out with all the sisters and give them a big smile why are you what are you doing sid i'm charity this is haram you have to understand that our religion is very strict with the grace of allah in protecting us it draws a line you should never cross this line so a woman no matter how scholarly you think a person is or how beautiful his voice is you do not propose to anyone have someone else have your brother no problem your father no problem rumor did it may allah please with him rama went to abu bakr he said hafsah is now ready for getting married so do you like to get married to have some he said not today and he went to uthman sorry he went to uthman first and then because man lost his uh wife died and he was widowed and he said no i she just died i don't feel like getting married he went to abu bakr abu bakr did not give him a straight clear answer yani as if he ignored him romer says i felt it i felt bad about it abu bakr is my best friend and this is what he is doing when i'm proposing my wife my daughter to him and then the prophet proposed to her after the prophet proposed abu bakr said by allah i did not answer you because i heard the prophet mentioning her meaning that he is interested in her so i could not accept or refuse i just i couldn't and i could not disclose my prophet's secret al-israel and this removed what he felt so it is permissible yes if i have a daughter and i see someone who is righteous i would go to him no problem why did you get married i'll give you my daughter in marriage who did this among the among the taberean saeed his daughter the son of the caliph the caliph proposed to his daughter for his son he refused imagine saying defusing giving his daughter to the son of the greatest one of the greatest colors of the entire time and he had a student one of the poorest and he could not come for a week when he checked upon him they told him his wife died so the student came after the wife after a week and he said how are you said well alhamdulillah did you get married no you want to get married he said who will give me in marriage he said i give you my daughter in marriage do you accept he said yes i accept and the court the the seminar or the workshop finished the masjid and the guy went home he's telling and all of a sudden he hears this knocking on the door and he said who is this and he heard the sound saying say i can't find someone i know by the name of satan never crossed his mind that it was saying sheikh one of the greatest scholars of islam everybody knows said so he said i opened the door and i found saheed in my face what is this he moved and he pushed his daughter it was something in black and he pushed it in the house he said take your wife and left and he said i did not know what to do i'm in the house with this woman he's the daughter of saint like this so immediately rushed out and she was very shy you know she could not speak what do you expect from a woman to do in such a position so immediately he rushed to his mother and he told her what do you want me to do with this she said well i will never speak to you if you approach her before i get her ready for you she's a mother-in-law but she's a woman she knows that no you cannot take your wife like this without her being prepared nicely dressed beautified a wedding a ceremony is you're a righteous person i don't have nothing to do with her so after two or three days she prepared her and everything was ready he was wedded to her he said i went in and she was one of the most beautiful woman i had ever lied my eyes on so i stayed with her the seven days which you know that the rights of a wife to stay seven days for a virgin and three days for a non-virgin he did not have any other wife but he stayed seven days not going to the class not doing this on the eighth day he wanted to leave his wife told him where are you going he said i'm going to your father i want to attend the classes she said sit sit sit i'll teach you because what he has i have and she she started teaching him because she had the knowledge of her father and she said subhanallah i had it made what more can i need a beautiful wife a righteous wife and a knowledgeable wife this is the story you will find in the life story of saying may allah have mercy on his soul so i don't know what brought must brought us to this subject anyhow yes yes the father is allowed to go on and propose to his daughter but the woman this is completely prohibited number four okay which is number three here you have no permission at all to propose to a woman who is married of course can you a woman who is divorced but still in the in the waiting period a woman who has been widowed but still in their period all of this haram a woman who someone proposed to her so i know that my friend muhammad proposed to fatima the daughter of so-and-so and they accepted so i go next week and i propose to her father knowing that my her father would like me more because i have more money i have more influence i have this and that so the prophet forbade this why competing so competition is wrong and it's not because of competing is good it's no not a promise it's the grudge it's the hatred that would cause in muhammad's heart so for example ali sells to ahmed something and they say okay i'll give it to you for this now okay very good price in between i come i said no no i'll give you cheaper and he changes his mind comes to me i spoil the transaction how would he feel very bad likewise if i spoil his engagement he would feel very bad however this is understood now look at this scenario someone proposes to my daughter i accept a week later someone else proposes unknowingly that she's already engaged but he's a medical doctor he's richer he's more knowledgeable he's more handsome what to do can i accept his proposal can i accept his engagement yes i don't even if i don't break even i don't tell him am i entitled to show my daughter to someone else she's not married because he may see someone else and break and get married to someone else in the time of the engagement the father i would not say the son and the holy ghost but the father and his daughter have the choice to change their minds to explore more possibilities so yes we in so many times a girl has three people proposing unknowingly they don't know so she has no problem in seeing all three and once she determines who to accept she accepts so this is your right as a woman you don't it's not a a binding agreement no isn't engaged no you're not you can change your mind any time alhamdulillah okay among the taboos and restrictions and engagements as i said she's not your wife you cannot sit alone with her do you have this here is the one uh proposing to to a girl does he sit alone with her in the engagement time it happens this is haram it is haram after the engagement and definitely it's haram before the engagement some of the brothers when they when they propose to a woman and they want to make the islamic official interview which is the first one is his right to go and sit and look at her and it's her right to look at him exchange views look at each other they do not have anyone with them or they may have the mother and the mother is not the guardian she she has to have a fee a male uh person present to safeguard her from this among the things that are part of the sunnah is that you look at the one you want to marry not only look also stare seriously so many times i get questions a guy came and proposed to me and we sat for half an hour and he left i think he's a good man but i seriously don't remember his face and i'm afraid that if i get married to him then he's not the one that i had in mind so can i sit with him again what would the answer be yes yes sit and stare but preferably do it first time and that is why i always tell the brothers who go and propose and the sisters who are being proposed to when he sits talk to him look him into the eyes measure him from top to bottom this is your legitimate right not do not come after the marriage contract has been made and you say sheikh i thought he was 6'4 apparently he was four foot he's a i didn't see and he says the same some of the men are evil he saw her well but can i see her again i just wanted to make sure make sure ah no no no you're evil if you took a good look and you're satisfied until inshallah the marriage contract is done uh okay the the the evidence that this is from the sunnah i have marriage take me as an older uh brother of yours if not an uncle i have a problem with when i see a two-year-old girl wearing hijab or a forty-year-old girl or a six-year-old girl i think that this is too extreme i feel very bad when i see a man practicing bringing his two-year-old child or three-year-old child for prayer is this good some people say yes let him get used to it no the prophet told you instruct him to pray when there before seven you do not say anything if he wants to pray on his own prayer i'm not gonna touch you but every time from age five four or five daddy take me to the to the masjid with you no you're still young every single day you're young you're young six years old you're young he's eager to go to the masjid seven years old let's go oh very happy so he goes and he wants to go rather than you forcing him from when he's three years old he may go when he's three when he's four but when he becomes six or seven he's fed up he doesn't want to go anymore now you want to beat him no you cannot beat him until he's ten likewise girls from an early age i maybe because i have alhamdulillah 13 of them wear normal dresses let them enjoy their childhood let them go let them play why do you do this you do this huh for two hours look what happens to you your ears grow big yani your children yes but again there is a difference when they themselves want to do it i'm going out my wife is with me my two year three year four year five year will never ever say i do this maybe they'll do it once or twice but the rest of the day no when there's six they were adies head cover still young when they are eight eight and a half depending on the size and how she looks sometimes they are 12 years old and they look really young and childish but eight and a half yes you have to cover your head this is what i do with my daughters when she is 12 years even if she does not if she is not reaching the age of puberty yet when she is 12 years old now you start khalas covering your face wearing gloves although it's not mandatory but i'd like you to practice so i would not be very strict sometimes the veil is a little bit see-through knowledge the gloves she doesn't wear them she does this she's still young by the time she reaches the age of puberty khalas red line is is there she knows it i've trained her so this is my own perspective i don't be offended this is how i feel because the children need love need care need a lot of free place to a space to play don't put the cap on the top so that then they would feel really oppressed okay what's uh did i do this okay may allah be pleased with him says the prophet salallahu sallam said if one of you propose marriage to a woman if he can look at her to see that which will encourage him to go ahead and marry her then let him do so and jabber used to tell us that i used to hide to see the woman i want to marry why because if i'm in open air open space and i look oh look at this pervert look at lower your gaze so no if i have sincere intention to marry a particular woman i can hide i can try my best to see what encourages me to marry her and sometimes this is good without her knowing because this would not break her heart sometimes a woman her heart is broken when someone proposes and he looks at her and then he declines does this happen a lot i got people proposing to one of my daughters he came sat with her saw her spoke with her and refused yani a week later he called and said allah did not choose alhamdulillah do you think i'm going to be angry i would be more angry if he married her and then divorced her after a month because he didn't like her initially but he was ashamed or any shy to tell me no we're on safe grounds masala nothing had happened and a woman should also be the same i have one of my daughters by suckling meaning that my wife uh breastfed her and she was proposed to like 25 times hamdullah she's engaged now but and and i was shocked she is the most beautiful girl among the family marriage is like watermelon you open it some is red some is so sour and bitter and white you can never tell can you marriage is like this you find ugly women getting married and the beautiful one are still waiting on the contrary you find handsome men being rejected and the poor people the poor men mashallah they marry on the spot why is this because tawfiq is from allah azzawajal it is not what you have it is not your power it is what allah azza chooses for you therefore put your trust in allah don't worry i worry a lot oh i have so many daughters when will they get married i will probably die before they all get married and those who are married when are they coming back divorced this might happen and i would think and then i would say no no no who's the provider who's the sustainer who do i have my trust in call us leave it to allah don't think about this so i don't know what brokeman says anyhow if you can if you're able ah what brought me to this is that if you were a girl and three four men saw you and rejected continuing to marry you alhamdulillah be more than happy and say i'm willing to see 10 more because this is what allah is choosing for me i would not reject what allah chooses for me what allah chooses for me is the best there is no doubt in my mind and tells us that may allah appears with him i propose to a woman from the ansar and used to marry a lot so the prophet told him did you look at her and he said no i didn't the prophet ordered him to go back and look at again why if i propose to my friend's daughter i am marrying her because of her father i don't care if she's ugly or beautiful nevertheless i have to go and look why well the prophet tells us because looking at her is fitting that the love and compatibility be established between you then the reason i go and look at my future wife because this first look wallahi has strange effect doesn't it i've seen so many beautiful women in my life when i went to propose to my wife i couldn't sleep that day wondering when i come to remember it now she's not going to see it she's not as beautiful but subhanallah that honest and fresh and islamic look made the love in our hearts until today with the grace of allah so the first look is important not only to check but to increase the love that would be sustainable inshallah in future years unfortunately in arabia i don't think you have it here in arabia there are some tribes that refuse this okay so if we're through with the murid shabbos hadith and we said that this is to increase the love in the future coming days in sha allah oh yeah yeah you said you have it here where muslims they don't allow you to sit with no this is you this is your god-given right if you have someone rejecting that you see your wife getting the engagement tell him i'm looking somewhere else i'm not getting paid and you don't want me to look at her what is this you're not giving me the dowry i'm because i'm a practicing muslim and also you don't know she has to sit with him and he has to look at her and he has to talk to her in arabia because of i know one of my in-laws relatives she she keeps the veil in the house with her husband and children in taif she is she was like 75 years old may allah have mercy on her soul when i married my first wife she is her father's stepmother so she's married to her grand father and she tells me that she keeps the veil in the house with her husband and it's a it's an arabians like this what kind of a life is this of course i did not comprehend this but after the years have passed i suggested this to my wife but she refused anyhow okay now coming back to engagement what is the man allowed to see from his fiancee or the woman he's proposing to the majority of scholars say he is allowed to look at her face and her hands so the face he would know the beauty and from the from the hands he would know the beast depending on the fairness of her skin if she's fat if she's any this is what this is the majority i follow the other minority that states that he can it's not mentioned there yeah okay you can look at her as she's dressed in the home properly dressed in front of her mahrams and that is what i do with my daughters when someone proposing she comes with her hair she comes with until the half of the arm and a long dress or a little bit to this area normal and she shits edit this and she sits in front of the boy and they communicate now she's not allowed to wear mascaras makeup eyeliners nothing she has to appear as she really is facial wise she see okay i have spots can i cover it with no nothing comes that he can see her as she really is and alhamdulillah because he saw the rock bottom so whatever she does afterwards it's going to be extremely well and this is what happened to me when i married my wife when uh that was ages ago when i saw her i liked what i saw when she came on the marriage day you know with the hair makeup and hair i was shocked sincerely i was shocked because this i was not expecting that much beauty because i saw the rock bottom so whatever afterwards she puts she's always a queen in my eyes okay um but the consensus of all scholars is no touching in india not such thing is you can see but you cannot touch this is a problem haram in islam to touch and to see in the in in elsewhere here no in arabia this is one of the worst customs that are crawling into our society in saudi the boy sees the girl they like each other they get the approval he immediately takes a bracelet and he goes to her takes her hand and puts it on her this is haram shaking hands with the opposite sex what's the ruling on that little bit yeah i need any haram major sin i get a lot of people coming to the messenger what's the ruling and so on so i said haram as if they are going into the shopping supermarket you know collecting uh family size good this is no no haram is the prophet tells us in the authentic hadith it is best for a man to be stabbed in his head with an iron needle rather than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him look at the gravity of the sin and unfortunately a lot of the muslims sheikh what can i do i don't want to embarrass her what do you mean i went to the office and this lady extended her hand and said good morning so in front of the colleagues i did not want to embarrass her so i shook hands with her and i asked him okay what uh what if you were in italy and she came oh my colleagues this is normal in in italia so what would you do would you embarrass it again i don't know this is serious stuff when you deal with someone do not deal with them out of embarrassment or out of being shy deal with them with what pleases allah no matter how big how influential this person is yeah and you think if the queen elizabeth comes in and she good morning my son extends your hands would you think i would shake hands with her no i would respect her in the sense that you know giving dawah i once in 2005 in delhi one reporter came to me while i was in the exhibition in delhi she's indian and with the photographers and uh she said good morning now i'm representing my country i'm representing my company i'm i didn't think twice i immediately said sorry i can't shake hands with you her face changed her face changed you know can know that she will write a very bad article about saudi arabia about the fundamentalist about everything so i said if i do my wife will kill me so she was relieved now sometimes you have to explain to them ahead of time and that's why when i travel abroad for business meetings i always put this condition no haram on the food on the table when we have business meetings and i don't check hands with women so if a woman comes and extends their hand to luck i'm a muslim i can't sorry i've warned you before and also you can always do this when you come to a place where there are non-muslims and the minute they come in if they come in you just say hi seriously they immediately know because if they get a little bit closer they're gonna extend their hand and if you come in from the door you say morning thank you make it clear that i'm not shaking hands so this is something you have to be really careful about where did i get this nose from it is not permissible for her to put any makeup okay we're through with this the english is different than arabic i wonder if it's the same person who did it it is okay tell us we're finished with the engagement let's go inshaallah bismillah let's get married we have time no time engagement prolonged that long maybe somewhere else we'll propose yes okay we will start with the q and charlan yeah i'm free my shake the question shallow is the camera on let's check it's on okay yeah sheikh when he said that a woman cannot propose herself okay uh if the sisters if any of the sisters want to leave go ahead up to you so that we can start inshallah after those who want to leave the brothers if you anyone if you want to leave before we start so that we can okay that was nice okay the woman cannot propose but what about the hadith in which a woman comes to propose to prophesy this is only as mentioned in surat al-azab as speciality and specifically for the prophet allah if a woman gives herself to the prophet i serve this is only for the prophet salallahu and not to anyone else this is mentioned in sura she gave herself to the prophet so the prophet is unlike anyone else the prophet would not cheat the prophet would not be uh deceiving others the prophet will not be happy when someone proposes to him because every single woman on earth would love to propose to the prophet this isn't unlike any one of us so it's a completely different story we'll take question from online sheikh you said that want you to hide their past sin with anybody but there is a hadith that an adulteress woman came to prophet sallallahu alaihi and said that she did cinna doesn't this contradict no no no contradiction at all this woman did not come to expose herself this woman came to purify herself and this is known as another hadith and both tribes originally are rooted into al-az so she is from she came after izabina malik may allah be pleased with him confessed of adultery and was stoned to death a while later she came she did not come to expose herself she could not live with her past and what i'm referring to is different i'm referring to someone who can live with her past who sought forgiveness of allah who repented and feels remorse i tell her if you are like this khalas what's gone is gone this woman like mary's was unable to live with the remorse burning and eating her heart she tried but she couldn't so the only way of salvation was to be purified and this is the first word she said to the prophet like mary's exact word o prophet of allah pure refinement meaning execute me and the prophet did not listen to her he looked the other way around he knew the whole story so i hope this answers the question sheikh what is your advice i'm reading the question again sheikh what is your advice suggestion regarding what is your advice suggestion regarding inter language marriage that is a spouse hailing from different mother tongue but sharing a common language sharing the common language and he knows two languages both of them they know english for example husband he knows tamil and wife has this has nothing to do language has nothing to do there is languages and there is body language in marriage body language is more important not only not only that not only that i personally do not encourage uh marriage from different countries now don't think that i am a nationalist or racist no i believe that marriage is something that is sacred and you have to have special qualities to make such a marriage succeed i've seen this in my family my brother is married to a woman from the netherlands my second brother was married to a woman a woman that was up uh was brought up in uk my cousin is married to an american my second cousin is married to a britisher so we have this marriage in our uh family the biggest problem is that when the woman moves to the country of the man usually it is extremely difficult it's torturing the woman she doesn't have any friends she doesn't have any relatives she doesn't have anyone to talk to and they don't speak her language what would the pressure be on the man he has to be her father her mother her family her friends and usually as i said before men do not have feelings and the marriage would break and maybe this is one of the reasons i did not marry from outside of my city because i wanted someone that knows my culture that knows how to treat my mother how to respect my mother which is the most important thing to me if my mother tells me something i'm going to obey it because i can marry as many as i want but i have only one mother so if she says one single negative word about my mother and i know my mother did not do her wrong yes if my mother was aggressor if my mother was the valim i would stand with her because allah does not approve of dull but i know my mother is a sweetheart and she doesn't do anything bad if one of them says anything bad about my mother it is doomsday to them eventually to me but not any at the beginning so you have to draw the line so the language is not a barrier the barrier is in the husband is he willing is he capable of providing for his wife a society an environment that would take the stress of her mind if yes mashallah go ahead if not take a look we have online questions is it permissible for the father of the daughter to look more than one man at the same time without giving reply to anyone of them like looking for another better man without giving reply to the first one even if he gave reply this is i will clear this even if he approves and gives a reply to someone and after a week or two someone else proposes and he thinks that he's better yes he can change his mind what is the ruling regarding the transgenders on marriage the problem the issue of transgenders you meaning to tell me someone who made an operation to change his sex right no they're referring to unique the natural how can it be natural if she's a girl female she's natural she's a girl if he's a boy natural he's a boy a transgender to my understanding my english is lousy i know maybe i did not understand is someone who changed your sex from male to female yeah some men have that femininity in them okay even yeah i understand my understanding of transgender is correct right surgical yes okay now we're going to come to the types of transcend trans genders one type is equipped with the equipment of the gender he wants to transform to meaning that a female has the hidden private parts of a male and the doctors say that surgically we can get this out and he can function it can function as a male this is permissible and this is originally a male so what the doctors do is show it out expose it a male that has the uterus that has everything inside of a female but it needs to be altered and changed surgically then this man is not a man originally he is a girl one would say you have a uterus yourself i usually say this say this because i have 13 girls two wives and a mother so my i'm growing a uterus by what i'm surrounded by no this is a joke very heavy joke at the end of the day yeah i tell the people that i swim in an ocean of ostriches because of all the girls around me so this is permissible because this surgical procedure is only revealing what allah has created the second type of transgenders is a fully male person all of a sudden he feels the tendency to be a little bit softer he feels a tendency to wear women clothes and high heels he shaves his legs and then he thinks that i have a lot of female hormones so what you want to do i want to and become a female so he's getting injected with female hormones and then surgically they try to mutilate him to be like a woman what is this after the surgery what is he he's a man but he doesn't have the private parts of a man anymore he's still a man likes it or whether he likes it or not can this marry another man no because inside he's a man outside he altered few features maybe with the hormones he grew some breasts but he still is a man and he cannot marry it get married same thing with the women women that cannot have this understood yes yes why yeah i asked the question okay you have any uh online questions one one question you take sure as a parent i am asking you should i tell the prospective groom that the bride will inherit well from the parents as a parent i'm asking you should i tell the prospective groom that the the bride will inherit wealth from the parents will inherit wealth from the parents why should i do this am i marketing my daughter yeah if someone is proposing should i tell him listen my friend i have a few millions in the bank and if i die your your wife will gonna be rich this i mean it's inappropriate i belie it's not haram maybe if you think that this would make him yeah and when he sees her before you before you see my daughter i don't want to be to be shocked but i'm going to tell you that i have a lot of money come my daughter but yeah he has money no i'll accept her this is not a good thing to do and men do not market their their daughters like this you don't go around and say that my daughter will inherit my daughter has no you mentioned the features that are true in her at the same time mention the things that are bad so do you will not be deceiving and you would not be portraying picture that would prove to be otherwise another noise no more questions i wind up for the day"
