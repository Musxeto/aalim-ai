  "transcript": "how are you I am doing great alhamdulillah so I have a question the question what is pray when I go regarding J J prayer okay so when I go for J sometimes like I go really early before the time before the time enters for J so I I don't know can I pray I see people praying a lot of RA before the IM comes before the time enters before the sun above the Horizon just after when the time ENT for so I see people a lot of prayers I don't know can they pray that or just the two that you're allowed to pray because after that after when the IM comes and says sometimes I people rise again after they already prayed their or more and then pray again so I want to know what many before okay uh I will answer you inshah first of all prayer Saturday through Thursday has four ra prescribed emphatic Sunnah before the F and two raas prescribed emphatic Sunnah after the F now in it is an exception there is an exception today is the day of surprises Mah everything is going out of order so what is the exception the exception is that it is part of the Sunnah whoever comes early for Friday that he prays how many raas he wants you want to pray two this is sufficient for you to sit down you want to pray 10 you want to pray 100 the sky is the limit why because the prophet am told us that this is part of the sunah for okay but we know that 10 minutes before the it is a time where it we should be not praying this is a Prohibition time yes but not for J there is no prohibition time for jum you pray all the way no problem second part of your question would be what about if the Imam comes and said and sits down and the starts to pray some people stand up to pray this is wrong what they're doing is an innovation they should sit down they must not pray the moment the IM says it's over it's done they don't pray and they just sit and listen and I hope this answers your question"
