  "title": "Can an old masjid be demolished or renovated? What to do with the old materials? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i was wondering if it's permissible to demolish a mosque with the intention to rebuild it better because sometimes the design of the original building is limited if they want to expand or it's very poorly poorly designed so is it okay to demand it in this case and through the materials of the original building have to be preserved first of all the issue of a masjid in islam this is called means that this particular thing whether it's a masjid whether it's a copy of the quran whether it is a well whether it is a cemetery or a graveyard the owner made this solely for the sake of allah so once i make this walk i cannot sell it i cannot give it as a gift and it cannot be inherited after my death this is the meaning of wakf and this is when we build a masjid it is a walk i can't come after 20 years and said the plot has quadrupled in price so i'm gonna demolish it and build a high riser and build a bigger masjid somewhere else nope this is not yours anymore the message is not yours anymore it belongs to allah having said that such a masjid that is for the sake of allah no one has control over it no one has a say in it except the muslim ruler and the muslim judge who was appointed by the ruler to do what if there's a need to demolish the masjid why because there is a need there's a highway that is crossing the area and all the muslims the engineers said that we need to build it this way or it will cause a great deal of hardship upon the muslim community or the masjid was built ages ago there are cracks in the wall it's gonna it's bound to fall or the authorities discovered a need to remove the masjid or it is so small for the community that it's not accommodating them in this case only the muslim ruler or the muslim judge or those representing the muslim community can look into it so if they came to a conclusion and a legitimate islamic conclusion that this masjid has to be demolished whether to be relocated or to build on the same spot which is the win-win something that is bigger and better and more uh capable of accommodating more muslims in this case it should be done what to do with the material the material that is usable it has to be used so the carpets we can't just simply ditch it out or give it to the poor no this has to be used in a masjid because it was wok for a masjid it must be used in another masjid maybe in some other poor country no problem maybe in the same message there's no problem the chandeliers the air conditionings the fans the electricity outlets etc all of these are walk they cannot be sold unless the muslim imam sees it fit to be sold and then use the money somewhere else in the new masjid and allah knows best you"
