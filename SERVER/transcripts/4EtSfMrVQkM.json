  "transcript": "oh my God you know in the subcontinent we have many people who follow the hanafi school of part blindly and then we call upon them to follow the tsunamis to respond that the people who are following the setups such as like they will give example like imams of haramaine um they followed uh Imam humble blindly so who should be respond to them first of all the imams of the Haram are not our role models they are like everyone else beside the point they are not blind followers of a school of thought the vast majority with the grace of Allah of the scholars of Saudi Arabia follow the salafi apida methodology of scrutinizing opinions from different schools of thought and following that which coincides with the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations not that their blind followers of hamberry ferkov uh school of thought or Maliki there are among them who are malikis there are among them who are hanafis but this is the origin of their practice not of what they're practicing at the moment a student of knowledge when he starts to study he does not become a salafi all of a sudden all of a sudden he has to pick a school of thought that he studies from a cover to cover until he masses it then he goes and scrutinize it with the Quran the Sunnah to know which is right among it which is 85 probably and which is wrong which is 15 to 20 and he adopts what is in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah they don't come out of thin air being salafis no they have to study a the books of a school of thought but afterwards what defines them is what they are actually practicing so don't argue with these blind followers whether in the subcontinent or elsewhere because it's fruitless yeah it's wasting time they don't want to listen to your dawa let them be focus on your own following of the Quran the Sunnah of trying to embrace what the prophet saws used to do as a role model and by doing so you have fulfilled your duty and people will follow you inevitably because they can see what is true and what is not an Allah Knows Best"
