  "title": "The etiquette of eating",
  "transcript": "as his question he says that if i'm eating and i'm almost full and someone gives me a plate of food and this happens you know when you're eating at somebody's house and they keep on pouring food for you until you're stuffed and you're full yet they give you another play to say try this so he says what what what should i do should i even what's the best would i uh overeat or finish the plate that i have or leave the the new food coming and not be full definitely the answer is you are not supposed to eat until you are uh full the prophet said in an authentic hadith it is sufficient for uh the son of adam few morsels that would straighten up his back meaning that when you're hungry you seem to cave in a little bit because of starving and and your stomach is empty but few morsels would make your back straight straightening up your back so the prophet says azam is sufficient for you to have few morsels but if you have to eat more than few morsels then you should divide and have one third for your food one third for your drink and one third for your breathing for the air to come in now unfortunately people keep on eating like beasts and when you tell the brother you're over eating said the prophet said one third one third one third each one of us know knows his third so i know what my capacity is and this is wrong because when you overeat you oversleep and you become lazy and would not be able to function properly"
