  "title": "Ruling on beating one's wife in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "atib says about the beating of a wife and he quoted a hadith in in the verse of the quran etc the general trend is that allah ordered men to be kind to their wives allah says in the quran you have to live with them in what is normal what is kind what is well known to people to be accepted you have a mother you have a wife you have a daughter you have a sister and you don't like people to deal with them harshly or in a violent way so this is the general trend however what goes behind closed doors is something that only the man and his wife are capable of handling there should be no outside interference because whenever there is interference from the families things go south also the prophet salallahu salaam told the companions that a lot of women visited my wives and complained to them of their husbands beating them by allah they are not from among the best of you meaning these men who beat their wives are not among the righteous the the pious those who are god feeding and this is a strong warning from the prophet allah now when we judge things we don't don't as muslims refer to the united nations we don't refer to the geneva convention we don't refer to man-made laws made by the disbelievers and the kafirs we refer to the quran and the sunnah so if you go to verse 34 chapter 4 i'm giving you the reference whom you fear their disobedience their rebellion what to do with them the women then you should advise them you should give them counseling you should remind them of allah of how bad this is how sinful it is and that they are doing something that allah does not love if this doesn't work then you have to abandon them but this is only regards of intimacy so you sleep with her on the same bed but you don't have any intimacy you don't hug her you don't kiss her you don't have any hanky-panky and this goes on like the issue of advising her for a while not for a day or two or for a moment or two maybe for a couple of weeks three weeks of advising didn't work then abandon being intimate with her for three four weeks this doesn't work then the last and third and final result is to beat them so allah doesn't say bring a a baseball bat to beat them up with it even bass when he who who is one of the great interpreters of the quran was asked how to beat them he said with this you see this this tweak if i beat myself with it i'm not gonna be affected he said you beat them without breaking a bone shedding blood leaving a mark and avoid the face what kind of beating is this my friend well this kind of beating is not meant to be physical it is meant to be sentimental something that would hurt her to open her eyes to see how this obedient she is and how bad as a wife she is after all the love my husband is beating me with a twig so this kind of beating is a form of reprimand not uh slapping her on the face not slapping on the shoulder and leaving marks of your fingers on this is not permissible it should not leave a mark on the body it should not shed blood it's only to reprimand and this is for the purpose of getting things back to normal rather than divorce and allah azzawajal knows best"
