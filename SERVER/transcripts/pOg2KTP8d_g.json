  "transcript": "um my parents are making me take take extra courses to increase my transis and getting into University uh but now I know I'm not going to go uh uni because of ribba and the FNA there but I'm too scared to tell my parents that so I'm acting like if I get accepted I'm going to go and if I don't get accepted I'm still trying to get good marks in the courses just to show my parents that I tried and didn't get in so my question is um am I sinful for not being able to help my parents around the house as much no you're not sinful in the sense that as long as your intention is not to displease Allah if I understood your question correctly you don't want to go to UNI because of the student loan and in order to go to UNI you have to prepare for an admission test and this requires taking additional courses and you are intending not to do well in these courses so that you don't make good grades which would deprive you from entering such a university and by uh um default not get these interest based loans if this is your intention skipping Shores At Home due to your absence for this particular period of time is negligible and you're not sinful for that of course it's much easier timec consuming and saves money for these additional courses to confront your parents and say to them upfront and be firm and uh steadfast in telling them that I do not want to go to UNI not only that I will not go to UNI due to these interest based loans and you have to be firm in what you're saying not well I think it's Haram maybe I it's not good maybe Allah no when you are are reluctant or hesitant they will pressure you but when you say it without any hesitation and you firm in it they will not be happy but they will accept your decision at the end of the day and Allah Knows Best"
