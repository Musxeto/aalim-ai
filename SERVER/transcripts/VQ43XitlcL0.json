  "transcript": "uh she my question is that is it obligatory honest to uh follow the policies for that we agree to on certain websites that don't go against the Quran and Sunnah but uh for example if there is a app that says that you cannot post uh duplicate ads of the stuff that you are selling so let's say I'm selling something that's that I've used in the past and I'm selling a used thing and this say that you cannot post duplicate ads to make more uh more people see the same ad again and again so it would get the it would get more reach but it's against their policy so is it obl uh mandatory Hors to follow such rules the prophet said Muslims are committed to their conditions they're bound to their conditions so you have to honor your word Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe fulfill your contracts so you have to fulfill your obligations as long as it doesn't go against Islam in the first place but if you agree to utilize an app or a website for your advantage and you're utilizing it and you want to do this against their rules though they're doing this service for you it's unethical Muslims don't do such cheap stuff and they lie just for an extra buck and Allah Knows Best"
