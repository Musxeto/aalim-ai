  "transcript": "says that can an animal be slaughtered by a non-muslim in the in the presence of a Muslim who says bismillah before the animal is slaughtered but the one who slaughters is non-muslim you have to explain this non-muslim is what what religion does he follow as Muslims we cannot eat any animal that is slaughtered unless the person slaughtering it is a Muslim a Jew or a Christian so if you get any other religion to slaughter for you this is a dead meat you cannot eat it even if he says Allah bismillah Allahu Akbar and recite surat al fatiha and sort of the bucket as well doesn't change a thing because we are only allowed to eat one of these three people's slaughtering Muslims Jews or Christians so these animals that they slaughter we can eat from it providing that they say bismillah al akbar and if a person is in the presence of a Buddhist for example and the Buddhist is slaughtering and they don't slaughter usually is against their religion but hypothetically and you say bismillah bismillah bismillah and he slaughters this doesn't count the person who's slaughtering should say this now the Jews and Christians we don't hear them say the smilla well this is sufficient as long as we do not hear them say in the name of Jesus in the name of the Holy Cross in the name of the Holy See or the holy ocean or the holy river as long as it we do not hear them say these things then they're slaughtering is permissible as long as you don't mention any other than the name of allah azzawajal"
