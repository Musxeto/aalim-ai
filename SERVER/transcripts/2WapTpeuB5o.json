  "transcript": "thank you inshallah Sheikh I will be going for umrah from the 24th of October to the 29th of October I'll be in Makkah and I was just wondering um if there is a specific uh Masjid that you visit where one can come and listen to your lecture in person at the moment I do not give any sermons or lectures in Masjid I only limit this to TV channels and to zoom workshops and to traveling to other countries but maybe if I would be in Mecca at that time because I'm planning to go to Mecca in couple of weeks time inshallah if I am there we may have a cup of coffee if we get to meet one another inshallah and may Allah make things easy for us all"
