  "transcript": "ald Hadith number 227 yes brother narrated AB in his last Hajj the prophet sallallah alai wasallam performed TA of the Kaaba riding a camel and pointed a bent headed stick towards the corner Blackstone in this Hadith what can we learn from that we learn that the prophet performed his tawa riding a camel which means that when needed a person can ride while doing the tawa nowadays it is almost impossible to ride so it is impossible though to be carried they have special beds like for those who are unable to make ta and four men carry it or to be in a wheelchair and if a person does that without any need his reward gets less but his ta is correct so why did the prophet make ta the scholars say that on that day sallallah alaihi wasallam people wanted to learn from the prophet and maybe ask him questions and if he was on foot that would have been a little bit difficult so he had to make his Ta on his camel so that if anyone needed a question they can see him and communicate with him and also it would be safer for him Alat not to walk and also it would be possible for those far away to learn by seeing him making so whenever he comes to thead he faces thead and says allahar orar this is all part of the Sunnah and he had what is known as a and a is a stick with a bent top and people use this either to collect things or to snatch things or for the camel for the ride and they can use this for many different reasons so again this reiterates the fact that if you cannot kiss it the black stone then you touch it with your hand and kiss your hand if not then you touch it with a stick if you had or an umbrella providing that you would not harm people nowadays it is almost impossible not to harm people if you have a stick or an umbrella and you would like to go and touch the black stone you probably poke couple of people's eyes and maybe injure three or four on the way back so this is not recommended unless it is possible moving on to the following Hadith Hadith of Abdullah Omar I will read this he said that I've have not seen the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam touching except the two yemenite corners and that is the ones facing Yemen touching of what of the Kaa and we spoke about this last time and we said that IB Abbas advised muaah may Allah be pleased with them not to touch anything except these two corners the black stone and the corner before it which is the yemeni corner and they're called yemeni corner because in Arabic we sometimes call two things with the name of one instead of saying Abu Bakr and Omar we say the two Omar this is in Arabic so usually You' find in Arabic saying that the two om came and you think my God who are the second om I know who's the second one the Arab says no no no we are referring to Abu Bakr and likewise they say the two moons and they're referring to the Moon and the Sun and in the Hadith of when she said that fire would not be lit in the houses of the Prophet for cooking for two consecutive months we would see the Crescent then the Crescent then the Crescent two months and Zu said my aunt or my mother because she is his aunt his mother is Asma so he asked her my mother as the mother of the Believers what did you feed on she said the two blacks and then explained dates and water so this is in Arabic water is water black no this is known in Arabic as enforcement or reinforcement of one over the other so this is known in Arabic and this is also displayed here moving on to the chapter that deals with and now we're going to talk about the different types of ha the first Hadith is Hadith number 229 I asked about he ordered me to perform it I asked him about the the sacrifice he said you have to slaughter a camel a cow or a sheep or you may share the with the others it seemed that some people disliked it that is thej I slept and dreamed as if a person was announcing and accepted I went to abas and narrated it to him he said Allah is greater that was the tradition of Abu Alim that is prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in this Hadith Abu Jam asked CL regarding which is one of the types of ha and I'll explain it inshallah to you so that you would understand it without any problem but you have to comprehend it and understand it so that you would not forget it so IB Abbas told him that yes there is sacrifice and before that he said yes there is mut why did he ask him because there was a dispute among the companions whether to offer mut or not and some companions such as Omar may Allah be pleased with him and other companions did not recommend it and we will come to know why inshallah and then he asked him about the sacrifice he told him you should do a camel a cow a sheep these are not mandatory huh it's mandatory for you to have 17th of a cow 1 7th of a camel or a sheep but he's telling him that if you want to sacrifice a whole camel this is good and a whole cow this is good but one sheep if not then 17th of Dimension two and then Abu jamra says that I had the knowledge that there are people who did not like it such as Omar may Allah be pleased with him so I slept and had a dream and in my dream a man came to me congratulating me saying to me that mallah Haj ma accepted Hajj and the mut is also accepted and when I woke up and I relayed this and I told Abbas about my vision my dream he was happy and he said allahar a sign of happiness and he said that this is the Sunnah of abim the prophet alam's name nickname is Abul kasim that is why at his life it was forbidden to call someone his name and to use his nickname to call someone his name Muhammad this was permissible but not to give him the same nickname because then this would not be appropriate at the lifetime of the Prophet Alat wasam and that is why while the prophet was walking in the street once he heard someone saying abim so the prophet turned around and said yes and the man said no I did not mean you he was calling someone else Abu kasim so the prophet Alam forbade them from using that nickname during his lifetime after his death you can call abim as you wish so what are the types of Hajj that we have there are three main types and I don't know if the time allows me but I will explain as much as possible inshallah there is and the person doing it is called there is and the person doing it is known as and there is and the person doing it is called so these are the three types of Hajj we will elaborate a little bit more after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaykum and welcome back so what is the difference between and Scholars say that is the best of the three because it involves making a separate and then you cut your hair and you wear your normal clothes you do everything that was forbidden before if you have a wife you can have intimacy you can perfume you can clip your nails you clip your hair you do whatever you wish wear normal clothes on the eth of which is known as the day of you wear your and make t of ha and you perform your normal rituals of Hajj with the pillars of Hajj and the pillars of Hajj Isam is to to stand on the day of is to offer which is the pillar of and this is what and they are exactly the same in every action they do for Hajj with the exception that the intention is different and that thein has to sacrifice an animal what do you mean that the intention is different the intends that is embedded in his Haj though he does not offer a separat and cut no it is hidden it is embedded and he gets the reward of both and he sacrifices on the 10th day of hij the MU does exactly the same but he does not sacrifice and there is no om for him now the three almost share the same acts of Hajj beginning from E onwards what do you mean I mean that the three and they must on the eth of the do the same rituals approximately in the sense that they go to mina on the 8th they spent the day there until the 9th of which is the morning OFA they go to arafa all of them the three and they spend the day there until Sunset and they move froma after Sunset to mifa and they spend the night there in mifa until the break of dawn after praying fer they go all to Mina and they throw the stones or the pibbles of one of the three jar which is the biggest one only one on the 10th and then they slaughter their sacrifice they shave their hair and they offer and and by this their Haj would be completed they have mandatory things left and that is the 10th of they must sleep and spend the night in Mina the following day the 11th after the aan of they must throw the three pibbles the smallest the middle and the biggest or the largest and then they spend the night until the morning of the 12th after Za after the aam they throw the three pibbles again and they have a choice either to leave or to spend the 13th as well but it's up to them to leave or not and they have to leave before sunset on the 12th they go to Mecca they offer the farewell and they leave outside mecah to jeda or to their country or to wherever or they stay it's up to them but if they stay the last thing that they should do is making the farewell ta before they leave mekah this is Hajj very simple there are few technicalities here and there that make it a little bit different but I will not go into these technicalities now now so that after we read a number of hadiths and you comprehend this and we repeat this process again and again then we mention some of the things that you can do the following Hadith is Hadith of IB Omar may Allah be pleased with him and it's a long Hadith we need someone to read it yes Muhammad Abdullah reported Allah's messenger sallallahu Al wasallam observed in by offering umah to the Hajj and gave sacrifice so he drove the sacrificial animals with him from Zila Allah's messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam pronounced Talia for umra and then pronounced Talia for Haj and the people performed Tatu in the company of Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam they put onam for um first and then for Hajj some of them had sacrificial animals which they had had brought with them whereas some of them had none to sacrifice so when Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam came to Makkah he said to the people he who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj and he who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circum ulate the house and run between Al Safa and al- marwa and clip his hair and put off theam and then again put on theam for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals but he who does not find the sacrificial animal he should observe fast for 3 days during the Hajj and for 7 days when he returns to his family Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam circumambulated the house when he came to makah he first kissed the corner of the Caba containing the black stone then walked quick in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits and then when he had finished the circum ulation of the house he observed two raas of prayer at the station of ibraim and departed and came to assafa and walked seven times between assafa and al- marwa after that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice 10th of zh and then went back and performed circum ambulation of the house known as ta after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam had done now this is a description of the pilgrimage of the Prophet Alat wasam and Scholars differed what did the prophet performed did he perform did he perform or did he perform in the beginning the prophet wanted to perform in the sense that he wanted to make a but then he was informed that whoever drove and took out with him his Hadi his sacrifice animals cannot at all cut his hair wear his normal clothes until the sacrifice is slaughtered so the prophet when they came to Mecca he told them those among you who had driven their Hadi should remain on their you cannot make and wear your normal clothes because you have driven your Hadi those who didn't drive and bring with them the sacrificed animal you should make and cut your hair clip your hair and not wear your normal clothes until the eth of and another narration they said oh prophet of Allah you're telling us to become Halal again to take off the after our om though we came for Haj what kind of Halal what kind of things that we permitted to do and the prophet said every single thing that was unlawful for you because of the state of after your because you did not take the had with you you can do everything so the scholars differed what was the type ofam did the prophet commit the most authentic opinion and has supported this opinion like his she like all our Shak that the prophet was doing qiran and why was he doing qiran because the person who's doing Quan cannot change cannot become Halal again unless he Slaughters his animal and the prophet had his sacrifice with him and he said in another Hadith when people said but what about you why should we make omah and you're not making om and wearing your normal clothes he said that I had wished that I did not bring with me the Hadi so that I can make and stay all this period wearing normal clothes doing normal things and on the eighth I would wear my Haram again why do Scholars say that this is much better than and that is they say because you're making two rituals a separate and a separate Hajj in one journey and this is the value of it while Kiran he's doing one ritual in one journey and likewise mu is doing one ritual in one Journey so they say that this is the best of the rituals which the prophet hoped and wished that he would have done some Scholars say the best of all rituals isan not why they said because this is what Allah chose for the prophet and Allah does not choose anything except the best for the prophet but they answered them back by saying if it was the best the prophet would not have wished that that he did not bring the sacrifice and so he would have made a omra like them so wishing something means that it is a better stage nowadays it is very rare if not difficult to find or impossible to find to find people coming and bringing their sacrifice with them so you don't find people coming from India and having their sacrifice with them although this is possible I've seen people in Hajj coming from Yemen and coming from outside of Mecca carrying their sheep or goat on their back I've seen this with my own eyes and this is a sign of glorifying Allah because the sacrifice is not just meat it is a form of worshiping Allah by driving your sacrifice for the sake of Allah and it's a lot of trouble yet this is what the prophet did on the Hajj of farewell Hajj the prophet sacrificed how many a 100 camels he slaughtered 63 with his own hand and gave the knife to Ali to continue or to complete the 37 and these sacrifice are for the sake of Allah the meat what will happen to it it will go to the poor people and you will probably eat a portion of it but you will give the rest to the people so the these are the things that the prophet Alat did we will elaborate a little bit more inshallah but I'm afraid that we have to depart and inshallah when we meet next time we'll elaborate a little bit more and until then"
