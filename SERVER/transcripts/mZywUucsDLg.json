  "title": "I want to look for a muslim International husband to do hijrah, what steps to take? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I want to look internationally for a husband because I want to make hedra to that country and want someone native to the area so what steps should I take to ensure I don't uh end up making any transgressions keeping in mind that my family isn't Muslim so I'm not sure what exactly their role would be in this process this is very difficult to answer because it's like playing Russian rouette you never know when the bullet would be in the chamber applying for an international husband through these websites is a difficult and hard and long process when people apply for a job not necessarily all the information they write in their CV would be correct and likewise when they go for an interview so many people are good in faking it and pretending to be the person they're not really are so it is difficult to go for this internationally I would highly recommend that you choose someone from your locality and that would be much safer because you can check on him and ask the people in the Masjid in the community at the workplace that that would make it easy for you to draw a portrait of his personality and what kind of a person he is and after that if there is in it and you get guys you um are on the same page you can then see whether going for Hijra is an option with him or not and then you can decide whether to go ahead with the marriage or not and Allah Knows Best"
