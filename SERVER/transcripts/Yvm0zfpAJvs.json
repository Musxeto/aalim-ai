  "title": "Masjid does dua & dhikr in congregation with lights off, can I join them? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh she my friend is being invited to go to a Masid that does and Dua in congregations and they turn off the lights what's the ruling on joining them most likely this is a Sufi Masjid that is doing such rituals and claiming that by turning off the lights they are getting closer to Allah and this is an innovation by no yeah doubt there's no doubt in that they're definitely not doing light saving or uh uh you know cons they're conservative with the energy and the and the electricity of the Masjid so this approach is definitely not part of the Sunnah and she must not join such a Masjid or congregation because they're based on B and Innovation and Allah Knows Best"
