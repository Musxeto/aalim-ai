  "title": "Can a husband take zakat of his wife's gold or cash? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so she I had a question so what if a person let's say has a source of income let's say he's salaried but he has a lot of expenses to take care of um and he has a lot of debts and by the end of the month um his salary is almost zero or he only manages to make little savings so is this person eligible to receive the zakat money from her uh from his wife on her gold if this person is unable to make ends meet which means that at the end of the month he has zero in his hand yet he needs to buy groceries to pay the rent to pay electricity bills but he cannot afford this then he's illegible to take his wife's uh zakat on her gold or on her cash and Allah Knows Best"
