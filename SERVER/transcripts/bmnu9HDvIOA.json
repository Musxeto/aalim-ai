  "transcript": "and thanking allah subhanahu wa ta'ala for all his numerous favors and bounties which he has bestowed upon us we ask of him the almighty to confess jesus peace blessings and salutations upon our beloved messenger and leader the guide upon his noble family his last companions his noble wives and all those to follow in pursuit of his footsteps of guidance referred to as his political mythology and way of life we welcome each and every single one of you my dear brothers and sisters in islam wherever you may be watching us right now throughout the world and alhamdulillah we thank and praise allah for allowing us to come together once more this evening for a very very important topic we know that indeed we are living in times of trials and tribulations whereby the ummah is always facing a lot of them and we ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to make our task easy upon us and that as believers we remain firm and committed always dedicated to our faith our loyalty to our religion to our lord subhanahu and to our beloved messengers as we all know recently we have come across and witnessed globally that there is a dislike and there have been many insults and degrading comments leveled at our beloved messenger from certain spheres and corners or regions of the globe and so likewise when these particular occasions do arise it is our duty as believers to remain firm to stand up and to be committed towards honoring and preserving not only islam but the quran the book of allah and his speech and the way of the life of muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam as the honorable messenger which allah wa ta'ala has sent to guide this particular ummah so alhamdulillah this evening we are indeed very honored to have put forward and put together a beautiful and important program in light and in respect of this and that is the prophetic legacy of muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam series of quran in cape town south africa and the theme for this particular week which will be discussed and more elaborated upon by our esteemed guests who are joining us shortly that is none other than the verse of the quran has mentioned and highlighted to us whereby he says [Music] indeed we have exalted we have raised high your mention and therefore my dear brothers and sisters in islam we find that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has indeed been aided by allah he is victorious by way of his lord most high and majestic despite the naysayers and the comments and the mocking and the allegations and the insults against our beloved messenger has told us we will surely support our messengers that was in the case in reference to all of the messengers [Music] we will support them and those who believe during this world as well as in the afterlife but with respect particularly to our beloved messenger allah [Music] we indeed will suffice you against the mockers against those who make estes they mock you they scoff at you they belie the message that you come with they throw allegations against you and allah subhanahu wa is already told he is beloved he says save you and protect you from the people so from this before we move on with our discussion this evening let us be reminded that it is our duty as believers it is part and parcel of the tenets of faith of iman that we as believers uphold and that in our words to defend prophets for not only to believe in him as the slave and the messenger of allah but that we defend his only reputation allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has already defended him but allah subhanahu wa allah has caused it to be such that we too honor we respect we revere him we hold the messenger in high esteem as a result of it being a test from allah jalla upon us so we hope and pray that this is indeed a task which is made easy upon us that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala grants us the ability to uphold these principles and these religious values and etiquettes to the best that we can allah my dear brothers and sisters it gives us great honor and pleasure this evening once more to be joined by a very special guest or for those of you who do regularly watch our programs and not only our programs but for joining us this evening we appreciate your time as always we ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and baraka in our gathering in our speech and in this unlike symposium tonight i mean so shaytan as we have heard in the introduction we are speaking about the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the importance as we have asked yourself to discuss the topic of the obligation they withdrew the obligation of defending and upholding the honor of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the life of a believer so we hand over to foreign first of all the topic of such an obligation to defend the prophet salallahu before addressing it someone may rightfully ask why should we defend the prophet allah why should we honor the prophet alaihis salatu and this question is probably asked by billions of human beings on earth and they have all the all the right to ask because they're not muslims so for non-muslims and for ignorant muslims to honor the prophet hallelujah they must know him and if you make a survey around the world you'll find that the people's knowledge about the prophet is less than point zero zero zero one percent and this is shocking to see so much ignorance about the most influential person to have ever walked the earth and this is not said by a muslim it's also shared by non-muslims so who was the prophet beside being a messenger and a prophet of allah as the muslims claim what was he like sad even asked mother aisha the wife of the prophet isalam and she said o mother of the believers tell me about the character of the prophet alaihis islam she said don't you read the quran he said yes i do she said then the character of the prophet allah saw was the quran what does that mean imam now he says this means that he acted in accordance with the quran adhering to its limits following its etiquette paying heed to its lessons and parables pondering its meanings and recycling reciting it properly this is how your character becomes the quran let's look at those who described the prophet allah what did they say they said that he was the most forbearing among the people the most courageous the most fair and just and he was the most chaste among the people never ever in his life touched a woman who's not his wife who is not his mahram who is not his right hand possession the prophet allah is during his day time used to fix his sandals patch his garments serve his wives and he was the most bashful of all people he would answer the invitation of the rich and the poor the free and the slaves and he would accept any gift even if it were as little as a drink of milk yet he would reward those who gave it to him with something better he would never eat from charity because he was a prophet yet he was never arrogant or too proud to accept the invitation of a poor person or a slave he would become angry only for the sake of allah and not for his own sake he would execute what is right even if this brings harm to himself and to his companions never ever in his life did he ever beat a woman or a child he used to starve days because he did not have food and he used to tie a stone on his stomach he would not be too proud to eat anything that is halal even if it were the hoofs of a ram or some barley with stinking ghee that was presented to him whatever invited to a feast he would attend he would visit the sick he would follow the funerals and he would walk alone between his frozen enemies without anyone guarding him he was the most humble of people he was he was filled with tranquility without any arrogance he was the most eloquent and given the concise of speech without prolonging his talks he did not care for anything in this life in this world whatever he found he used to wear sometimes walking in his sandals sometime walking barefooted sometimes he may walk without a cloak or without a turban or anything on his head which was custom among the arabs he used to be so humble that he could not care whether he's wearing something on his head or not he would ride whatever there was available without any arrogance without any pride without showing off so he would ride a camel he would ride a horse he would ride a donkey a mule and if he found someone who needed a ride he would also invite him to ride behind him he used to love beautiful fragrances and used to abhor and hate any foul smell nobody ever smelled anything foul from him he sits with the poor he eats with the needy and he honors people for their character and any of his next of kin he would be kind to them he would connect their kinship without preferring them over someone who's better than them whenever someone did something wrong and apologized he would accept his apology he used to joke with his companions but never ever lie he would joke saying truth he would laugh or let us rephrase that he would smile without breaking into laughter and he would see people play lawful games and he would approve of that and he would not reprimand them for it he would raise his wife as reported a number of times and he would play with them his time was always filled either with something for the sake of allah or something for the betterment of his life never ever he was idle doing nothing he would never look down upon a poor person for his poverty he would never resent a sick person for his illness and he would never fear a king for his kingdom he's forgiving he forgave those who killed his uncle hamza and who killed his companions and mutilated them and set them all free he encourages his companions to forgive and to pardon as he did with abu bakr may allah be pleased with him when his cousin masta slandered his own daughter abu bakr's daughter who was the wife of the prophet alaihis salatusam he slandered her yet the prophet encouraged abu bakr to forgive him he would be in the most sacred place of all in the masjid and a nomad comes and urinates in the middle of the masjid his companions want to beat him up the prophet says leave him leave him after he finishes he calls him and he advises him in a very kind and gentle fashion he had nine wives at a time and they were so jealous they caused a lot of headache and problems for him yet he never faced their jealousy with other than love compassion and mercy and he was always just and fair between them all when he spoke the words came sweeter than honey he was easy going nice person to be with never rude never aggressive never saying foul things he was proud without arrogance he was strong without violence he was merciful without weakness he hears aisha swearing and cursing the jews for saying bad things to the prophet and he reprimands the jews and he says to her allah does not like someone who uses foul language she said don't you hear what they're saying oh prophet of allah he says yes i do here they make dua and supplicate against me and i say alaikum so allah answers my supplication and does not answer this and he does not have to go out of his way to show them that he had heard what they said and that he knows what they intended so this is in arabic known as which is in english looking the other way and the prophet islam did a number of incidents this way so that he would not pick up on people why did you do this why didn't you do that like we usually do he was asked once o prophet of allah the servant who's a slave working for us how many times should we pardon him per day so the prophet said allah you should pardon him 70 times a day 70 times if your servant makes a mistake move on pardon it look the other way we hold a court healing for our servant or a driver or a maid if they ever make a mistake that's why ana malik may allah be pleased with him accompanied the prophet alaihi salazar for ten years never ever the prophet asked him why didn't you do so and so for something that anas did or ask him shouldn't you have done so and so for something he did not do he would always move on look the other way and not stop and question anna's for everything that he did or he did not do now if we were to take the rest of the night just stalking and speaking about the prophet salallahu's virtues and beautiful attributes and how he lived and how he communicated with his people it wouldn't be sufficient the whole night wouldn't be sufficient but it is important for us especially in the midst of this vicious attack specifically upon the prophet and on islam in general it is important that we discuss a number of issues number one allah azzawajal has exalted the mentioning of the prophet alaihis where allah says in the quran and raised high for you your repute so the reputation of the prophet the name of the prophet is exalted to the extent that no one can undermine this or look down upon our prophet was salaam and if you watch and look around you you will find that the name and the reputation the repute of the prophet saws is mentioned 24 hours seven days a week around the globe there is not a single corner of the earth that his name is not being mentioned all the lines of the longitude and altitude or whatever they call them there is always a place where muslims call the athan five times a day and they make the ikama five times a day every single inch of this earth round the clock worldwide is always mentioned so he doesn't need us to stand up for his honor or to defend him he doesn't need us it is us who need it he doesn't need us to say anything whether it was a french frog or a danish pastry who cares his repute and name has been exalted and raised those who dared and said things about him look at them the danish cartoons 2005. show me one person that knows who steered that campaign or those who drew these heinous drawings nobody knows that they all went into the trash can of history look at those who abused the prophet is among the idol worshipers 15 centuries ago does anybody know their names no rarely you'll find someone calling their names but tell me and show me someone who does not know the prophet alaihis and who does not know his biography his seerah everybody knows it so the prophet doesn't need us it is we who need to stand firm for his reputation and to honor him otherwise life has no meaning one of the companions of the prophet islam was captivated was held as a prisoner of war and was about to be executed the leader of the idol worshippers at the time he was a mushrik may allah appears with him he accepted islam later on he said to that companion would you hope and wish that you are back in medina surrounded by your children with your wife in your home safe and sound and the prophet sallam is being here in your place to be executed would you like a swap like this do you have any remorse do you have any regret what did the companion say he said by allah i would not want to be among my children and family with my wife in the warmth of my house while the prophet allah islam in his house being pricked by a thorn in his foot not to be executed even a single thorn to be pricking his foot i would not want to be with my family no i'd rather be beheaded and executed rather than him getting a single thorn in his foot this is the love of the com of the companions to the prophet isalam and this is the love we have towards our prophet alaihis salatwa one point that we have to note is that when the prophet allah was sent to humanity allah azzawajal took the people out of the darkness into the light through the prophet so the prophet was the one who united the people he was the one who made all the people come in solidarity united under the flagship of there is no god worthy of being worshipped but allah and that prophet muhammad sallallahu is his servant and messenger so they all united underneath this flagship the beautiful thing is that after these drawings of charles hebdo resurfaced again and the french official stands that we will defend these drawings and these drawings are part of our democracy and not only that they have posted it on government buildings challenging the affection and the love of the muslims worldwide why are they doing this well their action brought hell on their heads with the grace of allah we've seen again how the prophet was managed or how allah azzawajal made the people through their love to the messenger of of islam sallallahu come together unite and show their solidarity by boycotting these french products and goods and in five or six days today he came on one of the arab channels declaring that you guys misunderstood what i said listen to what you said now after you've tasted the same medicine that you've been given to people where is your arrogance where is your pride why didn't you apologize from the beginning don't apologize why didn't you keep your mouth shut some people say why don't you condemn the killing of that teacher somewhere who showed these heinous drawings to the students part of freedom of speech no muslim to my knowledge or scholar or ruler did not condemn it every single person had condemned it yeah yeah but why don't you condemn it i would condemn it if they would condemn the drawings said no no the drawings is part of their freedom of speech well i have my freedom of silence once you condemn the drawings and you say that's a heinous act it is prohibited by law in everywhere whether it's the prophet muhammad or jesus christ or moses any messenger of allah once you make this a crime we will be more than happy to denounce any terrorist attack but why is it always us who have to defend our religion though we did not do anything no no no you have to condemn this attack okay okay i'm ready to condemn it are you ready to condemn the drawings said no this is part of our freedom of speech well bad news nobody's gonna stay with you in the same room to discuss how evil such acts are when you praise your heinous drawings that depict the prophet alaihis salatu now this solidarity that the muslim ummah all over the world has expressed it shows you that the muslims are strong that the muslims are united when it comes to the love of the prophet and there will be of course few hypocrites here and there saying something else in order to support their regime in order to support their thrones in order to support their economy but nobody listens to them alhamdulillah thirdly the prophet salazar lived among the arabs among his people among the jews among the idol worshippers as a prophet and and messenger for 23 years 13 years in mecca 10 years in medina that is a long time 23 years is a long time it's history and it is sufficient to expose any liar or any imposter if someone were to accuse him of that so he would have been exposed see you can fool everyone some of the time and you can fool some people all of the time but you can never fool everyone all the time to manage to fool all of humanity for 23 years this is impossible so what is it that you dislike about the prophet islam in the midst of this ocean of his beautiful character and attributes what is it that you don't like he lived among us for 23 years everything is documented how he dealt with people how he preached people how he dealt with his enemies so what is it that you don't like about him if you were to look at the beauty of his religion if you were to look at the impact of his religion islam is the fastest growing religion in the world without any dispute the people are embracing islam like crazy despite these organized campaigns filled with hatred and enmity against islam yet the muslim the people are accepting islam why because it's from allah it's not man-made because they see the benefits of islam which is crystal clear to anyone even to those who are blind but they are blinded by the light of islam of the quran and i don't want to take much time than the time was allocated to me it is part of the duty of a muslim to stand firm through his understanding of the quran the sunnah and the understanding of the righteous predecessors to act and behave accordingly boycotting the french products is something that is founded in the sunnah when utah may allah be pleased with him decided to boycott the idol worshipers and prevent them from receiving a single piece of grain until the prophet sallam approves of it and once they felt the hunger and the need for brain the idol worshippers sent invoice to the prophet sallam seeking mercy so the prophet pardoned them and asked for mama to continue trading with them and sending them wheat and grain this is how oh this is the language they understand when you hit them where it hurts in their economy and insha allah the coming week we will see them on their knees asking for forgiveness pledging not to go back to their evil ways of insulting our prophet eliza we don't want you to embrace islam we don't want you to accept islam just leave the muslims alone leave their quran alone leave their prophet alone you have been harassing the muslims for decades you have killed more than a million martyrs in algiers you have done heinous things in africa and your atrocities are well known your freedom dictates that if a woman wants to go topless in can or knees they could deserve it's okay but if a chaste righteous woman wants to wear the niqab it is against humanity against freedom of speech against blah blah blah and she pays a fine if a person dances with an mahram hugs her embraces her touches her it's okay it's freedom but if a muslim man refrains from shaking hands with an mahram woman you take him to court you find him and maybe you put him in prison what kind of nonsense is this so you guys have their own religion keep it we have our own religion don't cross the red line you have no right to insult our prophet when you don't know him and this hatred of yours would only cause problems for all of the world for all of us so inshaallah within a week they will come to their knees and we have to only accept to go back to into uh uplifting the embargo and and the boycotting if they were to commit not to insult the prophet islam or any other messenger of allah publicly and to consider that to be a crime imagine if someone would were to talk about the holocaust or to talk about the jews to put him in prison where is my freedom of speech i would like to speak as you say it's it's my freedom of speech they'll put you in prison but when the prophet islam is insulted this is okay no it's not okay now the reason of all of this is to incriminate islam so this young man uh from chechnya who killed the teacher was 21 years of age the other one who attacked the church in nice was also in his uh 20s early 20s none of them was known to be affiliated with a muslim with a masjid or with an islamic center or with a sheikh none of them were known to be affiliated to islam yet he's a muslim terrorist but the man who attacked a muslim congregation with a knife who's french and catholic he's described as a right-wing extremist why don't you say he's a catholic he's a christian and the two women who stabbed two hijabi women near the eiffel tower also it is a right-wing extremist what did you say they're christians why don't you attribute the atrocities that the hindus are doing to hinduism in india or that person who killed the muslims the 50 plus in new zealand why don't you say that he was a christian why do you deprive associating their religion to their terrorist attacks while any tom dick or harry who has an arab name or who is a muslim by name you attach terrorism to islam and you say islamic terrorism this shows you that there is something intended that is to attack islam to tarnish the reputation of islam so anyone who does something if he's a muslim then this is islam if he's a non-muslim then he is either a right-wing extremist he is a a terrorist he is a lunatic but you never attributed to their religion so to conclude we are still fighting a war and the war is not over yet muslims have to be steadfast to hold their grounds soon you will see solidarity of the disbelievers to one another i would not be surprised if tomorrow denmark or holland or belgium would come up and say we are uh standing with france and we are publishing these drawings just to show them that we have our freedom of speech they're politicians the dirtiest people on earth are politicians they're doing this not for the sake of freedom of speech rather to win votes to provoke muslims to fuel the hatred between the religions and they will get what they ask for so even if you see such countries joining forces with them remain steadfast we have many other alternatives and believe me we're not going to die if we do not use their beauty products or we do not use their perfumes we have to stand firm never go weak never feel bored of defending the honor of the prophet alaihis salat hoping that if we do so that allah would honor us and allah would make us among those who are resurrected on the day of judgment under his flagship sallallahu alaihi wasallam finally allah said in surat what translates to if you do not aid him that is the prophet allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out of mecca as one of two that is abu bakr and himself when they were in the cave and he prophet muhammad said to his companion do not grieve indeed allah is with us and allah says and allah sent down his tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers that is angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieve the lowest while the word of allah that is the highest so the word of those who disbelieve will always be the lowest and those or the word of allah and those who follow and obey allah would be always the highest islam was allah sheikh al-simma hakim hafiz love to allah for joining us this evening and rendering those beneficial words of advice we hope and pray that it is a means of us understanding who our noble prophet salallahu and at the same time that we are able to uphold uh these injunctions within the quran within his noble sunnah and he is and generally bettering ourselves as believers towards understanding who this noble prophet of ours was may allah make that an easy task for us and a successful one for the letter asim we have one question that has come in which uh some may view as a bit interesting in the sense of its sequence and the questioner has asked and says my question is regarding the popular concept of defending the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and using symbolism to spread more awareness of how he should be respected i feel as though these protests are making it more about defending the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam's honor instead of defending allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala's right to be worshipped is it permissible for us to be making this much effort for the to respect our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the evidence regarding as to what i'm concerned is the ayah in surah 73 ayah 10 and endure with patience whatever people may say against you and avoid them with a calmly avoidance and then the question also uses as reference a hadith i urge you to use or to adhere to my sunnah and the way of the rightly guided kulafar the caliphs and beware of newly invented matters for every newly invented matter is innovation and every innovation is going astray narrated by abu dhabi classed also told us not to make a fuss over him as the christians did i heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam saying do not exaggerate in praising me as the christians praised the son of mary for i am only a slave so call me the slave of allah and his apostle and his apostle then of course with all of this being said where do we know to stop making it so much about muhammad sallallahu alaihi is right to be respected and more about allah subhanahu wa but i believe that the brother is a bit confused and if you don't mind me saying i'm an old man he's a little bit delusional are you crazy the prophet alaihis salat was right is part of allah's right if you don't stand up for the prophet you don't stand up for allah so as if you're saying that when someone makes a course in the masjid about uh seer of the prophet salaam you stand up and say hey wait wait wait you should talk about allah's beautiful names and attributes duh why should i do that this is a specific class in the seer of the prophetic assumption yeah but in order to glorify allah what are you doing we're not mixing wrong things together glorifying allah tawheed of allah loving allah praising allah is a different thing than loving the prophet isalam defending him standing up for him uh showing the whole world his beautiful seerah and attributes and and praising him and it's different from studying tafsir of the quran and and and arabic language these are all different things but to claim that defending the prophet is something innovative this is outrageous yes the prophet said don't praise me in the sense that we say that like some sects or cults in islam say that the prophet was created from the light of allah or that the prophet controls the universe and that he controls it as he controls the palm of his hand and he's hazard and he knows the unseen and he this is shirk this is claiming that the prophet assam is allah now this is what the prophet prohibited us from doing do not praise me like the jews and the christians praise their uh prophets and messengers the christians say that the jesus is the son of god this is the wrong way of praising him instead of saying that he's a messenger and a prophet but a human being so you achieve it all mixed up it is a duty upon every muslim whenever he hears the prophets allah's name being insulted to defend and we defend according to the quran and the sunnah we don't go too extreme we don't blow up people we don't kill people we don't do things that would tarnish the reputation of islam we have a judicial system if he's in a muslim country we deal with it through the islamic court if he's in a kafir country we simply leave he says bad things we leave the room because we can't go beyond that and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars not to kill not to vandalize not to blow up places but to claim that even standing up for the prophet sallam defending him and protecting his honor is an innovation this is outrageous and allah it's important that people correctly understand and that they place the context of the principles and the injunctions of the sharia in its correct context i think sometimes people would use like we just heard through this question either through incorrectly understanding it but we never say that upholding the or defending the honor of rasulullah islam is an innovation that is totally incorrect and i think as we mentioned and we discussed in the opening uh statement or introduction of our program this evening we made mention of the verse where allah says and that is allah has already done that duty but it is merely a test upon his creation as allah subhanahu wa tells us in the quran i think if we can add on to that question as well uh that allah has given [Music] [Music] and you praise and glorify allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala himself is your lord night and day that is our duty as well if we have another question concerning how one may in today's times instill love within the hearts of the believers towards understanding not only who muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam was but how do we love him more how do we grow in our love for our messenger and i think this takes us to the important topic or point of learning sometimes we find as uh mentioned when he began early on to say that the knowledge that people possess unfortunately sadly within the ummah people are not really eager and dedicated towards learning their deen the quran the sunnah etc so it may be difficult for someone to say i love the prophet sallam but what knowledge do you have of loving your prophet what knowledge do you have of who he was and maybe if you could please highlight the importance of the three primary questions which all of us need to be preparing ourselves for which will be asked in the grave as we know those three questions are very great questions which we will all be experiencing sooner or later who is your lord madinuka what is your religion who is your prophet salallahu what will we answer what is the zad the preparation that we have taken for that if you could please touch on that uh okay i would eat probably another lecture for that but uh in a nutshell the way to love your prophet is to know him and the way to know him is to read his biography and i find i found it fascinating to see the different books written on his biography and i was honored with the grace of allah to finish his biography a number of times in different occasions and both arab arabic and english and the more you go through it the more that you love him you cannot help it when i hear about sheikh one of abdul scholars of our contemporary times died 90 plus worked as a mufti as a judge as a scholar teaching heading the medina university islamic university in medina and doing so many blessed things in his life never to have taken a day off yeah in someone in his position i would have guessed that maybe once uh a year he would go to a resort to the maldives to the seashells to can or knees to somewhere to yeah re freshen up the guy was 24 7 working for the sake of allah and allah azzawajal is judged every single for all of his known life he used to pray in the masjid he has to give a small talk afterwards and he would always occupy his time with mentioning and memorizing allah who is abdul aziz next to the prophet if you read his biography and learn his daily routine if you hear the stories narrated by his companions what he did with them how he acted with them his wives his children his uh uh the children of of the masses the non-muslims the newly reverted muslims his enemies you get a 360 degree about who was who the prophet was and one of the most beautiful contemporary books that i would highly recommend you guys to buy is a book by my friend and brother muhammad evans the founder of islam q a dot info and this book is just big volume all authentic hadiths how he tweeted them in english in arabic it gives you a deep insight how the prophet dealt alison with all categories of the society his wives his uh offspring his grandchildren the children of the muslims the newly diverted the enemies the sinners of the muslims and how he dealt with them it gives you an insight and not only that this is not something that is a commodity a luxury this is something essential in your religion the prophet allah told us about the three questions in the grave and this is why imam abdul ahab compiled a short booklet about the three principle fundamentals felata and allah azza has blessed me and favored me to finish explaining this booklet and it's on youtube in about 15 series about an hour uh each and it's free on the on youtube you can watch it these three questions are the questions that will make it or break it if you don't know who's your lord and you cannot define that and you don't know what is your religion and the third question who is this man who was sent to you and if you you're unable to say his name i don't know his father's name i don't know anything about his life i just hear people say muhammad sallallahu alaihi what else so reading his biography is essential reading his sunnah the way he ate the way he talked the way he sat the way he slept the way he answered the call of nature the way he had intimacy with his uh uh spouses the way he dealt with others all of the way he prayed the way he fasted the more you get to know his and implement it the more you gain this precious love filling your heart towards the prophet islam so that when you are asked what is the most thing you desire in this world you would say to see the prophet to hold his hand to kiss his hand and to be with him then you get to love the prophet salallahu sallam and you will be granted your wish to be with him on the day of judgment to be resurrected under his flagship without this knowledge without this love filling your heart being more than your love to your own parents your own children your own spouse your own soul without this love you are not a true believer allah it says in these incidences which is the best acceptable way to defend the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam's honor in my own personal view i believe that the best way to honor the prophet allah is to imitate him in every single thing you do it's nice to have a long beard people respect you for it it's nice to wear this arab clothes people think that you're knowledgeable all of this doesn't pay much unless i can see your character similar to the character of the prophet which is the character of the quran if you fail to walk the talk if you fail to follow the sunnah in every single thing in the way you pray in the way you eat in the way you entertain yourself if you fail to implement the sunnah in the way you treat your spouse in the way you treat your children in the way you treat your neighbor in the way you speak and say only the truth and never lie if you fail to imitate the prophet sam in being courageous in being generous in being kind in being forbearing in being merciful and forgiving then you are not defending the prophet you have to walk the talk and you have to wish that everyone who sees you would offer salat and salutation upon the prophet allah because they always hear something beneficial from you or see something beneficial that they learn from you or learn a sunnah from you other than that what we're doing now is sharing the honor of defending our prophet you can use facebook you can use twitter you can write good things and show the world who the prophet hassan really was you can stand up and speak maybe you can't speak you can write maybe you can write you can finance imagine someone who is a multi-billionaire he cannot make a speech he cannot write he doesn't have knowledge he spends his money to support conferences around the world defending the prophet elizabeth or he comes to peace tv or to zad or huda tv sponsors a program about the biography of the prophet has in different languages this is not going to cost him more than a breakfast in paris or in london or a catwalk show in milan but it would benefit hundreds and thousands of muslims and non-muslims worldwide the means of defending the prophet sallam are endless you have to be innovative you have to think out of the box and you have to act upon your ability not over that and not below to protect you and your family and all those who support you and the work that you do allah subhanahu wa ta'ala except from you we have once again been honored and privileged this evening for yourself to join us and we look forward to having you in sha allah"
