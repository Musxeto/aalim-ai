  "title": "Saying salam to everyone in a room or saying once is sufficient?& Must everyone reply? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "I've done that second question was if I go to a place and there are like 10 people and I say assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah and i shake hands with each and every one while shaking hands i say Salam alaikum Salam alaikum Salam alaikum one of them he was engaged in speaking and he shook hands but did not reply to me verbally is he sinful well if those around him did not reply to the Salam the answer is yes he's sinful but if he shook hands with you and the one on the left which is most likely or on the right would answer see if someone is shaking hands with the guy next to me in his state saying to him assalamu alaikum i whose turn did not come yet I would probably say what it comes sent up and when he comes to me and say why he comes Salam so if no one replied to your Salam including that person your shaking hands with he is sinful however I would highly recommend that you don't do this Jonnie giving Salam shaking hands to all 10 it's ok but saying Salam repeating it is not from the Sun it's sufficient for you to come in the room and say as Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah and shake hands with everyone else you just simply see how you're doing good morning how are things what's up that's that's ok but repeating Salam alaikum Salam aleikum Salam alaikum this is not something that is recommended and a large audience knows best"
