  "title": "Mentalist - What's the Islamic perspective on people who claim they can read minds? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sh I have uh you know nowadays in social media there are many people who call themselves mentalist and they you know they read minds they say that I can see the I can see the words what you're thinking in your mind on your face I what is the Islamic perspective on these people is these people are soothsayers ears. Nobody can know what is in your mind because what's in your mind is from the unseen and only Allah knows the unseen. Now some of these soothsayers worship the jin. They worship their own. And because they worship their their may use them for their devious and heinous works in exchange from some services. So for example, if I counted what's in my wallet and I know that it is five realals, I'm a poor man and I hope not poor in the sense of heart poverty. No, no, inshallah I'm not a poor man in that sense. Not either in the other sense. Regardless, let's get back to the topic. So if a person counts his money in the wallet and it's x amount and he puts it back in his pocket, no one could know what's in my wallet. If this so-called mentalist asks his and his goes and asks mine already my has counted the money with me when I was counting it and he tells him about it. In this case, this is not from the unseen fully. It is from the partially unseen. Nevertheless, what he said is part of sooth saying if I ask just for the fun of it, 40 days of my prayers won't be accepted. And if I believe him, then I would be committing kufur because I believe that someone else knows the unseen. As I said, the unseen is whole and partially what's going to happen tomorrow, nobody knows. Next year, the year after this is in Allah's knowledge. But if I say, what is in the next room? I say beats me. I don't know. I don't have Superman vision to see behind walls. If someone sitting next to me gives a call to someone in that room and he tells him in the room there's a sofa, there's a table and there is a bottle of grape juice and we go and it's right. Does he know the unseen? No, because this is partially unseen to me because I can't see it. It was revealed to him because now he can see it. Likewise uh uh OGN doctors I think OBGN I don't know uh gynecologist gynecologists they come to a woman who's 6 months pregnant ultrasound said you have a boy they know the unseen no it's not unseen they can see it it's in the monitor so this is what is known as partially unseen Allah knows Fast."
