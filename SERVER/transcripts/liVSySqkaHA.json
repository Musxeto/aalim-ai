  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to our tenth episode of um the islamic faith for soul phil arpeda where we stopped last time at mentioning some of the types of kuffer and we've stated that if you recall that there are five types generally speaking of kufur that the scholars talk about and this is denying and falsifying then there is arrogance and defiance then there is number three kufrow al-juhood denying and rejecting and this is different than falsifying they know the truth but they reject it and fourthly there is kofro a sheck being doubtful losing certainty in religion and fifthly and finally is the kofron nifa the disbelief of hypocrisy now all of these revolve the issues of cover around them and they stimmed a number of different ones as well last time we spoke about a number of them so we continue where the sheikh says one who ascribes to others than allah what belongs to allah alone such as allah's right to legislate and rule such a person may describe without authority things as permissible or forbidden the issuance of legislation and giving rulings are called by allah as acts of worship allah says all judgment rests with allah alone he has ordained that you should worship none but him this issue is one of the most important issues that we have to understand due to the fact that there is a misconception in understanding it even among the major scholars of islam whoa that's a very bold statement and you sheikh who is a nobody among these great scholars come to criticize and to tell us what is right and what is wrong i have to admit i am a nobody true but when you come and see the effect of such a difference of opinion when you see the impact that it made on the ummah and in some cases devastated the ummah you have to come to a conclusion because it cannot be so ambiguous over a crucial issue such as the ruling with other than what allah has legislated or using man-made laws so what's the ruling on that among we have two different groups that go ahead and uh on head over this issue head to head one says clearly anyone who legislates other than the rule of allah azzawajal is an apostate and he is a kafir committed major cover and they give a list of evidences among them verse 44 in surat al-maidah chapter five um those are the disbelievers and many other evidences the other party says that no there has to be the intention to make such legislation halal but if a person rules with other than what allah has legislated and puts the constitutions and regulations and the system without making it halal with his intention then this is not kufa so these are two opposite opinions which caused shaytan to magnify the differences and made them almost as factions to the extent that one group which is the first calls the other one because they think that anything that is not part of making except with the intention this is considered in their opinion as inja and the other party looked at the first one who said that man-made laws is kufur called them because they say that anyone who takes someone out of the fold of islam due to a sin he is and they started slaundering one another pointing fingers at one another and each one quote me quote the same scholar imagine someone quoting shahrun to support his opinion and the other side goats i mean to support his opinion this one uh uh takes sheikh bin baz this one takes uh sheikh muhammad ibrahim this one takes this and take it and it goes on and on which led to those who believe that legislating other than the rule of allah azzawajal is an act of apostasy which means that the ruler is kafir the judicial system is kafir those who believe in it are kafir and we can overthrow them rebel against them and fight them simple as that the other one said no no no no whatever they do whatever they legislate it's something in the heart we can't say anything about that we have to obey we have to do this we have to do that and they're justifying for the muslim ruler of course we're talking only about muslims not non-muslims we they justify to the muslim ruler to do whatever you want because you are our muslim ruler and as long as you did not make haram things halal and you don't intend to then this is okay so from this we understand the statement of the shaykh in the book which is shared by many one who ascribes to others than allah what belongs to allah alone such as allah's right to legislate and rule such a person may describe without authority things as permissible or forbidden the issue the issuance of legislation and giving rulings are called by allah as acts of worship so this statement can be interpreted in many ways but to make a long story short when we say that a person said o allah you are my servant and i am your lord what's the ruling in this everybody says it's a no-brainer this is kufur okay what about if he said it by mistake as in the hadith which is in the sahih of a man who lost his camel while he was traveling across the desert and on the camel was his food and water and he searched everywhere he could not find it so he recognized that he is a dead man so he took a nap being so tired and then woke up to find his camel next to him he grabbed it and said out of happiness oh allah you are my servant and i am your lord what's your ruling on that is it an act of kuffer he said no of course not this is a mistake okay similarly the man who said to his family if allah were to resurrect me he would punish me severely for my sins therefore he ordered them to cremate him to spread his ashes on the top of mountains and on the bottom of valleys and in the oceans this thought alone that if allah were to resurrect me he would have punished me or tormented me severely isn't the concept of believing that allah is unable of resurrecting him by itself an act of comfort the answer is yes no doubt however allah azza resurrected him and asked him why did you say what you had said and do what you had done and the man said because i was afraid of you o allah so allah says i have forgiven your sins and we know allah does not forgive kuffar or sheikh but the man misinterpreted thought out of extreme fear that this was the only measure to escape allah's torment not that he was a disbeliever so with all of this we come to the conclusion that what the scholars agreed upon in the past still stands whoever rules with other than the ruling of allah thinking that man-made laws are better or superior he's a kafir an apostate no questions asked if he thinks that it is equivalent to allah's legislation so he can take this one or that one no problem this is an act of apostasy and kuffer and a disbelief if he thinks that allah's laws are more superior without any doubt yet his ruling with other than what allah has legislated due to injustice and this is in specific issues so he knows allah's rulings on a particular case but he rules against it because he hates one of the defendants for example so he rules other than with allah legislated due to this reason or he was bribed to rule otherwise but he acknowledges that allah's religion is a religion that is perfect in this case there is no kuffer akbar it's no grand cover but it is a minor cover as scholars say now both parties don't disagree when it comes to this issue the disagreement comes when they say that okay if someone acknowledges that islam is the supreme and allah's ruling is the supreme yet he legislated did not rule in a specific case in court no he legislated and put systems for taxations for ripa for um court uh rulings and and regulations that are not in accordance to sharia law acknowledging that allah's law is supreme what's the ruling here is the fork of the road and to me it seems that those who legislate other than what allah has revealed while acknowledging that the law of allah is supreme and better we cannot judge them by such an action as taking them out of the fold of islam requires that all conditions are fulfilled and that there are no obstacles preventing us from giving tech fear to them and this is not possible with the vast majority of muslim rulers you see all without exceptions have legislated things that go against sharia would it be possible that all of them are kafir and that none of them has the right to be obeyed this is not logical especially when we know that such so-called rulers have zero knowledge in islam and we say this and i think that they should acknowledge this that they have zero knowledge in islam yet those surrounding them and advising them and making money out of them whether willingly or unwillingly they're milking them and they are filthy rich unlike the old scholars who used to advise rulers and would refrain from taking anything from them or living a lavish life never others may find it halal such scholars of authority may misinform the rulers by saying that this is good there's nothing wrong in that so the ruler may ask and say how is nothing wrong in that when we're not following the sharia and we're legislating something this is come on come on your highness it's very easy anything that is related to dunya you have the right to do whatever you want and anything related to forms of worship that is no this is for allah so his highness says where did you get this from i said isn't it reported in the hadith sahih that the prophet hassam when he gave them advice about i think politics palm trees i think this is the word so that the palm trees can produce fruit and dates he said to them if they were to leave it that would have been better i don't think what they're doing would do them any good so they left it the farmers left it they did not do anything with the palm trees and it did not produce anything so they complained to the prophet saw and he said you know more of your dunya than me things related to dunya to farming to industry you know more than me so this scholar said to the ruler that from this hadith we understand that whatever you choose to do regarding to this dunya is okay as long it has nothing to do with forms of worship so these rulers may be surrounded by such people who give them ill advice and would allow them to legislate other than what allah has ruled while thinking that islam and sharia is more superior but due to the pressure from superpowers due to the pressure from here and there due to our need to make more money or to take more money from our subjects we need to do this or that so we legislate such rules and regulations which go against sharia but we believe that sharia is superior such is what ibn abbas said may allah be pleased with him and those who jump the gun and would like to take everybody out of the fold of islam you would find that their approach is not very accurate because they usually quote verse 544. while verse 45 of the same surah so why did you limit legislating or ruling other than what allah has revealed to cover this belief and not wrongdoing or sinful the answer is some scholars said that all these three are the same and this is mentioned in some parts of the quran and other verses that prove that the they may mean the same thing but other scholars said no this is wrong first of all these three verses in surat al maidah were talking about the people of the scriptures the jews and the christians wasn't talking about muslims so it is not right to just go and say that it fits the muslims as well even if we say that it fits the muslim as well even abbas may allah be pleased with him said clearly that it is kufar do nakafur that this is not a major cover there are minor cover and this is what all the evidences can be combined and applied with this understanding anyone who thinks that man-made law is superior to sharia like atator like the secularists this is cover and disbelief anyone who thinks that it is similar to sharia or a little bit better this is kufur anyone who thinks that they are equivalent and you can choose this one or you can choose this one this is kofir now we come to the issue where they believe that sharia is more superior and that they are sinful or wrong doers or whatever for choosing otherwise but they do not believe it is halal to do what they're doing this is minor this is a major sin they are in real trouble but they do not leave the fold of islam and with this we come to say that all whom we know among the muslims rulers are considered to be muslim until proven otherwise because there is this element of doubt whether they think it's halal or not if someone comes up front that says our rulings our legislations though against sharia it is okay this is covered and even when there is coffer proven there is no justification to rebel against this kafir ruler unless it is proven without doubt that one can succeed in overthrowing with the minimum damages possible but what we see from those who do not have wisdom nor knowledge what they have done in the muslim world over the past 10 years starting from the arab spring what had happened in egypt in syria in libya in yemen overthrowing in tunisia as well overthrowing the tyrants the oppressors yes they were oppressed without any doubt in that however can anyone say that the result was better all these countries if you come to them today and say would you like what you're living or would you prefer that we go 10 years in history they will all say that 10 years ago we were better 10 years ago we used to carry our passports and travel the world without anybody rejecting us now people don't accept us ten years ago we had medical care we took our children to schools and universities we could put food on the table now nothing of that is happening we're not safe in our own homes so it's not an issue of oh the ruler is cafe or not let's overthrow him or not let's rebel against him or not the media is filming us let's dance let's chance chant let's do things wave flags then what you throw a rock they throw a bomb you throw a molotov bomb to them a bottle with gasoline and they demolish your neighborhood so this is not what islam came with islam came to weigh the consequences and to know what is right and what is wrong and to act upon it after checking with the scholars whether this is right or not wrong so i hope i managed or succeeded to give you an insight of what's happening again i'm not a scholar yet those who differed were scholars and we are obliged to follow the quran the sunnah with understanding of seraph and not to just simply pick and choose allah azza knows best then the other thing that nullifies islam or is considered to be kuffer one who claims that anyone other than allah has knowledge of what belongs to al meaning the unseen that is what lies beyond the reach of creatures perception such as those who practice magic or astrology allah says none in the heavens or the earth knows what is hidden except allah no one knows what is hidden what is unseen except allah and this we have to maybe pause a little bit this is a big room do i know what's behind the walls of this room what's happening who's in there the answer is no therefore partially this is rabe for me it's unseen for me this is a partial unknown or unseen that can be known by others so knowing what's behind the wall is not shirk or coffer because i can give my brother a call and say hey dude what is outside the room he said oh there's a bicycle there's a man a pizza delivery man waiting for you to pay him there so okay now i have knowledge of what's happening this is not the raid we're talking about the unseen we're talking about is what only allah knows such as a man and a woman consummated their marriage last night can anyone on earth know whether she's pregnant or not no it's impossible it's less than 24 hours no one can know that only allah can and not only that even when she's nine months pregnant can anyone know what's in her womb yeah all doctors with a uh ultrasound can know this is very easy this is not from the unseen yet they can know the gender of the child which is knowledge that allah has given us but can they know whether the child would be righteous or sinful whether the child would be born alive or dead whether the child would live for how long what would the child do as a career no one knows this not even the jinn nobody except so nowadays when you go to a soothsayer or a fortune teller and the fortune teller tells you that next week you'll get a call from xyz and he will offer you a job and your wife will cheat on you and your mother would inherit a lot of money etc by just going to that fortune teller without believing him you have made the prayers of the next 40 days invalid there's no reward for you at all allah does not accept your prayers for 40 days and likewise those who read the zodiacs the stars what is your luck this week but if you go and you believe so you hear what the fortune teller has to say and then a week later you called your friend and said it it happened exactly as the fortune teller said then you've exited the fold of islam this is without any dispute or difference of opinion the hadith is crystal clear when you believe you become a kafir because you believe that someone else other than allah knows the unseen and he's not a messenger to be told by allah azzawajal of what's going to happen so this belief of yours is sufficient one says okay how did he know well it could have been a wild guess he could have understood that from your answers to some of his questions he could have investigated about your lifestyle and what you did in the past and gathered information about you and he could have a companion of the jinn whom eavesdrop to whatever the angels are saying when allah orders them something and they manage to give one another the prophecy while meteoroids strike them one by one killing them until one of them manages to take this piece of information add to it 99 lies and give it to the fortune teller who by turn comes and tells you all of this and nothing sticks of his lies except that particular thing he he's dropped as the prophet said so believing that someone knows the unseen is blasphemous even the prophet islam does not know dancing except what allah has revealed to him the angels don't know the unseen except what allah revealed to them and practicing magic is also one of the things that nullifies islam in verse 102 surat the angels who were sent to earth to test the people and warn them not to learn black magic from them otherwise they would leave the fold of islam verily we are a trial so don't leave the fold of islam so they learn from them they insist so this means that learning sorcery is cover and unfortunately i know families here in saudi arabia who every year they host a sorcerer from an arab country that is known with sorcery in africa and they give him thousands and hundreds of thousands of reals and they have a list this man should divorce his wife this woman should accept a proposal from that person whom she rejected the business of this person has to be jeopardized we would like that person to die out of illness and he does black magic he worships the jinn he tarnishes the quran or writes verses of the quran with mance's blood he puts the quran in fiestas we seek refuge in allah from all this so all of this is kufur that takes a person out of the fold of islam and people have to be careful before they end up doing these things and i think we're running out of time so we will inshallah stop here and take few of your questions so the first question for today is from someone who's anonymous if a spouse does not fulfill her obligations his obligations in providing for his wife or children for over a year but continues to live with them expecting to be provided for what needs to be done allah says in the quran there are two reasons where why what why allah azzawajal has made men guardians over women the first one is because allah preferred males over females the second reason is that the males provide financially for their families for their spouses therefore if a man is unable to provide for his wife yet still lives with her in the same house orders her to work so that she provides for the family or he simply cannot provide for them he cannot put food on the table anymore the wife has the right to divorce him not she goes to the muslim judge and proves to him that he's not providing and the muslim judge gives her divorce forces the man to divorce her but if she opts to stay with him she says okay i wha what will i do when i'm divorced two shades same thing so no i'm going to stay with him if she stays with him it is her god-given right not to be intimate with him because without him providing for her he loses the right to have intimacy with his wife this is not a charity this is a marriage you provide she's intimate however one has to be really careful when making such a decision if she is interested in continuing in this marriage she has to be very careful not to make any haste decisions where he would become more stubborn and refuse to provide and not to work and then end up in divorce when she doesn't want the divorce but if she wants divorce then there's no problem so we're taking talking technically technically speaking it's her right not to have intimacy or to respond to his call when he calls her if he's unable to provide for her and allah azzawajal knows best afiya says if one is suffering from illness and they are bed ridden people feel pity for them and say it is better that allah grant them good death rather than being suffering like this is it appropriate to say or make dua something similar to this such people who say such sentences are not true believers when someone says it is better that allah gives them a good death rather than let them suffer who are you trying to correct don't you listen to yourself are you trying to tell allah that this is not good this is not fair you should give them a good death instead of them suffering are you teaching allah what to do definitely these people don't have iman and they have huge disrespect to allah azzawajal when they speak about him like this one would claim that no sheikh they said this out of being pitiful and sad for what's happening yeah you can't be sad no problem you can weep you can cry but you can't talk about allah with such an attitude what allah azzawajal human is the best for him imagine that a you pieced me upon him prophet jacob was ill for 18 years and he's a prophet you tell me why did allah do this couldn't allah have given him a good death rather couldn't allah give him a good health yes but this is allah he does what he wills and he does what he does with utmost wisdom fairness justice and knowledge he possesses everything whatever he does no one can say or claim or object why so definitely these people are not real muslims real believers their ignorant imbeciles now as a sikh person who is bedridden myself can i ask allah for a good death the prophet prohibited us from making dua to die for a calamity that has struck us and he said if one must make dua he should say madame or allah grant me life as long as living is best for me and grant me death as long as death is best for me so this is a conditional dua and allah knows what is best for you and allah knows best zade said please talk about the danger of speaking about allah's deen without or with little knowledge this is a problem nowadays with the social media everybody wants to be famous and it is unfortunate when someone wants to become famous on the account of islam and therefore you find people who do not possess knowledge they don't have knowledge of the quran and the sunnah yes they heard the fatwa from here and there but this doesn't make them students of knowledge or researchers or scholars and yet they want to be famous well known prominent you end up finding them sitting in a masjid giving a speech and if a person only talks about the things he knows that's great but the problem is when you speak without knowledge allah azzawajal mentioned in chapter 7 number 33 and let me read the translation because i do not know the translation quran dot com so it is 7 33 i have the i in arabic but failed to find it in english which is okay okay now we have it so allah says in this beautiful ayah the four categories of things that are haram so allah says say my lord has only forbidden open and secret indecencies number two sinfulness unjust aggression will if thirdly associating others with allah in worship a practice has never been authorized and fourthly attributing to allah what you do not know attributing to allah what you do not know speaking on allah's religion without knowledge i think that this issue is haram no i think this is okay who are you to think of i remember 36 years ago i used to call sheikh members benefit those were the four known scholars at my time at the time i used to call them every single day with a a pad with questions that i write throughout the day when i read books and i ask them so i remember once i asked sheikh hassan may allah have mercy on his soul about the ruling on making diamonds prohibited for men according to the analogy that gold is forbidden for men to wear so diamonds are more expensive and more feminine so i said can we make it haram as well and the guy bursted in my face saying who are you to say can we make diamonds haram as well who are you to have a we to say we do nothing you're not anything analogy chris has men scholars who take care of it who looks into it who study and research not people randomly coming and speaking in the religion of allah without knowledge that was an eye-opener for me it was like cold water being poured over my body thinking that he's right we don't have the authority to speak out of our own whims and desires because we do not possess the necessary tools that makes that make us scholars if you don't know arabic classical arabic with the sciences of it you cannot be called be called a scholar if you don't know the tafsir of the quran if you don't know usual if you don't know the according to the four schools of thought and how to compare them if you don't know the hadith of the prophet which is weak and which is authentic and how to authenticate it and you don't know the meaning of the hadith according to the interpreters of the hadith among the scholars in the different books if you don't or if you had not spent long years studying with scholars from their knowledge and from their etiquette and their behavior you cannot be a scholar so definitely speaking about islam with minimal knowledge is fatal i see some of the brothers either so open to speak without knowledge that they are on social media now known as dais and in contrast there are students of knowledge who are well based and educated refusing to appear or to teach saying that no no we still have more to learn we want to do and they are almost scholars this is how shaytaan mess up with their minds both sides if you don't have if you have knowledge perfect knowledge in what you know yes go ahead and teach it but if you don't have knowledge that is strong in what you know then you should avoid trying to be publicized or to be famous because this is a death trap this is a killer when all what you care about is how many followers do i have how many views did i get how many platforms recognize me or invite me for conferences and and you think at the end of the day that i am you never quote a sheikh or a scholar or an imam all what you say is from your own pocket so that you are not labeled but talking about the religion of allah is a serious thing and by allah if i'm talking about myself if i was not pushed to teach and address such issues i would not have done that believe me there is nothing better than being unknown being idle worshipping allah on your own staying with your family having quality time do whatever you want instead of this but unfortunately we are forced and pushed to do this which we hope and and pray to allah that we're sincere in what we're doing and that we only seek allah's face by it but at the end of the day a person who does not have sufficient knowledge should not place himself as a bridge between the edges of hellfire where people cross over his body they ask you they come and ask me what's the ruling on this what's the ruling on that if you don't know just simply say i don't know no harm done but to feel embarrassed that no i have to give a fatwa i have to give an answer when you're not qualified maybe most of the times you're right but there are times that you're wrong and you have no justification for being wrong except that you were forced to speak no nobody forces you to speak therefore be careful from this may allah azza make me and you among those who listen to the good speech and fair speech and follow the best of it israel says a person can pray taraweeh prayer after midnight and finish 30 minutes before fajr the answer is yes see the concert again i've said this so many times i'll repeat it night prayer is an umbrella underneath this umbrella we have taraweeh which is offered in ramadan in congregation we have the hajjut which is offered every night preferably after waking from sleep and we have winter which is offered every night and can be part of taraweeh it can be part of the hajj it can be part of night prayer night prayer is any prayer you pray after isha and before fajr so the time span is long six hours eight hours depending this is called night prayer now if you go to bed and wake up at 12 or 1 o'clock or an hour before fajr and you start to pray this is called the hajjut and this is the best of all night prayers in ramadan tarawih is a sunnah where you pray after isha this night prayer in congregation but what islam is saying that i'm not going to pray it in the masjid i want to pray at home alone so can i pray it half an hour before fajr i wake up after midnight and i finished 30 minutes before fajr no problem at all this is totally permissible and you can do that without any problem it's called tahajud it's far better than praying taraweeh in the beginning of the night but would this prayer of yours alone be better or praying within the masjid for men definitely praying in a masjid is the best for women praying it late this late as israel said alone is far greater than reward than praying in the masjid and allah azza knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of our uh episode for the day this is something that i received from usual center and as you can see it's a a keychain but the fun thing is that it has a usb drive and in it they have all their publications and dawa material that they can you can download from in different languages and use when preaching islam so i don't think you can get this physically unless you visit them in riyadh but you can visit their website and if you have someone who is not a muslim or is a muslim but cannot speak arabic and you need material for dawah for them for numerous topics that are so nicely designed and presented i advise you to go to posul center www.osolcenter.com and this would definitely uh uh add to your good deeds record behind for calling people to allah's beautiful religion so until we meet next monday i leave"
