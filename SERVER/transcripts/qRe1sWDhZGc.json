  "transcript": "says is it allowed to use cigarette replacement products to help stop smoking like nicotine patches if you recall when intoxicants when wine was permitted in the beginning of Islam it came over three stages until on the last stage it was totally prohibited this gradual process of prohibition can be applied in other cases so smoking is how long and we know that why because it's harmful even the non-muslim doctors and Physicians all agree that this is a main cause of fatalities heart problems Strokes Etc therefore if someone is trying to kick out or off the habit and he resorts to nicotine patches chewing gums pills and whatever that may help him stop smoking Scholars say that this is permissible because it's a lesser evil and at the same time it helps him with the grace of Allah stop such a sin providing that it doesn't cause more harm than smoking itself which normally it doesn't therefore inshallah it is permissible Allah Knows Best"
