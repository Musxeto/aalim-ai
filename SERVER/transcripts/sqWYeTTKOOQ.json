  "transcript": "uh the second questioner says is it haram to call non-muslims our brothers and sisters and can we call non-muslims cfers first of all Allah says in verily the Believers are brothers so our Brotherhood can be attributed to religion can be attributed to lineage he's my blood brother he's my sibling and can be attributed to the country that we are living in we're sharing the same region we sharing the same tribe however Brotherhood is mainly focused on Islamic orientation so it is not permissible for me to call a Christian or a Jew or a Hindu brother especially when debating or communicating I say brother I can say mister I can say uh um Any Other Name that does not give the impression of closeness and Brotherhood because he's not my brother my true brother is any Muslim whether he's in China in Bangladesh in Arabia or in Europe or in the Americas he is my true brother as indicated in the Quran so it is not permissible to call non-muslims as a brother or a sister as for calling non-muslims cfers cfir is a description in Arabic it's it means a disbeliever so I as a Muslim to the Christians I'm a cafir because I disbelieve in their religion n none of them would say you are a Believer you're this no Jew or Hindu or sik would consider me to be a believer they all consider me as a disbeliever Bel likewise we consider anyone who's not a Muslim who does not believe in the Quran who does not believe in the Oneness of Allah who does not believe in the message of Muhammad our prophet and messenger we believe him to be a cfir or a disbeliever so yes we call them and acknowledge calling them as Allah called them in the Quran"
