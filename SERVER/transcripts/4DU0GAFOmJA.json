  "transcript": "and we begin our 70th class of the islamic and today we will begin to speak about the conditions for the proper slaughter and these conditions would render whether our slaughter is halal or haram and it depends on a number of issues so it depends on the person doing the slaughtering it depends on the animal itself and how it is slaughtered and it depends on the tool used for slaughtering and after that inshallah we will try to if there is enough time to go quickly swiftly to the chapter that deals with hunting so first of all there are conditions for slaughtering and these conditions are related to the person who's doing the slaughtering so it is a well-known fact that all scholars agree upon that the person doing the actual slaughtering has to be either a muslim a jew or a christian we cannot eat the slaughtering of anyone who is not one of the three denominations so whatever a buddhist if ever they would slaughter or a hindu or an atheist whatever they slaughter this is dead meat crayon this is not to be used or touched or consumed because their slaughtering is of haram to the muslims to eat and such people when they slaughter an animal the animal is dead meat as for the muslims this is elementary as for the people of the book the jews and the christians allah says in the quran the food those who were given the scriptures before you is lawful to you verse number five the food of those who were giving the scriptures before you and these are the jews and the christians now the word the food was interpreted by even abbas the cousin of the prophet allah when he said that this is referring to their slaughtered animals and the consensus of all scholars that this is referring to the slaughtering of the animals done by the jews or the christians so this is a well-known fact that each and every one of us should always try to put at the back of his mind which means that when you go to a country like china where it is not christian country this means that when you see food when you see meat there you cannot by default say bismillah eat it you have to first inquire whether the person who slaughtered it was a muslim was a jew or a christian the second condition is that the person who was slaughtering did not dedicate it to someone else other than allah so if someone while slaughtering says in the name of jesus christ for the sake of uh nationalism for buddha for saint so and so for uh al badawi ortiz or any of those whom people ignorant people people of shirk think they are peers and think that they are saints this was dedicated to other than allah and hence allah azzawajal does not accept it because in the quran allah says and that which has been dedicated to other than allah meaning that allah will not accept this and it is prohibited to consume so we got this out of their way now remember when we say that the person slaughtering has to be a muslim jew or christian this has nothing to do with the person preparing the food or the person cooking the food so if a muslim slaughters the meat and gives it to the chef who is a hindu who is from the sikh who is an ahmadi and this person cooks the food there's no problem with that the problem is only with the slaughtering so if a buddhist cook veggie food totally permissible if he cooks non-veggie food we have to ask who slaughtered the meat the animal and if it were one of the three mentioned earlier alhamdulillah that's good if not then we cannot eat the meat because it is crayon it's a dead meat secondly we move to the conditions applicable to the slaughtered animal so in this book we have two conditions one related to how the animal was slaughtered so the proper way is to cut the animal's throat esophagus and the trachea along with the two jugular veins so the windpipe the throat has to be cut along with the two jugular veins and this is what's considered to be the right way of slaughtering the evidence is the hadith of he said that the prophet said when the animal's blood has been uh shed and allah's name is mentioned at the time of slaughter then eat of it but do not use teeth or claws so this is the second condition is that you do not use inappropriate tools but this will come later on insha'allah and secondly allah's name must be mentioned when the slaughter is about to be made so this is not related to the person slaughtering this is related to the animal while it is being slaughtered allah says and do not eat from that upon which the name of allah has not been mentioned for indeed it is grave disobedience and this is a big issue of dispute mentioning the name of allah before slaughtering is it mandatory or not the most authentic opinion is that mentioning the name of allah is mandatory however if a person forgot it the most authentic opinion is that his slaughtering is valid and we can eat from the animal he has slaughtered though he did not mention the name of allah imam shafi for example says even if he did not mention the name of allah deliberately it is still valid so what to do with verses such as this and do not eat of that upon which the name of allah has not been mentioned for indeed it is a grave disobedience like said and other scholars said this about people who dedicate their slaughtering to other than allah like those who offer it to idols and this is why allah said it's a grave disobedience but a person who forgets well we have the general forgiveness and the general concession from allah azzawajal to those who forget or make an error do not burden us do not hold us to account if we were to forget or to er and allah says in the muslim i have done so meaning allah has given us the concession the permission the forgiveness so if a person forgets then the slaughtering is still valid the vaheri school said no if he forgets it's a dead meat but this is not the most authentic opinion so this condition and the one before it we're related to the animal itself now we go to the third part which is related to the tool how are you going to slaughter it with scholars say you can slaughter an animal with anything that is sharp that can give comfort to the animal quickly swiftly and that would shed the blood providing it is not teeth or claws like those of birds so in another hadith the prophet salaam indicated that whatever makes the blood gush out and pour out when slaughtering and you remember you mentioned the name of allah then go ahead and eat unless it is bones or nails so the bones like the teeth is prohibited to use and the nails are like the claws of a bird and the abyssinians used to grow their nails and they used to slaughter with them this is prohibited by the hadith of the prophet and we must avoid this so it should not be a blade made of bone like the animal's teeth or the claws like those of birds okay now these are the conditions of the person doing the slaughtering the animal and the tools are there any things to be avoided well you must not use a blunt blade because the prophet alaihi salat was ordered us to sharpen the blade and make it swift and quickly and when we sharpen it we must do that away from the animal so that it will not see us because they do understand what you are about to do to them so to come with a blood blade that doesn't cut and you keep on doing this doing this this is torturing the animal it's not being kind to it and allah azzawajal has prescribed kindness over everything so when we use slaughter perfect your slaughtering the prophet says alice also you have to do it swiftly and quickly and as painlessly as possible to the animal secondly you must avoid breaking the animal's neck or to skin it before it dies completely because this tortures the animal breaking the neck scientists say that this would prevent the animals organs from naturally pushing the blood out of the body so when you do this you actually are like stopping the blood from going out but i'm not a scientist and i cannot comment on this so what you do is you cut the windpipe this the the the throat and the jugular veins breaking the neck is not part of the sunnah of the right way of slaughtering and you do not skin the animal before it comes down most of the people they do the slaughtering and they start to cut it open and this is not right because the animal is not dead yet still shivering and shaking and moving you have to wait until it comes down and does not move anymore this means it's dead and it would not be hurt when you start to skin it um thirdly the slaughterer should not sharpen his blades with the animal looking and we have gone through this and he should not also slaughter animals in front of one another and this unfortunately is found in many slaughterhouses and i'm talking about things that take place here in saudi arabia for example when we go for eid and in the slaughterhouses we see how they treat some of them not all of them alhamdulillah there are many of them who are god-fearing and practicing muslims who know how to deal with this so there are those who do not know and they would line up the sheep one after one the other and they do the slaughtering and they throw the bodies to the second person to take it and they keep on doing this while the whole line is watching in horror and fear of what's about to happen to them um okay then we have the slaughter by followers of other religions we've gone through this and i don't think there is anything else for us to add to it now we move on to the chapter that deals with hunting and this refers to killing animals that live in the wild that cannot be domesticated so what animals can we eat how can we hunt it is it permissible or not because we're not going to slaughter it well allah says in the quran lawful for you are the animals of gazing livestock except for that which is recited to you hunting not being permitted while you are in the state of haram meaning that it is permissible for muslims as long as they are not in the state of haram to hunt so hunting is permissible and this is genetic everything that lives in the wild can be hunted and consumed except for the exceptions that were mentioned in the quran and in the sunnah allah says also only when you are clear of the sacred presence and released from the state of haram may you hunt are they even hating me i'll be pleased with him said if you let the prophet say to him if you let your training dog loose to pick up your game and mention allah's name on it you may eat of it so here we have some of the conditions that we will mention later on but one of the ways of hunting is using animals so i have the option of throwing an arrow shooting a bullet as we will come to discuss in sha allah in a while and i have the option of having my trained animal whether it's a dog or a falcon or whatever a predator there is that is trained providing i mentioned the name of allah as wajal of course this is when you have the intention of eating not when you have the intention of playing around and killing for fun so what the brits do when they send their hounds to catch a fox this is not part of islam because we cannot eat foxes so such expeditions and running and training and whatever they do is not lawful because it's for the fun of it likewise those who send pigeons so that they can shoot them as target practice this is also haram in islam you have to hunt with the intention to eat and to benefit from the animal or the bird that you're hunting the following section deals with permissible and prohibited hunting so all hunting and fishing is permissible except in specific conditions what are these conditions one it is forbidden to do any hunting in the sacred uh presence around the kaaba so we went through this when we spoke about hajj and we said that the whole world is called meaning permissible yet there is a specific area which is known as al-haram the sanctuary the area that is sacred and it is surrounded by border lines that people know inside this sanctuary or harlem you're not allowed to hunt again you're not allowed to pluck the trees and cut them down so you're not allowed even to scare animals so this area the halam is sacred and the prophet alaihis salatu said on the day when mecca fell in the conquest of mecca he said this city has been consecrated by allah ever since he created the heavens and the earth its plants must not be pulled out and its game must not be frightened meaning let alone be hunted so this is one of the things number two it is forbidden for anyone who is in the state of haram consecration to hunt or to help anyone hunting whether by action or by pointing out in any other way and we mentioned this also in the restrictions of so now we have number one an area where no one is allowed to hunt in it whether you are in the state of iran or you're not outside this area like in wherever you are if you are in the state of iran you have not reached the sanctuary the the sacred area still because you are in the state of and you're coming for pilgrimage or for umrah you are prohibited from hunting game you are only allowed to fish if you are at sea but to hunt game it is totally prohibited it is even totally prohibited for you as a muhrim in the someone who is not in the state of ahram and help him or assist him in hunting so for example the bus driver he's not in the state of iran his job is to commute people from point a to point b in the sanctuary in the sacred area and this guy was resting and there goes a deer so in the state of ahram as a pilgrim and i say to him look what a beautiful deer there that is so pointing it to him where he goes and kills it this is prohibited for me to eat i cannot eat it it's haram can he eat it yes she can because he's not in the state of iran and he's not within the borders of the haram area so there's no problem in that okay so conditions for the permissibility of game now what are the conditions that would make what i hunt halal the book says the same conditions that apply to the slaughter of animals of for food also apply to the hunter which means he must be a muslim a christian or a jew and he has to be sane so a muslim insane person does not make the job a muslim a christian who's drunk does not make the job a idol worshiper does not make the job if we go to the tibet and they are buddhist or they worship the sun and we go in on an expedition and one of them shoots a deer and he prepares it and cooks it for us we cannot eat it because he's neither muslim christian nor a jew of course again this deals only with animals that require slaughtering but if this buddhist went fishing and brought us five six fishes big ones five six fish and he cooks it yeah we can eat that because fishing is not slaughtering if a group of hindus caught in a big bag hundreds and thousands of locusts it can be consumed because this is not slaughtering and so on and among the conditions is the intention so for example if someone was target practicing and he shot a bullet and this bullet happens to by accident hit a deer and kills it can we eat from it the answer is no because he did not intend to hunt it so this is a crayon and it's a dead meat that does not fit for muslims to eat and this is regarding the person doing the hunting what about the tools used well scholars say that the tools used must be of a sharp edge that either slaughters or penetrates due to its edge and sheds the blood accordingly and it must not be made of bones or claws exactly like previously and it might must not also kill by its weight so it has to be an arrow a spear a sword a knife a bullet all of these shed the blood and penetrate and wound the animal but if i hit the animal with a stick or with a stone heavy stone or like in australia with a boomerang so i hit the animal and it bangs it in the head it dies but it did not penetrate it did not cause the blood to flow out of the animal this is dead meat because it does not have a a sharpness or a blade to it and it does not penetrate and likewise which is quite [Music] popular in non-muslim countries is to kill with a trap so you set a trap in the wild and you come after three four days and you find the animal caught in the trap and dead this is that meat because it died out of hunger it died out of pain it did not die out of being wounded when you wounded it without any intention without mentioning the name of allah so all of this is not permissible the other type of hunting this the tool so this tool is i'm done who's using it the other type is using animals and birds of prey to kill game with their teeth or claws allah says in the quran say lawful for you are all good foods and game caught by what you have trained of hunting animals which you train as allah has taught you so eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of allah upon it and fear allah so this is crystal clear the animal has to be trained you have to have an animal that is trained animals and birds of prey used for hunting must be trained how to take away a game and do not chase anything else and they would stop when they are told to stop so this is their training you have the bird you have the hound and they see the prey they do not move until you say go this is how the training is then only they move to hunt and when they attack the prey the game you say to them stop they stop and an important condition is that they do not catch for themselves so if the falcon starts eating what he has hunted then this is haram because he's catching it for himself not for his owner or for its owner it has to do the kill and wait until the owner comes and feeds it or gives it from it or from anything else but not to eat from it for itself the prophet said if you send your dog and mention allah's name and he catches and kills the game you may eat if the dog eats of it do not eat because he only kills for himself and of course we mentioned before that the name of allah must be mentioned and if a person forgets then it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it is still valid allah says you may eat of what they catch for you but mention allah's name over it and have fear of allah what happens if a person sends his dog or shoots a bird or an animal and he reaches the animal while it's still alive some people think that okay we'll just wait until it dies totally then take it and this is wrong if you were to find the animal still alive or the bird you must immediately slaughter it because if it dies without you slaughtering it will become dead meat when is hunting halal for you to eat it when you shoot a bird or an animal or when you send your animal uh our predator to catch and hunt for you and it kills the prey this is halal if i shoot an animal and i reach it and it's dead this is halal as long as i said bismillah but if i reach it while it's still alive it is a must for me that i have to slaughter it in order to be halal and allah knows best we move on to the questions of today the first question is from muhammad morin he says we are supposed to pray with your before sleeping as sunnah but we have to pray to hajjud after a short nap but whittier should be the last prayer before fajr please clarify the problem there's no problem except in our minds brother muhammad you see you said that praying witter before sleeping is a sunnah and this is not true the prophets within was always after the hatred maybe the hadith of abu huraira may allah be pleased with him where he says that my dear friend has advised me of three things i shall never leave them until i die he advised me to fast three days of every month and to pray two raka's of doha every day and to perform water before i go to bed so maybe this might have confused you but this is something specific for abu hurairah scholars say because used to work the whole night studying memorizing revising the hadith of the prophet and therefore this was not a normal person rather he was may allah be pleased with him a scholar and a student of knowledge who was spending his time in the welfare of the ummah by preserving the hadith so the prophet instructed them to perform water before going to bed now having said that never ever underestimate above rail his mother and his only brother used to divide the night into three parts each one of them taking the first shift the second shift and the last shift and when his mother died him and his brother divided the night into two shifts each one taking one of these shifts so don't think that spent all his time studying and not praying night prayer he spent all of his life offering night prayers so what is the best thing to do if you are a person who knows from your track record that you may over sleep and only wake up for fajr like five times a week so you would miss winter five times a week a night prayer in this case offer your winter and night prayer before you go to bed but if you are a person who has a strong will who wakes up normally like 29 days out of a month to offer night prayer and widget in this case postponed and delay your witter to conclude your night pray with it this is the way of the prophet and this is the highest for your grades and for your reward hasina khan says my question is here in tanzania every mosque and then are in different time like in fajr is 5 15 then after 10 minutes i pray fajr prayer then at 5 30 i hear another adhan of fajr in different mosque so did my prayer or was my prayer accepted or should i wait for the all the adhan to complete then pray just i'm just confused well this depends on what the messages are doing you see the norm the sunnah is for fajr prayer to have to avan so if the time for fajr is at 5 30 we have something that is called the first adhan which is about 15 minutes or half an hour before the actual fajr prayer this is called the first adhan and this is is this is still being practiced in mecca and medina in the haram masjid of mecca and medina so the first adhan is a sunnah at the time of the prophet bilal may allah be pleased with him used to give the first adam and the prophet said to the people when you hear bilal giving the adhan this is nothing this is only a reminder to wake up those who are asleep meaning so that they can perform with it and to remind those who are praying night prayer that eat your pre-dawn meal because fajr is going to be around the corner if you're fasting but when ibn the blind man when he gives the adhan which is the second adam then this is when you have to refrain having said that the difference between the adhan of bilal and the second event of ibn maktoum which is the actual event of fajr the adhan of bilal he doesn't say al-salatu rum because he's not waking you up for salat he is reminding you while ibn um says in his addament is better than sleeping so that he wakes you up so for you you need to google um in your region so you have to see when is the actual fajr according to um in tanzania and if it coincides with the one that is at 5 30 in this case you understand that the one who did it at 5 15 was only giving the first event and this is a reminder but if you found out that it is at 5 15 then this means that the other masjid is probably following the hanafi school which delay it a little bit they should delay the prayer but not the adhan because then has to be done at a specific time and allah azzawajal knows best the second third question is from also from hasina says i usually pray to hatjud every day so i make my old ass then in other prayers i'll just make short draws as allah accept my duas and read rabbana at dunya i don't repeat that dua which i make at the time is not necessary to make that long duas in every salat as i believe allah knows everything which is in our heart the answer is no it's not necessary but the more insisting you are the most likely that you will be answered so it's like someone saying i have a number of options i have this job that pays me x amount of money but there is a better job with lesser working hours and double the salary which one will you choose those who say no no i'll take this job that doesn't offer me that much where i have to work 10 hours instead of taking this job of five hours a day with double the salary people who say this is crazy so when you say that i made long duas during the hadjad this is sufficient during the day i'm not going to make long draws why are you doing this yeah because i did it at night and allah knows what's inside of me so i don't have to repeat well this is up to you but it's a well-known fact the more you insist upon allah azzawajal while expressing your poverty and humility and showing allah that you are in need the more likely that allah would respond to you and allah azzawajal knows best rashid says suppose an animal is hunted and dies before slaughtering is it halal to eat we just spoke about this rashid and we said that if you reached it after it died in this case it is hard for you to eat but if you reached it while it's still alive and waited until it died then it's a dead meat and you cannot eat from it you have to slaughter it by says is hanafi mathab or in hanafi they say it is not permissible to eat shrimps well this is baseless this is not founded neither in the quran nor in the authentic sunnah on the contrary the quran itself says that it is lawful for us to consume seafood without any restrictions so the vast majority of scholars beg to differ with the hanover school on this point and they say that this is baseless and it's totally permissible to eat shrimps uh hayat abdullah says tell us what is the benefit of the last two ayah of surat al-baqarah these last two eyes these came from a treasure underneath the throne as one of the narrations says and the angel who came down descended down with them never came to earth before and the prophet said whoever recites the last two verses of surah al-baqarah it will suffice him what is meant by suffice him some scholars say that it refers to it will protect him from the devils that night and the second interpretation is that it will suffice him from offering night prayer so if he does not offer night prayer and simply recites these last two verses of this would be sufficient for his reward and the prophet told us also alaism that whoever recites the last two verses of surat al-baqarah this will protect his home and prevents the devils from entering entering it for three nights so it is a beautiful uh uh thing to do and it is definitely part of the bed time afkar that we all recite before we go to bed and allah azza knows best neshwa gamur says how about the horse is it halal to eat or haram we've mentioned this before that it is permissible to eat horse meat and i believe there's a hadith by asma bit abby bakker be pleased with her and with her father that they've slaughtered a horse at the time of the prophet and ate it so this is permissible however a horse is far expensive and more important than rams or cows so it is illogical for a person to slaughter it to eat the meat it has no special powers or taste to it however is it halal or not the answer is yes madiha says which are the animals prohibited killing by the prophet israel well the prophet if i recall correctly prohibited the killing of the bees the ants the um what what is it called an arabic is the um sparrow i think think i hope this is the right translation and the surah is a special little small bird these were mentioned by the prophet islam to be prohibited to kill and we know that anything that is harmful it is permissible to kill so if you were attacked by a swarm of bees definitely you have to defend yourself and kill them if your house was invaded with ants and they are hurting you spoiling your food and intimidating your children you can kill that without any problem and allah knows best salifu says can a sister live alone in an apartment with a nun sharing the rent even though they don't meet or interact in that particular apartment due to their differences of time frame the answer is definitely not no woman with chastity that would allow herself to live with anan in the same house no man who's practicing and fears allah would accept such a deal so even if their working hours and time frame are different inevitably they will have a weekend they have to stay together what happens if he is sick and he doesn't go and she's in the house these questions don't usually appear in the muslim world it appears in the non-muslim uh countries because it is okay to them and if we manage to establish a relationship afterwards that's a win-win situation to them to us it's a great loss of iman and a shameful act to even think about it being permissible or not neriman says is shrimp and lobster permissible to eat again the answer is most definitely i adore eating shrimps and lobsters and they are very tasty and beneficial food to eat and it is totally halal to consume them according to the quran and to the sunnah zenat says i have a question on ruling of using nut mug or not meg not nutmeg nutmeg is a spice so it is part of the spices used while cooking and it is an issue of dispute but when you look at the general ruling which the prophet alison gave us and apply it you know that nutmeg is not permissible it's not halal what is the general ruling the prophet says allah anything that a large quantity of it intoxicates you then a little bit of it is haram so apply this to wine or to champagne if you are at a wedding and they're throwing a toast and you drink a sip of champagne just one sip would you be as intoxicated is no so is it halal well you have to apply the rule what happens if you take six or seven glasses of champagne oh you'll be wasted in this case one drop of it is haram likewise what happens if you take a puff of hash or marijuana part what will happen will you be intoxicated answers no but if you smoke six or seven joints most likely you'll be wasted so it's haram likewise when we come to nutmeg or mug i don't know let me see is it my god make do fine it is not make okay so when we come to nutmeg scholars say that this is intoxicating if you take it in large quantities it will make you intoxicated therefore the rule applies and using little of it with food renders it halal and as i said this is an issue of dispute but this is the most authentic opinion and allah azza knows best samuel i think says is it permissible for men to have chest long hair men by nature have hair in their chest if it's long or short this is how allah created them can they keep that hair no problem can they remove that hair no problem this is part of the hair on the body that allah azzawajal did not order us to remove or to keep it's up to your preference and i've said this before and i said it again the the hair on our bodies is divided into three categories category number one you have to you must remove it and this is the armpit hair and the pubic area here for both men and women they must remove it and not allow 40 days to pass without plucking or shaving it the second type of hair is the hair that is prohibited to remove so for women it is totally prohibited for them to shave their heads and it's totally prohibited for them to pluck or cut short their eyebrows as for men it is totally prohibited for them to shave their beards and to pluck or cut short their eyebrows the third type of hair which is up to you and your preference for men and women so if women want to remove their arm hair if men want to remove their leg hair no problem in that and if they want to keep it there's no problem in that either because the sharia did not mention it either way so it's up to your own preference and allah azzawajal knows best and our last question for today is from hafsah she says at what age can my son lead me in prayer what are the conditions to make him able to lead there is no specific age for him to become an imam if he's six or seven years of age and he knows what he's doing he's stable he's not a childish person who would say allahu akbar and then goes play around then he can lead the companions i think his name is he said i led my people when i was seven years of age six or seven years of age or eight because i memorized the quran the most of them all so this is permissible even if there are grown up men behind him as long as he memorizes the quran and he is not acting childishly he's stable he prays the prayer normally without any movement that would be any not appropriate for the imam to do and allah azzawajal knows best so with this we wrap up our lesson for today until we meet you next thursday i leave you for manilla cattle"
