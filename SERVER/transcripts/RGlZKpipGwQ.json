  "transcript": "uh she I have a 9year old child I have a health condition and do require water a lot however since Ramadan started she really really do wants to do some bit of fasting and I was thinking whether should I allow her to do a bit of like 5 hours fasting and I'm thinking if I do with all knowing that she have a health condition if I allow her to fast am I sinful and if I don't am I also sinful since she wants to try about like five or six hours a day what is her health condition she have sell anemia ah may Allah cure her I've read an article about a month ago that they have discovered a gene uh treatment in America and it was alhamdulillah successful for people with uh CLE cell uh disease and it was I don't know if it's approved by FDA or not but this article that I read was very helpful so you may investigate inshallah first of all if the doctors say that she must consume water or this would be hazardous for her health or she may elapse into a fit or may Allah protect her then you must not allow her to fast she has to drink water according to the recommendations of the doctor yes maybe you would try to convince her not to eat and tell her this is an excuse maybe try to five six hours do not eat but you have to drink so you have to weigh the pros and cons if the doctor say that 5 hours without water is fine then yes encourage her to do this by while telling her that this is a test from Allah and Allah has Exempted you from fasting because even when you reach the age of puberty if this persists and continues with you you will not be able to fast and Allah would not love you to fast because throwing Yourself In Harm's Way is totally prohibited in Islam and you have to break your fast in a form of obedience to Allah to Pro to protect him preserve your own safety and health so you should do whatever is is available and Allah cure her illness and all the illness of our children and loved ones"
