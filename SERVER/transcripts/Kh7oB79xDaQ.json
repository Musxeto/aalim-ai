  "title": "Why call ourselves Ahle Sunnah wal jamah, Ahle hadees (origin) at Prophet's time we were all muslims",
  "transcript": "says you always say that we are from sunnati or hadid where did this come from at the time of the prophet allah they were all muslims true then what happened afterwards they remained to be muslims until what is known as ashiya came to existence and they started dividing the ummah and after a while or actually before the shia al-khawarich came at the time of the prophet sallam so we have al-khawarich then we have the rafa then we have al-murjiya then we have al-jahmiyah and those sects that came out of them such as and the sects that came out of them such as etc who are sharing some of the principles but in general there were so many of them so basically speaking when someone asks you what are you you say i'm a muslim there's no one better in rhetoric than a person who calls to allah does righteous deeds and proclaims that i am among the muslims however nowadays if you say i'm a muslim people would go a bit further said what kind of a muslim and you would say i'm not a raphaeli i'm a sunni so they say okay the rafale is like eight percent but 92 percent of the sunnah have deviant sects and cults in them so what kind of them so you have to start explaining yourself and the scholars say that the hadiths of the prophet abide by my sunnah by my way and by the sunnah and the way of the righteous righteously guided caliphs so this is why we call ourselves and also we call ourselves well jamaa because the prophet alaihis salatu told us that allah's hand is with the jamar and whoever goes astray would go to hellfire so the scholars selected this terminology this name sunnah that has no sect that has no cult that it attributes itself to rather anyone who says by default has to go back to the sunnah which is the hadith which is the guideline that he walks and abides by and jamaa the jamaa of the muslims so so he abides by the muslim ruler whom allah azzawajal and his messenger ordered us to obey the muslim ruler even if even even if he was sinful so this is where it came from and nowadays ignorant people may come and say this was not at the time of the prophet sallam true also printing the quran was not at the time of the prophet but it is a necessity and it was needed the having messages with carpets and air conditioning and lights and and microphones and speakers was not at the time of the prophet sallam but again so it is not for laymen to come and just simply scratch off things they don't understand or they cannot comprehend rather it is for the scholars of the dean and it's like someone coming and asking how is it this neurosurgeon is doing this procedure to remove something from the spinal cord and to do this who are you what did you study i did biology in primary school subhanallah now you're questioning this so again we have to be really careful when we question things about religion and when we try to find justifications ask this is totally but not object there's a big difference in allano's best"
