  "title": "A woman takes her Father, Brother, Husband & Son to hell with her..is this authentic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so uman says I recently heard about a Hadith of the Prophet Alat saying that a woman takes four people to hell with her her father brother husband and son is this accurate and if it is what is the context and meaning of the Hadith this is not an authentic Hadith and it has no Rel relationship to our religion we know that the prophet saidat that a person is responsible and accountable for his flock everyone is a shepherd and he's responsible and accountable for his flock so the father is responsible for his daughter but once she's an adult and he has no power over her he has no accountability because he didn't his due diligence he tried to stop her and she wouldn't uh uh adhere likewise the husband Allah says oh you who believe protect yourselves and your families your women folk from Hellfire and if he does his level best but she re is a renegade she is rebellious then what else can he do as for the son he has no control over his mother as for the brother he has no control over his sister if his father is alive or she's married and the like so this Hadith is not authentic and Allah Knows Best"
