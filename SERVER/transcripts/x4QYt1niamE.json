  "title": "Ruling on sleeping on your stomach - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um his muhammad's second question was about the ruling on sleeping on your stomach and it's an issue of dispute and the hadiths related to this issue in my opinion are not authentic one of them is the prophet saw a man sleeping on his stomach so he came and kicked him saying to him that this is the way that the people of hell sleep the man is asleep he's not accounted or he's not accountable for his actions while in his sleep the prophet would not do something like that punishing the man for something he's not accountable for let alone kicking him while he's asleep and startling him uh in that fashion so the most authentic opinion after research that there is nothing haram in sleeping on your stomach is it the sunnah the answer is of course not the sunnah is to sleep on your right hand putting your right on your right side putting your right hand under your head and doing that cut as we know after that there is no problem but to sleep on your belly on your stomach from the beginning there is no problem with that inshallah"
