  "title": "What is a Transgend*r and are they allowed to enter our houses? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Anisa says in our state it is common that transgenders bring marriage proposals they do this as a businessman and act as a mediator between the two families is it allowed for transgenders to enter our houses because I have once heard that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam told one transgender to leave the city of Medina I don't know whether it is true or not first of all I personally don't know of such a hadith where the Prophet Allison would order transgender to leave Medina and before we go on I think it is appropriate to understand what is meant by transgender or transsexuals usually a transgender refers to a person who is inclined to imitate the opposite of his real biological gender and who denies his own true nature so a man born a male yet he insists on wearing women's clothes talk walk and behave like women this person is the transgender or transexual and such people are condemned in Islam the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam cursed the men who imitate women and he cursed the women who imitate men this goes against their nature they may justify it by saying that we were born like this this is something that we've forced to do and this is unacceptable in Islam all men and women are born as Allah has created them to be men or to be women not to be against what they were born as and anything that develops down the line it is due to the environment to their own personal conviction or the desire to be like this but it has nothing to do with their nature Allah created them in the best of form they chose or they were influenced by their environment to act in such a fashion which Islam condemns and Islam tells them that they have to correct themselves otherwise those homosexuals like the people of lot of Saddam Kamala had destroyed if this was a natural thing which is homosexuality Allah would not have called them to repent and to seek forgiveness and to refrain from whatever evil acts they've been doing this shows clearly that this is Haram now there is a hadith where there was this person who is as we call them today may be castrated so he was a man but he was operated upon that he would lose the tools of his manhood yet when the Companions were about to go and conquer the city of pIEF he told them that if you enter the city of Taif then you should take note that there is this woman I think she was the wife of reelin and he started describing her body to the men now when the Prophet heard this Ali thought was Salaam he instructed that this person this individual not enter upon women just because he was castrated and that he was not a man because of an operation done to him does not mean that he lost his interest in women or his sight and look at women so the man when describing this woman in Thai if he described her as a man and he is pointing out to other men the points of beauty in her so the Prophet told them not to allow him to enter upon women who would say feel safe like now in the West women feel safe being friend to a gay man because he doesn't have any interest in women so they think that it is safe to be around him which is not so coming back to your question Anisa such a transgender must not be allowed to enter upon women though he acts and looks and may talk like them he is still a man and he cannot mix with women so as a business man yes he may moderate he may match make but not to mix with women he's only allowed to mix with men because he is really a man no matter what he puts on or no matter what he pretends"
