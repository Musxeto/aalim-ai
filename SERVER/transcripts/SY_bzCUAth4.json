  "transcript": "this account is not mine asalam my name isim as you know I am quite visible on social media with the grace of allaha and this is a test indeed however on Instagram there are two accounts one that is mine which isim one word and this is the verified one that I own and my team runs it with my approval and nothing is posted on it without my permission the other one which has approximately one .7 million followers I I have nothing to do with it I've tried many times to contact the person that owns it but without any success so I have nothing to do with it I'm not responsible of the material that is done with it or the activities that are associated with it so this is a shout out to the one who's running it to get in touch with me so that we can have a collaboration I don't want to close this account because alhamdulillah Muslims are benefiting in a way from it but when push comes to shove and there might be some questioning or danger on me personally then maybe we would have to resort to such measures so I would highly request that my followers their followers tag them along so and Below whatever they say so that they would uh uh be notified and I know they will be paying attention to what I say inshallah was"
