  "title": "How to differentiate between everyday actions & biddah i.e reading Quran after salah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is how can we differentiate between everyday actions like for example someone who reads Quran every day after and between so Innovation religion we are ordered to recite the Quran 24 hours 7 days a week so if a person recites it after F prayer or after or after or after and thinking that by doing this he will get more reward than any other time this becomes a b but if he's doing it because this is the time of convenience after prayer he has like 15 20 minutes and he would like to utilize the time by reading a certain number of pages after F prayer there is no problem in that inshallah"
