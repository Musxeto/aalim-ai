  "transcript": "um abdullah's second question is that a person who's married and he lives with his parents and his parents uh want him to live with them in a joint family system but his wife wants him to live separately who should he obey the answer is your wife because this is her given right in islam to have an accommodation that befits her and that is separate from everybody else so if you can manage to have a separate uh suite for her in your family house that has a kitchen that has a a separate bathroom and a separate entrance where no one could come in whenever they want is totally locked totally private this is sufficient if not you have to move out and get her a house outside you"
