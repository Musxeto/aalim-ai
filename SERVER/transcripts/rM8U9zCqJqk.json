  "transcript": "um can you recommend good Tor books or cassettes or playlist anything like this in direction of Tor because I feel like there's a lack of English or of the Quran maybe you can start an own series inah if Allah opens this door for you and may Allah accept from you and increase you in knowledge and py for thinking well of me I don't have any knowledge in this field and I have not done any of my own reading in the field of t t is something that Allah gives to you the more you read the Quran and this alhamdulillah we do and the more you research in tap and the more you read in tap books and alhamdulillah this is also done but we're not doing enough no matter what you do you'll never do enough with the book of Allah the Quran is a treasure that has no limits it's an ocean that has no Shores so no matter what you do you will never be satisfied or fulfilled thinking that I've done a little so to me I don't know the best way of T is to continuously read the Quran on daily basis at least one and to have a portion of from different books so that you can comprehend and Allah will open doors of Tor for you inshallah"
