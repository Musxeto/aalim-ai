  "title": "Allah said We created you in pairs, but what about people who die while being Single assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh Ahmed says Allah has said that we have created you in pairs what about so many people who die single this is a misconception that a lot of the Muslims have Allah says from everything we've created to we created a pair so that you may remember so people think that this is referring to spouses so every individual must have a spouse and this is not what is meant by the Ayah because there are so many people who are born and they die without getting married or they die before reaching the age of puberty so where is his or her spouse the Ayah refers to creating from each thing a pair so there is night and day there is heat and cold there is good and evil and there is mail and female now you come and say oh but there is a transgender or a third gender or a transvestor or whatever this is not logical and not Islamic and not Christian and not Jewish and not a single religion endorses this this is all the fabrication of today's atheists and those who want to change the world order and to insert immorality among the people and this would take people downhill it would destroy them Allah says in the Quran they're created of a pair male and female that is it and this was mentioned in all previous religions before Islam so there's no way they can argue this so this is what is meant that of each thing there's an opposite to it so Heat there is a cold cold things cannot be Hot and Hot things cannot be cold and this is a manifestation of Allah's greatness when he can create things others can't and Allah Knows Best"
