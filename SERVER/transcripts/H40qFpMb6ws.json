  "title": "Unsure if she emitted mathi, skipping prayers due to this, what to do? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she my question is about my sister um as she is totally obsessed with this thought as I am going to tell you like generally she read about um pre seminal discharge so from that time she said that I feel scared that maybe during prayer she imits free seminal discharge or any kind of discharge without any cause and desire and when she starts spraying she feels like that and when she check out she find nothing but sometimes she find that there is discharge but you know discharge is the power of woman cycle because of this she is very disturbed and she's I can't do that anymore and she's about to skip her so why should you invite such person this person should be advised to fear Allah Shan the devil Satan is setting her up so that he can accompany her to Hellfire and she's obeying him and she is an obedient student of his he's very happy he's clapping all the way as she's about to leave and Skip prayer which qualifies her to be a resident in Hellfire for eternity as you've clearly stated it's part of the women's nature to have vaginal discharges and these are according to the most authentic opinion pure and do not invalidate the woodo and the default is everything is pure everything is normal until proven otherwise so you cannot jump the gun and assume that oh this is uh uh prosthetic fluid or uh whatever it's called Mei or the likes when you don't have any provocation of Desire or you did not see anything that sexually aroused you and you've checked so many times and you found that it was nothing and you still insist on doing this you are qualifying to be an advocate and one of The Devout students of Shan it's your own doing shatan has nothing to do with it he just calls you and you respond and answer it as mentioned in Surah ibraim Chapter 14 verse 22 Satan says in Hellfire I had no control over you except to call you and you responded and answered me so don't blame me rather blame yourselves I'm not going to benefit you and not you're not going to benefit me so so she has to fear Allah and Allah knows best a deal"
