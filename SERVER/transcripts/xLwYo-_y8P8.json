  "transcript": "one minute this is late you know my timings oh yeah still uh what do you call it one minute left i'm fine i'm because you don't call for three four weeks so alhamdulillah where did we stop last time last time we stopped at where we're talking about the meaning of rise on one the ii this will be finished yes we finish that the explanation so we're supposed to go to the next verse okay there isn't any next person is there there is so uh this uh i don't have any in here talking about hijra yeah yeah yeah but we did not reach the hijra would not speak about hijrah noah spoke about he is right okay so we go we go through the ayat and then continue from there inshallah all right ready when you are all right uh hijra because the ayah first or the hijra no before the hijra there was a phrase that he says uh he [Music] remained doing this for 10 years yes that's the one yeah uh he remained doing this for 10 years calling the people to tahit and after 10 years he was ascended up to the heaven where the five daily prayers were made obligated for you and him so he prayed in mecca for three years and thereafter he was ordered to make the hijra migration to medina okay alhamdulillah allah hate about iman about irsan we move to what is the belief of your prophet alison see we will be asked about who's your lord in your grave what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you so it is an essential part of our belief to know who our prophet muhammad ibn abdullah sallallahu alaihi wasallam was and this is not something to be taken lightly as we see nowadays the more people are ignorant and neglectful about their own prophet and messenger the more you would find their iman weak and they are so distant from allah azzawajal and this is obviously you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see this if you go to muslims and you ask them what is the prophet's mother's name i don't know is it they don't know if you ask them about the wives of the prophet you will hear wonders someone who says fatima is his wife yes they don't know the difference between a wife and a daughter so it is an essential part of our religion to know who our prophet salam is his biography his seerah well you don't have to be a scholar and know each and every detail about it but at least you should know the basics and this is what the sheikh the imam may allah azzawajal have mercy on his soul is doing in his book so he told us how he was made a prophet then a messenger and how allah addressed him and ordered him to warn his tribe and to call them to to heed warn them from shirk and from sinning and from from disobeying allah's commands and call them to tawheed to worshipping allah azzawajal and this is exactly what he had done he did this ten years calling to allah azzawajal in mecca to tawhid remember in mecca there was no instruction to pray in the first ten years there was no instruction to give zakat there was no hajj there was no umrah there was no jihad there was nothing of the issues that we all know about today then what was he doing all these years in mecca he spent 10 years in matka scholars say that he spent these years calling people to heed calling people to hakida and the concept of akida many people say we are on the manhattan of the salaf we are believing in the akida of the salaf and when you ask them what is the meaning of akida said huh what is the meaning of al-qaeda it says we believe in yeah what is the rakida what is the difference between mayapida the people don't follow the concept of akida now don't go to your details my attitude yours are to believe in allah azzawajal his beautiful names and attributes the existence of allah azzawajal and you cascade that with believing in allah's messengers in allah's divine books in the angels in the day of judgment in the predestiny in the torment of the grave in the sirat and everything that happens on the day of judgement etc among other things this is our happida and this is why when we have this firm belief in our peda it is impossible to divide us it is impossible to defeat us it is impossible to have a life that is not pleasant or happy because with the correct akida you are the happiest man on earth or woman with the correct hakida you know how to worship allah and you know how to tolerate calamities and to be patient you know how to be grateful to allah azzawajal and thankful you know your duties of doing dawah because you're following the footsteps of the prophet sallam so did the prophet do that of course this is what he had spent all of his life doing so as you have heard he continued to do this 10 years calling people to tell hate sheikh i thought you said he spent 13 years in makkah yes true so why are you saying 10 years if you were to give me some time to finish my sentence you would have understood he remained on this that is calling people to tawheed warning them from shirk for 10 years and then after these 10 years allah elevated him and ascended him in the miraculous journey what is the miraculous journey some scholars say that in a single year that is on the tenth year of dawah the prophet alaihis ram was hit by two sad incidents one was the death of mother khadija may allah be pleased with her who used to support him comfort him bring peace to him at times of difficulties and the second incident was the death of his uncle abu talib which was unfortunate that he died as a disbeliever and he was the one who used to protect him defend him and deter the idol worshipers from harming him he raised him as a son and the prophet alice islam treated him as a father yet he died refusing to accept islam these two important people in the life of our prophet alaihis allah died in the same year this is why some scholars would call this the year of the grief amul but if you look and search in all books of seerah you would never find this description by the companions may allah be pleased with them so nobody gave that year such a description the year of the grief and most likely it was ishti had from some of those who wrote and compiled in the seerah of the prophet was seven so scholars say allah wanted to comfort and give the prophet allah to salaam some form of um it's that it's not the right word but some form of entertainment so that he would overlook his grief so allah wanted to console his prophet by this beautiful magnificent night journey so three years before migration while the prophet sallam was in the house of um and in another narration in the near the kaaba and to combine between two these two narrations the house of omaha was adjacent to the kaaba very close by so it can be described as both jibril came to the prophet alaihis wasallam and they performed a surgery where from his throat downwards to his belly was opened and his heart and the inside were washed with zamzam water and his heart was filled with wisdom in knowledge and belief as a preparation for the journey that is to come and then jibril brought him al-buraq which is a beast which is a ride that is bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule yet it travels faster than light and it would put its front hoofs wherever its sight ended so imagine if you look at somewhere like 5-10 kilometers away and you reach there as soon as you see it so you can just imagine the speed of it i'm sorry you can't imagine the speed of it but it was something extraordinary and the one the majority of of scholars say that the miraculous journey began from mecca to jerusalem into the al-aqsa masjid where the prophet isa met the other prophets and messengers and led them in prayer and then he was ascended to the heavens there is another narration and this was the choice of ibn kathir in his book of the seerah where he said that most likely the prophet was ascended to the seventh seven heavens because if he were to meet and to lead in prayer all the prophets and messengers then ascend to the heavens there was no point in being introduced again to the prophets in each seven heavens so he met in the in the first heaven adam then in the second heaven he uh met uh as we will come inshallah just to see um yusuf and then he met um risa and and and yahya jesus and john and then he in the fourth heaven he met idris in the fifth heaven he met haroon in the sixth heaven he met moses in the seventh heaven he met ibrahim and each one is introduced to him that this is muhammad that he he is the messenger of allah now if he had led them earlier in al masjid al-aqsa there's no point in reintroducing him again but as even katie says if from mecca he was ascended to the heavens meeting the messengers and on his way back he went to jerusalem and led them in prayer that makes more sense either way it's not a big issue but i just wanted to bring this to our attention because students of knowledge all know that this is what the scholars say mecca jerusalem jerusalem heavens heavens mecca but azim kathy says it is mecca heavens heavens jerusalem jerusalem then mecca back again when he was ascended he went to the first lower heavens and this is not the jannah as scholars say this is the heavens and the skies the seven skies and he was met by adam and adam exchanges salam with him and he says welcome with the righteous son the righteous and and and the and the righteous prophet and the description is there it's a long hadith on his right are those souls bound to jannah happy and joyful and on his left are the souls bound to hell whenever he looks to the right he smiles whenever he looks to the left he cries and then he went to the second heaven and he found yahya and john the baptist and jesus peace be upon them and their cousins maternal cousins and they greeted him likewise he went to the third heaven and he found yusuf then he went to the fourth heaven he found idris and the fifth he found haroon and the brother of musa and the sixth he found musa and the seventh he found ibrahim al-khalil may allah peace and praise be upon them all now this was done to show how prophet muhammad ali was honored by allah so allah azza wanted them to meet him in person to see him and to show them how great an important a messenger he is and there are so many things to be discussed but i don't want to bring up the whole seerah in a class that is related to apida so you should go and read this and do your homework on your own we know that in this journey allah azzawajal met the prophet al-islam and allowed the prophet ali to listen directly to the speech of allah we also know the fabrication the fabrication of what many of us believe that was a conversation between allah and the prophet many of us since childhood were taught that when you say he was this is what the prophet said islam when allowed to enter by allah azzawajal and allah replied by saying assalamualaikum and then the prophet sallam replied so that this would not be only for him by saying etc this is not authentic this is fabricated it's not even weak you know there are some hadiths that are weak due to one of the narrators was negligent uh lost his memory when he got old his books were burned so he was giving hadith from his own memory they classify him as the if as not authentic weak no this hadith is fabricated it's not even found in the books of sunnah yet the vast majority 95 percent of the muslims know that this is a conversation between the prophet and allah azza and this is not not true at all so allah azzawajal gave the prophet ali our daily prayers and they were 50. so he went back and was met again by her by musa peace be upon him and this is why i love prophet musa a lot prophet musa is the most prophet and messenger mentioned in the quran do you know that no one is mentioned in the quran more than prophet musa why because his story with the jews his upbringing as a orphan the trials he met from the jews and the plottings they did against him were similar to those which are prophet muhammad sallallahu salaam had faced and this is why allah was over and over repeating different situations so that our prophet sam would find comfort in such stories and that he's not the only one who suffers from his people but rather musa peace be upon him suffered even much greater at some time and then moosa peace be upon him said what did allah give you so the prophet said allah he gave me 50 prayers per day and night imagine in the 24 hours if you have to pray 50 praise this is an average of two prayers an hour and every half an hour or so you have to offer a prayer imagine what life would be in such a situation prophet moses said no your people will not be able to tolerate this go back to your lord and ask him for a reduction so the prophet goes and allah reduces five and then musa peace be upon him says no no go back again and allah reduces another five and another five and another five until it is five daily prayers so the prophet musa says no no it's a lot go and ask for another reduction here our prophet says islam by allah i'm too ashamed of going back again so allah azzawajal reveals to them both that decision my decision does not change they are five prayers but they are rewarded as 50 prayers subhanallah and these five prayers people are fighting tooth and nail not to pray them so you get people saying um i pray only and some even don't pray answer i pray only the maghrib what is this it says i have 40 percent discount you don't pray fajr you're a hypocrite at least you have a sign of hypocrisy in you because this is what the prophet said allah when he described the hypocrites they find fajr prayer and isha prayed the most difficult prayers upon them and had they known the great reward in it they would have crawled to the masjid to attend it subhanallah so in this miraculous night journey the prophet alaihi salatu salaam entered janna paradise which is the ceiling of the seventh heaven and he dwelt in it he saw it and he gave a description of it to us and it's a beautiful long hadith that you can go to the seerah and read it in detail now one last thing before we move on which is the night journey the miraculous night journey known as and this is one of the evidences for the majority of scholars who say the route was mecca and masjid al-aqsa heavens this first ayah says that it was from here to there and other scholars who said no it's the other way around they said yeah it was from mecca to jerusalem but he did not pray in the masjid al-aqsa he went straight to heaven on his way back he led them in prayer before going back to makkah so this miraculous journey it's an issue of dispute among scholars did it take place by spirit by soul or by both physically and by soul what is the difference oh there's a big big difference you see we believe as a sunnah that there were many visions which means that the prophet goes to sleep he sees a vision and he tells us that i saw jannah i saw hellfire i saw this and i saw that and there is no miracle in this this is a revelation from allah we believe it but people would say so we all have visions most of it are lies we know but there's no miracle in that it's a revelation from allah to the prophet this by itself is a miracle but to claim that such visions are miracles no they're not they're just visions however the miraculous night journey was done physically and by the soul so both body and soul were moved to jerusalem then to the seventh heavens and to the jannah and the prophet saw what he saw ali salsa from allah signs and this is confirmed has no doubts in it none whatsoever other narrations where the prophet alaihis was tells us that i saw this in jannah i saw that in hellfire these are visions separately done by the soul and not by the body so i hope this clarifies things up then the imam the sheikh says and the five daily prayers were mandated and the prophet prayed in mecca for three years so the first ten years of dawah there were no prayers prescribed they could have prayed randomly here and there but nothing prescribed now after the miraculous night journey they have five daily prayers to offer they offered it in mecca for three years after that he the prophet was instructed to make hijrah and the hijrah of the prophet sallallahu salaam is by itself a big chapter in this era that we should learn about we know that the prophet alice islam migrated to medina and we also mentioned before that the muslims of mecca due to the prosecution of the idol worshippers were forced to migrate the first migration to abyssinia to al-habasha and scholars say that there were two migrations because in the first one when they left liars circulated in abyssinia that the idol worshippers have accepted islam and now muslims are worshiping allah azzawajal in mecca so some of them went back only to find that they were fooled by such lies so they made another migration new people came and they went to abyssinia again among them was uthman ibn afan the third caliph among them was jafar ibn abi talib the cousin of the prophet isalam and many others so at the end of the 13 years the abuse of the idol worshippers grew and it became became intolerable so the prophet alaihis salat was waiting for the right moment so that allah would permit him to travel and migrate until that moment came which coincided with the attempt of the idol worshippers to assassinate the prophet alaihis salat and assassination was always an option to the tyrants and specifically to the disbelievers and this is used till date when disbelievers are unable to [Music] respond to what they consider to be a challenge to their well-being or to their security or to their religion and beliefs they refer to assassinations and we see that israel the occupying force of the muslim land in palestine they are the biggest assassination power nowadays they've killed so many muslims so many scholars so many scientists so many palestinians and nobody is holding them to account therefore when he was so tired of what would what was happening in mecca he came up with an ingenious plan so he said that we should select one tough strong young man from different tribes so we have like 20 men from 20 tribes and they go at night to the prophet's house alaihis salatu and they all stab him and kill him with their swords so when the family of the prophet the tribe of the prophet hassam demand justice they cannot blame one tribe because they can see that the blood is on all of these 20 men's swords and because of that they cannot fight 20 tribes and hence we will pay his blood money and we would not have a problem with that so allah azzawajal informed his messenger sallallahu of what's being plotted against him and gave him permission to migrate he goes to abu bakr he secretly tells him that he is migrating and abu bakr says i'd like to be your companion and the prophet approves of it and abu bakr cries out of happiness isha says that was the first time i see someone cry crying out of happiness and not out of pain or grief and we know that he asked his cousin ali to sleep on his bed so that people think that he's still asleep those who are coming to assassinate him while he attempts to escape in the darkness of the night with abu bakr to the cave and then hide there for a few days and you know the whole nine yards it's a beautiful story those who don't know it must go back to the seerah books and see the suffering that the prophet went through ali sosam to migrate and see the blessings of allah azzawajal in rescuing his messenger from such a fate and see the devotion of abu bakr in protecting the prophet allah in guarding him in walking in front of him and walking behind him walking to his right and to his left until the prophet said what are you doing you've you're walking in front of me behind me on my right on the left he says oh prophet of allah i remember those who are pursuing us so i walk behind you to protect you if they were to attack us then i remember those who might be ambushing us so i walk in front of you so that i would protect you then i remember that they can come from the right and the left so i walk a little bit here a little bit there if you read abu bakr's devotion during the hijrah you would easily understand why allah made abu bakr may allah be pleased with him the first one from the ummah of islam from ummat muhammad to enter jannah and you would know his weight and magnitude and impact on islam religion and um then the sheikh goes on to speak about hijrah and definition what it is and i think that we will stop uh at this point and inshallah next week we will talk about it further more and allah azzawajal knows best uh we just take some few questions okay now the first question is uh islam alaikum i usually have doubts when i am praying i get the feeling i haven't done the take here and i keep repeating it how do i move forward to yeshua well usually when you are praying you hear noises in your head or as they say you hear voices in your head you did not do the shahood right you have to repeat it whenever you get this say hey wait thank you but who's talking to me who's giving me this advice 99.9 percent of all those who are suffering from ocd when i do to them when i do with them one-to-one counseling sessions and they have problems with divorce repeating it in their heads they have ocd regarding their marital life their teshah their wudu their hustle their prayer i do counseling sessions on regular basis alhamdulillah and in the first five ten minutes i speak with these guys i said when you hear these voices in your head who do you think is talking to you and they all say shaytan so i tell them listen my name is asam al-hakim i am a con artist i'm a liar i'm a cheater and i steal people's money and i take people's money and never return them can you give me a million nera please i will invest it for you and give you a lot of good uh profit would you ever give it to me everybody says of course not you just identified yourself as a big crook how can we trust you and i said subhanallah when shaytan whispers in your ears that your the shahada is missing or you said the wrong phrase how do you believe him it is you who's opening the door and inviting him in so don't blame anyone except yourself those who have ocd and every prayer they get the same doubts or similar did i read the shahood yeah i read it what did i say this phrase correctly or i made a mistake no i think i made a mistake i think i think perhaps maybe i'm doubtful throw it in the dustbin ignore it if it's not 100 certain throw it in the dustbin and move on with your prayer yes sheikh but it is very difficult i cannot don't say i cannot it is you who want others to feel sorry and pitiful for you oh the poor thing he's got whispers he's got ocd i feel sorry for him it's you who want people to feel pity and this is why you can't if you want it you can so whoever has this ignore it and move on because it's regular sheikh i don't know if i pray three raka's or four rakahs i don't remember if i did one sajdah or two the default question do you get this every single salah or once every blue moon should no shaykh every salah said ignore it and move on act upon your gut feeling whether right or wrong in couple of weeks time shaytan will give up and you will never find this again but you must stop him you must refrain from listening to him and allah knows best next question is uh please do a husband have full authority on his wife's inheritance or her late father or mother like he has control over what she inherited yes if he's a thief and a burglar and a liar and a cheater like i had just described myself earlier who gives him the right in a single penny that she has and possesses that's her god-given right if he has right over it allah would have made him inherit her father and mother not her allah made her the heir and gave her a percentage of what they had left who gives you as a husband the right to come and say don't do this with your money do this with your money give me your money you're a crook nowhere in islam where you will find islam giving the husband right over his wife's wealth whether it is inherited whether it is earned due to her job whether it is due to her uh trading it is her money not yours so yes a man has no control over his wife's possessions full stop uh the next question is can we see allah in the lowest level of jannah or only internet referrals all those who enter jannah will be having the privilege of seeing allah azzawajal the frequency and the length depends on the level in the jannah you cannot expect someone in the lower level to see allah as frequently and as long as those in the friday but how why how many this is something we have no knowledge of now next question is are the bodies of the prophet dead or alive in their graves okay let me use reverse psychology with this question the question is very clear the prophet muhammad islam is he alive or is he dead in his grave now if i were to say if i were to go to his grave and open his grave will he be able to come out and speak to me and shake hands with me and go out to have lunch together or not now those who claim the super sufis who claim that the prophet is alive alisa they find a very difficult task to answer this question so they usually would not say yes or no because if they said yes he will come out we would say then with all due respect why aren't you getting him out if he's alive let him solve our problems in this world you see the wars you see the famine you see the problems with his wisdom that allah has given him he can solve all our problems so they can't say that allah said that you are verily die going to die and they will die in another verse allah azza says muhammad is merely a messenger who many messengers came before him if he were to die if he were to go to be assassinated will you go back on your heel so again is the prophet alive or dead well we know that he is dead in the standards of us human beings who are alive on earth so when my father dies or when my friend dies or when my loved one dies i can see him lying on the bed not moving not breathing there's no pulse what is he he's dead is the prophet like this dead the answer is yes the prophet is dead without any doubt in our standards but we know that there are three phases there is the dunya which we live on and when we die we go to a transitional period between dunya and being the hereafter there's a transitional period when we are in our graves it's called al barzach and in al-barzah people are alive but not like our lives so they don't drink cappuccino in the morning they don't have a big piece of steak they don't go to the gym they're alive in a way that only allah knows about it while their bodies normal people decay and they turn into dust only the bodies of the prophets also are preserved and it cannot decay it's like the day they died only and maybe some other and this is something whom allah azza chooses but it's very very rare so their life is not like our lives one of the super sufis and he was the mufti of azhar a few years back he says that i used to repeat allah al-muhammad 500 times a day because there was a hadith which is a fabricated life whoever says 500 times will see me alive subhan allah not will see me in his vision that would have been tolerated and accepted you know he would see the prophet alive if the prophet is alive then why wouldn't he come and let us meet him like the companions this doesn't make any sense so this previous mufti of al-azhar says and i went to medina one day and all of a sudden from the grave the prophet's hand came extended to me to give him the pledge of allegiance to give him baya so i shook hands of the prophet ali and we would have asked him if you had some sense in your mind why didn't you pull the prophet out if he was as you claim this was shaytan messing up with your head but these super sufis all of the religion is based on such funny things that shaytan messes up with their heads and they believe that it is authentic or they believe that it is a reality may allah azza will protect us and save us so going back to your question again is the prophet alive or he's dead in his grave he is dead according to our standard and according to what was mentioned in the quran and according to what the companions did when they prayed funeral prayer and his uh property was given to charity and he was he did not leave anything for his heirs he did not leave anything for for fatima or the other wives of the prophet because they don't leave any heirs but when we come to the life of the barzah he is alive allah azzawajal would return his soul and he appoints an angel to convey salam so when i say muhammad this angels goes to the prophet and says to him awesome hakeem has just given you salaam the prophet replies to my salam and allah knows best masha'allah let's take the last question uh he said islam alaikum i'm from bangladesh i know uh a hadith where the prophet saws say whoever settled among catholics is not among us can we migrate for work to non-muslim countries but live in muslim communities this is a good uh question but it is related to my next lecture where i will speak about migration the rulings of it when to allow it and when it is prohibited the hadith mentioned is correct but if i answer your question i'm going to um spoil this i'm going to speak about pakistanis and bangladesh is migrating because they have muslim countries and i will also talk about indians migrating because their country is already a kafir country so is there any difference so inshallah bear with me next week if sheikh nazar is willing to to take me next week or leave me for another four weeks uh waiting and anticipating inshallah it's been beautiful having you we hope to see you next week i i hope this blow was not below the belt no see you next week insha allah"
