  "transcript": "foreign basically my like my entire family unfortunately like they celebrate Christmas and they wish each other Merry Christmas and stuff but um on the New Years they're inviting like a lot of people so how do I deal with them how do I do I stay in the house do I leave I'm kind of confused I don't know what to do not permissible at all to celebrate other than for the Muslims and this is by the command of the Prophet himself Allah has substituted you with two days meaning that these are the only two days you can celebrate and be joyful in every year so they are Aid coming at the same time every year participating in celebrations of AIDS and festivals of the non-muslims is totally prohibited congratulating them is also prohibited simply because the prophet Allah and his companions lived among them and with them and never ever reported that he ever celebrated or congratulated them once nor he endorsed their celebrations or did anything to show such congratulations and and and the likes on the opposite he told us that whoever imitates a people that he's one of them and the verses of the Quran and the hadiths of the Prophet Islam all Direct in not endorsing falsehood and not witnessing azure and what is more zure and falsehood than these celebrations Christmas stating that the Son of God was born on the 25th of December which is totally false from all aspects even the Christians themselves they say it couldn't have been in the 25th of December it's too cold for the Shepherds to go and a graze their flocks but this is beside the point so as a Muslim if your family insists on celebrating and Gathering all what you have to do if they're Muslims give them advice diplomatically if they scold you or are unwilling to listen to you just stay in your room lock yourself in go to bed early or do something useful go out with righteous friends attend a lecture go play football do anything but do not participate in such Haram celebrations and Allah Knows Best"
