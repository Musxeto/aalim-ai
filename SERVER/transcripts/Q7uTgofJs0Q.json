  "title": "Is hunting or fishing for fun, without the need for the meat, permissible in Islam? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "thank you I had a question uh we had a discussion with Brothers about hunting um so I let's say for example I have I don't know maybe two kilograms of beef lamb maybe some fish at home store right and all of a sudden I decided to go for hunting or fishing or hunting let's say a wild deer or a wild bird of some kind obviously Halal one and then bring your home cook and enjoy with my family right uh and this is not for sports reasons however technically speaking you enjoyed the process right getting ready for the hunt you dress up and you you make sure your shotgun is ready or for example your arrows and bows and then um because of this can you say you can't hunt and bring home that deer because there's no necessity in that and you already have a meat at home or you go there and you enjoy the process is there any Hadith or uh on that backs up it restricts uh says for example you cannot hunt because you already have a meat at home this is not a valid logic which the brothers are using because according to their logic if I have bottles of water in the fridge I shouldn't buy a box of bottled waters unless I finish the one I have in the fridge if I have chicken meat fish in my fridge I shouldn't buy beef or steaks or ribs because I already have some in my fridge and this is not true the confusion these brothers are getting is from an authentic Hadith where the Prophet Allah prohibited taking animals as shooting targets and this was a sports in the past and probably is still till date where people who live a lavish life just shoot animals for the fun of it and they leave it they don't eat it they don't use it and this is totally prohibited and the one who does this is cursed by Allah azzawajal however if someone loves hunting and enjoys it but he does utilize what he hunts whether by taking the fur or by eating the meat or by giving the meat to the neighbors even if someone goes fishing and he catches a lot of fish and he doesn't eat fish but he gives it to the poor or to the neighbors or to the loved ones there's nothing wrong at all in this so shooting a uh a duck or a bird or um a gazelle if a deer if this is uh permitted in your country and eating the meat or storing it or giving it as a gift there's nothing wrong in that inshallah"
