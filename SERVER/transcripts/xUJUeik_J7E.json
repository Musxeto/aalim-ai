  "transcript": "stating that a follower was in Tasha hood there is the final touch a hood and was confused whether he said salato Ibrahim iya or not the Imam said that Aslam and the follower assumed that he had read it so he said mr. Salim as well immediately he remembered it was a 50-50 situation and that he should have read it in this case he missed a Rajab should he repeat his mother absolute first of all the ruling on the prayer behind an imam differs whether you forget a pillar of the salat or a mandatory act or a Sunnah because these are the three things that the prayer is dissected to so we come to that a solitary brahimi saying soli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammadin commence allah tala ibrahim while al Ibrahimi naka homonym Majid etc 'what's the ruling on it some scholars say it is a pillar of salat it is like rukuh and sujud other scholars say that it is a sunnah if you don't pray it then there is nothing wrong in it I personally am inclined to follow the third opinion which says that it is mandatory it's not a pillar but it's also not a soon it is mandatory to offer so in your case in the case of the questioner he neglected an obligatory act not intentionally but rather thinking that he had performed it like for example if you are Institute and you do not say subhanAllah be illallah out of forgetfulness or you say instead something else you said some hand would be loving which is the wrong thing to say so one would argue what to do you have one of two scenarios either you are with the Imam from the very beginning or you have missed Erica or more if you have missed Erica or more this means that after the salaam you will stand up and complete your prayer hence you have to offer forgetfulness prostration so you the cell for the Rajab for the mandatory act that you have dropped now if you are with the Imam from the beginning the moment he gives salaam you also give Salam and your prayer is valid but share I forgot to say subhanAllah Bell Allah Institute no problem you did it out of forgetfulness or by mistake yeah but I said to Hanna be having no problem I forgot to say it here to lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat oh wait wait a triad is a pillar you forgot that you have to add a new raka in compensation but if you forgot something mandatory such as allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad this is mandatory but because you are with the imam the imam takes the burden and he guarantees that your prayer is valid and i hope this answers your question"
