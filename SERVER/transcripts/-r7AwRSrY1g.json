  "transcript": "okay the second question from the sister is regarding the she says I pray the night prayer sometimes and I doubt uh with myself what's the best time to pray and she says I get a one hour before the F prayer and I pray and I do my w she said is this the best time that one hour before the well it depends from person to the other our Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam as narrated bya may Allah be pleased with her told us that the prophet sallam prayed at the very beginning of the night which means after Salah Isa prayer and he prayed in the middle of the night and he prayed at the very end of the night so it depends it varies from a person to the other abua for example he told us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam advised him and instructed him not to sleep before performing W wit prayer which means that Abu H used to pray at the very beginning of the night so it it's all okay but but the most preferred time for praying night prayer is the last third of the night so of course 1 hour or two hours or three hours before fer prayer this is considered to be the third last third part of the night alhamdulillah and she's doing uh uh well if this is her capacity and capability 1 hour alhamdulillah it's good if she can add to that alhamdulillah but the most important thing that she is consistent we don't want her to pray for a whole month 3 hours and then she is fed up and she abandons praying is this consistency for other acts as well or is it just particular it's for all it's for all the prophet Alam told us that Allah does not give up on us until we give up on him or we feel bored of a particular uh uh form of worship and he told us that the best uh uh forms of worship are those that are consistent even if they are little so it's good sometimes to start a half an hour the hour and then increase rather of course of course okay well for that okay"
