  "transcript": "uh where should a person start when seeking knowledge and where should he go when wanting to seek knowledge seeking knowledge is not something that is easy it's not a package deal or a form of things you do that happens overnight it's a very very lengthy hard process so seeking knowledge in the beginning each and every one of us must seek knowledge of the basics where he is a Muslim and his Islam would not be valid without it so you have to know the pillars of Islam in general what are the pillars of Iman in general what are the three questions you'll be asked in the grave in general what uh how to pray and how to uh fast the things that you're required to do the basics which you can learn in maybe one day then you have to start to go up the ladder so if you want to be a highly decorated student of knowledge you need and you must learn Arabic because without Arabic you're depending on someone like me to translate into English which is not very sufficient and and helpful it's good but it will never ever make you a full-fledged student of knowledge then you have to learn the very most important thing which is Al Quran so you have to learn the Quran memorize it know the alongside with the beautiful names of Allah and the general things without without going too extreme into the sects and Cults so many people who studyed are disoriented when they leave the and study all different Cults of okay then we so you don't focus on studying other sects and read your own so when I say to you I said we're not we're not we're not okay what are you so it's me no focus on the real the essence of the and then that would be cascaded with that then you need to study a concise F according to one of the schools of the thought of the four schools of thought one one concise from beginning to end just to have a full overview of f now each School 85% is correct 15% is wrong so whatever you study you'll be in good hands after that you can go to study the real F according to the Quran and the Sunnah and filter all what you've studied and and you go to and you but this is not something to be done in three months 6 months one year five years it depends on your comprehension ability to memorize the teachers you're giving and the dedication of course when you're tired and bored you learn the of the prophet and entertain yourself by doing so there is a lot of things you have to study like theith and the likes but it's so huge now you may be deterred and said oh this is too much I'd I'd rather go and study English but not everyone is qualified to study and not everyone who memorizes books and material will become a most people make the biggest mistake when they come and say sheim I'd like to come become like you I said don't because if this is your intention you've lost decide to become someone who pleases Allah and then you will become a maybe you will become famous maybe you'll be do if not who cares I'm doing what I'm doing for the sake of Allah to have an objective to become famous or to become a scholar this is a breach of sincerity and Allah Knows Best"
