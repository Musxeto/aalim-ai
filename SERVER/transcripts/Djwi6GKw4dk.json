  "transcript": "uh straight I have a question so basically if a person eats food and then it doesn't say this helps the shower pain so if one person is too lazy to say this does this Stay come out of the foot of Islam No no no it does not at all take you out of the fold of Islam because saying Bismillah is an issue of dispute whether it is mandatory which we believe it is or highly recommended which a lot of the scholars also believe it is so if you fail to say it out of laziness whether in the beginning or in the middle by saying Bismillah this doesn't take out of the fold of Islam and to a lot of the scholars it is not even sinful so Yani inshallah this answers your question"
