  "transcript": "the allegation that you have brought forward is used by a a cult known as and the most authentic opinion is that Al are not labeled as Muslims they are apostates because they reject the Quran while claiming to defend it how is that done they say we believe in the Quran and we reject the Hadith of the Prophet Alat and we discredit anything that is not found in the Quran and usually they put forward the allegation that the scholars say that the Quran is incomplete have you ever heard any Muslim scholar say the Quran is incomplete yes or no any scholar who says the Quran is incomplete is a cfir Allah says Allah says today I have completed your religion but the qur do not say that part of completing the religion is to believe in the Quran and in the Sunnah and this is what is mentioned in the Quran in hundreds of places obey Allah obey the prophet and the people of authority so the OB Obedience of Allah and The Obedience of prophet Muhammad is referring to the Quran and to the and this is why Allah says if you dispute over an issue always refer back to the Quran to to Allah which is the Quran and to the messenger which is the Sunnah and if you ask these you say that the de is complete he said yes the Quran is complete it doesn't need anything so they said yes Subhan Allah where do you find in the Quran that there are five prayers is composed of one and two s and is for silent is for silent m is three two are loud and one is silent and Asha is four we don't find it but the culture and the people are doing it so we're doing it okay alhamdulillah where do you find in the Quran that zakat is to be given on cattle livestock gold and silver and crops that are grown from the earth with different percentages 2.5% generally 5% over crops if it it is irrigated by you and 10% if it is irrigated through rainfall and rivers and for the livestock it's different five camels you give one sheep if you have 10 camels you give this much if you have 30 cows you give this cow if you have 40 you have a different cow if you have uh 40 sheep you have one sheep where is this in the Quran this is not authentic so they cannot undermine Islam so what do they do they disseminate it bit by bit if they speak about the Quran people will attack them and kill them so they say h let's go a little bit lower let's talk about Sunnah let's try to refute Sunnah let's try to insult Sunnah and likewise insult the scholars the scholars don't know the scholars say that Islam is incomplete the Quran is incomplete they need this they need that and once we manage to do this we can also attack the Quran later on so in response to your to your question this is very simple very crystal clear and with the grace of Allah no matter how hard they try they are speaking to deaf ears our ears are deaf with the beauty of the Quran and the beauty of the Sunnah and we will live strive and thrive"
