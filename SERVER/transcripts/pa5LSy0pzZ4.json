  "transcript": "uh sh had a question I bought uh Playstation 4 about a year and a half back and I want to sell it now but the confusion is that 99% of people who buy such gaming consoles they use it for Haram so is it permissible for me to sell it or no to tell you the truth I don't have an idea how this device look like but may I ask you a question abdulh Hadi this device can you play uh I think FIFA Football uh yes so is this Halal or Haram this is halal the vast majority of the youth I know usually spend their time playing this game and inshallah this is permissible if you follow the Islamic conditions and you don't do anything Haram therefore why assume that the vast majority who will buy this counil from you or this device will use it in Haram it's a device like a a knife you can cut people throats with it and you can cut the bread and the meat to eat with it so I don't have to make a placement test for whomever wants to buy it from me about their purpose and intention of buying it and I don't as long as I don't have any clue CL about it it is permissible for you to sell it"
