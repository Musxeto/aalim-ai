  "title": "Giving the zakat to non-Muslims",
  "transcript": "got some questions from Sister s here first one is about zaka again she says are we allow in any circumstances to give zaka to non-muslims this is an issue of dispute among Scholars because one of the eight categories mentioned in the Quran of zaka is those who we would like to draw them to Islam and may Allah be pleased with him the second said that this was at the very beginning of time and now we don't have to draw people to Islam by paying the money heads of states or uh uh leaders of tribes and so on we don't have to do this they either accept Islam or not but majority of Scholars say no it's still uh uh acceptable to give money of zakat Whenever there is the need to draw the hearts of people to Islam inshallah this is acceptable"
