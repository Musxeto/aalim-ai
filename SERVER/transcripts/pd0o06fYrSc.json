  "title": "Reward for women praying at home better than at masjid, even in Makkah haram - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "well okay what about women if they decided to go to pray it would that be sufficient would be it would that be accepted the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was salam to women that their prayers is better if they pray or offer it home at home but he also instructed and ordered the men not to prevent women if they want to go to the Masjid so now in one hadith the Prophet prohibits men who are the guardians of women to prevent women from attending the congregational prayer in the Masjid let him know imma Allah he masajid Allah okay but at the same time though women have the permission to go the Prophet said that praying in their homes is better for them so does this cascade also to the harem we know that praying in the harem one prayer is equivalent to a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere so if a woman goes for amma with her husband and she wants what's more rewarding she likes going down to the haram and praying in the Masjid and seeing the Kaaba etc but she wants what is good for business she wants money she once has an axe she want good deeds so we tell her that praying in your hotel room praying in your hotel room is far better for you and greater for your reward and this was mentioned clearly in the hadith of the prophet sallallaahu Salam when a woman came to him and said o prophet of Allah I like I love to pray in your Masjid so he said to her I know that you love to pray in my Masjid but praying in your house is better praying in my Masjid and praying in your home is better than praying in your house and praying in your inner home is better than praying in your home and praying in your chambers is better than praying in your inner home so the Prophet is making it tighter and tighter to indicate that a woman's prayer far away from people's gaze and the possibility of nan Muharram seeing her is much better than praying in the message of the Nabi Saleh wasallam which is a thousand times better than praying elsewhere other than the Masjid of Mecca"
