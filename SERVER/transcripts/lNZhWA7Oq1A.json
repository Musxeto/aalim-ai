  "title": "Is a child born out of wedlock attributed to their father or not? #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh you explain a lot of times that when a child is born out of wedlock do not attribute it to the father and if it's a girl she should wear the hij in front of the father but a few months ago a woman asked you about a child born out of wedlock from a caic man and you said biologically and logically the child is the father's child so they can bear his name I'm confused since I'm only a please explain you are a Layman but you you don't have anything to do with wedlock do you I I do yeah the vast majority look at the Hadith where may Allah be pleased with him and uh disputed about his nephew the son of when he had had a dispute with ABB Zam the brother-in-law of SAA the mother of the Believers when they disputed over a child AB claims that this is my brother because he was born to my father's concubine and S says this is my nephew the son of because before he died he told me that he committed uh uh fornication he fornicated with this woman and that's his son and you look at the resemblance he looks like my my brother so the prophet said his Hadith the son or the boy is attributed to the bed who's the owner of the bed who was who he was born to so the owner of the bed is z the father of of of SAA because he's the owner of the concubine whether he had relationship with her or not whether he was the biological father or not regardless if she was married and she conceived and gave birth the child would be attributed to the husband even if the husband was away for six years and all of a sudden she gives birth whoa what is this correspondence no okay is the husband rejecting him and saying no he's not my son if he did then we move on to stage two of and cursing and the likes but if he doesn't then he's attributed to his father quote unquote who's not his biological father 1,000% because he's was away for six months six years now if this woman did not have a bad meaning she was single and she was not married before this is an issue of dispute where Islam has few things here and there however we do not go usually into details because we don't want people to say whoa we have a way out come on my place are yours and if anything happens we'll figure it out no the majority of Scholars say he's not attributed to the biological father according to this Hadith but the fatwa differ from one person to the other fatwa is not for Layman it's not for you and him and me and others it's for the scholars and this is why you may hear a fatwa for an individual and may may hear the same opposite of this fatwa for another individual although the case is the same that is mindblowing but this is what happens a man came to abdah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet one of the greatest Scholars of the Companions and he said to him if a man kills another is there any room for repentance he said yes half an hour later another man comes and he says if a man kills another is there any room for repentance he said no his students were shocked said whoo come on same exact identical question one you said yes one you said no why now IB Abbas is the Muti so he said the first man came with tears filling his eyes and remorse apparent on his face I knew he killed someone so he's asking for a way out to repent to Allah to ask for forgiveness I would not return him away from Allah's forgiveness so I said yes and this is to all Sinners I didn't do anything wrong the other man came with Sparks coming from his eyes and Vengeance traces and I knew that he was attempting to kill someone but he wanted an alab he wanted an excuse so I said no there is no repentance so that I would block him from going ahead with his crime so it differs and it's not appropriate to go and ask the she why did you say this and sometimes people come to you and they don't even speak Arabic they don't read the Quran they don't know an a of the Quran said what's your Del so okay I'll give you a Del maybe I I'll quote you some poetry would that be sufficient you wouldn't understand so I hope this answers the question"
