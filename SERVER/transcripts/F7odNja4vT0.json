  "transcript": "[Music] nasria from ethiopia says her aunt is married to a christian and she celebrates the christian feasts like christmas like thanksgiving etc so is she a muslim or not and can she visit her as an aunt and maybe to give her dawah as for your visitation to give her dawah there's no problem in that at all because this is an obligation to call her back to islam but this would be apparent after two three visitations if there is no hope in her then let it go now is she muslim or not this is something that we cannot judge because she is one of two if she believes that what she is doing is wrong and against islam and is prohibited to marry other than a muslim yet she still went ahead with it acknowledging the fact that her marriage is invalid then she's a muslim but she's a fornicator an adulteress but if she says no i'm a muslim and i know that in islam in the quran it says that it is totally prohibited for a muslim woman to marry someone who is not a muslim yet my marriage is still valid though he's christian and i know that then she's an apostate and she is not a muslim anymore celebrating the feasts of other religions this is a major sin but it does not take a person out of the fold of islam just for celebrating it and allah knows best"
