  "title": "Can we hold the Quran with our left hand, is it apostasy or sinful? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is holding the Quran with the left hand an act of apostasy okay as for um holding the Quran with your left hand Allah gave us two hands and he told us not to hold our private parts or clean ourselves after defecating or urinating with our right hand so now we know what to avoid any told us not to eat and drink and give and take with our left hand so now I know other than that it's so it's fine when I prostrate should I place one hand on the ground which is my right and my left hand behind my back or should I put them both no you should put them both so in standing up should I put my left hand on my chest or would this be apostasy no you have to do this because this part of praying likewise if I hold my Quran with my right or with my left there is no preference none whatsoever oh but Sheik we know that the left hand is used for indecent things yeah but this is not the default so if I'm eating a cheeseburger in it's big double or triple layer should I do this or can I hold it with both hands I can hold it with both hands if I'm drinking from a big vessel that I can't carry with one I can hold them with both hands there's no problem in holding the Quran with your left hand let alone it being apostasy it's not even sinful to hold it with your left hand and Allah Knows Best"
