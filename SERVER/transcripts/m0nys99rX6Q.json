  "transcript": "a man from the UK says how many days are there for ehtekaf in Ramadan the answer is 10 this is the Sunnah but one can make less than that so scholars say even if you go for an hour and you intend there decaf it counts can I make it in the beginning of Ramadan in the middle of Ramadan or it has to be in the last ten nights of Ramadan it is permissible whenever you want to make it because in the beginning the Prophet as Salam made it in the first and then in following years he made it in the second ten that is from the 10th to the twentieth and finally he remained doing it on the last ten and one Ramadan he skipped it altogether because a dispute that took place out of jealousy between his wives each wanting to perform ehtekaf so he cancelled all of that and he made it up in shawol and Omar may Allah be pleased with him loud to make a Attica for one night in al-haram in Mecca and the Prophet told him to fulfil his vow so it means that you can do it in other than the last 10 nights though the best in the highest and reward is to do it exactly as the Prophet had done it so lala haria who i will seldom"
