  "title": "Who is eligible to receive the Zakat (Poor & Needy) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay abusive from Saudi Arabia he is asking two questions on the same topic so a person who is bankrupt who lost his job for any reason but he owns an apartment it does he qualify to receive zakat money and his siblings whether they're working or not do they qualify to receive zakat money ah he don't burden yourself especially with relatives because whenever we have zakat money we tend to look at our sisters our cousins our close relatives to give them the zakat or our close friends and sometimes we tend to bend the rules a little bit until it breaks so what is the ruling you as mentioned in verse 60 chapter 9 that the cat can be given only to eight categories the first two categories are the poor and the needy so if this owner of a flat is classified as poor he's not because he's got a flat but he's classified as needy because he does not have what suffices his needs so if he is classified as needy it has no savings no income and at the middle of the month he needs money for essential things such as medication tuition for the children food etc and he is unable to afford that he is a recipient of zakat likewise your siblings if they fit the description then yes you can give them from the zakat Abu Bakr from Libya"
