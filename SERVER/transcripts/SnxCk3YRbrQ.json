  "transcript": "somebody is asking whether is it allowed for a person to fast 40 consecutive days in the intention Allah will make something easy for you and the person is talking from a point of experience that he has done and it happened this is 100% prohibited in Islam you say why I'll give you the reason number one and you understand what I say because this is the methodology the way we should be thinking as Muslims when we hear such questions oh I fasted 40 days and it was consecutive and Allah gave me what I wanted I was hoping to graduate and I graduated I was hoping to pay off my debt and some magical way my debt was paid off it's out of experience very good so when someone comes to you what do you do you analyze it through the lenses of Quran and Sunnah Quran says today I have completed your religion and I've perfected my favor upon you and I accepted Islam to be your religion which means if fasting 40 consecutive days at the time of the Prophet alai was not there it cannot be part of Islam yes I understand it's not part of Islam but I tried it and it's good okay this is a new religion good luck with that as a Muslim I cannot do it number two the prophet saidat whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected Allah will not accept it and this is not part of our religion so it is not accepted number three not everything is done by experience for example I can say that before I came here to Kenya for my visit for five or six days I made Dua and I said oh Allah if going to Kenya would make it easier for for me to pay off my debt oh Allah make it happen I went to Kenya and my debt was paid says okay every time I have something I come to Kenya this has no relationship to Islam it is a coincidence yes it is a possibility that Allah is testing you yes a brother for 10 years his wife would not conceive he comes to me said I went to omah every week I go to omah and ask Allah and my wife doesn't conceive so I said be patient this is a test from Allah one of them super sufis come and says you want Allah to accept and you want to have a child he said yes please said okay go to Egypt in Cairo there is the Masjid of Al Hussein the grave of Al Hussein is there may Allah be pleased with him go to the grave and write a small petition and slide it underneath the door and you will see wonders the guy goes books a ticket goes to Cairo goes to the Masjid of husin and he writes the petition and puts it under the grave nine months he has a twin boy and a girl he comes to me says she look look look 10 years I've been going to the Kaa and Allah does not accept my Dua I went to this Hussein grave and look I have a twin boy what is your point a that Allah does not exist in exist no no no you're crazy Allah is testing you and you failed big time you're a big mush go to hell so this 40 days concept is totally out of the fold of Islam and Allah knows best h"
