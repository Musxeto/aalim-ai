  "transcript": "uh she if my mother asks me to drive her so she can visit her sister or her female friend and I know for sure that there would be free mixing for my mother would I be sinful if I just drop her there and pick her up later on first of all the main rule in Islam inah chapter number five Allah says in the beginning and collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon trans transgression and vice or sin so your mother is your mother you have to obey her you have to be dutiful to her you have to um be respect ful if you know that the sole purpose of her going there is to commit Haram you cannot assist her on that but if it's a byproduct where she's going to attend a Halal event she has something to do she has relatives to visit and as a byproduct there might be free mixing or there might not this is a byproduct this is not the origin she's not going to a musical concert or she's going to a bar for example rather she's going to a gathering that might be free mixing and this is a byproduct then you have to try to advise her to try to be diplomatic with her to avoid taking her there and if this is not possible then you should take her while hating it with your heart because at the end of the day she's going most likely to take a cab or to do something Haram other than that in addition to what may result of that in the future and may Allah guide her heart to abiding by the rulings of Islam"
