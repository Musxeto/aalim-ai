  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says what's the ruling on drinking from a bottle of water if this is your bottle of water you can drink from it as you wish the prohibition is to drink from something that is shared between people while breathing from it or in it so if you drink from a cup like this and you keep on and exhaling and god knows allah knows what falls inside some of the brothers have like big uh uh astakosa uh lobsters uh uh mustaches that fall inside and then he gives you the has said uh join in well do respect what is this the thing's moving inside so no this is what the prophet prohibited from but if it's your vessel and you're drinking from it there's no problem if it's a common vessel that others would drink then you may drink from it but do not breathe inside of it so take a sip and you can drink it and breathe then take another sip without breathing in it and allah knows best"
