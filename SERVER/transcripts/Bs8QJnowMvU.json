  "title": "Using Vitamin C to lighten skin in order to fix a pigmentation problem - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so basically I've seen a patient who is a patient of melasma which is a skin disorder which you can get by UVB rays when it affects your skin so this patient basically has uh brown spots on her on the corners of her lips the problem is she applied a bleaching agent and um which affected her surrounding skin as well now what I want to recommend her and direct her as practitioners recommend is something called vitamin C vitamin C is will not lighten her skin to a dramatic level like Michael Jackson but it might make her a skin tone lighter because when if she will stop using that bleaching agent now what will happen is that melasma would return after five six or three months and will return even darker so right now the melism is in control so if I give her vitamin C if she applies vitamin C um her skin that melasma would be in control and it probably won't come back darker and generally I can ask her to use it just on that area but the problem is that her skin her surrounding skin might get pigmented so practitioners generally generally recommend to use it on the entire entire face so my question is is this premise of a well this is a little bit too technical for me and might be way above my pay grade I have to seriously look into it and consider all aspects of it and maybe consult some of the major Scholars for opinion the standard fatwa is if there is I don't know if the right word is pigmentation difference of color you can restore whatever was previously there with medical treatment or surgery if using vitamin C would fix this this is permissible now what you're saying is that you have to treat the whole face to become lighter in color fairer in color so it's a form of bleaching as well but what you're saying to me that it is not intended for the sake of bleaching rather to keep the tone the same so that there would not be any difference of color and I have to look into how the bleaching is done what degree how fair would she become and if there are any other Alternatives and to contemplate upon it so I would highly recommend and ask if it's possible to post this question to my website so that I can think about it inshallah"
