  "transcript": "Mohammed says what's the truth about Illuminati I had to go and search this a little bit but could not find anything first of all Illuminati is something that there is a lot of myths and stories about which you cannot pinpoint and say it's true or its false likewise Freemasonry so the Freemasons also claim to be though longer in existence than the Illuminati because some say that the only surface for ten years for a decade while the Freemasons were there for centuries either way as Muslims do we need this that says no do we have to be aware of this the answer again is no unless there are facts and things that we can pinpoint and say this is true see the essence of Islam is to seek knowledge that is beneficial the Prophet used to seek refuge salallahu alaihe salam in allah azzawajal from knowledge that is not beneficial or who to become an ill mean lion firm so knowledge that is not beneficial for you you should avoid and by avoiding it you would focus on what is good on what draws you closer to allah azza wajal and this is why going deep into these I don't know what to say but it's not a fairy tale into these fabrications and illusions and myths is a waste of time as a Muslim I'm ordered to be careful to be keen on knowing what is being plotted against Islam but not to go and make things up not to consider any eye that I see to be a sign of the Antichrist or the Dajjal or the Illuminati's any pyramid that has an eye in it that's their sign I the conspiracy theories spreading all around us again not all of them not even the majority of them are true yet people keep on circulating it and giving it momentum and the negative thing of such an act is that the Muslims feel vulnerable and inferior when everything that is taking place in the world is attributed to Freemasons to the Lions or whatever they call them that the Rory's clubs etc and giving them more power than what they actually possess this makes the Muslims feel weak feel inferior and they feel vulnerable to any attack anything could happen yes we acknowledge that through history the Jews collaborating with the hypocrites had many conspiracies against Islam roma-roma-ma pop was killed by the Persians the fire worshippers who hold grudges and enmity against the Muslims still today the forefathers of the referred on earth man even our fan the third caliph was also assassinated I leave now ABI talib the 4th caliph was assassinated the collaboration and the fingerprints of the Jews the hypocrites and the RAF table is evident and this does not prevent them from collaborating over the centuries to continue their dirty work but as Muslims we don't have the time nor the luxury to just read and skim through all what was written about such stories and believe in it when there is no proof for it so my advice to you my mood is leave all of this behind you focus on learning the Quran on learning the Sunna of the Prophet irresolute salam and getting a good grip over your religion and this will make you immune this will give you immunity against all such things as illuminati or the Freemasons and these agencies that are trying to attack Islam and the Muslims"
