  "title": "Gold zakat of wife, husband get frustrated when she asks him to pay, who must pay it assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is if the wife is unable to sell her jewelry for any reason some of it was stolen or sold and it would cause her loss and the amount of remaining zakat for earlier years may be more than entire jewelry itself so a family member who handles the house expenses speaks to women's husband who are pleased to pay but it's a big amount and due to fear of mixed wealth it was decided that he would pay monthly from active salary rather than collectively from account as matisy salary won't contain interest first this would take very long so if the relative after Guided by his scholar later realizes that Collective payment should have been finalized but if anyone restart the discussion again with the husband he would get very frustrated and Disturbed so due to fear of mixed wealth so now should he be insisted on Collective payment again or is there any sin in monthly payment in this case the second is over what gold where is the gold uh gold is there and but in the for the past few years they had not paid that goal okay this is not the husband's responsibility the gold belongs to the wife and she's the one who's being held accountable on the day of judgment whether to go to Hell or Heaven regarding the pay not paying the zakat so she is not to go back to her husband and ask him for money because it's not his responsibility if he needed money he would not take the gold and sell it and use it for his own needs this is the wife's possession she is ordered and instructed to go and sell some of the gold and give whatever is due for the previous years without him knowing about it and Allah knows best this is all"
