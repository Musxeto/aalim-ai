  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] asalam alayum alhamdulillah [Music] Al [Music] [Music] speak alal convention therefore let us begin our forum tonight we have alhamdulillah sheim we have Dr Bilal Phillips and also the one and only she Dr Hussein y uh since she Hussein he's from Malaysia how are you sh Hussein alhamdulillah alhamdulillah let's begin with the first question because our our topic tonight is about challenges of being a good Muslim in other way in other words it is it is not easy to be a good Muslims therefore I would like to ask what does it mean by being a good Muslim is it just by um being a good Muslim by praying five times a day is it just by reading the Quran or it is more than that Hussein [Music] [Music] please Hussein the thing that you thought this evening alhamdulillah this still remember yeah alhamdulillah this is what good Muslim is alhamdulillah now coming back to the question to be a good Muslim is very simple normally the challenges is more when you want to become not a good Muslim I see because good Muslim normally will bring peace to himself to the family and to the community the fitra of mankind is is whether you're Muslim or not you're Muslim they love anything that is good that is the F but the problem that we are facing today a lot of Muslim are not setting good example they are not showing good example they not becoming a practicing Muslim so that is why caused a lot of confusion to the not yet Muslim they thought that if this is Islam you lie you cheat and then you do a lot of bad things thing but normally if everyone become a good Muslim maybe there will be some trial and challenges but it's not a big issue Allah remind us do human feel that when they claim I am a believer Allah just accept your claim that you are a Believer no Allah is sure to put all of us in a test we will be tested so what is important the Ayah that was recite by IM today is beautiful so I end this by this the meaning of this Ayah based on our humble experience why the not yet Muslim feel that the Muslim always bring problem to them number one we are not showing good example number two we do not engage with other people when you are Muslim you live in Muslim minority country you don't get involved with the com you have to engage show them how we Muslim respect the elders yeah love the young one respect our neighbor by doing that I don't think anybody who love anything that is good will hate the Muslim but we isolate ourself from them we be just among our community and we become judgmental that's how I personally feel different people may have different experiences been a rward myself for more than 40 or 50 years I understand yeah it's not easy yeah for us to be a practicing Muslim sometime but for the sake of Allah if you are proud to be a Muslim just do what you have to do as a Muslim the rest you leave it to Allah you don't have to worry about what people say about you as long you know that you are trying your best to please Allah and Allah said Allah will not burden you except what you are able to do but just be proud to be Muslim be a practicing Muslim then inshallah Allah protect you and you will be respected by the people who love what is good Z little bit she Hussein when you first become a Muslim what are the main challenges that you face what are the main obstacles that you face especially when you are in this dawah uh in our country and outside our country what are the obstacles when you first become a Muslim I was ready to face my own Community who are not yet Muslim I see I thought that I would have problem from them or you expected to have problem from them yeah but there's a plot twist is it yeah then suddenly I have a different experience I don't have any problem from them because I'm doing something good I become a I'm going do Allah want me to do what the prophet want and I'm proud to be a Muslim I don't hide my identity but then something happened is that I got very bad experience among the traditional Muslim who have doubts about my Islam Allah yeah and then that is the beginning of my challenges Allah not from a not yet Muslim but from traditional Muslim who don't understand the spirit of Islamic brotherhood all believer are like one family but alhamdulillah Allah know best maybe I felt that what Allah have put me through is to prepare myself to face more challenges to come so alhamdulillah I don't have any problem that's why I encourage everyone who want to be a Muslim be proud of yourself don't hide your identity inform your parent inshallah you see you gain back The Respect by you respect yourself as a Muslim and be proud to tell the people I believe in Allah and I'm the follower of prophet Muhammad sallam inshallah ladies gentlemen don't worry we are with she Hussein y do you agree ladies and gentlemen alhamdulillah alhamdulillah when you say you have problem among Muslims we know we understand you know you know you don't know you don't know H all right um Dr Bilal because whenever she Hussein y he mentioned that he he he has obstacles among Muslims themselves so my question is that uh who are the enemy what are the general obstacles when we that we will face whenever want to become a better Muslims because we know outside there other than the kufar there are also those who are maybe Envy towards what we're doing in Daw please Dr bil alhamdulillah I think that when ever we choose the right path yeah because the decision to be a better Muslim or to be the best Muslim that you can this is taking the right path MH your greatest obstacle will be Shan Shan will focus on you and try to cause you to slip turn away from the path for one reason or another make small issues become big and you will find difficulties because the path though it's it's got a lot of uh Sid tracks Prophet Muhammad wasallam decide made a Line in the Sand I'm sure you're all familiar with the Hadith and then uh lines off from either side yeah you know just one line and then all of these other lines and he said there's a Shan at the head of each one of those other tracks you know calling you in encouraging you to come to go down that path so know that if you make that decision and I pray that Allah helps all of us to make the the decision to become the best possible Muslim that we can that we're not going to find everything falling into place everything is perfect you know road is smooth and no opposition it's not like a is it not at all not at all it's going to be a serious challenge because now you have broken away from the general masses who are just doing Islam as a cultural norm you know you're a Muslim because your parents are Muslims your neighbors are Muslims everybody around you is Muslim so you're a Muslim and there's no challenge you know so I would just say be be aware don't be surprised because of course if you're not prepared and you make that decision then all of a sudden you're finding all this opposition all these problems you start say maybe this isn't the right path you know and that's exactly what Shan wants us to think and no no you made a mistake better get back on in line with the community you know everybody else cultural Islam that most Muslims follow get back in line with that that's easy you know so that would be my basic advice a little bit more Dr bil how can we relate because earlier I've cited the Holy Quran how can we relate this Ayah and with our topic about challenges being a good Muslim Dr well the Ayah Allah tells us that we're going to try you we're going to test you I mean Shan being able to create issues for you this is by Allah's permission Allah is allowing Shan to do that and this in the end you know as they say if it doesn't break you it will make you stronger you know so as long as you hang in there eventually you'll win because if you've chosen the right path then Allah ultimately is going to support you but in order for you to be stronger as you go on you know there will be tests Etc to get you stronger build you as you take on bigger and bigger yeah tests because as I said from the beginning the road is not smooth it's going to get rougher and rougher Shan is going to try harder and harder if this doesn't work and that doesn't work they'll try this and this and you know he'll be coming at you so uh this uh Allah has said the verse you mentioned as well as you know that he created human beings difficulty you know so just know that that's part of life if you're sailing smooth something's wrong I see you see something is wrong everything check yourself everything is okay yes fundamentally you've gone off the path because that's the path that Shayan wants you on the one that's smooth and soft and easy I wonder what are the biggest obstacle that you face throughout the years in your dawa Dr bil oh it's lack of water lack of water maybe maybe like a water the I can't see the biggest obstacles each phase in my life I face different obstacles when I first converted to Islam back in the 70s in in Canada I faced obstacles not from my parents my family were very supportive no problems uh alhamdulillah in fact my mother was very happy that I'd become a Muslim before that I was a communist so I was arguing with my father at the dinner table you know regularly he used to be a socialist when he was younger you know and he realized or understood that this wasn't the answer but I was still fiery on that so my mom was happy no more arguments at the dinner table and trying to find Islam what what Islam was there were difficulties there you know there were no there in Canada back in the early 70s just Muslims that made Hijra from Egypt from Bangladesh from Pakistan etc etc nobody who could teach effectively and consistently so one would tell me one thing and another one would tell me something else this one is this one what is this what is this what is this but I knew intrinsically I knew that it was the right path I just needed to find out where I could get that information from so I needed to just stay on it until I got a scholarship to go to Medina so in those days uh now if we try to get to to Medina you know a thousand people applying you know yeah so it's you may wait years in those in that at that time back in the early' 70s no one there was nobody they they had the scholarships available and nobody wanted it it oh they weren't even interested but I was so alhamdulillah myself and abdah Hakim quick who is brother who gave me uh shahada you know we both took the opportunity and went to study in Medina and when we got to Medina more troubles more more troubles I mean Medina that in those days was primitive yeah yeah primitive literally primitive we we went on campus had uh buildings from the time of the Turks you know old buildings you know and um it was tough it was tough adjusting to that you know no sit down toilets sit down oh my God you know the squatting you know that was a challenge and etc etc uh but for each stage I I could go on on and on but for sure at each stage there were trials different trials and alhamdulillah I thank a lot that he allowed me to come to where I am now alhamdulillah and now you are in police mashallah yeah more trials alhamdulillah there was no hot water in the in the hotel no hot water new challenge a little challenge by the end of the day what doesn't kills you make us better make us stronger inim I believe during by the way thank you for the correction um I wonder what is the formula used by the prophets by the sah by the salf in facing their challenges in their Daw in their in the days being a good Muslims please [Music] I don't know this this question is too generic and the tests and trials of Allah have different shapes and forms so you cannot come to a particular uh situation and give a size one fits all we know that the prophet and his companions whatever happened to them they would put it and rely on Allah and this is the first and most important thing never ever to depend and rely on your own strength your own knowledge your own intellect your own ability the moment you do this you lose and this is why whenever the prophets faced a Calamity he would rush into prayer he would rush into Dua on the night of bad he spent the whole night supplicating invoking Allah Asel until his cloak fell off his shoulder and Abu Bakr is calming him down oh prophet of Allah Allah will honor you and fulfill your uh uh Destiny by making you and the Islam Prevail even Abu Bakr is telling him this but the prophet was relentless in seeking all guidance and support from Allah so number one whenever you face a Calamity or a trial put it on Allah in the sense that I have no where to escape no one on earth can solve my problem my Calamity my depression my poverty my illness no one on earth can do this except Allah so number one when you face trials and calamities this what was what the prophet alai and his companions referred to number two they seek guidance through Shar not through their whims and desires like we do and this is the definition of a Muslim a person who submits his will entirely to Allah what does Allah want this is what Allah says Allah says be on the straight path as you were ordered not as you want we tend to formulate and mold our situation according to what we want and The Bu the the the easiest example for all of us men the sisters don't have this problem usually alhamdulillah alhamdulillah but men have this problem is that you have a daily routine does your daily routine revolve around Salat times or does Salat times revolve around your routine I see this is what you have to ask if you find that oh no no I can pray later on oh no no no I can pray home I there still five minutes before I just got a call from Russia the brother is saying to me sheh I prayed a full raak and in the second suud I was making extra Dua when thean of called so is my valid or not why would you delay your prayer until the last moment of it and pray as usual prolonging the first raaka I said no your prayer is invalid why because he did not pray a full unit a full ra before the time expired so this is one of the ways you could tell a my or am I not and their problem goes and Cascades to your financial dealings alhamdulillah we have a salary we have an income but if we want an extra Edge she can I get a house in mortgage I would save a lot and my children would own a house yes it's RI based but they say it's Halal so you start instead of breaking the rules you bend them and you bend it here and you bend it here and you bend it here and at the end of the day you have a religion but it does not relate to Islam it is something that you made up so Islam is to submit your will to Allah once you do this you don't think about obstacles or problems or calamities because Allah will take care of it and Allah knows best Mah alhamdulillah is a great um for us ladies and gentlemen whatever we do must be accordingly to the time of our prayer not our prayer follow our work mallah thank you she she Hussein um I go back to you because aren't you asking me about my reversion oh yeah I think that's interesting okay I'll skip I'm sorry sh I will come back to you sheh she Hussein some people say that why make our life difficult why Allah have to make us facing challenges because since Allah isman why not giving us the easiest way in life as a Muslim rather than facing challenges then we will we will hear the challenges by shim sh Hussein please if you go back if you learn about Islam if you don't learn about Islam of course you may have this issue and you will entertain this kind of feeling why Allah put me through all these challenges and problem when I don't have this problem before I became a Muslim corre I'm referring to a rever first yeah but then when you have the right understanding what Allah said and what the prophet have taught us then you realize that this is not really a problem yeah this is part of the reality of life because why Allah said Allah now make his religion difficult he make it very easy example but because we don't have the right knowledge so the conclusion is knowledge is very important when you don't have the right knowledge everything become difficult so in general when you understand Islam and you just follow as what Allah and the prophet want you to do very easy simple straightforward so that's why I inform a lot of people who want to be a Muslim Islam is a very easy simple religion you believe and you act according to the guidance of the Quran and the Sunnah class you are here to please Allah not to please human but if you're doing anything to please other than Allah you will find it more difficult that's why the prophet start with your intention if your intentions is every test there's a yeah everything that happen to you there is a lot of wisdom that will come as long as you have patient trust in Allah so I believe that life nobody can say I have no problem anyone whether you Muslim not yet Muslim whether you are poor or Rich everybody have their own problem the politician have greater problem than all of us you know the rich one they are rich with also problem like us we have less problem you know because we are normal people so it's normal so don't worry about that the test will come like what the Ayah that you say is just Allah say I will put you through the test so that you ready you'll be tough to face all the challenges if you're not been tested you don't understand what is real life so just have faith in Allah and it's easy maybe in the time the prophet we have the good environment our environment now the new challenges we face is like example the Arab is showing another kind of example that they are abandoning they leaving the dean they're welcoming all the thing that's against the dean and that is really a challenge for us for us we have the guidance you just follow Allah say you ask me for guidance I show you my guidance you just follow simple as that sop is they just follow but we fail to follow because we fail to follow that is where the problem is coming more and more so I would like to remind all the good brothers and sisters please try your level best to do everything for the sake of Allah then you find peace to yourself and the problem may come but the problem always follow out with wisdom remember what Allah remember that usra you don't give up just move forward but must be guided by the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallah alai wasallam this my sharing so when a person say I have no problem they have problem they the most problematic people come back to you shim actually I really love it when you tease me just now so please tease me again all right I have no problem you have no problem okay thank you very muchim I believe in your journey in da your journey as a Muslim you also have your own challenges so please share with us so that we are inspir spired by a story seriously speaking I don't have any problem either because I tend to brush it all off and not give it much thought I see when you think a lot you worry a lot and you have sleepless nights and I used to have this in the beginning but Allah Asel guided me to Simply believe that everything was predestined 50,000 years before Allah created the creation so why worry so alhamd I don't even pay attention to problems or give it some thought I always have content people die in my family may Allah have mercy if they don't die I'm going to die one of us going to die we're all going to die so why care a lot about it provision yes I had downfalls and I have I had Mah Peaks and Allah is the so trust him he will give you don't worry if you keep on worrying about money it's not going to come and your worries are going to make you more and more depressed so seriously I don't recall any of these everything goes with the grace of Allah with a lot of Dua and with being content whatever happens just be content be happy and insh Allah things move on don't worry be happy all right um when you talk about uh how can we be so much positive because we do not overthinking uh we can see those who are watching Tik Tok there are many Jews who become influencers but they become a Muslims because they are impressed for those Palestinians no matter no matter how much challenges that they have even their family members who died they were murdered but yet they at the end of the day they just mentioned so so let us look in the bigger spectrum because when we talk about Palestine they were murdered thousand of people were murdered millions of people were displaced and in such a way Muslims are powerless what can we learn about that when we relate to our topic the challenges as a Muslim sh you've opened a kind of worms yeah you want me to speak about the conflict or you want me to speak about their plight or you want me to speak how to handle calamities or all the above number one what we can learn from their when they face obstacles yeah you have two choices either be patient and tolerant and steadfast or complain and bitching wine excuse my French and yeah keep keep on banging your head on the wall and nothing's going to change when someone Sun dies it's a it's a Calamity isn't it they are one of two either one who will cry tear his clothes bang his head on the world why me why not him why not her why take my child he was young he was this he was that and complain for a whole month after one month what will happen he will CM down business as usual he will go to work he will enjoy life he will even enjoy a capuccino in the in the early morning and nothing he forgot everything his son is not going to come back to life the sin is registered with Allah and he was impatient the other person is saddened and hurt but he says alhamdulillah he puts his trust in Allah and he's content and he says if you have given if you have taken one child you have given me five more or six more if you have taken one child you have given me life so on the spot Allah gives him content and tranquility and the angels register a a house in Jenna called the house of alham and Allah will give him great rewards is his son going to go back to life no the end result is the same but the reward is the difference between the heavens and the Earth so the brothers in Palestine say this a why are you weeping oh I lost 37 members of my family she said so what you are a Walking Dead you are about to die so whatas Allah's decree has taken place you have no other choice but to be patient to be strong to be tolerant and to say alhamdulillah we don't feel sorry for for them wah we feel sorry for ourselves because with all that Allah has given us we are complaining why not this why not that why isn't Allah giving me a raise why isn't Allah giving me money why don't I have six or seven properties I have only two houses and a commercial building that's not fair I have only three cars my friend has a sports car and USV and my neighbor has an airplane and those who have an airplane they say my airplane is a a Jetter G4 another friend of mine he has 747 you will never be satisfied because you'll never show your gratitude to Allah you'll never be content even if Allah gives you everything yet you go to Bangladesh you go to Pakistan you go to the makeshift Villages and you you visit one of them Chanty houses and you enter no electricity no running water tin roof leaks leaking water doesn't shelter you from cold or heat 13 people living in the house and the man hosts you please please she come in you feel ashamed I you come in he says please join us for food and he brings a small plate of Biryani he said three days ago there was a wedding and they gave us the leftover it's clean shh W it's clean 13 individuals will eat this I need six of those those to suffice me what is this said no no Allah will put bar please she please join us and the smile is from here to here with content so how are you brother alhamdulillah Allah has given me everything come on do you have a [Music] gun Allah has given you everything then what has Allah given us so we we don't feel sorry for the people of Gaza yes we're saddened we're thankful and grateful we're not in their shoes but at the same time what will our account be on the day of judgment compared to them and Allah knows bestall alhamdulillah is it clear ladies and gentlemen Dr Bal when we talk about being a good Muslim there's another problem that is how to be persistent how to be because some people yeah maybe after this forum after a talk after any kah they will feel masallah I want to be a good Muslim maybe first day alhamdulillah third day alhamdulillah seven day mashallah after one month they lack of persistency so how to be persistent how to be after we have decided to be a good Muslim Dr I would say that the most important important Habit to develop is to be around people who are themselves firm that their firmness would rub off on us Prophet muhammmad wasallam had told us to choose our friends well because we'll be raised on the day of judgment with our friends so once you found your way or found another way then you try to find other people who are also on that way because together you will be stronger when you're on your own you are easy target an easy target for Shan so choose your friends well that's I think the advice that comes to me most easily and directly from Prophet Muhammad before that all right you break for aan for a while they can turn the this way let all m as spe spe for all we must careful in selecting our friends because who we are defined by the circle around us what about you yourself what do you do what do you practice in being because I believe you are you are in this Daw for more than 60 years how long are you in Daw sh 50 over years 50 over years that's quite some time alhamd mallah so what do you practice in being persistent now what Dr is very true based on a few Hadith of the Prophet number one the prophet said it's very important to select your friend and your environment being a human nobody can say I'm very strong we have a lot of weaknesses but we need to be in a good environment to strengthen ourself number two the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam also give us a lot of other guidance example the prophet Sall Al wasallam said stay together in the right group of people if you want to be close to Allah and follow the Sunnah of the prophet Allah said be among the righteous people the truthful people what is right is what Allah said is right what the prophet say is right is right not opinion not tradition but what or not even majority what Allah said because the truth is from Allah so that is number one so the rest of it of course if we are I I come back to the sharing about knowledge the power of having knowledge if you don't have knowledge the right knowledge of course you get confused and then when you are confused you get into the wrong group of people you encounter more problem but when you have the right knowledge to my humble experience example I know that is part of life life the prophet have gone through more challenges than us yeah we have now been chased away we have never been throw Stone by anybody even when you doing dawa just some lip service people don't like you people say this and say they give you a new logo new brand yeah labeling here and there is common but as long as you know that you are doing what Allah want you to do and what the prophet want you to do you just do it if the prophet have been tested more than us who are we he is a prophet a messenger of Allah that's how I counsel myself so then learn the power of shukur be grateful and be thankful like what shim has said that be contented don't keep on complaining but how can you have that feeling how can you you have that feeling that I'm contented I'll be grateful you only can have that when you revisit without understanding and we have have a lot of problem why why no end and that's why the prophet said when anything happen see Allah the all powerful he do what he wish when it happen just accept anything that you feel that it remind you of something good alhamdulillah you get closer to Allah so always be ready and Allah will help those who help thems so this is the spirit that we want all our brothers and sister to have but to have this Spirit you must have the knowledge the Quran will guide you and the Hadith will strengthen your IM inshallah without that we get more confus so may Allah protect all of us and give us the right knowledge remember pure knowledge is opin not majority not tradition pure knowledge remember before I go toim a little bit more Dr bil because when she Hussein mentioned about there's one thing in Malaysia when we try to be disciplined in the Hadith when we ask whether this Hadith is or maybe or maybe fabricated then some people will tend to label us as wahabi or some of them will label us Asim so on and so forth so how do you overcome this kind of labeling especially way back in Canada how do you face it Dr B well to be honest I really didn't face it in Canada you didn't face it in can I faced it in the UK I see in Canada no problem yeah um I was based I've been based in the Gulf anyway yeah you know some from there I was going often to the UK during the '90s and some of the brothers who were students who used to sit in the circle I would give you know talks yeah for the congregation and they would come to me afterwards and ask me to correct this or show them that and the other and um by the N by the time that the 90s ended I found that those same people who I used to correct for they now became Sheikh and they had removed me from the manhaj they said this gu deviated and all this those you corrected before yeah and who couldn't recite the Quran properly without mistakes and you know all of a sudden they were sh they were ing the Bish of the Saudi and you know marching around Subhan Allah no one no you're one of those that they were writing off the manage so so that's you know my my experience um in terms of Canada I did have trial from the um the media because I had given a lecture in Germany and um the people it was an open air lecture and some people asked about um you know how harsh Saudi Arabia is in in dealing with homosexuals so I defended Saudi Arabia's position as Sharia it's not Saudi Arabia it's the Shar this is what you know Allah has commanded and had Muslims follow and uh if if people commit adultery they're also executed you know which is obviously something they're not executing anybody for adultery in in in this times long time past they might have so that story fled spread like wildfire across Europe so every country I was going to Sweden to Norway to you know Holland and all this they were homosexuals they have a a Lobby yeah where they spread the word he's coming you know you got to do something so and so and so so they would be coming to the airport I'm coming off the plane and they would have a kissing right the men would be kissing men and women kissing women in front of me to to gross me out basically is what their idea was we'll show you you know but Subhan Allah then when I went to Canada homosexuals were after me there too you know I had to defend on television and the newspaper and these kinds of things you know and that um eventually they Banned Me from the UK as a hate preacher Allah you know I wasn't preaching hate I just explaining what Islam said you know I mean I'm not attacking them in that sense I just explaining that this is a issue in Sharia in order to protect the family I mean this is why the the harshness is there is to protect the family whether it's adultery or whether it is homosexuality these are direct attacks on the family which is the basis of the society when the family crumbles the society crumbles after it you know so that's all and uh alhamdulillah after that I focused uh a lot of my efforts in Africa where the um rate of graduates from high school getting into the universities even though Africa has one of the youngest populations in the world but the number the percentage of those who graduate from high school getting into University is less than 6% the world average is like 36% in Africa it is 6% less than 6% and UNESCO said that this is the difference between developed countries and developing countries education that's what it was so my focus you know went into education I left a lot of the traveling and lectures here there and all that and focused on education set up a university I don't know if you've heard of it called the international open University IOU and alhamdulillah it has students now from over 200 countries in the world and thousands of students are registered and studying and that's where I put my energy I've given up on um lecturing in in various countries and that this is one of the first places I've lectured for a long time Subhan Allah alhamdulillah but you know Allah though he may close certain doors here you know there was other doors that I needed to open which were far more beneficial alhamdulillah alhamdulillah as mentioned by she Hussein alhamdulillah last but not least I believe the audience in front of us even those who are watching online most of us we trying very hard to be a good Muslims and nevertheless challenges keep on coming and coming so how can we summarize throughout our discussion today so that by the end of the day J will be our end of place will be our end of mind again what these questions of yours pardon what are these questions of yours this requires like six hours of talking you can't you can't just skim it off you this is a way of life this is a life changing or altering decision yes so you cannot just throw it in okay H this is very difficult number one in order for you to become a good Muslim you have to submit your will to Allah and we covered this and the spoke extensively about this number two also the Sheikh spoke about it to have good companionship without the proper environment you're lost and this is why you have Dr Jackal Mr Hyde personality in the Masid Subhan like the brother said Allah and few weeks later it's exactly the same but you have to be consistent and imagine chapter 18 verse 28i verse 28 Allah addresses the prophet not us he's saying this to Muhammad three commands be patient you your self with those for the sake of Allah who call Allah in the morning in the evening so number one you have to be patient with them stay with them stick with them hang out with them go to play badmington with them this is what you should choose go to your contact list how many do you have 2,000 in my case how many righteous Muslims among them 1,900 99 no no this is baloney no maybe one or two why because this is life they're boring when you sit with them fear Allah you will go to Hell Fire Allah says drink with your right don't drink with your left what is this everything they're telling me is to do this and not to do that so I don't tend to go with them I'd like people to come and share with me the latest uh uh Game of Throne on Netflix season number 10 I don't know so this is what I want so number one number two to Second command do not look elsewhere wanting the adornment and the Glamorous things in dun those practicing Muslims they drive what Patron what's the card called here Patron proton proton proton proton proton Patron is a gas station anyhow yeah you need a gas station to up your car so I need people with BMWs with Teslas with Ferraris with Lamborghinis those I want to accompany not those with Hyundai and and the likes Allah says no stick yourself with them and then the third command do not obey Those whom we made their heart heedless from our remembrance some people I sit with they don't speak about Quran and Sunnah they speak about Ronaldo Kino they speak about football they speak about sports they speak about movies they speak about shares they speak about stocks they speak about property dun and Miss Universe 2024 what time is it aired this is all what they think about no Allah says don't follow or obey Those whom we made our their hearts heedless from our remembrance and they followed not the Quran the Sunnah their whims and desires their Affairs are at loss they don't have blessing in their in Baraka in their time may Allah praise be praised and may Allah bless Dr bil Abu Amina I'm not saying it to his face Allah knows what's in his heart maybe he is worse than us all but but look at the Baraka that Allah put in his life how many books sub this is inshah in his good scale if he's then it would be very bad for him how many those gu were guided through his university how many University branches he managed to open a conferences he attended this is Baraka how much do you have in your life compare Apple to Apple but again this is in Allah's hands I'm not praising him and he's not you mallah his head is not becoming like a balloon and because him him and I we all know ourselves yeah so even if I praise him and I compliment him from today until F it's not going to matter with him because he knows himself more than all of us but I'm talking about becoming a good Muslim it's not about speaking we all speak very well masallah but it's about walking the talk go to my house and ask my wife I will kill you if you ask ask my children ask my subordinates my drivers My Maids my neighbors if you see that I check old boxes and I walk to talk maybe this is a good sign but if I'm with you a good speaker mashallah motivator and then in my own privacy I don't do it and I'm alone on my own and I sin this shows you that there is a deficiency there is something wrong so if you want to become a good Muslim you have to check all the boxes and at the end of the day you're fearful may Allah Asel accept and Allah may not so you're always in the balance you remember last lecture I did three four months ago the balance between fear and hope so you fear Allah every step of the way because you don't know what Allah will end your life with is it on as or is it on music and movies and at the same same time I'm hopeful not to enter Jenna I'm hopeful to be with Muhammad so this is the balance manage to do this and inshallah you will be safe may Allah make me you mash and all of those attending and listening and hearing among those who will be resurrected with the prophet Muhammad Alim Dr B Hussein thank you very much for the knowledge for the inspiration and ladies gentlemen ald yes oh yes please no no problem I would like to grab this opportunity to just add on something that you said earlier yeah when we are trying to follow the authentic Hadith or we ask for Dal from people people are not happy so they may label you many things many thing and the normal thing that they will say in bahas this is what they said that mean if you ask the from the teacher that was teaching you they say you are a student without maners impolite impolite so they ask me what do you think I say I agreed with them from one angle but then I made another comment and I see any teacher using the name Islam and to teach the people about Islam and when they are teaching people about Islam they don't bring Dal just they say anything they like Islam Islam Islam they don't have ad at all Islam don't belong to you don't belong to me it belong to Allah you want to say anything about you must have reference from Allah you want to talk anything about the Sunnah you must have authentic had if not you lying and the prophet warned us whoever dare to lie on me or say something I didn't say he put himself in Hell Fire it's not a small matter so I said I agreed from one angle for you to ask just want to challenge the guru is not good correct but for the guru to teach anything about Islam without Dal so please may Allah protect all of us as seeker of knowledge be sincere in seeking knowledge and always learn the adap you want to ask with adap and if they say oh I'm sorry I don't have the reference today is good be humble yeah we don't remember everything sometime we may forget yeah then you move on so may Allah protect all of us and accept all our Deeds forgive all our mistake and sin all right thank you much once again and ladies gentlemen inshallah we will continue with and inshallah we'll meet again tomorrow will continue our par International Sunnah convention so thank you very muchal"
