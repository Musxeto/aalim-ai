  "transcript": "I was wondering about Anis destroying ancient artifacts and Idols from pre-islamic era why didn't the Muslims destroy it before NIS because the Muslims did not have the means to destroy it first of all second of all we do not take the weird actions of NIS to be a benchmark because most if not all what they do goes against Islam so they don't relate to us and we don't even care to look into what they're doing because there are they they are a terrorist group they are tarnishing the reputation of Islam and the Muslims and as far as I'm concerned there are people who've been paid for by the Western intelligence agencies with the sole purpose of tarnishing the reputation of Islam and giving them an alibi to attack Islamic centers and the Muslims and to stop and prevent and hinder the dawa but this is beside the point when people ask why didn't the Muslims destroy XY Z of artifacts that were based on shik and idols and their likes they could have had had many reasons it doesn't matter to me as a Muslim because I I'm more intelligent than to open the door for shatan and inviting him in to mess up with my head the simple question were there 360 Idols surrounding the Kaaba at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam that the idol worshippers used to worship answer is yes yes was the Kaaba filled with some of these Idols were there Idols everywhere in the Holy Masjid or the sacred Masjid of Al Haram answer is yes did the prophet leave it sallallahu alaih wasallam the answer is no he ordered all of them to be destroyed dismantled and taken out of the Masjid and not to keep a single one why because this is what Islam says so this is The Benchmark that we follow not what XY Z did or did not do now if you think of it logically when you have monuments as big as a mountain made of solid rocks that in today's measurements cannot be dismantled or even blown up with explosives how would the Companions and the righteous predecessors dismantle such monuments and figures of shik doesn't make any sense so either way we follow the Quran and the Sunnah and not try to counter what Islam says through the Quran and Sunnah by what didn't Tom Dick or Harry do this or do that this is not the right way of doing it and Allah Knows Best"
