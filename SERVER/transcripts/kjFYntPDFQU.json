  "title": "Ruling on Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the emirates his father bought uh crypto currency or invested in cryptocurrency what's the ruling in that i i made a um a video clip nine minutes i think a couple of years ago when it first started and the ruling is the same it's ambiguous it is bogus uh three days ago a turkish businessman was indicted i think uh and and the interpol is looking for him for stealing two billion dollars worth of cryptocurrencies and flooding the country so this is ambiguous it's not cash it's not tangible anybody could hack into it anybody could forget the password and lose so much money and the spikes that it goes up can be easily the same when it goes down and it is not backed by any fine trusted financial institution only the rich are make getting richer and the poor will be getting poorer so my uh opinion about it is still the same as the vast majority of scholars of the muslim world that it is haram"
