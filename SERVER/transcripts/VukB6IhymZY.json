  "transcript": "number two it says if any part of the feet is exposed and this is ambiguous so you may not need to correct this if I take off my socks though I'm in a state of purity resulting from wiping so it's door time I wore my socks earlier in the morning in the state of original wudu where I had washed my feet I went to the bathroom couple of times past wind though her time comes I perform wudu and I wipe over my socks valid valid now after a couple of hours it was a little bit hot so while in the state of wudu which I just prayed with I took off my socks for an hour and then it's aser time I put them on can I wipe the answer is no why because now in the second time where I had put them on did I put them on in the state of an original wudu or over in the state of a wudu resulting from wiping no the answer is I wiped for Lord in this case you cannot wipe again you have to wash your feet because you took off your socks and this means that you interrupted the condition which is to put them on in the state of an original voodoo taking them off does not mean that your wudu is invalid it's still intact until you break it but you cannot put the socks again and wipe over them unless you have an original wudu from the beginning from the start"
