  "transcript": "because of time ask last question what if the father [Music] doesn't this is something that is attributed to the Muslim K if the father does not provide for his children he has no right of custody to begin with the custody is for the mother in Islam when they're separated and divorced the custody of the children goes usually to the mother unless she gets remarried if she gets remarried automatically the father takes the custody this is Allah's uh uh religion now if he does not provide and I think this is what the question is about the father does not provide for his children who are living with their mother so as a punishment the mother wants to deprive him from seeing them no this is what we were just saying in the Hadith so don't betray who betrayed you he will be held accountable on the day of judgment for his negligence of his children but you don't have the right to prevent him from his right of seeing his children and Allah Knows Best"
