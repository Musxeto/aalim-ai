  "transcript": "yuuna says in this age of online wallets we are offered cash backs on transactions made is that money Hallel that we are obtained as cashback first of all this concept might be a little bit new for me so I'll just give a general answer and you may ask someone who knows specifically more in this than myself cashback is something that you get from your bank from your credit card or from a third party app application so any cashback that I get from my bank account this is RIBA and we spoke about this before because the money I deposit in my bank account this is not for safekeeping otherwise it would be prohibited for the bank to utilize this wealth and they should put it in a deposit box that is untouchable but this is not the case they usually take whatever deposits they have and they deal with them they lend them to people with interests with RIBA they do things by stocks or whatever and trade on the stock market etc so whatever they give back to me this is actually called RIBA in a credit card it's different because I'm actually borrowing from them so and I'm not going into with their credit cards it's halal or Haram because we've spoken about this before and you find so many links on my youtube channel talking about this but when I buy something worth a thousand euros the credit card company gets a percentage from the seller who sold the item to me so they after accumulating a number of transactions as incentive for me to utilize this because they're benefiting from the seller though I'm paying on time and there is no river in it they give me cash back in this guy's back is Haddad because I have not lent them anything rather I borrowed from them so as if they are giving me a discount of what I've borrowed from then there's no problem in that the third option is to have a third party which is an application so an e wallet or an online wallet usually is an application that they store my username password bank accounts credit cards etc for safekeeping in a secure environment so whenever I need to pay something I use this app and the transaction happens flawlessly hopefully and nothing is wrong the app is benefiting from the sellers from the banks from all parties if I do not pay anything for this app so there's no subscription fees it's totally free and legit and this app is independent from the banks that I have my bank account yet rather they benefit from the credit card or from the shops that I'm buying from then insha'Allah the cash back is considered to be halal as well and Allah knows best"
