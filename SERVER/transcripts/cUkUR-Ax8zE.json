  "transcript": "from a sister she says does a daughter become guest at her uh parental home after marriage my parents called me a guest whenever I go to my parental home islamically does that order hold same right which she had to be to go and be like the same which she had before marriage in her Parental Home the question is what's the difference whether they call you a guest or not and what are the rights they are depriving you of basically there is nothing most likely they honor you more they would not allow you to participate in house shores as before and would ask your other siblings to do the job as you are there only temporarily for few hours or few days maybe a week or two and then you go back to your husband house so they honor you more not that they are depriving you of your rights unless you are insisting on sleeping in your same old bedroom on your bed that you've abandoned for four or five years because you're married with your husband that is not logical it's not logical to ask your sister to Evacuate the room for your sake you're just here for a week or two and you want to change everything as it used to be no this is not fair other than that whatever they're telling you that you're a guest meaning that you're honored and you're not expected to work and clean and cook as you used to before and Allah knows best so don't be too sensitive and spoil things uh accordingly"
