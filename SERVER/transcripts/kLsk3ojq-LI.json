  "title": "Should we take the hadith \"Run away from leper like you'd run from lion\" literally? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh the Hadith says that run away as you would run away from a lion do like do we have to take this apparently for I mean if I see someone who have a disease like contagious disease though do I have to like run in the opposite direction as if I have seen a lion like uh literally this Hadith is as the prophet said run away from the leopard the one who's affected by leprosy as you run from a lion when you meet one and the Hadith is a recommendation to take the means as there are other narrations where the Prophet Allah ate with a diseased person with such an illness and this shows that if a person's trust in Allah reaches the peak that there is no problem in mixing with such people with contagious illnesses however the recommendation is that you stay away because taking the means is better than claiming to have full trust in Allah and then after being affected afflicted by it you start to doubt your trust in Allah and may blame this to that so it is not mandatory but it is highly recommended to stay away from such contagious illnesses and diseases by avoiding it because this is part of taking the means and Allah Knows Best"
