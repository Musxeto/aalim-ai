  "title": "Are Women allowed to work in Islam? Why is everything haram / prohibited in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a working woman can produce a machine or a device in her factory while a practicing productive muslim woman in her home would produce a whole generation from her home working is not at all prohibited for women at all it is totally permissible if the conditions are fulfilled but what is better for a woman to work outside her home leave the kids unattended or taken care by a maid whom we don't know what she does to them or what she teaches them or to be among her children teaching them various sciences and moral acts that would shape and form the way they grow up so we always often hear how can a woman be productive which is deprived of everything you extremists you fundamentalists you shares how can she be productive when she is deprived of everything first of all this is an exaggeration we never say that everything is haram and whatever we say we don't say it from our own whims and desires and this is what i always ask my students or who come asking me for solutions do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires one hundred percent of those who i ask this question say we would like to follow sharia no doubt unanimous answer but when you ask them in that particular problem or situation which you're asking me about are you following sharia or are you following your whims and desires this is when they start to stutter and they stumble and say oh i i don't know why because they know that they're not backed up by sharia they can't provide the evidence in the quran and sunnah that what they're doing is right so the only alternative is that they're following their whims and desires and i'll give you an example we want women to be productive good we want women to enjoy life excellent can we do this through sharia or through our whims and desires we can do this through sharia but sharia doesn't suit you here why because in order for you to be productive in your point of view and to be happy and being paid you have to free mix you have to take off your hijab you have to um you know no if not break some rules bend them you have to travel without a mahram you have to be in seclusion with nan maharam it's a meeting sheikh it's a business here what can i do we have uh uh a retreat every year for three days and we have to go to chen to um goa and yeah we have to go to the beach with with the management here it's my job here what can i do subhanallah so are you following shariah your whims and desires here is where the punchline is he said they can't say and this is the biggest problem muslims have i have many big problems for muslims but one of the biggest problems what is that no this is the biggest problem sumi who cares the biggest problem of muslims is that they are unable to sink between islam and their lives and this is where they come to the fork of the road either i have to go right or left islam says go right others stay well my whims and desires say go left whom to follow this is what defines you as a muslim or not you see islam is a frame so islam is just a frame like this one and your life is a picture which is bigger than the frame a real muslim puts the frame on the picture which is his life and start to cut the edges that does not fit so at the end of the day he has gotten rid of so many things of his life habits hobbies desires relationships interests that do not allow islam to fit on because islam is specified limited now we have the frame fitting 100 your life you're a practicing real true muslim a brook the vast majority of muslims when they put the frame said oops um i can't get rid of these hobbies these habits these desires these sends these is that what to do the frame i have to start breaking it taking edges off it put duct tape put branches here put some wood and nail it so at the end of the day i have a frame that fits my whole life but this frame this crooked frame is not islam it's something new this is why women find it difficult to add here to sharia because it doesn't go with what they want i'd like to be a nuclear scientist okay my daughter that's good but i have to live in america for seven years and work among men and study in different universities and i don't have a father or a brother or a mom to take me there and i have to live alone and i may have to work at night to provide for myself or what do you want me to say this is for the betterment of the muslim society this is haram she doesn't listen she goes why because she doesn't want to follow sharia she wants to follow her whims and desires so if we can cross this problem and solve it to abide by sharia then we have no problem but who wants to follow sharia nowadays you're an athlete and your country says to you we would like you to represent our country in the olympics yeah but i'm a woman no problem you can wear the hijab but everybody's going to look at me no problem just to compete maybe they will tell you you have to compete against an israeli woman there are enemies no problem except for the spirit of sports what is left of islam they have taken everything away from us so no hijab no fear of allah and i'm competing against an enemy of islam who took forcefully from us muslims kicked our muslim brothers and sisters from their homes occupied them terrorized oppress them and i shake hands with them and i compete with them and i have a selfie with them what is left of islam this is why the biggest problem is how to get aligned synchronized between islam and what islam wants from us between islam and what our lives are all about once we manage to do this then we are in good hands"
