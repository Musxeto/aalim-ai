  "transcript": "each one of you is a shepherd and he is responsible for his flock or for his her so each one of us has responsibilities though we do have rights as well but these responsibilities are many that is why when you say what are my responsibilities in life and where would I start this is a difficult question to answer however we know that our prerogative in life is to worship Allah to live this life and and our time to do our time on Earth and then end up in Paradise for eternity this is our objective in life there's no doubt in any muslim's mind maybe they're a little bit diverted from the straight path maybe they're uh misguided a little bit here and there but at the end of the day when they sit with themselves they know that this is their objective to enter Jenna and you cannot enter Paradise without fulfilling the Commandments of Allah and staying away from what he had prohibited upon you but at the same time you have to live your life on Earth so you have to work you have to study you have to get married you have to socialize with others you have relatives you have acquaintances and everything has responsibilities so the best thing that would highlight how how you should live your life is the Hadith of the Prophet Alat when he advised abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and he used to fast all day long not skip a day every single day he used to fast and he used to pray all night long rarely sleep at night so his day and night both are engaged in worshiping Allah full-time so the prophet told himat these beautiful words that if we would to write it in Gold that would not be uh uh something of extravagance because it is something worth worth noting the prophet told himat your lord Allah has rights over you your family that is wife and children have rights over you your guest has rights over you your own body your health has rights over you so give each its due right these responsibilities you have to balance and you have to prioritize so if someone says I'd like to just simply worship Allah in a mosque in a Masjid and do nothing else but pray and make vick and who will feed you who will take care of your children how will you be able to get married all of these qu all these questions need answers so you have to balance you have to work to earn money and you have to worship Allah as he commanded you and you have to socialize with guests and relatives because you can't live alone you're not on an alent on your own and at the same time you have to take care of your health of your medical condition and not simply just throw it all down the drain once you can attain this balance then you would be the happiest person on Earth and you would be fulfilling what Allah has ordered you to do"
