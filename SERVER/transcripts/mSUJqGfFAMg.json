  "transcript": "check some scholars in my country say that when we're making Dua during Salah in we cannot ask Allah for anything related to the Dunya they say you can only ask for things related to the Hereafter and if we ask for anything in the Dunya that will be invalidated so I wanted to know if this is true or not of course this is not true at all and these so-called Scholars are talking without knowledge they are restricting people from begging and asking Allah if I have debts who am I to ask if I have an illness who am I to ask if I have a Calamity who am I to beg in Salat of course Allah so you're telling me that I can only ask for forgiveness and for Jannah in my prayer in my sujood and not to ask Allah azzawajal for anything else this is totally incorrect in its baseless and it is restricting people from calling Allah invoking him supplicating to him and asking him for what they need where nowhere in the Quran or the Sunnah that Allah azzawajal restricted them from asking such a thing and Allah Knows Best"
