  "transcript": "oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] alhamdulillah welcome to lessons in F again we're still studying the book or the chapter that deals with the Nullification of evolution of Al and the Hadith we have before our hands is Hadith of anas IB Malik I believe that brother Fadi or brother Muhammad go ahead narrated anbin Malik the prophet Sall alai wasallam had blood extracted from his body and offered the prayer and did not perform a new ablution okay now this Hadith has been graded as Weak by and nevertheless the meaning is authentic and correct which is that blood coming out of your body due to a wound or due to your own doing this process is called cupping hij is called or known as cupping which is extracting the blood from the back of the neck or from the shoulders or from certain areas in the body and it relieves the body from lots of the poisons in it it is medically known and it is medically proven to help people and the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam did it and he instructed us to do it and he also told us that if the Cure were to be in anything it would be in the slice of the cupping you know the wounding of the person doing the cupping or in uh uh some honey honey is also a very excellent cure or by burning uh uh parts of the flesh with a hot metal and this is also well known yet it is not quite recommendable but it's a form of medication the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam did the cupping of course our sub subject is not cupping but before a person makes cupping ha there are certain days that he should only do the ha in such as the 17th 19th and 21st of every lunar month and there are days he should prevent stay away from he should not have intercourse the night before so many uh uh uh things attached to it our subject is whenever blood comes out either because of a wound or even even if you donate blood as a lot of people do they donate blood then again you don't have to perform Evolution some Scholars say well yes you have and that is why IB ha the compiler of the book mention this Hadith here just to tell you that if you hear someone saying if you have a wound if you bleed then you have to perform ablution don't jump to conclusions and say you are innovating you're doing this you're doing that no he has an Evidence though this evidence is not authentic as in the case of's Hadith where uh uh the prophet said and the Hadith is weak as we uh uh mentioned uh if someone vomits or bleeds through his nose or uh uh uh has a discharge of M then he should do this and that we we mentioned this a couple of programs ago and it's not authentic so we should not uh follow it any questions regarding cupping regarding uh uh performing Evolution after bleeding regarding cing you asked I know it's a little bit off topic but how come someone's not allowed to have sexual intercourse the day before performing coping like if it's so e performing coping the next day it's it's not a matter of not allowed the prophet said that it's not preferable and recommendable apparently it has to do with the Medical Science and I think that they would prove that it would weaken the person's ability to go ahead with the cupping this is something that is found in the book books of jurist prudent and and F so we just mention it as it is but what's the wisdom of it we need a physician a a practitioner that knows what he's doing and he could tell us this and in my country and and and in lots of places worldwide the cupping process is becoming a regular thing now doctors are recommending that you do it from every four to six months and it relieves a lot of the migraine that people has a lot of the reduces the blood pressure the high blood pressure and it it has lots of benefits and we don't need we do not need the medical reports to back this up we have the prophet's Sunnah and instructions to do it so we uh uh do that I think we should move to the following Hadith Hadith number uh 75 narrated muah may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the eye when awake is the the eye when awake is the is the the eye when awake is the string of anus to stop air escaping and if the two eyes sleep the string is untied reported by Ahmed and the tabarani who added whoever sleeps should perform Abol also reported by Abu daud mentioning the above addition without the words the string is untied but both versions are weak and Abbas may Allah be pleased with them narrated in a traceable Hadith that evolution is necessary for one who sleeps while he's lying flat now all these hadiths and versions are weak so we don't have to go into details explaining them though the meaning is correct the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam gives us an example if someone has a pouch where you keep your money your jewelry or what valuables you usually tie it with a leather string so it is tight and nothing can escape so the prophet tells us that the eyes are the leather string to the Anis so whenever your eyes are open the string is tight and nothing nothing can escape not you cannot pass wind without realizing it but the minute a person falls asleep then the string is loose and then things could go out without you feeling it so this Hadith tells us that it is sleeping is one of the things that nullifies wo if you fall in deep Sleep you have to perform W you cannot sleep and wake up and say I guess I did okay nothing went out nothing passed without my knowledge no if you fall in deep Sleep you have to perform W uh again the following Hadith narrated Abbas may may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallah alai wasallam said Satan comes to one of you in prayer and blows air in his bottom so he imagines that he released Air yet he did not so if he gets that feeling he should not leave his prayer unless he hears the sound of the air or smells its OD okay again this Hadith reiterates what we've mentioned earlier on when we started talking about things that nullifies one's Evolution now Satan comes in and he blows in one's bottom while prostrating while performing Salah so that he would feel that something came out while actually nothing came out so the prophet tells us do not abandon your Salat and until you smell something or you hear something as in the previous Hadith we've mentioned a while ago now you have to be careful for the tricks of Satan Allah in the Quran told us not to follow his steps Satan never comes to you directly and tells you commit adultery he never tells you steal a bank he comes to you bit by bit he tells you watch this movie listen to this song look at that lady talk to her approach her heit on her maybe you you you you'd score or something and step by step he tries to pull your leg until you are in the swamp of sin likewise he comes to a human being through two directions he looks at your faith how strong or how weak so if you have a strong faith and you're a big a strong believer and you take things the rough way he comes and obsess you telling you that H I washed my hands three times I should have made it five times yes what the heck I'm a strong person let me do it five times I performed the bution but why not perform it again and three times just to make sure that everything was washed and covered after a while he comes to you and say why perform ation for prayer why not take a full and total bath and he comes on and on and on until a person is obsessed through his strength in taking this Islam and this is not the right way not the uh Islamic way of dealing with yourself this is one part or one segment one form of people the other form are those who are easy goers so he comes to them the guy is performing ation and then says uh did I miss this part nah it's okay I didn't miss it I don't even have to look so how many times do you want to perform Evolution I don't know I I performed Abol a couple of days ago I think I didn't nullify My Wo till now you went to bed you said yeah yeah but it's okay it's it's not you you didn't urinate you didn't pass tool I don't remember I don't recall it's easy it's Allah is forgiving so he comes to the people either through the extremes or either through you know letting thing go by in a very smooth and and easy way and the right thing for us to do is to follow the Sunnah you don't go to extremes this is forbidden because then you'll be extremist and you don't leave things to be so easygoing because then you would not perform the worship as Allah has instructed you to do here we have the same case we have Satan coming to you now you're prostrate you're praying to Allah and he blows in one's bottom just to give him the feeling that something came out and nothing came out it's just a feeling it's just a doubt because of this doubt he confuses your prayer and the guy from the first ra to the very end of prayer he's confused did I pray once did I pray two did I have something did something go out or not then there a there a problem so he confuses you and he destroys your Salah destroys your contemplation destroys your submissiveness before Allah and this is exactly what he wants and this is the role of Shan he has a great role to do trying to distract you from going to paradise and he's very good in doing this my cameraman tells me we have to pause for a short break so stay tuned and we will be right back and welcome back before the break we talked about how Satan approaches us and he looks at how strong all week our commitment and Faith uh are and uh this is the role of Satan to whisper and to distract us from our Target which is Paradise and remember that he's doomed forever in hell so he wants to have as many company as he can get he would like to have as much as possible with him in hell so try not to be one of those inshallah uh uh uh Shan or Satan as we were told by the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam there are different types of of devils or satans there is one that is that his profession and and and he is concentrating on Evolution and this one is called alhan his name the prophet told us his name is alhan his job is to come to you when you're performing evolution and tells you telling you that oops you've missed something or you've added something and he would like you to either go to the extremes of purifying and and washing six 10 11 20 times or that it tells you oh you've already done this it's okay don't wash it that good you don't have to do this there's another Satan that is specialized in prayer and this is called anybody knows kab his name is kinab and he comes only in prayer so if you are praying he comes to you and starts reminding you of things and okay after you finish prayer you have to go to the supermarket don't forget the tomatoes or you'll be beaten do this bring that he keeps on reminding you of things whispering in your ears so that he would distract you from uh uh uh uh your prayer there are certain devils satans that are specialized in markets sus supermarkets so whenever there's bargaining they come in and in markets even in uh stock markets or whatever A lot of people depend on the word of mouth on their trust to others so if someone says W I swear by God that I bought this for only 10 uh uh euros and he bought it for five but he's swearing and lying so that he would convince you to buy it for 11 so Satan is always there telling people to lie telling people to deceit and deceive so that they would gain more and more and more and he would gain customers in hell with him more and more and more yes sir so how do we combat Satan concerning these obsessions and during prayer it's it's very easy the process of combating him comes by relating your heart to Allah depending entirely on Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala on your lord so when you come into prayer you say allahar as if you're holding something and throwing it behind your back I'm throwing the whole world behind my back and I contemplate in what I say so when I say all praise be to Allah alhamdulillah the merciful and you start thinking of the fa the fa Allah the prophet of Allah tells us that Allah says whenever you recite portions of it Allah answers back so when you say alhamd Allah says Allah tells talks to his angels he tells them that my servant is praising me he is describing me as merciful and and kind and so on he is praising me by saying that I own the day of judgment and if Allah owns the day of judgment he owns this world of course the Allah says this is between me and my slave this is between me and my servant because we worship you so this is for me for Allah and we seek your help and support and so this is for my servant and slave and so on if you stand before Allah in prayer and you recall this Hadith when you recite the fa you'll be completely transformed it's a different prayer now all of us most of us when they pray they just want to get this four ra of their chest you just want to throw it allahar what did you do I prayed what did you do benefit nothing I think I guess I'm not going I'm not going to hell that's it is this the only relation between you and your your lord not to go to hell where is love where's compassion where is respect we as Muslims don't worship Allah just because we're afraid of his punishment but but because we love him and we have hope in him and they have to go side by side Fe fear of Allah and having hope and love to Allah if you only worship Allah by fear then you it's like the wings of a bird fear of Allah is One Wing and the Hope in Allah is the other and the head of this bird is the love of Allah so if you don't have love to Allah you're not a Muslim if you don't love Allah you're not a Muslim and you have to think about this not once or twice every time lots of the boys and girls that I know would sit back and say listen I'm a Muslim I worship Allah and I pray I do this not because I love Allah I do this because I don't want to go to hell so let's not talk about love if he is truthful and sincere he's not a Muslim any person that does not love Allah is not a muslim okay what is this Punk saying he's saying something thing that he did not think of because if you sit down and think you will love Allah but he is saying what he hears others say so he repeats it like a parrot everyone loves Allah because look at what you do you fast because you fear Allah but you also fast because you have gratitude when Allah grants you health when Allah grants you wealth when you have four limbs you enjoy when you you have feet to walk on when you consume three or four meals a day and you never feel that you need to do this or that you have every single thing so you feel that you are privileged you feel that Allah has granted you things that others were deprived of you love Allah but you may not have sat down and thought about it once you have this the bird again love is the head no love the bird is dead if love is there but you fear Allah more than you hope then the bird will not fly straight because you will be always afraid and not hoping not wishing Allah to not feeling a trust in Allah that he will forgive your sins and at the same time if you have more hope and wishes then you have fear this will encourage you to make sins and then again your life would not be straight so the best way to have contemplation to have a full-fledged prayer that is accepted to Allah by by Allah and to try to minimize uh uh the effect of Satan is to try hard and to believe in Allah is this possible to have it 100% it's it's very difficult because he runs in our Bloods he's with us all the time so one cannot say listen we have a 100% Satan free prayer you cannot have it 100% but you try if you can't have it 60% 70% then this is good enough with practice inshallah you uh uh will be perfect again there are satans that are experts in sus and markets and there are Satan Devils that their specialty is to apart the husband the spouses and this is why divorce takes place this these satans come to the husband and say your wife did this your wife did that your wife does not respect you your wife does not obey you so why are you keeping her ditch her and take someone else and they come to the wife and say that your W your husband's going to remarry again your husband cheats on you your husband doesn't give you your rights he doesn't spend on you he's poor he's ugly he smells he does this he does that so disputes take place and you have lots of family feuds and fights among uh uh the wife and and the husband and then you have a broken family ties are broken and you have divorce that takes place so you have to be very careful if you do not know your enemy you lose the battle because if you go out of your house without knowing who your enemy is you're going to lose and that is why one of the supplication we are told to do when getting out of the house is very very easy it is very easy the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says that when a Muslim says this supplication two Devils two satans you know take a side and one tells the other listen we we we can't do anything to this man because he did the supplication why because there are two angels whenever he says this supplication the Angels say which means you have enough and you are protected who is protecting him the Angels by the grace of Allah so the Devils sit back and say well I I don't think we have our day today this guy is being protected by the angels and the only way for you to be protected by from the Devil is by getting connected to Allah Asel you have to try your best to recite the Quran to have the supplications of the morning and and of the night a lot of the Muslims don't know these supplications don't know these AAR that makes them connected with Allah throughout the whole day and night and by this by trying to stay in focus by trying to say the supplications Allah will protect you from the Devils from satans and your life would improve now lots of the the problems we have are due to our departing from Islam being distracted from the path of Islam why do we have problems with our our wives why do we have problems with raising our kids those who are married of course not you guys why do we have problems with h our neighbors our subordinates our bosses in in in in work because we are distracted from the path of Islam we're not treating people as Muslims we're supposed to treat all people in a certain and particular Manner and we're not doing this so the minute we're back on the track we're back on the path of Islam what the minute we always remember that we are as Muslims should apply the Quran and Sunnah in every single detail of Our Lives the minute we do this the minute everything clears out and we have a Clear Vision clear prayer everything is accepted and we live the nice and and happy life that we are promised as in the Holy Quran I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh"
