  "title": "Charity to Students club By Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "asks is it allowed to give money to the Muslim Students Club in a mixed college for them to use would that count as a charity first of all we have to understand the role of a student club if the student club is doing something of a social work to the students helping those who are orphaned helping those who are in need giving financial assistance to those who are needy and then this case yes it is charity but if it's a student club like any other student club organizing parties and tours and making events etc then definitely the money would not be considered as a charity and one should utilize the money in better ways in Charlotte"
