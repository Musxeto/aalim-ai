  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to Mercy to Mankind we talked previously about the origin of the tribe of qur and how Mecca started and what was the role of Abraham and Ishmael may Allah uh uh peace and and praise be upon them all had to do with that but she in the previous session you've mentioned that the people there were following the religion of Abraham but what about Christianity and Judaism that's a very good question you have to look at the religious status just before the uh uh commissioning of the Prophet Sall alaihi wasallam or being commissioned or revealed to the religious status in general was as follows the majority were pagans and they were not pagans by birth but after Abraham and isma died all the Arabs at that time were Muslims in the sense that they have surrendered their will to Allah they were following the teachings of Abraham and uh Ishmael and this is the meaning of Islam because all the messengers and prophets of Allah preached Islam which is submission to the will of God submission to the will of God in the sense the notion of Al also is the same thing in Arabic means to uh uh uh go to one side rather than going in straights and this means that they go astray from the Crooked way but their way is the straight path so Islam is the submission to the will of Allah and all the messengers and prophets of Allah preach the message which is monism only worship Allah who is worthy of being worshiped alone without associating anyone or anything else with him so they followed this monism the teachings and the message of Abraham and Ishmael for a long long period of time because they did not go anywhere this is where they were born and this is where they got their religion and this is where they were practicing it until one man left to uh uh travel abroad their boundaries his name is he went to the Sham which is the northern area of the peninsula where you find Palestine Syria Lebanon and Jordan this whole area is called sham and there he saw the idols and he thought that they looked cool so he thought and this is by Satan that by bringing them Idols back to Mecca we can get closer to Allah by worshiping them so he was the first to introduce the idols to Mecca and he was also the first to introduce the idea of letting the camels sheep cows to go without any movement in the sense that they are not to be used in farming the animals are not to be used for carrying them or carrying their cargo and it was called a who he's he was the first to make this so why did he do this he's claiming that these cattle are only for their Idols so no one is to touch or talk or harm or use any of that now the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that because of this he saw him in Hell going around his guts because of the paganism he introduced to those who only worshiped Allah therefore people started to go into paganism they started started associating others with Allah to the extent that they had these Idols in the Kaa they had 360 Idols around the Kaa some of it was made of wood others was made of stones and others were were made of gold and some were made of dates and and and well not in the Kaaba but to the extent people lost their minds to the extent that a an Arab would come and build buil a statue as an idol of dates and worship him the whole day this is the idol is going to get me closer to Allah and and at the end of the day once he felt hungry he would eat it he ate his God and then the following morning he would make himself another God maybe with another flavor strawberry whatever was available at the time the problem is that they believe belied in Allah and in his existence they believe that Allah is the creator they believed that Allah Almighty was also the one who makes people die and they believed that Allah Almighty is the one that gives them their Provisions but Satan came to them through the idea of why why not get closer to Allah you're not pure enough to get closer to Allah so the best way is to have people to intercede for you or to have objects to intercede for you they started by worshiping these Graves started to worshiping uh uh uh Pious people and then ended up by worshiping Stones trees any Idols that they bring thinking that these are the gods that should be worshiped in order to get closer to Allah then there are several kinds of monism monism of that Allah is the creator the sustainer the cherisher and so on and um monism that Allah uh the only and true God that be worshiped alone okay then this is true this is what we call to worship Allah not to associate anyone with him and this is divided into three sections the first section is that people all share pagans and monists that is that it is Allah the almighty that has created the whole universe it is Allah that gives life and and and takes it it is Allah that gives the provisions to all mankind this is the first monism is called and then the other form of mon ism is what we call which means that all Deeds all actions all forms of worship that we do must be directed only to Allah so if I do not do this this is shik if I pray to other than Allah then I my form of worship is going to other than Allah this is sh this is associating others with Allah it's not enough to believe in the first one of course it is not yes as pagans of course and and and this is why the pagans refus the message of the prophet and we will come to this inshallah uh in due course now going back to uh uh uh the the the religions there we had the pagans but we also had the Christians and the Jews yeah but in Mecca there were no Jews at all and believe me there was no Hitler at all so he did not have to do anything with that but there were no Jews in Mecca there were a handful of Christians the majority of the Jews were in Medina and in njan and the Christians were in the Sham area with scattered bits and pieces here or there but the majority of the people were pagans now if you want to look at the political status of the people just before the Revelation and the birth of Muhammad Alat wasam we will find that there were two types of people crowned kings that were appointed by the superpowers at the time the Romans or the bantian and the Persians and there were tribes different number of tribes that had no king no crowned King but they had leaders if we look at qur and quray as mentioned before is the tribe the main tribe that was uh uh controlling and governing Mecca at the time if we look at uh uh uh um qur we would find that they did not have any Kings but they had a number of great rulers ruling them so one great ruler was in charge of feeding and providing water to the pilgrims one other great ruler was taking care of the mosque Al Haram uh the other uh uh third ruler was uh um in charge of trade and securing their trade paths and so on in that uh uh uh uh aspect we find that the people of qur had many good attributes and ethics applied but at the same time you have to realize that the social aspects was not as one would have imagined or wished for for example though they had many good attributes adultery and fornication was widely spread among them to the extent that only few refuse to go and to uh uh be part of fornication and we were told as in the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her that they had different forms of marriages and this shows you the blessing of Allah upon us as Muslims ald one form of marriage is the normal one you go to a man and ask his daughter in marriage he steps it's okay the second form of marriage would be that nine men come or or less and they sleep with this woman and at the end after she is pregnant and she gives birth she looks at them and says that well the father is this man yes and the third form of course this is all adultery huh the third form would be that a husband seeking to have a good and healthy son would look at himself in the mirror and say I'm not the man so he asks his wife to go and sleep with someone who is noble and Rich and and healthy and once she's pregnant he claims that son to be uh uh his and the last and fourth type of marriage was the marriage of prostitution which is not actually marriage but a prostitute once she's pregnant they bring someone to try to identify the child who's his father by his genes or by the way he looks alhamdulillah for the blessing of Islam we have a short break and inshallah we will be right back [Music] m [Music] alaykum and welcome back we talked about the forms of marriages before the break and of course the result of marriage would be having children so we it's also appropriate to know what was the relationship between the Arabs with their children before the birth and revelation of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam they were split into two some of them would love their children to the extent that they would give their lives in return and unfortunately the other part they would bury their children alive whether because of poverty or because of the fear of Shame and this would be mentioned in the Quran in a number of verses where it tells us that the Arab would once having a a child that is a female that would wait until she is six or seven years old and then take her to the desert dig a ditch throw her in it and then bury her alive and by far this is one of the most major and and greatest sin How could a man be a man how can a human be a human doing this there are some reports that did something like this and that he laughed and cried and one of the things that made him cry as the story says that he once Buried one of his uh daughters and while he was you know trying to put the sand over her she used to clean his beard from the sand so whenever he remembered this he cried but this is not an authentic story and we do not accept that Omar with him did anything like this and the proof behind that is that his daughter h h b Omar was the wife of the Prophet Al which meant that she lived to marry which means means again that he did not do anything uh of that sort before we move on I have a question okay here we're supposed to be talking about the biography of the prophet sallam and I think when you study the biography it starts with the birth of that person but here we're talking about the conditions of the Arabian penil before the coming or the birth of prophet Sall Ali wasallam what this has to do with that the answer is very simple you have to study the time and the location before the birth of the Prophet Alam just to understand the situation why he was revealed to them why he was sent to them without understanding the circumstances surrounding his birth without knowing the goods and bads of that situation you would not be able to uh evaluate the importance of him being sent there because all the Arabs all the San Arabs at that time thought that there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel life was so miserable was so difficult to the community as a whole that this chaos this lack of order was unbearable for example it was not just the fornication and the way they treated their family it was also the way they treated their tribes and next of Ken they felt very strong towards their tribes and NEX ofkin they had a very strong relationship to the extent that wars were initiated for the silliest of reasons for example a man slapped another man on the face they had a feud they quarreled a little bit each went back to his family his family came the following morning and they started fighting with the other family they went back to their tribes and the tribes initiated a full scale War simply because a very silly problem and it showed you that this is one of the good things which is to be strongly connected to your your relatives but it was in a bad sense because it meant that you are ready to be an aggressor with your relative though he is the unfair and the unjust uh uh person also having said that we have to know that the Arabs at that time had gambling in their blood which is a very bad thing yes which is forbidden in Islam gambling is a major sin the Arabs that that time also adored intoxicants but having said that they did not have any cocaine heroin crack or whatever they had wine and they loved wine so much to the extent that they used to call the grape tree as being generosity because whenever they drank they felt so generous they gave all the money while they were drunk and they did so many bad things as well but this was the only thing that remained in the memory after waking up and being sober they thought that I've lost everything well this is part of generosity they also H as mentioned before used to kill their children males and females by burying them and they among them was spread uh the get getting women out of their clothings nudity and so on and to our astonishment we know during the pilgrimage season only the people of qur had the right to perform pilgrimage and tawa going around the Kaaba wearing their clothes any other Arabs who came from outside Mecca was forced to uh uh uh uh make n women and men and this was normal to them though it is not normal to us as Muslim where our religion teaches and preaches chesti and so on and again it was very normal to have feuds and to get Wars initiated for any simple reason so if an Arab did not have anything to do he goes to his Tri and say what about visiting our neighbors for the rest of the day and they go and kill and and loot whatever they can at that time all of this was there among the Arabs but this is this was not it they had some good things in them in the sense that not all the Arabs shared all of this being evil without any good ethics and morals on the contrary the Arabs were known and still are they're known to be very generous the Arabs are known to be fulfilling their promises so whatever promises they give and make they usually keep them the Arabs at that time were uh known to be courageous and one would give away his life for any simple reason just to prove that he is not yellow and he's not a coward also the uh Arabs were known to be jealous in the sense that if they're married if they have uh girls daughters they are so jealous on them that they are willing to kill people if they simply say a bad word uh about their um family and they also had pride in them and again this is in the Arab standards before Islam which meant that they would never beg they would rather kill kill than beg and this is pride but it is UN Islamic because killing is a major sin so you might as well beg Which is far lesser sin than to kill but the Arabs at that time the bedwin the the the the the nomads those who were the offsprings of Abraham and Ishmael who lived in Mecca had this pride in them to the extent that they would never ever allow anyone to control them and that is why they were difficult to control now going back to Muhammad's question why are we talking about the environment that preceded the birth of the Prophet alham just to tell you how things were and there were Arabs that thought that there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel because with all these problems with all these uh bad things happening in the society the strong eats the the weak the rich deprives the poor from his right you had a very big gap in the society you had people eating in plates made of silver and and gold while while others could not find something to fill their starving stomachs with so there were Arabs that were looking for a light at the end of the tunnel some of them was Z who used to worship Allah and who used to buy these girls that their fathers wanted to bury them alive he used to go to them before they kill their children and say I'll buy them off for you I'll give you money and take them and raise him on my own he used to despite uh uh or depict uh uh the fact fact that people sacrifice a a sheep an animal to their idols and say Subhan Allah it is Allah who gave us rain and who grew the grass and who gave us this animal to feed from and then you sacrifice sacrifice it to another God this is unacceptable so Z our Prophet told us that he is a nation on his own and that he died on following the religion of Abraham monism also there was uh uh UMB AB Sal who was a poet and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to love hearing his poems because he used to talk about uh uh worshiping Allah alone about the things in the universe that only Allah alone can do it as we were told by one of the companions that was traveling with the prophet Alat wasam the prophet asked him do you know any of the poems that used to say so he said yes and he started saying it to the prophet and the prophet used to love hearing these poems because there were Arabs who had this in them that only Allah is worthy of being worshiped and only Allah is worthy of being uh uh uh presented with sacrifice to him and all of these Idols are not worthy of being woried this is or this was the set that the Arabs were living in with the superpowers the bantian and the Persians were surrounding them no government ruling them all this bad things and morals and ethics and bad behavior the set was ready to receive the prophet s I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah we will meet again [Music] m [Music] [Music]"
