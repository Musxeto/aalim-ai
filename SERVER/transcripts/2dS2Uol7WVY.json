  "transcript": "our first question for tonight is from Huda that is the sister not the channel she says what is the meaning of being good friend in Islam I have many friends but no one very close to me is this wrong first of all a friend is a word that has a very wide definition and the prophet Alam emphasized the role of a companion a friend and he told us that there are good friends and bad friends and the good friends are like those who carry the musk so either you will buy something from them or you will get a gift or at least you'll find a nice scent and those who are bad are like the ones who blow the the who work on the Billows and they work with fire and coal either you would burn your clothes or find a very bad smell out of that and people differ not necessarily each and every one of us would have a companion who would open his heart to and tell them every little and big thing in their lives and this is not even advisable in the Hadith the prophet said that is love the one you love moderately because some who knows one day he he may turn into an enemy and hate your enemies moderately because one day who knows maybe they'll turn into uh someone you love so being moderate with your emotions is quite good this doesn't prevent you from from having a close friend which is defined materialistically into the one you would benefit in this life and in the Hereafter so if you have a friend who needs money you're not a true friend if you don't give him that money and if you have a friend who is ignorant you're not a good friend if you don't teach him and if he does not uh um know that what he's doing is sinful you're not a good friend if you do not prevent him from sins so the definition of friendship is quite wide but the best friend is the one who gets you closer to Allah and the worst friend who entertains you in this life so that you would gain more and more sins and you would be negligent and ignorant of Allah and what draws you closer to him subhana tala is there anything bad in not having a very very close friend no this is normal people differ and maybe you do have close friends but without realizing that and Allah Knows Best"
