  "transcript": "uh what's what's the ruling on taking depth from non-muslim for zaka on jewelry knowing most of his money would be from riba and unlawful dealings and one doesn't even know if it's stolen so do I need to ask and investigate similarly please also State the ruling for taking debt from a Muslim who doesn't offer Salah and his money may be mixed income do I need to investigate first of all it is not permissible to investigate people when you want to borrow money from them you're not getting married to them so what's the point of investigating whether this money is halal or Haram this is none of your business the prophet borrowed from a Jew and we know the income of the Jews and he borrowed it to buy a s of uh barley and he pawned his shield with this Jew and he died with his shield ponded to that Jew so the prophet borrowed without investigating sallallahu alaihi wasallam secondly if you have jewelry you have to sell some of this jewelry to give the zakat and not to borrow because borrowing is not a recommended thing to do in Islam the prophet saidat all sins of a martyr are erased except for the debt all of his sins are forgiven except the debts these are not so no one in his sound mind would borrow to give zakat over jewelry when he has the jewelry sell some of the jewelry and pay off your zakat and your debts and Allah Knows Best"
