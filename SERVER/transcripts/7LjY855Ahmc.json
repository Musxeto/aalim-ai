  "title": "Can I reply to recorded Dua or Adhan Athan? Is there any benefit in it #islam #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she my question is not to go searching for a recorded du but let's say you are watching a video or a lecture and the person in the video makes a Dua would it be beneficial to Sayan to that Dua or is there no point the scholars say that in order for the Dua to be answered your a should be said to a Dua that is being said live so a pre-recorded Dua would not help would not be beneficial likewise when the aan is being called I live in London and I listen on live broadcast on some app to the live aan in Mecca and I repeat although it's not prayer time in London but I repeat behind the aan which is being said live in Mecca and I say the Dua this is valid but in my hometown in London if it's Sunset and my alarm clock announces the aan which was pre-recorded of course or my mobile and I repeat after the pre-recorded aan and I say the Dua this doesn't work it has to be live and I hope this answers your question"
