  "title": "Does rounding up a payment (instead of $4.50 you give $5.00) fall under Riba? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "that's my question you need I don't have any car to make international payments so when I need to make international payment I tell someone else to do it for me and in in return I give him Bangladeshi currency so what happens is like when we convert that into Bangladeshi currency we get a like really odd number for example 8. 800 877.123 or whatever something like this so when I return him I make it a round figure round figure and I give him a little bit more than what I owe him so we leave for under Divine anyway see the the ribba comes if there is no simultaneousness in giving and taking let's assume one dollar is equivalent to 1.2 euros for example if I have one dollar and I go to an individual and say to him I need a euro and I I'm willing to exchange he says I will take two dollars for 1.2 Euros because he sees that I'm in need of his Euro I agree and we exchange simultaneously there's no problem that there is no River because this is a Halal transaction whether I take one Euro whether I pay five dollars for that or one dollar or half a dollar whatever we agree upon so if the transaction has been made and you agreed to pay a particular amount and you decided to round it up from your own self as a gift there is no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
