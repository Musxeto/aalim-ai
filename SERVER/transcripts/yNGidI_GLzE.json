  "transcript": "Miriam says in our country people celebrate an occasion called bismillah Kewanee when a child first starts to recite the Quran all the guests are invited for dinner party and the Maulana comes home who makes the child read the Quran and they make special types of sweet cold blood let do they say that it's just celebrated to encourage kids can we celebrate such parties first of all it's an issue of dispute if you bring this maulana because you want to seek his Baraka his blessing then this is an innovation is prohibited giving or throwing a party because the child finished one zuzu or memorize the Quran etc this is a form of encouragement and it's permissible there's nothing wrong with that but the format that you're describing is more of an innovation rather than cultural so it's not becoming something of an encouragement rather it's becoming a special type of food the ladoo sweets and a procedure where the Maulana comes and he gives blessings and recitation etc and I would highly recommend to avoid this procedure as it is so that we would not fall into the issue of bitter and allah azzawajal knows best this"
