  "title": "Shouldn't Muslim immigrants in west invest in their poor hometowns rather than in west Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that a lot of us immigrants living in the west are investing heavily in the west and he is advising them that you guys come from uh nations and communities that are so poor and so neglected you should invest your money there so he says i don't know if i'm right or wrong well brother youssef i don't know either whether you're right or wrong for example for muslims to invest in countries that have a totalitarian regime an oppressive regime to the muslims in countries where muslims are lynched killed raped and no one speaks about it in countries that muslims are put in concentration camps and forced to take off their hijab to shave their bees to drink intoxicants and eat beards and eat pork in the middle of ramadan so that they won't fast they're prevented from praying on time and they're forced to work in labor camps who in his right mind would invest in such countries let alone try to live there or it should have been the opposite way so i don't blame these immigrants who are investing in the west where it is safe where where there is law they can go to and complain and sue anyone who oppresses them or tries to steal their money and their investments are secured and halal insha allah so this is how i i see it and allah knows best"
