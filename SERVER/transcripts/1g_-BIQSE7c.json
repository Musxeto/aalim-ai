  "transcript": "mean she says someone told me that there is a Hadith that says that we should not make Dua to Allah to grant us saber is it true the answer is no the Hadith is not authentic however is it appropriate to ask Allah for patience for supper the scholars defined that not to be appropriate before a Calamity befalls upon you so at times of ease one should not ask Allah oh Allah grant me patience and tolerance and sober rather he should ask Allah for Allah for the well-being and the prosperity in life and the Hereafter but after a Calamity strikes and when a person is already being tested this is recommended for you to ask Allah for patience and for supper as Allah said in the Quran this is when the Calamity took place and they were about to fight an army so now they want Allah to grant them patience but when you are at ease in in times of prosperity that wouldn't be logical to ask Allah for patience because as if you're asking Allah to already test you and Allah Knows Best"
