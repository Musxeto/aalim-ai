  "title": "If a person consistently miss a prayer, is it considered as abandonment of prayers? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question because that is very important topic uh again so you mentioned abandonment is that's where you can classify somebody who's rejecting to pray the Salah let's say somebody this is common a lot of people miss one Salah consistently let's say it's F let's say it's or whatever it is they miss that one Salah consistently does that fall under abandonment or that no they are major uh they've committed a major sin big time okay and they're in great great danger but they're still labeled as mus worshippers okay so if they miss fer deliberately yes they're committing a major sin but they're still considered to be in the fold of Islam okay yes that's what I want to clarify"
