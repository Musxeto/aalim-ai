  "transcript": "we all know that every woman knows that a husband can be held and can be paradised and likewise a woman can be your nightmare and can also be your fantasy unfortunately we all know our rights yet we seem to neglect our duties and obligations and I've seen a lot and a lot of people who pretend to be practicing and their wives call me by phone and they say oh sh mallah my husband is a nice man and he goes to the Masid he attends circles he travels uh to different cities to attend seminars and he is participating in Daw he hands out leaflets Mah he does this and does that Mah your husband is one of the companions of the Prophet Alam says no this is the bright side and then she goes telling me that list of the bad things he does and then you you you don't know if is this Dr Jackal or Mr height it's a split personality with the people mashallah he's excellent but with his wife he is as bad as he can be and the prophet tells us the best among you is the best to his friends or his family his wife how can you be so humorous and happy and giggly when you're around your friends with the minute you enter the the house Mah welcome to the dark side of the force the guy is is is is is completely transformed why is that what did they do bad for you uh 17 years ago she said something disrespectful what was it I forgot but who cares it was disrespectful this is this is not the dealing of the Prophet at all you have to support your wife a sister just called me just 10 minutes before I came here from Saudi Arabia and she didn't know that it was an international call and as she was talking I was sweating and it took about 20 to 25 minutes phone call she's just like the Energizer Bunny see talking talking talking without nonstop talking crying crying and talking of what of her husband she's saying everything that is bad about him he doesn't spend time with us he's always at work from 9:00 in the morning until 11:00 at night work work work nothing but work he never spends quality time he never takes me out he never sits with me I would like to drink cup of tea and she kept on talking I was envious but then asked her one question is he that bad she said no no he is a very nice person he's very generous he's kindhearted he's he's M she now sympathizing she's he is M he's a poor man as if she's confessing that I'm giving him hell so this is and I told her Subhan Allah couldn't you find any excuse for him who is he working for and I told her that so many women are calling me telling me that their husband does not have a have work and they're supporting him and they're complaining and I have other women calling me telling me that their husbands prevent them from going out of the house to visit the parents except once a month and they live in the same neighborhood the husband say no you don't go out and This Woman's husband is telling her listen go to your parents go to your friend go to your relatives enjoy yourself she says no no I want him and him alone so one of the greatest things that would increase your love to your spouse is to turn a blind eye look at the other direction if you see something that is awful always look at the bright side and she says when eating with the prophet if she eats a piece of meat he would take this meat and look at the traces of her bite and bite from it and if he she drinks from a cup he would go and put his lips where she had put her lips on that cup this is beautiful love it's like we do every day in our houses when our wives gives us they give us the spoon they had eaten with and what is this dirty go wash it bring me something she said I ate from it I know what is this where is the hygiene you crazy you it's all over you this is wrong a real husband a real loving Muslim would enjoy eating with the same spoon would enjoy eating in the same plate would enjoy drinking from the as show of his love to his uh wife and serve himself whenever I go to through this Hadith serve himself I try to remember when was it the last time I went to the kitchen and got a glass of water I can't remember honey a glass of water she's sitting next to me what am I what's wrong with me why don't I go no no what did go and get me this go and get me that go get me this go get me that this is what I do and this is wrong you have to cooperate with your uh uh wife I know a lot of good Brothers masallah they cook and they're excellent cook I've tried their their their cooking mallah I know brothers that wash the dishes once or twice a week try to be the first to apologize it's not a shame it's not um reducing your manhood to apologize when you do a mistake the prophet tells us about the characteristics of the people of Jenna he said among the men the prophets are in Jenna are in Jenna the righteous are in Jenna the martyrs are in Jenna those who uh go and visit their brothers in Allah not their uh siblings their brother in Allah in a different city only for the sake of Allah are in jenah okay what about women the prophet said the women of Jenna are is the one who gives birth to children I me Brothers in the 30s 40s 50s M how many children do you have one why is that line of production is very bad one one of the brothers I met from the the speakers I spoke to him Mah he's my age how many uh uh children do you have [Music] 15 one of the known as must one of the Egyptian guy he is very famous in in Egypt and elsewhere he's a good he has two football teams that's a lot that's good so the prophet says the women of paradise their characteristics uh are one they give birth to a lot of children two they are kind W they are kind to their husbands four they benefit their husband and finally and the fourth one is that whenever her husband does her Injustice who's the aggressor the husband whenever the husband does her in Injustice he she takes his hand and she says by Allah I would not sleep until you forgive me and you pleas he's the aggressor but the prophet tells us that the women of paradise are like this so if she's doing this when she's the one who is oppressed then how would she be when she's pleased and at good terms with her husband and the list goes on but I'm afraid that this is all the time we have I pray to Allah that we benefit from this and we use these points to practice them and Implement them in our lives and not only this but to teach our daughters as well because our daughters are tomorrow's wives so we have to teach our our daughters the rights of their our husbands over them and we have to teach our our children our boys the rights of their wives over them so that when they get married they are already prepared e"
