  "transcript": "you from the u.s says what's the ruling on praying to raqqa's october there is the prayer of repentance at the times of restrictions and we know that the times of restrictions are after fault of fajr till sunrise and after of asar till sunset and about 10 minutes before the adhan of lord so these are the three times where we are restricted and prohibited to offer prayer that are voluntary without any justification or legitimate reason and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion without going into details so that we can make it as short and concise as possible is that any prayer that has a legitimate reason can be prayed at such times of restrictions whether it is funeral prayer whether it is afford i missed and i just remembered after asir whether it is the two raka's of greeting the masjid so i can sit down in the masjid whether it is the eclipse of the sun or the moon or whatever whether it is whether it is prayer of forgetfulness these are not general genetic prayers no these are specific with a reason with a cause hence it is permissible to be offered at times of restriction allah knows best"
