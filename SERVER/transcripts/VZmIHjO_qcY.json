  "title": "Do you get the same barakah for making up for missed days of Ramadan, after Ramadan",
  "transcript": "she says that when a woman has her menus and she misses days of Ramadan if she makes up these days after Ramadan would the time of her fasting be as blessed as Ramadan and would her Dua be multiplied as in Ramadan first of all the Dua is not multiplied in Ramadan the Dua in Ramadan is like the Dua outside of Ramadan but it is blessed because Ramadan itself is blessed by Allah Asel and it's a month where Allah subhah wa ta'ala uh uh accepts the Deeds of a supplication more for the Muslims when they uh supplicate so the blessing in making up these days is not like the original makes the biggest sin that when uh fasting in other months than is good and you are uh feeling remorse for missing these days though you should not feel that bad about it because this is something that Allah has decreed upon the women uh the the the the daughters of Adam so you have no reason to regret alhamdulillah and utilize your time time while you are in the menis as far as pray uh prayer and fasting you're not allowed to do but you're allowed to do everything else in the sky is the limit you can make VI Subhan allaham 100 times it raises your sins even if they are as great and as much as the uh foam of uh the sea and of excuse me there's a fly flying around and apparently it's one of the fans of Asa so do bear with me"
