  "transcript": "um if you are if someone is traveling and he's an an airplane and they don't know what like my sister was traveling and she didn't know like what time F was so she said um the sun was rising in some countries and the sun was not rising in other countries so she said she was really confused and and then she said when the sky turned gray I don't know what that time is she prayed and they were supposed to land um in London at 6:56 so that's past F time so do they are they supposed to repeat that prayer because there's like some doubt in it first of all when a person is anywhere the prayer time is related to his position on Earth not where the country of destination is or the country of origin is if I'm flying it doesn't matter what time fer is anywhere in the world except on the plane I'm in so alhamdulillah while flying I have the windows up I can see in the direction of the East the darkness of the night when the break of dawn appears and I see the white thread horizontally appearing now I know it's fjer this is my fjer regardless of the time or the country the moment I see it this is my fer so if she saw the sky was a bit gray meaning the light has appeared but the sun did not rise and she prayed then her prayer is valid with the grace of Allah asna from India"
