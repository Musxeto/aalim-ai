  "transcript": "roxanna says I have a 22 karat of gold 18 karat of gold with diamonds 21 gold karat silver jewelry with diamonds in it when I asked the jewelers they say 22 18 and 21 carrot of gold cannot be converted into 24 as it is impossible to raise lower karat gold to 24 so I cannot exactly know the value of the value to calculate my zakat I'm confused how do I calculate my zakat on the jewelry I have your question is a little bit strange roxanna because you are not obliged to convert it into 24 you're asked to do your calculation so that you would know how much is the total amount of gold which you possess so that we could tell whether it is a cat able or not so the zakat threshold is 85 grams of gold of 24 karat gold which means that if you have 85 grams of 22 karat of gold this is not ZK table why because it is definitely below 24 karat of gold the two missing are usually copper so the actual 24 karat gold in this amount would be probably 80 3.5 or 84 grams maybe so if you have a lot of gold that is let's assume 22 carat of gold and it is a hundred or 200 grams or more definitely there is a cat in it so how to calculate it take the jewels back again the gold to the jeweler's shop and tell him how much does this cost without the diamonds he will tell you it costs thousand euros for example then you give 2.5 percent of that as the cut in another in another word you can divide it by 40 and the result is for the cut and how to transfer the weight in 22 carat into the weight in 24 carat there are lots of apps on the internet you just are right in Google search for example 100 grams of 22k Gold equals how much in 24k gold and it will give you the calculation they can do this easily without needing to go to the jeweler shop if you wish so there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
