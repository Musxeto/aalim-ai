  "transcript": "If I meet the imam when he is in sujud and before I finish my inaugurating or before I reach the ground the imam has risen from sujud and sat between the tworations if but if I still go into sudjud um if I still go into such on accident will my prayer still be valid I don't understand your question the imam is in the first sujud. Where are you? Yes. Uh I am about to join him. Why did you not join him immediately? Uh no, he he was quite late into the sujud. Okay. So if you did not delay going into sujud rather he was very quick saying Allah abbar and by the time you moved he said Allah abbarbar and sat down your prayer is valid continue and move on but if you were saying no I was doing dua oh I was doing this I was doing that I'm too slow then you have to repeat the raqa"
