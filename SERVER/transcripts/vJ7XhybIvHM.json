  "transcript": "question is when I'm praying with your mom fudge your mother of an Isha and he's reading out loud um and I know that you can listen and you don't need to resend anything if I want to recite Surah Fatiha and masura when would I recite it so the answer would be you cannot recite the Fatiha while the Imam is reciting it so when he says alhamdulillah this is not permissible what is permissible is when he concludes his Fatiha by saying I mean you say I mean and You Begin reciting the Fatiha if he starts to recite the following Surah there's no problem you can also continue to recite your Fatiha quickly conclude it and then listen to it if you don't recite the fact at all according to the most authentic opinion your prayer is totally valid because his recitation in loud is sufficient for himself and for you as well oh yeah"
