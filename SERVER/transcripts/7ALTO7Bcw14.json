  "transcript": "Abdullah had mr. Kady may Allah be pleased with him said that I went to a room when the Prophet was praying at is awesome and I heard to his chest a noise similar to the noise when you have a pot on fire and it's boiling he's crying salah salem he's weeping why would you do such a thing because when you remember a large ocean when you remember the greatness of allah subhanaw taala when you remember that allah has created all this rivers which does not mean anything at the greatness of Allah as Odin and it is nothing compared to the greatness of Allah soprano tile and I as an individual I am nothing at all compared to this huge universe let alone compared to the greatest of illusion when you pray and in the middle of the night and you recollect all that is recall your sins your shortcomings the things they've done to others the things that you have done towards to Allah the Almighty and you feel how small and humiliated you are standing in front of a larger you're praying and asking for forgiveness you cannot help but to cry likewise when you ask Allah for forgiveness when you're prostrating are you making drawn if it comes from the heart it rips your heart out because you know how bad you were and you still are and you don't know how Allah so gel is gonna conclude your life so you keep on praying you keep on feeling the submissiveness and humility to Allah Azza WA JAL and you cannot help but to cry and that is why this is a little bit difficult why because you may try it for a year or two and nothing happens but if it does happen then you are among the fortunate one that is why you're encouraged to try and make it by faking it for few years trying to convince yourself that you crying out of the fear of a large though gel and then Allah may bless you by making it and transforming it into sincere fear of Allah and crying so what's the benefit if I cry and achieve falls from my eye the Prophet said ELISA Ladouceur that there are two eyes would not see hell meaning if my eyes will not see hell then I would not be admitted to hell all together which means that definitely I'll be in paradise when one of them was an eye that remembered allah azza wajal and tears came out of it so fearing allah azza wajal and crying out of this fear is a carte blanche that you will not enter hell and you will go to paradise with the grace of a large surgeon so yes if you can force yourself if you can fake it and pretend that you are doing this out of the fear of Allah it would gradually turn into real and genuine fear of Allah [Music] link"
