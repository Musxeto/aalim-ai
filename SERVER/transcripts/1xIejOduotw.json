  "transcript": "she says i have a confusion you said to a previous caller a couple of weeks ago that he noticed that there are traces of methi or many on his body after completing his russel and he performed prayer and afterwards he found out what to do the issue of repeating the salat is governed by a hadith which confused sadhaka where the prophet said allah whoever oversleeps or forgets a prayer must repeat it once he remembers it there is no expiation for it other than that so sadhaka is thinking hmm why did the shaykh say repeat it the answer is forgetting it is similar to making a mistake that invalidates it so someone who invalidated his salat unintentionally or without knowledge someone for example prayed for after he prayed the hurt he remembered oops i already broke my wudu half an hour ago so i prayed without wudu what do we say to him do we say no problem or do we say repeat your wudu and pray lahar again the answer is pray to her again because this falls under the category of forgetfulness doing something by mistake unlike someone who deliberately skips the until other times come until after time comes and then he said oh i've done a mistake i'm going to make wudu and pray said no no don't pray skipping it deliberately makes it invalid and for you so i hope this answers your question"
