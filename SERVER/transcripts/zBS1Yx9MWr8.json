  "transcript": "and the definition of 10 20 or 30 words saying that these words are not Arabic but Alonso de says in the Quran this is in a clean add a big chunk this is referring to the Quran chapter 16 verse 10 free Allah says badly we have revealed this as an Arabic Quran chapter 12 verse 2 another says and thus we have inspired you with an Arabic Quran chapter 42 verse 7 this means that it's over the discussion is over the full or ad is inanimate okay what about the few words that are of origin of Persian origin of Abyssinian origin or of this or that scholars say that these words are used both in Arabic and in other language so this does not mean it's not Arabic is Arabic but it is also used by other languages so it is the Arabic speech the Kalam of Allah so this indicates that any canal or any other angel or person or prophet does not fall under this so this gives you Tris fictions the program has to be defined as the Arabic speech guard academy of Allah which means that any Arabic speech other than Allah is not considered to be the Quran which he revealed to our prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam booty to be which he really because allah azzawajal speaks and not all of his speech is considered to be haha so true definitely allah azzawajal if we try to write his by using all the trees on this planet and as pence I'm using all the oceans and seas and rivers as ink a las word would not be over why because Amazo Geoff runs they didn't work the whole universe for his work he had not counted but this is represented to me or on it has to be filled to the profit that I sellable set up through his agent should be peace be upon him so if it were to be the words of Allah through another angel did that be possible this you have an example anybody knows an example from this year up with an angel came to the prophet that is awesome hi Holly danger come on successful when he came to the prophet Isaiah salam when he was descending from Heidi and this is a very strange incident Aisha melodies with her as the proper direction officer what was the most hated incident you face from your cry from your people except for the battle over and he said I think down from by after they rejected me and I walked approximately 40 kilometers he walked downward and I did not wake up except in understand it he came down from by it and all of a sudden after two three hours four hours five hours Allah knows he walk because of this stress he had so many times this is something out of so many times we need people and say I meant so and so and I said selemani thing we did not answer me what's wrong it's nothing wrong when you talk to him sooner did not see so many times you driving or you're walking so busy stressed you have so many things on your mind at all of a sudden you find another neighborhood Pamela how did this all happen this happens so the Prophet of Islam they seemed an angel to be peace be upon them and Julian said this is the angel of the mountains he has something to shake you and the angel said o prophet of Allah Allah instructed me to ask you know what he says is this piranha no there is no for Han at all except through debris here but there is no plan to any angel except through Jimmy and speed up on him desert a video open and he alleges that the spirit the truthful spirit as a building to you through the words of a soda which has been preserved in the Messiah so what we have is a foreign someone comes and says there is a pure heart and it is not in the most half we do not accept it this is the Quran that we have and this is the one that was preserved by allies our journey through time and it is the shortest sora that challenges mankind to produce something similar to if it has to be challenging and from this we can take out to eat a good see you know that the Haditha is related to allah azzawajal but the Prophet did not say that it is boron and colors also add to this something else and they say that it is what we can worship a lot with so that is a pussycat we decided in the we cannot and if you do your prayer is invalid this is the holistic definition of the four and if you realize this you would understand that it is the word of Allah get out of it any speech of humans any speech of angels stay out of it the prophets happy and it gives you feel so what was not revealed such as the works of Allah is not considered to be from the Quran and they do to Muhammad Ali saw it ourselves which means that if it was revealed to Moosa go to ISA this does not make it a poor aunt has to be revealed to muhammad arif so Abu Salim and it has to be challenging and what do we challenge the people with with one verse put all of it some scholars say we challenge the people with the whole Quran as but have to leave Italy some say they actually do it with 10 and some say we sort it made me glee with one sure and what is the shortest shoot at the plant how many verses or don't look at the net surfing is that is V versus ok this is also something that makes you a little bit awake and away 3 verses in surah the Delta inna happened that Dakota for solid or become how English at a cover up the three verses since the Quran was revealed a lot challenge between has anybody succeeded in this challenge and they will not thick enough they produced so many trials of solace that was so funny that people just fell down and laugh about frogs whether you make knowledge that you don't make noise or you have of you in the month on the half of you in the water this is what you say even had that the liar who prophesize himself said I'd I'm a profit and when they told him to produce something similar on if this is what we produced after hours of thinking so what's the benefits of study this rain well first of all if you study alone for I you are able to understand the Quran and know the rulings because without the same you would have lots of confusion you will mix things together you know you would not know what what / gated what what came first and what can last you cannot understand if this is general and or specific in the or on so that is why we find another confusion among people who do not study this property they come to one person so for NSA Allah says this and they do not continue you cannot approach the forehand individually you have to look at the whole basis of around if you go to and is such as for way you don't live for me and you saw what this is this woe to those who pray punishment is with those who pray and you stop so in this case cumberland we didn't favor with a few now now you have to continue those who relax and forget to delay their craters not any prayer Allah is going to punish so this is one of the beasts is one of the methods it enables skills or knowledge to possess the tools for interpreting the piranha of course with us they have to be you cannot interpret for another gathering but it helps those who have arabic language resistant you they have to be expert in Arabic language so understanding obscene no but to give you all of see yes you have to be proficient in Arabic language but this is 7 um because Arabic is out of it and scholars have gone through the Quran since 15 centuries and there's nothing more you can add if there are insights I see something that some scholars did not see for example liquid will come to this when the ayah say ok so in general what you were doin a double among to this verse of the Quran in 2 comma in the immaculate error and be over there little piece of him you know they were so weak in Makkah and verse says that the gathering will be defeated and they will run away and give you their backs from are saying disha faces I could not understand this first until i saw it happen in the battle of better when the prophet is a lot of said i took some pebbles and dust and threw it in their faces and same same and when Gemma we're gonna do much and they ran away scattered so you need this understand what the verses of the Quran your thighs after wine but you cannot give your own interpretation without the full knowledge of the language and also it equips the student of knowledge with the necessary tools to be able to and such those would try to cast doubt on the poor Adam give it some people talking about obligation and they tell you how the samurais earlier tell you to do this and then tell you not to do it how does someone tells you and this illogical stated dispersed in the Quran that whenever you want to talk to the Prophet Elisha ram you have to pay hahaha this is suraj no clothes okay when she get damaged area and no complex because they used to overwhelm the prophet is officer they all need to come to the prophet after he finishes I have a question I have a question and the question to the extent that woman and I shall never be sure that said that the Prophet I saw to set up did not pray sitting down until the people overwhelmed him when he was old I will oversee when he died 16 years old so at the end of his time when you were 16 when he used to pray at tap at his house night rarely used to pray sitting down because it was tired I had the work of people over welding in so Alonso little bit in distress and any one of you companions want to talk to prophet as a son first give charity to a foot person and then come the only one who did this I'll even everybody only incident and the visor a big deal something to obligate it that it's not all so that you all can keep some value of cool resource or so and from this we learn that some of the brothers we see in mention after they pay my lip they play the sooner sitting down and he is much too much as empty as a bull what are you doing synthesis winner we noticed that should matter suggest the properties to sit down I saw the break is it not true he prayed night prayer sitting down in his house because of his condition but in you were healthy you have to pray standing up if you insist on bringing sitting down Allah will deduct fifty percent of the award as in the hadith definition of areas that we move on to define wait wait is inspiration is revelation generally speaking but why didn't we talk about the Quran before wife we should have talked about what he first and then the collage because it's part of it well scholars generally when they write in the Sun is irrelevant Quran they start with the blonde because it's more honorable this is the first thing you start with and then you talk about what he has a general thing but logically one should have started with working but because we always go define the Quran and honor it we started with it that is why we always honor the Quran we do not put it in places that are humilated you know a lot of the brothers when they sit in the message and they stretch their legs ken at the end of the legs there is a copy of the Quran this is not recommended it is not happen this is that in my sinful someone says yes provide with the evidence I don't have their list I know in my heart yes we all know it by heart if your mother was in front of you have set your legs if you had four children book your legs next to the funny so the Piranha should be more respected and that's why we started with the Quran what is why what it means to inspire or to communicate in a manner that is not obvious or a parent to anybody else in a swift manner so a suggestion any gesture when I say this is inspiration i'm making some inspiring you not wait so and it's Swift it's fast it's quick this is the gel and acoustic meaning of the way and it has a lover of meaning in Arabic for example what meaning is the natural order and laws of nature and this is using the Quran Allah Allah says and 41 well then he completed and finished their creations as seven heavens and he inspired in each heaven its affair what oh happy could easily what is the meaning inspired here I was giving revelation to the heavens no it means that the nature of the natural order and the laws of nature that govern this the gravity the temperatures everything that deals with natural things these are inspired by a las older but it is not the revelation of the Quran and it also means the natural animal instinct what is the natural atomistic this Jimmy yeah what is it we're talking about shattered ok now talking about this whole nother the definition of 4 i'm right right this hose under definition of what we're talking about the meaning in Arabic of Wadi and the Quran uses the Quran so first we say that is the natural order and then we're talking about the natural animal instinct this is also why T because oh I is revealing to them to do this and not to do that and this is mentioned in surah 16 verse 68 and 69 and your Lord inspired the beam oh how ok ill and Danny what say take as a vacations mountains and in the three and in what mankind bills etc so I aspire to be how does the B know where to make its hind where to go into katie's or into the trees or so on a risotto inspires the pieces then it means also human intuition and emotion Allah says in surah twenty-eighth seventh and we inspire the mother of Moses when they heard that Pharaoh is getting old male voice mail infants that are born in this particular here what did who says want to do she put them in a fatal if you through the cradle and whatever I wouldn't do something like this it was an inspiration of Allah what's it weigh can we come and say okay the mother of Musa is a prophet because allah inspired gave her way no this is intuition this is the emotion that you it's what we call a gut feeling sometimes you make a choice without a new stress you make a choice and becomes the right choice and you say this is I'm smart and this is part of a lot of the professionals when they make presentations I would like to make a forecast of next year and talk about the results of this year I will have a presentation and say to the management that yes I managed to secure the target and six months I instead of one year I managed to reduce the cost I managed to get six or seven more contracts I did this with my team and okay that's what this is on oh my associating with alonso de even have that never pleased with him and his father says that who says had it not been for the duck you know the duck where's the my friend has it had it not been for the duck of my neighbor there the burglar would have come and stole my house a man is talking about while he was asleep a birth of a burglar wanted to break into his house and the tub started quite enough so the burger from the frayed Indiana and the man woke up is Hannah mom had it not been for the tub my house would have been it all broke it into your message whoever says this he has committed because you're not attributing the blessing the benefit to a cost who is allah so you always have to say it is oh the place of a lot of that managed to do this and because of a larger blessed me we succeeded in securing the this is that and because a logical left me with this intuition and this emotion i managed to choose the right thing always that they've got everything good luck warm up accompany me from in allah so just it's all from Allah Oh was it located problem and also signals or gestures to communicate this is also book white allies Allah says he came out unto his people and inspired them by just as a size to glorify Allah raised in the morning and in the afternoon chapter 19 verse 11 who's this second idea so foul hey acepta kvalitet watching you he did not talk to them he just communicated by gestures and also it is why also means the evil whispers from tre hon the evil whispers from chicken if I blew this was denied TK and it says in chapter 6 verse 1 21 and of a certainty The Devil's inspire their cohorts among mankind dispute with you they inspire their allies there aaliyah their service to debate and to dispute with you so when you get evil thoughts this is inspiration don't be happy you got a profit when these inspirations aren't from Japan and so many behalf of them and you cannot leave your mind from these inspirations except go to orientation always go back to the basics for a listener and you will be on that rubber and also means guidance to the angels from Allah and we all know that a large shower gel guides the angels and Allah says in surah 8 verse 12 remember when your Lord inspired the Angels I am with you so he firm those who have believed this was in what location and the battle of items are loved it and finally it is the integration to the Prophet said this is known as the revelation the way we know Allah says in surah 43 verse 51 and these are the types of inspiration from Allah way from a lot to his messengers it is not befitting for any human being that allah should speak to him unless it be my inspiration or from behind a veil or that he sends a messenger to reveal what he wills by his permission so these are the types of ye and we will get the talk about them in detail insha'Allah type so what is the worst that I've just coated and we have three types of ye hear what"
