  "transcript": "mm-hmm hmm alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum in previous programs we talked about how the prophet sallallahu alaihi was happily married to Khadija may Allah be pleased with her and that Allah has given him from her six children two boys who died in their infancy and for girls that those were uh zainab um Fatima and throughout his life the prophet sallam with Khadijah it was a happy quiet life there were no special events that took place or something or things that were abnormal he was leading a happy marriage and he was trading and he was living his own life yet there are things that used to indicate that something's going to happen this man is not like any other man for example we mentioned that earlier that there was this flood rainwater that came and swept parts of the Kaaba and at the time the Kaiba was about a a man's height in in height so they thought it was appropriate to rebuild it again and give it the status it deserves and they were afraid of demolishing it though they had a good cause and they were afraid that something might happen to them until one of their dignitaries came up and said o people why do you demolish why do you want to demolish the Kaaba why do you want to destroy it is it not to rebuild it better again they said yes so he told them then why are you doing anything about it they said we're afraid that the gods would come and take us so he said if I'm doing this for the sake of the Kaaba then the gods would not hurt me and he started destroying it Brick by Brick the minute the people saw this they gathered hand and they started to destroy the Kaaba so that they can rebuild it again the Arabs at the time agreed that they should invest only Halal money money that did not come from a crooked way so they said that they will not take in any money that came from interest from usury they would not accept any prostitution fees so if anyone had slaves and he uh have had them work as prostitute prostitutes they would not accept this money and they would not take anything that was looted or stolen so they gathered a certain amount of money and they built the Kaaba and they've raised their walls until they came to the spot where the black stone would be and the Blackstone was originally White and this Stone Came From Paradise but the sins of man made it transform from white to black the prophet told us that this Stone was as white as milk but it was the sins of man that made it turn into black when the Arabs and the tribes came to the position of the Blackstone Feud took place and they started to quarrel among them who would be the right one or the chosen one to put the black stone in its position everyone wanted to have the honor and they stayed for four days disputing on this issue everyone says I'm the one going to do it every child says we should have the honor to do it we are so and so and so for four continuous days they had this dispute till they almost fought each other and picked up arms to do so until one of them said this cannot go on we are in the Haram we are in the sacred areas of the mosque and we cannot fight like this and leave it as it is without an end so what do you suggest one of them stood up and say and said okay we will let the first one to come from the gates of the Masjid of the mosque to be the judge on this and to their surprise the first one to come was Muhammad IBN Abdullah the prophet of Islam and the minute they saw him they said oh okay he is the man we all agree because he is the trustworthy and the honest he is asada I mean Muhammad so they told him about their problem and it was easy for him he told them bring a piece of cloth and so they did and he asked them to put the black stone in the middle of it and each member of representing the tribes would hold a piece of the cloth and they will all raise it at the same time to share the honor of carrying it and they agreed upon that so they did so and raised it until the position of the black stone but who was the honored one to hold the black stone and put it in the Kaaba it was the prophet and they did not object to that they agreed on them lifting the cloth until the level of the black stone then the prophet saws took it with his own hands and he put it in its place and the dispute was over and alhamdulillah they have accepted this this shows us that the wisdom of the Prophet sallallahu was accepted by all the people of quraish and this also can be considered as indication that is going to have a great position among these people there were series of events that led to this conclusion that he is not like any other man and he was expect accepted and respected for this kind of wisdom from then they've noticed as before that the prophet sallam did not talk a lot and he would not like to talk unless talk was needed so he was not a man that would sit and talk and talk and talk without any benefit no he used to prolong his silence but whenever there was a need for him to speak he would do so and it would be decisive and useful very concise but very precise that's that's up to the point the prophet salallahu later on love to be alone loved to go to a cave nearby Makkah not very far from the Kaaba and sit there days and nights contemplating watching the beautiful creations of Allah azzawajal gazing at the stars and the planets looking around him and thinking and believing that there is only one God that is there is only one creator of all of this he had it in him he knew that it was unfair to associate any with Allah azzawajal he hated what his people used to worship he hated the way his people used to behave he knew this is all this was all wrong but he did not have an alternative he didn't know what to do so he used to go days and nights to that cave the cave of Hera and used to sit there and contemplate until his Provisions his Foods his food ran out then he would go back down to his house sit a day or two with his wife and then go back again to that cave and we need this in our daily lives to a very great extent not to go to caves but we need this isolation every now and then just to revise and audit Our Lives nowadays Muslims that is are engaged in every single thing that does not remain remind them of their lord and of their sins they wake up in the morning we go we get in our cars we go to our work we are in those with our daily work until we're it's over we go back home we either have lunch and sleep or do something that is considered to be useful and then do some shopping take the kids to hospital do our tours visit our friends after Russia go back home and sleep so it's a continuous circle that has no end and very rarely that we sit and contemplate about our sins very rarely that we sit and revise our good deeds and bad ones so that we would know if we are getting closer to Allah or are we getting as far as possible from him had this in him he knew that he had to sit and contemplate and think why am I here why was I created who brought me here where am I headed to without this you would not be able to find the truth and the prophet had no alternative he did not know what to do or whom to worship he knew that there was only one Creator but he failed to know what he wants from him so he used to go to this cave hoping that something might change any kind of prayer no no he was not Abu dhar he used to pray without knowing what he was doing and our Prophet saws contemplation itself is a form of prayer when you start to look at the beautiful creations of Allah and appreciate his wonders and power this itself is a prayer and the prophet saw Allah as he told us six months before his he was revealed to he started seeing dreams and his dreams would come as the break of dawn clear and true so whatever he saw in his dreams the following morning It came it became true and this is part of the prophethood because this is a form of Prophecy seeing your dreams to uh coming and through and this was six months just before he was commissioned prophets just prophets no only even even people normal people can have this a a dream these dreams that come true as the prophet saws said no as a part of prophethood or a prophet it is a chapter or a part of uh prophetude we have a short break so stay tuned hmm if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day I've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people that are Muslims we want to serve Allah Almighty with all our hearts in the show let's talk every week we're going to talk about Islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve Allah we'll have Studio guests we'll have a life studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hudder.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart the show for you assalamu alaikum and welcome back the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam loved to stay in this cave and contemplate look around him and glorify Allah for his wonderful creations but though he knew that his people were worshiping and following false idols he did not have a clear path to tell him what to do and what not to do we talked about his dreams that came through as truthful as the break of dawn Prophet Muhammad peace and the prayers be upon him has no friend to go with him to the this song like many famous people a lot of people know them like them and would like to sit with them as much as possible but the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam everybody liked him yet he only liked to be alone with his Lord with his Allah and this was before being commissioned but he felt that he had a higher purpose in life sitting with people would usually include chatting talking about life about women about money things that may stiffen your heart but the prophet saws knew that he had to spend his time neutralize it in a far greater cause and purpose I think another reason for that is is not to visit later that the prophet sallam had that trained and he used to teach him so and so so that might be a reason for not having friends or not selling with this allegation was said before by some of those claiming to be studying Islam orientals they said that whatever the prophet saws brought was taken from the gospels from the Bibles in one incident they say no when he was 11 years old traveling with Abu Talib to the Sham they made a they met a priest who was called buhaira they had different names Georges or whatever and he told Abu Talib that this man or this boy will be the messenger of uh in years to come and the orientals keep on saying that well there were two carpenters in Mecca who were Jews from najaran from the south of Arabia who used to talk to the prophet sallam and preach him to him and teach him what he later on came and and claimed to be the Quran and all of these allegations are a group of lies and nonsense simply because a child that is 11 years old who met this priest for less than half an hour would he be able to gather and compile all this Perfection that he came with in the Quran definitely not these Carpenters who were from Nigerian and who were Jews they themselves could not speak Arabic and they knew the books which was in Hebrew so how was it possible for them to translate it to Arabic and then the prophet sallam rephrases that into this Perfection of the Holy Quran so all of these allegations or the prophet saws getting this from the Jews and the Christians from the Bible it's nonsense the prophet was illiterated he could not read and write the prophet sallallahu did not bring us something that was in the Bible itself there are so many things that the Bible does not contain yet the prophet salallahu brought us something astonishing and above all the Quran itself corrects so many misleading information in the Bible and telling us that these are contradictions these are a false information that has been altered and changed by the priests so the prophet salallahu was not influenced by anyone and the claim that he loved to stay alone so that no one would influence him is unacceptable because no one can come with the things that the prophet sallallahu came up with this magnificence this this miracle that is until the day of judgment which is the Quran you have people linguists reading it and finding endless Miracles you have geologists you have Physicians you have astronomists you have all types of profession finding prophecies finding scientific facts though it is not a book of science yes but this is the words of Allah these are the words of Allah and whenever something comes to you from Allah it has to be perfect it has to be filled with knowledge that has no end so this is not why he did not take anybody with him it was simple that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam simply love to be alone to contemplate and think of this universe in one night during the month in Ramadan and it was of course Monday the prophet saws as he was sitting in his cave he was approached by the Archangel Gabriel who came to him in uh the human form and angels have different forms they can take any form they wish so he came to him in the form of a man and it was in the middle of the night it's a scary thing because you are sitting there on your own and all of a sudden this man appears in front of you at night he embraced the prophet Allah strongly to him until he could barely breathe then he let him go and he said read and this can be also translated as Proclaim or as recite recite the prophet saws answered in three times as saying which can could mean I'm not going to read I just don't want to read and it also could read what I'm not a learned man I cannot read I'm unable to read and it also could mean what should I read as a question and some Scholars say that this is the sequence because jabriel was telling him recite so in the beginning he said I'm not going to and then he told him recite so he said I am unable to because I cannot read and then he told him recite then the prophet says what should I recite and then the Archangel Gabriel recited the first verses of the Quran to be revealed to our Prophet Allah declaring his prophethood of him being a prophet these verses translate to audible from the Satan Bismillah in the name of Allah the most beneficent the most merciful the Surah starts with Proclaim or recite in the name of your lord and cherisher who created this is the first verse created man out of a mere thought of blood recite and your lord is the most Bountiful he who taught the use of the pen taught man that which he knew not so it's very simple but very concise very strong the prophet salallahu came down from his cave went straight home trembling shivering and asking Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her to put a cloth on him so that he would feel warm and he was so afraid and Khadijah was trying to calm him down she told him what's the matter so the prophet salallahu told her that he was encountered with this man who told him so and so and so and he feels so afraid he was so afraid that he would have and he died because of this of the Mount of fear before going what happened after this Revelation can we know some lessons can we take from this situation especially the saying of Allah the recite the importance of reading seeking knowledge on each Muslim or non-muslim of course Islam especially the first word revealed yes that's a very good note Islam is the religion of knowledge without knowledge you're not a good Muslim and the more you elevate in knowledge the more you're closer to Allah the almighty and that is why verily those who know are not equal to those who do not know so the more knowledge you have the closer to you are to Allah and we would like to point out something which is very critical and important is that knowledge is divided into two knowledge of the Quran and the Sunnah and the Sciences governing them and knowledge that is not such as geography geology physics and so on it's not secular but things that are not related to Islam so the knowledge which is a must and more important than any other knowledge is the knowledge of religion and the Sciences governing it the other forms of knowledge are important if the good intention was present but without good intention they are like anything else so we always direct people especially in this verse where Allah says recite recite what read read what definitely Allah wants us to read the things that get us closer to him the Sciences of the Quran The Sciences of the Sunnah and the Sciences governing the the religions uh as a whole but from what I've said that must be a call for people to concentrate on the religious knowledge ignoring the the other kind of knowledge if people concentrated on religious uh knowledge this would definitely lead them to study other forms of knowledge because in Islam it tells us to exceed ourselves it tells us to learn about the universe we live in about the Earth so that we could prosperous and walk in the different Paths of the of of Earth gaining from its uh uh good things so Islam tells you to pursue other Sciences but it does not tell you to start with it on the account of the Islamic knowledge you have to have the basic Islamic knowledge and afterwards you pursue the rest and I believe that we should stop here and insha Allah we will continue after uh uh uh uh we meet again next time and until then mm-hmm"
