  "title": "Family not dividing inheritance islamically so I wrote letter to let go of my right assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question Amina whatever Allah has given you as part of the inheritance from your father this is your god-given right once you possess it it's up to you whether to keep it and utilize it or to give it away as Charity or to let go of it by Distributing it on whomever you wish from your siblings and from the other heirs the paper that you had written stating to them that you have no interest in it at the moment is not binding because the inheritance is not divided so you did not possess it yet you cannot give something you did not possess therefore you have the right to claim it whenever they are Distributing any of your father's wealth whenever they do so you can claim it because it's your god-given and you can possess it and then give it in means of charity you can also take them to court your siblings have no right in preventing and stopping the distribution of such wealth this is your god-given right and this is the right of all other heirs Allah gave him this money who are you to prevent them so if they say that we're not going to divide it islamically and they don't give a heat or pay heat to doing the right thing you should not respect them as well and you should take them to court and demand your right if they want a peaceful settlement they will come and say okay our father's property is equivalent to so and so your share is so and so will buy your share here you go and then you can do that and document it and it is permissible in halal Allah Knows Best"
