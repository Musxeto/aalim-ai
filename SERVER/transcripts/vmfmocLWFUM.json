  "transcript": "abdul mukhit says how can we be martyrs well this is so generic because real martyrdom can be attained only on the battlefield when we're fighting in a just jihad in a legitimate jihad against the disbelievers if you die you're a martyr so this is the only way of attaining true martyrdom other forms as mentioned in the hadith if someone dies with a disease in his stomach if someone dies with a lung disease like corona and tuberculosis if someone dies with drowning or in a fire or a building collapses or a woman while in labor all of these are also considered to be martyrs but this is not selective you cannot say hmm i think i'm gonna die drowning no this is something that happens it's a calamity you have to be patient if you are you die as a martyr and allah knows best uh"
