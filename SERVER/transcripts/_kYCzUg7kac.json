  "transcript": "Sabina says please advice what is a scar or thicker we need to do after for prayers and please confirm people say to recite ayatul kursi after fault by putting right hand on their head or should we just recite right after the fault please correct my knowledge so Sabina is asking about the eighth car that car is prescribed in the Sunnah and a lot of the books have collected these of car such as the Book of Allah bila sahib of even OPM al karim a type of event a mia the book of at the car of a Noah we and the most contemporary book which is booklet actually in Arabic I think it's widely printed in orange maybe a little bit red so it's a small booklet that is pennies and lots of the people distribute it for free you can find you can get this you can download it and you will find it the first thing that the Prophet used to say after Salam is to say Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah and the seller women Casella t barakatuh yeah the gelati what o'clock and then there is a whole array and a lot of earth car that one can say and perform as for placing the right hand over the head immediately after salat and reciting ayatul kursi this is a claim and I would say why not put it on my heart and recite ayatul kursi and this is more for preserving my heart from with wires from doubts and from other desires other one says no I'd like to put my fingers on my eyes so allowed protect them by ayatul kursi so now each one has his own method so which one should we follow as any Muslim would do we refer back to the Quran and the Sunnah the Prophet said that is all awesome in what mother Aisha narrates may Allah be pleased with her and the hadith is in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere she said that the Prophet said Alice Ostrom whoever innovates whoever creates in our religion in our Deen what is not part of it it is rejected so brother from the subcontinent who always after Salam puts his right hand on his head and say ayatul kursi do you have any authentic hadith I could use and share with you because well I if there is an authentic hadith I'll be the first to be implementing this here and the guy says no but my share said this is Sunnah okay Oscar che show me the hadith in sari Buhari is a Muslim shouldn't I be the wood tourmaline Nessa even imagine what a man Malik Muslim am I met any of the renowned and famous books of hadith the sources the real sources if he fails to present us with not only a hadith but an authentic hadith then you should know that your share has to go and that is not worthy of being learned from because he is teaching you something that is not authentic something that the Prophet did not do that is awesome how dare you do something the Prophet did not do I assume the Companions did not do may Allah be pleased with them the Tiberian did not do so do you have more knowledge and do you have more Eman and you are you more careful to please Allah than them if they did not do it if they did not know anything about it then definitely you are making a serious innovation"
