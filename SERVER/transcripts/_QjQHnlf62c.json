  "title": "Can I give my oath expiation to beggars? What about children or must it be adults? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "told me before that I cannot give k y tocome so can I give this to Beggars even if they are professional Beggars and is it only to be given to adults or can be given to children as well I did not hear your first part of the question you must give your broken oath expiations to Muslims who are poor or needy so you cannot give it to non-muslims regardless whether they're children or adults males or females it doesn't make any difference as long as they fit the criteria of being poor or needy so you have to search for such people that fit such a description giving it to the poor people the profession Beggars is not permissible unless you think most likely and probably they are truly poor or needy but when you see them professionals spending 10 or 20 years of their lives begging making money out of it and taking it as a profession they do not fit this and Allah Knows Best"
