  "transcript": "uh my question is during ifar my family watches TV TV shows with music and other Haram content and I always mute the sound and advise them but they get mad at me and turn it back on if I eat alone they' probably boycott me so what should I do here you have to acknowledge that there is no obedience to anyone in disobeying Allah and being who you are and Advising them with evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah and they reject that they don't want to listen to that however their sin is upon them but when you sit with them this sin is also affecting you negatively therefore you cannot sit with them even if they will boycott you only on or on this meal s but other than that you can sit with them you can talk with them you can socialize with them you can be dutiful and obedient to them however whenever there's a sin you must not sit with them as Allah mentioned inah chapter 4 verse and 40 and Allah Knows Best"
