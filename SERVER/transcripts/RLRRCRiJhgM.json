  "transcript": "so my question is if a person who did a lot of major sins and he turned back to Allah like sincerely once and then he continued repenting and uh he he feels the most effic day and he continues depending can he become a very close slave of Allah and become below to Allah at some point in his life if he do a lot of good deeds hoping that Allah will bring him close to him if if you watch my playlist on YouTube which I did in this blessed Channel about three years ago it was about the beautiful names of Allah and one of Allah's beautiful names is the most forgiving the most merciful the one who accepts those who repent to him Alim and alur the one who forgives so if you acknowledge and know the meaning of Allah's beautiful names and you worship him and you express your remorse and you do good deeds Allah's Gates of repentance are open for you anyone who comes and Allah extends his hand to those who sinned in the evening when they repent in the morning and those who sin in the morning or the daytime when they repent at the nighttime so don't ever feel despair yes you can attain the highest levels of J if you work hard for it and Allah would help you in the process may Allah make all of us steadfast on Islam"
