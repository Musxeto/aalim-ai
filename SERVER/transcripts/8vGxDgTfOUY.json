up no give in even when success seems out of sight the patient on turned to [Music] hehd the word is the plural of and this can be negative and it can be positive as well and sometimes we refer to positive as in or and the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam was described by Allah the almighty in the Quran where Allah says and verily you Muhammad are on an exalted standard of character so Islam promotes good character Islam promotes ethics moral conduct good manners translate it in any means you wish but this is part of the Muslim identity people can recognize Muslims by their Good Conduct by their moral conduct by the ethics and values they carry and have and this is one of the reasons that the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam was sent to humanity the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says I have only been sent to perfect good characteristics I've only been sent to perfect good characteristics which indicates to us that there were good characteristics before the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was sent but he was sent not only of course to perfect the good character istics if we look at it as only ethics good manners moral conduct because he was sent to also guide the people from Darkness to light to guide the people from Idols worshiping into worshiping the only creator of the heavens and the Earth the almighty Allah the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as he said he was sent to perfect the good characteristics and the Arabs at the time when he was sent to them he sallallahu alaih wasallam was sent to a people who had the best characteristics among all the nations at that time the Arabs were known to be the perfect among the other nations in character Abu sufan IB har may Allah be pleased with him when he was a pagan he tells us that he went to do his trading up north in the Sham area and he was called to the court of the leader of the bizantium at the time and when he was brought forward this Emperor asked his companions those who were with him in that Caravan to be behind him and whenever he says something that is not true whenever he says something that is false they should notify the emperor and wave to him that this is not true and the emperor started asking Abu sufyan about about the prophet Alat about those who follow him about those who fight him about his character what is he well known of and whether he is claiming his forefather's drooling position wealth or fame and Abu sufyan may Allah be pleased with him says that had I not feared that the people my people would record against me that I've said a lie I would have lied but I couldn't this means that what prevented him from lying was not his religion because he was a pagan he was an idol worshipper what prevented him from lying was his reputation he was afraid that people would say that Abu sufyan had told a lie and these people were the people that the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam was sent to them to perfect their conduct their character their perfect moral manners the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as stated he was the best example and that is why Allah sent him to us to set the best example for us to follow the prophet Alat was the most generous the most Brave the most caring and loving person you could ever meet he was the most forgiv person one could ever meet and we will explain some of these beautiful characteristics of the Prophet Alat wasam as we go on in these programs the prophet Alat wasam reiterated it so many times and he emphasized on this so many times that our conduct counts at the side of Allah it is not only the number of Ras one performs it is not only the number of days one fasts it's not counted only by the number of money you give to the poor or the number of poor you feed it is not only the length of your beard or the shortness of your th these are all counts these all count but they are not everything they are part of a whole system that Islam promotes and the prophet tells usat about a very important part of this system and that is your good manners your behavior your conduct your ethics the prophet says the Muslim and he's identifying a Muslim the Muslim does not slunder curse speak obscenely or speak rudely look at these four things mentioned here and compare this to what the people are doing nowadays look around you well better more look in the mirror does this fit me am I a person as the prophet alai described that does not slunder curse speak obscenely or speak crudely or or am I completely the opposite if these characteristics fits fit me then inshallah I'm a proper Muslim and inshallah Allah will accept my Deeds but if I'm not then definitely there is something wrong in me and I have to correct it I have to work hard on it the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that these characteristics that we should work on these ethics and moral conduct we should work on them really hard because the fruit would be sitting next to him sallallahu alaihi wasallam in paradise and this is the main objective this is the ultimate objective of a Muslim and that is to be accompanying to accompany the prophet Alat wasam in Paradise the prophet tells us sallallah alaihi Al wasam that the most thing that makes people enter Paradise is their good character is their moral conduct and the more you are at the most exalted level in moral conduct the closer you are to him sallallahu alaihi wasallam on the day of judgment in paradise and that is why he said the closest to sit to me are the best of you in ethics and in moral cont in and when the prophet was once asked about that which will admit most people to Paradise he said the prophet Alam the fear of Allah and a good attitude and a good moral conduct this is the most that makes a person enters Paradise having said that you have to be careful now the prophet Alat when he said that he was referring to a person who was practicing a person who was doing what allaha is instructing him to do to the minimum but if someone comes and says well so and so does not pray and he's not a practicing Muslim but mashallah he has one of the best Good Conduct have ever seen so does this mean he is closer to the prophet Alam in paradise and the answer is no why is that this is inshallah what we will discuss after the break so stay tuned the [Music] patiam and welcome back if a person's conduct was excellent he was kind caring loving generous Brave forgiving but he did not perform or submit the basics in Islam then this would not do him any good if a person does not pray but he has all these beautiful characteristics in him this would not do him any good the prophet alaihi wasallam said the first thing that a person would be judged on the day of judgment would be judged for would be his prayers so if his prayers are valid and they're all approved and accepted then the rest of his deeds would be approved and accepted as well but if his prayer is not valid if if it's not complete if it's rejected then the prophet says Alam other good deeds would be rejected as well so this is a very important issue that we should pay attention to the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam used to supplicate to Allah a lot about this subject purification of the Soul of the heart from all of these bad characteristics Allah the almighty swore in the Quran in the chapter that is named as which translates to the son Allah does not need to swear because he is the creator of the heavens and the Earth and no one would doubt of or question whatever he says the almighty but when Allah the almighty swears this means that it's an extremely important issue to pay attention to and it's only for Allah to swear with whatever he wishes but to us we can only swear by Allah so we cannot swear by the prophet Alam and say by the prophet peace be upon him we could not swear by our honor or by as people do we can not swear by the KA or by anything that is created we can only swear by the Creator the almighty or his attributes other than that it is forbidden it is part of shik to swear by other than Allah the almighty asael Allah the almighty swears by the sun its brightness by the Moon by the day and night by the heavens and the Earth and by the soul itself he swears by all of these things the almighty and then says indeed he succeeds who purifies his own soul he succeeds who purif ifies his own self so Allah is telling us that success can be attained if we purify ourselves if we cleanse our hearts if we perfect our manners and conduct and purifying one's Soul can be achieved by the true belief by the true Creed in once you know and believe in Allah and once you have the proper then this helps you to elevate your moral conduct and your own ethics and after observing the people and looking at them closely we find that these moral conducts these ethics these good manners and attitude can either be a gift from Allah asael that he grants to Muslims and non-muslim alike and we have to be fair we have seen hundreds and thousands and millions of non-muslims who have excellent ethics beautiful characteristics and good moral conduct that is not enforced upon them they are doing it because this is their nature so this is a gift from Allah and they have to work hard to improve it but as it is it's a gift from Allah it's been it's given to Muslims and non-muslims alike and if a person is deprived from this gift the this leads us to the second type and that is the type where a person has to work hard on improving it himself and is this possible yes it is a person can be not generous but he's not stingy so he's not providing he's not giving freely so he would like to be generous he has to work hard he has to convince himself and control himself to give for the sake of Allah a person who is by nature hyper and easily angered there are people that are like this who get really angry easily they have to work on their anger whether to have anger management or to just think it over and try their best to work out a solu ution out of this rage that makes them lose control the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam told him that there are two characteristics in you that Allah loves most you take your time which is a good sign of a person not being hyper doing things and then regretting them after a while and a is is talking to the prophet Alam and said are these characteristics of my own doing or Allah made them in me as a gift from him so the prophet saidham that they were a gift from Allah the almighty so he praised Allah and thanked Allah for something that Allah has created in him that he loves the almighty so if you work on your anger you can find a solution a man came to the prophet Alat and said oh prophet of Allah advise me so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said do not become angry and the man said Okay add me more give me more advice and the prophet said do not become angry do not get angry and he kept repeating it on and on and on this means that it's within your ground has been reach not to become angry and again this is not what the prophet meant because it's you have to get angry otherwise you don't have any emotions what the prophet Alat wasam was referring to was do not do things out of anger that you would regret later on but to be angry is a natural thing you have to become angry if you see your wife or daughter doing something that angers Allah and you are happy with that and nothing affects you you're not a Muslim if you see your son having a relationship and instead of being angry with him because he's sinful you go and tell your friends my son has become a man he has like three or four girlfriends this means that you're are not a proper Muslim Muslim anger is good but the consequences what takes place after you get angry is what Allah will hold you accountable for so if you get angry and kill someone now this is a problem you are sinful if you get angry and abuse attack break steal say things that anger Allah then you are sinful and you have a problem therefore for it is duty to work hard on this it is our duty to try and perfect our moral conduct our ethics our good manners and attitude it is our duty to purify the soul to purify our hearts from hatred enmity from being coward where we should be bra brave from being misery instead of paying for the cause of Allah and being generous with others we have to cleanse and purify our souls and Hearts from Envy you cannot be envious to people and wish that the things they are having would go away appreciate the blessing of Allah upon you you cannot hope grudges against everyone around you you have to try to be forgiving and to pardon people so Allah Asel would pardon you we have a lot to say and talk about this but I'm afraid that this is all the time we have so until we meet next time"
