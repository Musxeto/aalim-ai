  "transcript": "so my question is I know it's Haram to study in a mixed University for women so I study in all female college but there are male teachers and however except some students most of the students don't abide by hijab and based on the times joke with the male and male teacher and the milk is it doesn't lower his gaze during practical classes the female students stand very close to the male teacher but I stand a little bit faster our physical contact and sometimes there is physical contributing between the teacher and students like showing them how to hold something Etc and there are backbiting sometimes so there are so many Haram things and fitness going on in my college in this case is it haram or undesirable for me to study study there as long as you are abiding by the hijab avoiding socializing with the male teachers or having any physical contact with them keeping your distance it's not your responsibility what other sins some other students may fall into with their teachers you take your subjects and do your thing and move out if you can give the other students dawa that would be a plus but again your studies is fine your studies are fine insha Allah as long as you're not doing anything Haram Muhammad"
