  "title": "Lot of scholars use Blessed (mubarak) when talking about Prophet (his Hair Saliva..) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so check my question was like many scholars use this word whenever they refer to any attribute or anything related to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so they use the word Mubarak blessed so they say his blessed beard would soak in his tear when he used to pray or he used his blessed Spirit to cure the eyes of uh Ali radhi Allah in the Battle of khabar so they attached this word blessed so is this appropriate is it allowed do you have any doubt Shahid that the prophet Allah is a blessing all in all yes or no no okay alhamdulillah so there's nothing wrong yes it is not from the Sunnah but we all agree that there is no human being that we can seek Allah's blessing through him physically other than the prophet Islam so His Garment is a blessing we can take it and we can uh seek Allah's blessing from it his hair his sweat his touch how many times he blessed the food he blessed the water in the well until it uh [Music] came abundantly and and sufficed people's needs so he's a blessing wherever he goes in his lifetime and hence there's no problem in using such terminology and Allah Knows Best"
