  "title": "Can children colour living things in colouring books as they're not accountable yet? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling on coloring books can children color living or non-living images as they are not yet accountable the most authentic opinion is that even children they are even if they're not accountable the parents are so if a child wants to drink alcoholic wine or champagne or wants to smoke or wants to listen to music or wants to do something haram though the child is not accountable we as parents are and this leads us to the fact that coloring drawing books is part of drawing it so it is not at all permissible for children to be assisted in doing such a thing they'll grow up loving and liking uh such things and most likely would influence them in the future and hence we must stop them from doing this when the coloring books are related to drawings of animals humans birds living creatures what if it's coloring books of landscape of uh greenery of mountains of whatever farms there is no problem in that insha allah"
