  "transcript": "me um established the masjid of medina this beautiful mosque where the rival tribes of medina who had fought for so long would become brothers and friends would gather in this masjid would solve their problems in peace and harmony instead of solving it with the edge of the sword this masjid in our standards was poorly built and with the way that we're spending money a lot of the muslims would probably feel hesitant to pray in it because it does not fit their standards it wasn't their condition it had no chandeliers that were costing so much so what about the floor safe the floor itself was made of sand and and today yes so there were there were no carpets no rugs the walls did not have any painting on them the main reason for the mosque was to shelter people and to be a place of gathering a place of worship this masjid was the first thing the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did when he came to medina he started by establishing by building this message of his and we have to remember that the threat the warning that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave the muslims he told us in an authentic hadith that if you beautify your copies of the holy quran and decorate your mosques then destruction and doom will befall on you so this is a crystal clear warning from the prophet sallam to avoid these things though the holy quran is the most sacred book a muslim holds to yet it is forbidden for us to decorate it to the extent that the people had reached these days now you find copies of the holy quran that cost in the thousands because they are decorated with gold and they're put in mahogany wooden cases and so on and this takes the quran away from what it was revealed for so so basically saying the purpose of the masjid then is not the same purpose as it's used now definitely it is not from the prey this is the most important thing that the muslims have to look into again now we in our days look at the masjid as a place of only performing the five daily prayers and if you calculate the number of people that perform prayers in that masjid you would find that they do not make 10 or maybe less of the population and just compare fajr prayer on a friday morning with the people who attend the friday prayer at noon time and you'll find that it is almost one percent one to one hundred scale of one to one hundred at the time of the prophet salam the masjid was almost a university because a lot of the companions graduated from that small place abu bakr umar uthman and ali among lots of the companions who enlightened the world with their knowledge and their kindness and with their practice of islam they all graduated from this small building which is the message of the prophet this masjid the prophet tells us and gives us the glide tiding that whoever prays in it will be multiplied in reward so he tells us that one prayer in the message of medina is equivalent to 1 000 prayers elsewhere except so that's the special something for this move it is for this particular mosque of course with the exception of the masjid of mecca messenger because one prayer in the message of haram is equivalent to a hundred thousand prayers elsewhere and what about masjid al-aqsa al-aqsa is 500 prayers more now going back to the masjid itself it was also a place for the poor to reside in and there was a certain portion of the masjid where the extremely poor people who had no wealth nor property and they did not have anywhere to stay in used to stay in in the masjid so how big was the masjid if it had two compartments for both his wives it housed some poor people plus they worshipped in there how big was it at the very beginning it wasn't very big and we have to know that the message was expanded so many times but some of the scholars calculated it to be 100 foot wide or long so 100 foot is is nothing compared to the standards of nowadays but again you have to look at the quality not the quantity look at the essence and the value of the masjid not at the size of this masjid the prophet alaihis did not have a way to call people to prayer so the companions once had to talk it over some of them said let's take the bell that the christians use in the churches and the prophet did not like this allah and by the way this is a footnote it is forbidden for muslims to use the bell that the christians do not even in the form of calling the bell boy in a hotel or to call the waiter if you are in a restaurant the prophet tells us whenever you travel the angels do not accompany a caravan a convoy if they are having a bell and this is realized when you know that a lot of the people that travel with camels and horses put bells in their necks so whenever they go it rings now so you can know whatever the prophet lost no not actually just for for for the sound of the bell so the prophet tells us that the angels do not accompany a caravan that has this bell now this is different than the bell of your mobile it's different than the bell of the house when you someone but someone brings the bell because it's not like the bell that has a simulates the bell of a church some of the companions said let's use a horn like the jews do and the prophet even did not like this because he did not like to imitate the non muslims he wanted something of his own and if you notice that most of the islamic teachings we try to differ than other denominations because islam has its own spirit some of them said okay what about raising the flag but this did not wake up the sleep and could not notify those who were not looking so the prophet did not like this allah and every companion went back to where they came from a while later abdullahi zaid who was one of the companions of the prophet saw in his dream that he was going to the market to buy a bell so one man came to him and said what do you want to do so he said i want to buy a bell to notify people of prayer time so he told him i'll tell you something that is much better than that you say allahu akbar allahu akbar in allah he taught him the lyrics the words of the evan so abdullah zaid woke up and went to the prophet and he told him that i saw in my dream a man coming to me and saying so and so and so and the prophet salallahu like that and he knew that it was from allah so he told him go and teach this to bilal now why did i choose him okay that's a good question why do you think he chose him i don't know okay i don't know that makes three of us no actually he chose because his voice was much softer and tender and that is why he told him clearly go and teach it to bilal because he has a nicer voice abdullah objected in the very beginning because it was an honor to call people to prayer so he said i saw the the dream so it should be mine so the prophet told him that teach it to bilal he is he has a softer voice and much nicer voice which tells us and indicates to us that whoever calls for the adhan should have a very nice voice you're calling the people to prayer so you don't want to frighten them you don't want to bring someone that does not have a good voice or cannot perform the adhan in a very nice way that gives you tranquility and peace this is the way it should be and immediately after this came ramer mulhatta the second khalifa the second caliph may allah be pleased with him and he told the prophet sallam by allah it is the same dream i saw so now it coincides coincided with abdullah jonze's dream and and this is the actual event that we have uh at the moment i'm afraid that we have a short break so stay tuned insha allah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hoodah.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you and welcome back now everything was established the masjid was there the people are being called to prayer five times a day and there's one point that it's worth mentioning is that the prophet when he was ordered and instructed to pray by allah azza on the seventh heaven he was given the order to pray how many prayers at the beginning was 15 it was 50 50 prayers and by the grace of allah subhanahu ta'ala it was the discount was there until it reached the present five daily prayers and yet people still fool around with these five prayers they pray four times three times some may not pray at all which indicates that there are people that allah would like would that allah would guide and there are people that allah would send astray so let's pray to allah that we are among those who are guided at the very beginning the prayer was commanded and was revealed to the prophet salaam in twos so although her prayer was two asa prayer was two fajr and asia were also two and the maghrib when the prophet went to medina and he established the masjid and the adhan was also established the prayers increased so now noon prayer afternoon prayer and evening prayer night prayer where made four racquets why why the reason why these particular prayers were increased there are so many things that we do not have the justification for isha may allah please with her tells tells us that when the prophet came into medina allah increased the prayer of the residing people into four and it remained as it is for those who were traveling now there are so many things in islam where allah examines and tests our belief so if someone says okay why margaret prayer sunset prayer is three rakaas while fajr is two why not have them all in even numbers or in odd numbers again the answer would be this is how allah wants it to be and that is why throughout the quran you will read that allah tells us that the believers are those who believe in the unseen so we take whatever comes to us for granted and we follow and comply as it is without trying to look for justifications of course sometimes it is acceptable and it adds value for example someone says intoxicants are forbidden in islam why the answer is pretty obvious because it harms you it makes you do things that you don't want to do and you do a lot of things that you regret afterwards besides the health problems uh the liver and so on that are resulting of intoxicants wasting the money and so on okay but so there is a lot of things we're not allowed to ask about it well no no it's not that you are allowed to ask about anything but you should not put it as a criteria that i will not believe i will not comply unless i understand because again this is the difference between muslims and non-muslims we believe that there's allah and we believe that in the existence of angels of devils of things that we cannot see we believe in paradise we believe in hell yet we do not see these things we believe in them when allah tells us that you have to perform five daily prayers why not ten one at three when allah tells us you have to go and perform umrah you have to go around the kaaba seven times you have to go between safa and marwah seven times one says one at eight one at five these are things that you have to believe in them as you believe in lots of the rules and regulations of your government so there is an element of blind following yes but in 90 maybe more there's always a logical justification that you will buy and understand the problem is with the remaining five percent or ten percent that your capability of understanding may not qualify you to understand and this is a window of opportunity for satan to come through and would say ah now this you do not understand so you reject and unfortunately this is why lots of the non-muslims do not embrace and revert islam because of now if you try to compare apple to apple you have no problem if you compare islam to other religions you have no problem that's whatsoever if you apply the same rule of thumb to each and every religion you will always find that islam prevails because you will find that 99 percent of islam goes with your logic and goes with nature it is fair it is just it is logical but if satan wants you to be prejudiced and arrogant he would say no this thing i do not understand this thing i do not believe this thing is not logical okay use the same criteria your process of of analyzing to your own religion you would find that it is far greater mistakes and errors and things that you cannot understand than in islam so this window of opportunity we would like always to minimize in the sense that it's not blindfolded but accept islam because you accepted the foundations the main principles of islam the existence of one lord of this universe allah who has no father who has no son and who has no wife he has no beginning and he has no end you believe in this you believe in what comes afterwards that he would not leave us astray so he would send us a message a messenger with a manual with a book that tells us how to run our lives and he tells us in crystal clear words where we came from and what should we do and he tells us where we're headed to and what is the reward and what is the punishment and if you analyze the whole situation you'll find out that islam is the religion that goes side by side with your logic unfortunately it is the arrogance in every one of us that makes us reject some parts of it and because something i did not understand satan comes and says well the whole thing you should reject you should reject the whole thing why well i cannot understand why it's not lawful for us to fornicate to have girlfriends i love women so i cannot understand why therefore i'm not going to accept islam if you're fair if you're logical you would say no this is a defect in me but all in all yes i don't like people fornicating with my wife with my sister with my daughters and so on so therefore touche i have this defect in me i i confess but the religion as it is it's perfect it's crystal clear i accept it and i pray to allah that he fix this defect in me so the islam came to save the limit between each other between the people to save the limit between the between the people there are no limits among people because they're all equal and islam came to promote the equality of all humans there is no difference between a black and white an arab or a non-arab and this was manifested by the prophet sallam's teaching and by his companions and going back to the issue of prayer the prophet alaihis salat was instructed us to make the two raka's into four as ayesha said and to these prayers would remain two raka's when you are traveling so now everything was set and people are praying five times a day before the prophet alaihis when he was in mecca the muslims did not have the upper hand the muslims did not have a community of their own they were not allowed to gather in one place without being harassed or oppressed the muslims used to see their brothers being tortured simply just because they believe in one lord of this universe they believe in allah the almighty and they could not do a thing the muslims stayed for 13 years in mecca they could not raise a hand they could not take a sword they were instructed and ordered by allah not to fight imagine for 13 years being unable to defend yourself being unable to protect your brothers though you have the power to do so yet allah tells you do not uh go to the uh on the offensive part just stay as you are call people to islam practice your own religion but do not do anything that would cause more harm to your cause and this is a very important thing in a lot of the countries you have muslim communities and satan comes to them and say you're a people of power overthrow the government make chaos make a attacks here and there so that islam would prevail and this is on islamic islam does not promote violence and in so many places we've seen these movements here and there carrying the name of islam being oppressed and they demolish they go and all what they've worked for these long years is gone because of the wrongdoing of a handful of youth thinking that they can take matters into their own hands i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time um hmm mm-hmm"
