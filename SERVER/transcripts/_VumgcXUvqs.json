  "transcript": "children eloheem al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik ala aalihi wa wa suleman nabina muhammad in cuadrado sahib you mean I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still discussing the chapter that deals with Adan and hadeeth number 64 we would like someone to volunteer and read it yes brother narrated a Bijou Haifa Bob evening up the LA also ie the Delano I came to the Messenger of Allah and he was in the red leather tent and bilal radhi'allahu stepped out with ablution water for him what was left of that water some of them got it whereas others could not get it and those who got it rub themselves with it then the messenger of allah sallallahu sallam stepped out wearing a radish mantle and I was getting a glimpse of the whiteness of his shanks he prophet salallahu salam performed the ablution and bilal pronounced the azan and i followed his mouth as he turned this side and that as he said turning to the right and left come to prayer come to success a spear was then fixed for him on the ground he stepped forward and said 2 rakaats of zohar he continued performing 2 rakaats till he came back to al-madinah where well this hadith has a number of points and lessons that can be learned from it among them is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he performed woudl what did the Companions do used to fight for the remainder water of rasulallah Valley who says yes this is what they have done they started to fight not in the actual sense of swords but each one wanted to take a glimpse of it why to wash their faces to watch their bodies with it and this can only be with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam meaning seeking the blessings of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam because he is the mercy to all mankind and not only that we know that he is pure blessing from allah azza wajal so you may not seek the blessing of allah through any living creature except through the Prophet Allah so Salam his clothes his voodoo his evolution his hair all of these even his sweat was considered to be a Baraka a blessing that you can get and attain and this is part of our religion however after his death sallallahu alehiwassallaam this all has top so I cannot fool you and say this was preserved 15 centuries ago the Prophet drank from it so if you drink from it it will give you healing it will give you Baraka it will and you end up finding people claiming in museums and in messages that we have hair of the Prophet Paris for some we have his sword we have his cloak we have his shoes and all of this is baseless you cannot verify this furthermore the Prophet came out wearing a red sort of mantle a red cloak but we know that wearing red in Islam for men is completely prohibited so how is this combined the scholars say wearing pure red is prohibited something that is 100 percent red but if it's red with white lines black lines different spottings so that it would not make it 100 percent red it is permissible and this was reported that the Prophet used to wear such a cloak at a hiss alot of Salaam that had lines of white though it was red and scholars said that this is permissible and this is what jhil islamic milk i am may Allah have mercy on us all in his great book that al Mahad daddle Mahad is one of the greatest compiled on such topics every Muslim home should have a copy of it and I believe it's translated into English it's a great book that has immense amount of knowledge in a very delicate and very easy way so if you read it probably take you about 4 to 6 months but I assure you after reading it you will find that your knowledge has increased tremendously and it's in a very nice way of showing you the Sunnah of the Prophet s lamp in a number of different aspects then about your - says that the Prophet is of Salaam after performing voodoo he instructed Bilal to make the event and this is why we got this hadith how did Bilal offer the event about you - says I used to follow his mouth when he moved right and left calling for Hollis rahdert hi Jana fella and colors take that this is part of the Sunnah when giving the Adhan if you are in the open if you are in the open area outdoors part of the Sunnah plan to put your fingers in your ears why if I put my fingers in my ears I would not hear myself therefore I would extremely shout it out however scholars say that these two Sunnis because Bilal had done them in the presence of the Prophet Isis Aram so they considered them to be a Sunnah because the Prophet approved it is awesome however scholars say what is the reason behind putting the fingers in the ears when calling for the Iran and turning right and left when saying hi Alice Oh Lottie Heil fella they all agree that the reason is to increase the voice to make it louder and to have the outreach more because if I'm calling the event to this area in the open it would only read a certain spectrum but if I move 90 degrees in 90 degrees the area would be wider however scholars say if you're calling the iodine in the Masjid in front of a microphone do I turn right and left some say yes you do because it's part of the Sunnah another say no you don't definitely because the reason you are turning right and left would be a reason for the voice not to each people if I'm calling for the iodine in front of the microphone and my voice is loud the minute I say hello solid it's gone because it's not in the direction of the microphone so people would not listen to it so it has a diverse result and that is why scholars say when you're giving the event in front of a microphone you should direct your face straight to the microphone and not turn right or left and also one of the lessons was that the Prophet used to pray at a historical salon to a screen what was the screen here the goat was it the Hansa or the Inasa you remember we spoke before and we said that in Arabic they all are written the same anza which means a goat and a nasa which means a short spear so this is the one that was put in front of him to pray Salah Liholiho Rosella and when you do this when the Imam is praying to a screen and we as the congregation praying behind him anyone can pass in front of us why because this would not affect our prayer our a prayer would be affected if someone passes in front of the Imam so therefore in big messages for example or in prayer holes or in the harem in during the mandatory or prayer when the people are praying behind the Imam you find people walking between the rows in front of the worshipers no problem because this was done at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam and you have no problem in doing that none whatsoever and finally we learned that the Prophet s term used to pray 2 rakaats meaning shortening prayers until he came back to Medina so those who travel they do not have a specific time for shortening the prayer as long as they're traveling a week two three four as long as they're considered to be traveling they shorten the prayer Paul rokkes they pray them in two to three records they pray them into three unchanged one would say maybe Allah kinda half and the Torah has also remained unchanged so the only shortening is when you pray the four into two okay so I believe we have a break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum and welcome back we have another hadith that is related to the event and hadith number 65 we will take it and explain it and then we will attend your questions in sha Allah and who will give us the honor yes brother narrated even humor and Asia the prophet salaallah alayhi wa sallam said bilal pronounces as as on at night so eat and drink until evening Maktoum pronounces the azan Buhari the hadith was narrated by a beloved Umar may Allah be pleased with the man with his father and also there is a narration of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her but the one in whom Nutella camp is only on Abdullah Hanauma and he says that the prophet sallallaahu whatever Selim said that Bilal pronounces the I van at night and even Maktoum pronounces the I than when it is pleasure time what do we learn from this we learned that the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam is to have to advance forfeiture you know that we have two fetchers right a false feature and an actual feature so likewise we have two event one event where the Prophet says alehissalaam is performed by bilal it does not affect your night prayer your whitter and it does not affect your eating and drinking so this is simply a reminder from Balad that watch out budget is closed so if you would like to offer with it offer it if you would like to have your suhoor your three down meal and you drink before hogr go ahead so this is a reminder and that is why the difference between the iron of Bilal and even Maktoum what is it what's the difference between the Agana of Bilal and even ohmic - yes brother as an of Palolo Zillah one who has hi Alyce Allah but the azan of Omaha to has a Salado high remain unknown yes well actually if you just said that you know Maktoum has a solid - hi Roman in Nome would have been better because both advanced have hi Alice hola hi Oliveira so the normal Adan of Bilad which he does throughout the whole day is given at the beginning but the van of a Bonomi Maktoum is a Salado Chiron min unknown and even on Maktoum as we don't was a blind man so how did he call for that then how did know it was featured definitely someone had to inform and from this we learned that a blind man can announce the event if there is someone trustworthy telling him that that time is due not only that it is permissible to have the blind man to be a judge or to be a ruler because whenever the prophet has some left Medina on an expedition on jihad on Razoo he used to a point of the live no me Maktoum to be the ruler of medina and you cannot be a roller without judging people and without leading the prayer and this all was done by amiami Maktoum therefore is the Adhan of bilal for Tahajjud no the hajj starts from earlier on but it is a reminder for people unfortunately this tuna has been abandoned I'm embarrassed to say this I'm sorry to say this but this Sunnah has been abandoned in the Muslim world except in few places such as Mecca and Medina up till today Mecca and Medina they call the first event we call it of furture and they have the second event but other cities they consider this to be means of waking up the sleep and they don't want to wake up this is what it was meant originally to be what to wake people up so that those who did not offer with it would be able to do that and those who are preparing themselves too fast they can take the pre-dawn meal nowadays people don't want to listen to the event and would like to sleep we have still to do something with their van and hadeeth number 66 is the last thing we have in Sharla in regard to that so I will take the honor of reading it narrated by abu sorry the hoodie Mallory please with him the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said whenever you hear the Adhan say just as the earth then is saying narrate and reported by Buhari so so many times we are asked what to take when the madman says Allah Akbar we say Allah I shall either halala similarly a shadow mohammed rasoolallah similarly when we come to the higher color when we come to high yellow solid high alpha we have another authentic hadith that date that we should say la haula what a cool water in LaBella why colors justified they say when the more evidence says come to prayer come to success and prosperity if you pray if you repeat you said no you come he says come to prison oh no you come that would not be logical so what is the appropriate thing to say to say la hawla wala quwata illa billah there is no might and there is no power except by Allah meaning that I cannot go to attend the prayer on my own I need what I need Allah support and this is why this phrase la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah one of the plants of the trees in paradise wallah if we know and understand this phrase when you know that there is no possibility or might or power except by Allah you feel helpless you are 100% helpless without a lodge and the minute you understand that Allah is with you you are the strongest person on earth no one can defeat you no one can bring you down no one can make you depressed no one can even intimidate you why because I have Allah and if I have Allah I have everything but if I lost Allah I have lost everything so losing Allah meaning that you don't have a Las protection unless guidance Allah provisions for you and that is why it is extremely important to understand when he says hey I lost a lot I'm not coming on my feet I'm coming with Allah's grace and power la hawla hotel allah and what about when he says isola - hi - many Nome in Federer the most authentic opinion is that you say exactly as he says so when he says a solid Ohio mini-note you say artola - hi Roman and no and of course we know that after that then we offer salutation to our Prophet Allah humma salli wa salim re and we ask allah Syria or fidella were Alma common muda heaven and adora you all know that hoping that we will achieve by that his intercession on the day of judgement sallallahu alayhi wa sallam we opened the floor for your questions Kareem and then I'd be like man we learned from the hadith stop we have to repeat the Adhan is does the same ruling apply to the Akama and associated with another question is not when we repeat our she had one muhammad rasool allah should we also accompany it with sallallahu alayhi wasallam as for the air karma some scholars say that it is permissible to repeat after it because also considered to be a dad other scholars say that we don't have any evidence to back this up and none of the companions had ever reported to us that this is something permissible therefore we take to the event you repeat only the that when they're calm is being cold you are just careful to treyton up your rows rather than repeating after him as for offering the salutation to the Prophet that is Haram when repeating after the event of the MOA then when he said ashhadu anna muhammadan rasulullah should I say ashhadu anna muhammadan rasul allah most holy of salam ala muhammad the answer is no because this is not the time to do it and the Prophet Adam did not instruct us to do it and if you cascade this if you expand this a little bit more people would say okay what about the might then can he say a shadow no muhammad rasul allah mohamet solution Amana Muhammad then this would be part of innovating in Islam Shaykh you mentioned about the different types of argon that are there in the other on for the fagio prayer there is an addition in a way that that you know prayer is better than sleep so can you enlighten us as to what's the origin of this phrase and related to this is since we know now that it's an abandoned soon of having to other on for Fajr prayer was the time for the first man to be pronounced for your first question the origin of this is the Prophet s term he's the one who instructed the companions to say Isola - hi Roman and known as for the time of the first event of fire this is up to the people they can make it 15 minutes half an hour or an hour before there is nothing specific because there isn't any special sign that tells us now this is the time for advance though it depends on the people and the buffer zone or the barrier or the time that is the period between then the first event in the second event yes brother Shiva is one organization where there's no Masjid near to it the people in that organization they cannot hear the Sun so is it permissible for them they know that it's time for Salah and is it permissible for them that if they go to the prayer hall they pronounce the azan yes it is there is no Masjid nearby then it is definitely recommended for you to call for the Adhan even if you're not in a Masjid even if you're in a prayer hall in an organization in a school in a company there is no problem in pronouncing that than at all it's recommended but is it mandatory or not as long as the people in that city pronounced it it's sufficient but it is added value because the Prophet told us that some of the great reward of those who pronounce the event and that they would come on the day of judgement with the longest next not only that any bird tone 3 human being who here then they will come on the day of judgement to testify for you that you offered Diane yes brother is it necessary that person according for as on cannot lead the Salah oh ok so your question is is it permissible for a person who gives the Adhan to lead the prayer the answer is yes there is nothing restricting that you can have a person calling for that than he is calling for the hama and he is leading the prayer I've done that so many times and you can have a person offering that that and another person offering their karma and a third person offering the prayer this is all permissible insha'Allah yes brother soundly kucik is it necessary to say comma in Salah whether first or voluntary if offered alone if it's voluntary there is no a common Oregon at all this is agreed upon but if it form it is highly recommended that you give a comma but if you pray without a comma your prayer is valid if you pray without your karma your prayer is valid I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fear man alone Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
