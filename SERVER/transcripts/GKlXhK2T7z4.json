  "transcript": "Mohammed says if I was praying and I did sujood and got up and I had doubt if I said Subhan Allah BL Allah or not so I went back Institute and said it and I did this with several player prayers are my prayers valid the answer is if you were ignorant of the ruling dance the the prayers are valid but do not do this again because if you do it again your prayers are invalid why if I stood up I stood up for a pillar of salat which is the third record second rocket whatever it's a laka it's a pillar and if I go back to sujood to say subhana rabbi Allah I'm leaving a pillar for an act that is mandatory this renders your prayer invalid so what should I do if you're doubtful continue your prayer as usual don't go for stitute again continue your prayer as usual but then offer to a sujud of forgetfulness at the end of your prayers"
