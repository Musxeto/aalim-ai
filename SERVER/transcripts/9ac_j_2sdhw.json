  "title": "When should we do dua qunoot in Witr, before or after ruku? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "because I found it is [Music] where the companion is saying that he's so Prophet are praying with her that is three units and uh profit made in the third raka before the record so this Hadith is a very crystal clear but to why they are a defense of opinion with already due respect I am asking you this question if you find any arrogance or anything disrespecting then I am very much sorry for it thank you there is no arrogance or disrespect in your question at all this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion is both narrations are correct the Hadith you've mentioned and quoted is authentic without any doubt and uh albani mentioned it in his famous book the description of the prayer of the Prophet Islam and he quoted that the companions some of the companions quoted that the prophet did the qunoot before the record but there are numerous verses and Hadith also stating that the Companions and tabern used to do it after the record and also some other narrations so both ways are fine what we are used to in the Muslim world that people do it after raising from the Ruku and there is no problem for a person to do it before inshallah according to the Hadith you have quoted Allah Knows Best"
