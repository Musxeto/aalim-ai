  "transcript": "sonam an overhang hungry little brat any solo vamos a la vodka do so here I mean the Vienna mahogany water he was happy aljamain and my back we continue with session number Allah knows how three accession number three and in this session we are to discuss one part of her room Quran known as McKee and Matheny and McLean is related to my car and mother is related to Medina and this science desert not only address the verses of the sewers that were revealed relating to McCann Medina alone but it also relates to the locations the timings etc for example the scholars said that this relates to what was revealed in Mecca what was revealed in Medina and the disputed whether would this wasn't Medina or in macro and also it relates to the shooters that are classified as Medini and which verses of mucky inside of it and vice versa and what was revealed in Mecca yet it has the ruling of remedy for example are you mad metal upon be no this was revealed in Powers Act which is close to make up yet it has the ruling of the Metheny because it was in the period and vice versa what resembles the makii ayah which resembles the madden EAJA what was carried from Mecca to Medina there are verses and sewers cat were carried to Medina and what their others carried from medina to muck up what was revealed in nighttime what was revealed in daytime what was revealed in summer time and what was in winter and what was revealed in residency when the Prophet was deciding in Medina and what was revealed while he was traveling all of this was governed in this section of rain and this highlights the great carefulness that the companions may allah be pleased with them and the scholars who came afterwards related and wrote this science it tells you how great they were taking care of this science likewise the sooner when in the sooner we know that the prophet is locked somehow number of white hair he had in his beard home on his in his head and it is her head it shows you how exact this was reported to us it was reported in the Sahara try him a Muslim and other authentic books that shall matter piracy may Allah be pleased with him was addressed by a group of Jews and they said you Muslims you claim that your prophet taught you everything even how to difficult even how to go and pass school because they're astonished by this is it this extent your profit Tokyo what did Salman say did yes the Prophet Alice auto salam forbade us from facing or giving our backs to the Qibla when defecating and he instructed us to clean ourselves with three stones minimum and to make this in odd numbers and people forbade us from using our right hand very easy this is part of Gotama para and Salmonella replace with him give half of it in this hadith which shows you that the Companions reported to us every single detail of the prophet of the Prophet Elisha love selfies life because Allah preserve the Dean through this and that is why we have to be very proud of our religion no one can come and say our prophet our messenger did this and did that in the details that we have yet when you measure the number of hadith of the Prophet Alice awesome throughout the 23 years of his life as a prophet and messenger to you will find it little compared to 23 years I say since the beginning of this lecture more than the hadith of the Prophet RSS if I said and this was only in three hours time which illustrates that this is not from the Prophet eyes emits from a lot on my ticket is why and that is why it's preserved a la serda did not only preserve the Quran Allah so jeal preserve the Quran and the Sunnah with it it's all side by side and that is why we learn and exact hip and and know the ignorance of some of the Muslims nowadays we find a lot of Muslims coming in saying that Allah says in the Quran so and so and when we say ok the but the Prophet says are they said no no no no I don't want to hit happy why Hadid has lots of fabricated things have a by e mo door and so on but the Quran is one all they talked to me by the or on is this acceptable allegation no it is not because the prophets say that is officer I do not want to find a man leaning on his couch you know the people with they are rich and comfortable he will not sit like us straight they would sit I like this you know having a couch and Arabia we usually sit on the pot we would love to have these pillows so that we can lean over them and this is something but over the side the prophet alayhi salaatu sarah said three or not to be rejected when you are offered do not reject them in a pie recall correctly the pillows if you're sitting is somebody gives you a pillar to lean on or to put behind your back does it should take it this is something that costs you nothing to accept perfume deep when somebody gives you perfume unless it's something that you don't want that you can reject it kindly but mainly speaking no you have to accept it and lemon milk somebody gives you milk it's so nutritious so full of good things for you no reason for you to reject this so the hadith says the Prophet says I do not want to find someone from my Ummah leaning on his cow of his fellow saying that don't give us anything except Quran whatever is important we take whatever is not we reject the prophet elias am I have given I've been given the revelation the Quran and something similar to it and there is sooner you cannot depart or separate them somebody says yes everything is in the Quran Allah who your father is enough Katie activity beyond the cliche where is an electrical it away unless in the undulating him so everything when I forgotten our cricket a be in shape this can refer to the Lohan my food and it can defer to the Quran in general terms but can you come to the piranha say it stays states that there are five players a day it states that hudgens to regards mother is three and there are support it stays that America has to stay Jeter it doesn't say anything of this it does it say the percentage of zakat 2.5% on golden silver five percent on crops that you water ten percent on crops that is watered by a large thou shalt through grain does it say on 40 shape you have one sheet on five camels you have one sheep on 20 or 30 cows you have this you have does it say that so how are you going to understand Islam it has to be interpreted and then this should only through cigna and what brought us to this in short the Ratana consulted a lot of effort to preserve this deal to come to us this reporters to this issue no religion can say this not even Christianity not even Judaism no one can say Jesus Christ said this without 30 or 40 other churches say no didn't you did it no one and if you ask how many Bibles do they have hundreds hundreds and thousands of this Bible's New Testaments everyone writes you have reported catawba wave to wanaka tava be ided him Paula says they write the book with their own hands in the sense that whatever they wish they change this and they put this Islam hamdillah hey anyone student of knowledge is able to say that this hadith is authentic or not a good student of knowledge if you know who stole al-hadi it and I did this at early ages years and years ago I was found of hashish and you should take everybody and check every single man in generations and check if this is authentic or not and then see what all the other scholars said it is a beautiful science but it is time consuming and because i'm lazy i did not continue I thought that there are priorities in their own but there are men who are people of knowledge experts professors in this science Cheryl albani may allah have mercy in its all I feel I trust them so every he says had it so he juggle ahead I don't have to follow and whenever he says how do you buy it I don't have to follow but sometimes i do and i used to do this were long ago and i met him may allah have mercy on her soul and I told him you said this hadith was by even this high level society and he explained it and he showed me where I was wrong so this is science this is end it's not more because if there is a game in America and Europe they say Simon Says stand up you send up Simon Says sit down you sit down his love is not like this do this horse why because I sit why not ask no no this is we don't have beasts in Islam if you are equipped to understand I would explain to you one of the brothers is level of hair yesterday came to me after the lecture he said you said that the sister can read the Quran intelli we have p.m. from her masab said yes how do you say this I was shocked in awhile I started calculating my head maybe it maybe I made a mistake may be made him see I didn't make a mistake I said what what's wrong in it he said the Prophet said I assume you have to put your right hand over her left when you standing up ok so how can you say that she can hold them us up I told him brother this is sunnah and he said how do you say it sooner then I started calculating it again did I did I make a mistake well I have been teaching this for more than 20 years and the guy was very confident so I said it is sooner because the hadith of I didn't hajer the sunnah of the prophets to put the right on the left over the chest he said no it's mandatory it's local it's a pillar of Islam of a player and as said no hold on now now I know this reminded me of abu hanifa may allah have mercy on his soul he was teaching in his circle with his feet extended when this 50 or 60 years old bearded man very respectful came so immediately he cross his legs and sat in a respectable way and after he finishes course he said does anybody have any question nobody raised their hands as we always do so you looked at this respect to shake i said respected share do you have any inquiry you would like to ask we said yes mmm when does a fasting person break is fast so the chef said then I'm sure buddy was it when the Sun sets so the chef said and what if it is not set abu hanifa stretch his legs they say he said now it's time for abu hani back to stretch his legs because he realized the magnitude of the question coming from this man so when the brother told me that it was a pillar I knew that he was misguided and he said that when the no it's not a pillar brother he had no shoes albani said he disappeared in separate the summer and it so happens at this book I almost know it by heart because I taught it in my message it finish my page but I read paragraph by paragraph now to them he doesn't say this I'll give you ten thousand rupees if you say if you bring me evidence for this it's a bit from one side not as hell business humble set so having said this we have to know that Islam is only derived from piranha soon if you are equipped to ask and receive the answer we will communicate but if you do not have the arabic language can you say you say its own show in Arabic but I don't any believe that do you know how to my brother no but it doesn't sound nice I cannot communicate with you therefore coming back to the subject and I don't want to take too much time Islam preserved our knowledge asst be trustful and what you learn because this is quran and sunnah and scholars have spent their entire lives preserving and protecting and classifying and compiling all of this for us have the live in my throat may allah be pleased with him he's among the first to know this science he swears by allah that there is no solar in the Quran except that he knows where it was revealed and it is not a single verse in the Quran except that I know the reason behind its revelation of course he is referring to the verses that have the cause of revelation because we just stated that not all the verses of the Quran have a specific but he's mentioning those that have a reason he knows that and he says and if they would any person that knew more about the Quran than I did and it was possible for me to reach him I would ride on my camel towards him to get this knowledge Abdul of misrule who was as described unless he's described as what when we describe an assailant matic we see the servant of the Prophet Alistair someone will describe a dilemma so we say happy land the one who used to carry the sandals of the Prophet Ali salatu salam and he was close to the Prophet Elisha la tercera and he's the one who chopped the head of abu abu journal in the battle of Bajor of course he was first attacked by the two companions of Assad and while he was dying he came and mounted and when you hear the translation of the Saudis he mounted over his chest as if he was a big beast because I thalamus food was very fini when he once was climbing a tree the Companions look at his legs and they fell down Hitler he was like a cue stick you know billiards and it was like a Miss Walker and the Prophet said what were they are you laughing at did you look at his legs so then it can't be say the Prophet else and by Allah they are heavier I decide of a lot at the mountain of God because of the e man he has to don't be deceived by the looks of a person now you might find a very big person with that person and he is not weighing the way of the leather the wing of Kito the prophecies are set up and he would find a very thing man and like even my sore throat so he swears by this he is modest and humble to the extent that he is willing to travel anywhere to learn about the plan from someone who is more knowledgeable than him so he is sit setting the foundation of the same he knows where it was revealed how it was revealed and he is willing to go more and more to learn about this now when we talk about McKeon Matheny we have to understand that it is not only related to McCann Medina it is classified into three types whether we're talking about the period when it was revealed because the period is decisively stated with teacher so before he is called McKeon after he is called methane and the second way of classifying it is by location so whatever was revealed in makkah whether after use your before Hydra it's called McKee and whatever is revealed in medina whether after or before is called maddening and the third type is in classification of the addressee who was it addressed to so if it was addressed to the people of Mecca and Medina it's considered to be McKee and this is a divided here as mentioned either through time that we see or location and what is the most authentic opinion they have different opinions ax to time why because when you divide it into time you have two divisions if you divide it according to locations you have lots of divisions because this was revealed in the time after he drop to have time and location but here we have time before and after and as for the addressing what do we mean by that racy for example one of the characteristics of the lucky versus that the majority of it says here are you a nurse because it an ass include everybody while the noggin ii-vi you halloweiner Hammond but is this jenny agreed upon no because insured al-baqarah and it is Megan in surah it has moved here are you an answer who do not become a commodity no public event has a lot of viu velutina amano so this criteria does not befit every single sewer so it's not decisive while before he drew octahedra is definitely acceptable by oh where is the benefits where are the benefits the benefits proper understanding and interpretation of the Quran it helps you a lot to know that this verse was revealed in Mecca where Allah tells them refrain do not fight if someone nowadays takes is higher and good will the aggressors usually use this if I were to be a non-muslim tough a bit and I attack a Muslim country and the people want to defend themselves and make you hug and I said Allah Surya said Khufu idea co that refrain from fighting you're Muslim book well so-and-so chapter some so this is the Quran if you no if it's revealed in makkah and madina and said life is right let's stop so it gives you more ability to understand the Quran would you know whether this was revealed in Mecca or in Medina also it gives you an insight whether it's abrogated or not because if I have two verses wine muckin one media immediately know that in Medina khobragade's that that was in that car because it came the last and that is why Jerry did not deliver jelly may allah be pleased with him if i'm not mistaken he used to recite surat al maeda and he embraced islam lately either him or to me matt darey I am confused well the 22 Sahaba and the companions used to love to hear it from him because it was among the last to be a view to the prophetess Sam so it obligated everything regarding rules that came before it and among the benefits that the history of the gradual revelation of Sharia is known to us so once we see how it was revealed then we know that this was revealed before this we know how it was gradual to us in Islam and four before the final point it adds value to us to know the proper way of calling to Islam making Dawa I'm tired of talking how is this I need explanation from others chapter a new people usually get a bit drowsy in Arabia after lunch we have to take a nap before lunch we have to rest so that we can get ready for lunch so if lifeless know this this is an exceptional it's not there is a hadith with the prophets say that is some pea pea chef unilateral have had a nap because share teen do not have this dana and then differed whether it's before over for after book and the nap is five minutes hit those who work in offices know that it breaks the ice it is needed and it gives you an extension that is why in spain this is not a local our mother that is why in spain they give mandatory half an hour to an hour best because it makes people extend their consultation and their agility but going back to the question brothers matthew brother sisters the proper way of calling islam to islam Dawa i'll tell you so that we can make use of the time that's what you're raising in is whether excellent question excellent answer you have to know the kalahari in is a geyser"
