  "title": "Money given to a man to keep it and he spent it, can I use that in zakat",
  "transcript": "chan if I gave someone a deposit some money to keep whether it's a loan or anything else most likely it is a deposit and after a year when I wanted to pay the zakat I spoke to the man I told him listen the thousand euros you have please give 2.5% of it to the cat and the man said to me I was in so much need of the money i consumed it and i use it for medication or for this because I was poor so he says can I change my intention now and make this as the cat and answer is no because this is a man deposited with someone else and you are now hopeless of getting it back so instead of taking another thousand euros and giving it in the cart you said okay this one cancels this one and the thousand euro is in your pocket this is not permissible"
