  "title": "How to upbring our children in the right way and manner? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "though published first question is how to up bring our children in the right way and manner and are there any books to read well hand Allah that TV is running the show that talks about life adornments and this is one serie there is or there are a number of series and found on YouTube insha'Allah where we talk about how the Prophet s I'm dealt with the children if you know Arabic then I would HIGHLY advise you to enroll in that Academy because inside Academy Allah blessed me to teach four semesters and one of them is about how the Prophet hasn't dealt with different segments of the society among them their children his grandchildren so before birth when they were born after birth when they grew up etc how he dealt with them from the Sunnah but to try to summon that sum it up all now it's not possible unfortunately and any books I don't know any books in Arabic in English there are many books that talk about upbringing children and there is this beautiful book in English of our beloved sheikh mohamed hassan al-majid may allah bless him which is in arabic is called kafir amela home in english how he treated them big volume but full of authentic and beautiful knowledge that you most likely won't find it elsewhere so I would highly recommend that you get a copy of it so after"
