  "transcript": "it is a number of rulings regarding fasting shahan the first ruling is that it is it is forbidden for a person to fast the last day or the last two days of shahan if he's doing this so that he would be on the safe side night because he's not sure when Ramadan is due so even if they say that Saturday is Ramadan he says well I'm going to fast Friday just in case this is Haram the prophet said do not precede Ramadan by fasting at one or two days except those who used to fast a special kind of fast then they may continue to fast as in the case of those who fast the fasting of David pleas upon him he fast a day and uh Skips a day so this is permissible or a person who wants to make up for days missed in Ramadan the previous Ramadan and there are only three or four days left for the following Ramadan it is permissible for him to make up for these days the second type of fasting Shaban is for those who are weak and if they fast the last 15 days of Shaban when Ramadan comes they are exhausted and they're tired in their case they're not allowed to fast the last 15 days of Shaban because they have to gain and regain their strength to be able to fast the month of Ramadan uh uh on good terms the third and last type or category are those who are capable of fasting without any problem they healthy they're strong and in their case they may fast as many days as they wish from shahan providing they do not receive Ramadan with a day or two and even if they fast the whole 28 days of Shaban this is permissible the prophet had never ever fasted any month uh after Ramadan more than he fasted Shan and Allah Knows Best"
