  "transcript": "I'm blessed with three children alhamdulillah two sons at the age of ten and four and a daughter which is who is eight months uh basically she says you know I breakfast both of my sons uh for about a year but I seem to have given more time to my daughter a breastfeed of tea she says I felt feel uneasy the fact that I gave more time to my daughter than I did my sons now will I be held accountable for for this that I basically breakfast there for two years and the children the other children less the sisters confusion comes from that is she fair for all of her children or not and not breastfeeding them all the same amount of time the answer is no it depends on her physical condition on how she feels about the children it does not uh have to do with gifts this is something you should be fair in so if you give one um 10 reals you should give the other one 10 reals as a gift and this is different than what they need for school or what they need for uh their livelihood I'm talking about general gifts but what they have to take as provision or as support no this is different it depends on their uh individual needs"
