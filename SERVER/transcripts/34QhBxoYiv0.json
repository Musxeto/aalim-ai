  "title": "How to practice Islam in the west? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "welcome to this lecture organized by our brothers in holland i wish i could say uh any greeting in in deutsche though i've been to holland maybe three or four times in my life though my sister-in-law is deutsch and my nieces are deutsche though we had a house in maastricht 40 years ago yet i could not pick the language unfortunately due to my ignorance nevertheless i hope you understand my poor english and i also hope that you benefit from what we are going to discuss because seriously i did not prepare a lot well actually i did not prepare anything due to the fact that i know that insha allah what i'm going to discuss with you is basic knowledge the topic if i understand it is how to live and deal being a muslim in the west and if you look at the muslims in the west why are they there either they came long time ago searching for a better standard of living so they were going there to improve their lifestyle and get better job make money or they are there to study and gain knowledge from colleges universities and they liked it in their state or they're there because they're refugees running away from their countries due to it is unbearable to live there or they're being prosecuted or for any other reason so the community of muslims that live in the west they're not all the alike they're not the same they have different reasons for being there so when we want to discuss anything that deals with their standard of living with the way of life with practicing islam we'll find that this topic is endless it depends on how you look at it from which angle are you looking at it sometimes people think really really deep and sometimes people think on the surface what to do in the times of wearing the hop or growing a beard or free mixing that's it this is what they know or understand about islam so it is always essential to go back to the fundamentals oh that's why they call you a fundamentalist true fundamentalist means a person who abides by the fundamentals of his beliefs and this is why such people are always classified as extremists so when you abide by your religion when you abide by islam to the letter this doesn't go well with the vast majority of muslims let alone with the disbelievers imagine even the muslims would not accept it oh this is too extreme what is extreme quran either you're not a real muslim or we are the few who are following the footsteps of the prophet so it's always essential to go back to the basics because what i'm going to say is not rocket science everybody knows it all the duat and the and the students of knowledge and the scholars they're not reinventing the wheel they're simply opening your eyes and due to the fact that you live in a kafir country among disbelievers among muslims who are sinners or barely muslims your brain is being washed and lots of the basics are being compromised till the extent that we have reached the end of time where the prophet ali salazar told us that evil would become good and good would become evil this is how people see it nowadays so let's attempt to explore such venues and open our eyes together i might be wrong you have the right to correct me but if i'm right then it's about time for you to reflect on your life and to see whether you are on the straight path heading to jannah insha allah or you need to do something about it now why are we created come on this is basic everybody knows this okay refresh my memory says i have not created the jinn and the humans except with the soul purpose of worshiping me worshiping allah so this is why allah created you okay do you have knowledge sure no no seriously do you acknowledge do you accept this fact yes this is why i'm praying i'm fasting and i'm a muslim okay this is not only the forms of worship because is far greater than simply fasting and um and praying and giving zakat yes it is one of the pillars of islam but is it everything no so what is it that you're talking about how many years did the prophet spend allah in mecca 13 years and after that he migrated to medina and stayed there for 10 years very good masha'allah you've done your homework what did the prophet isaiah do in these 13 years in makkah the he taught everybody islam such as prayer fasting hajj zakat wrong what do you mean wrong these are the pillars of islam wrong because salat was ordained and obligated only in the last years of the makkah period after the israel the miraculous night journey and this was one two or three years before hijra so for 10 years there was no salat for 13 years there was no zakat because zakat was obligated in medina after migration there was no fasting because fasting was obligated on the second years of hijrah in medina there was no hajj in umrah because hajj namra was obligated on the 10th and the ninth year of hijrah whoa that's strange so what did the prophet do all of these 13 years in mecca he taught them how to worship allah okay but i thought you said all of these forms of worship were introduced in medina yes because that was not the only form of worship what is the first pillar of islam to bear witness that there's no god worthy of being worshipped except allah and that the prophet muhammad islam is his servant and messenger this is the shahada also known as the kalima this is what the prophet alaihis salatu spent all of his years in makkah as well as in medina teaching the people who allah is what the prophet alaihis salatu salam's status in islam and why should we obey him simply manifested and summed up in tawheed so the prophet salallahu salaam had spent all of his life teaching people to hate the core of islam and what to do with the belief that the prophet is a servant and a messenger of allah to obey him in what he orders to stay away and refrain from what he prohibited and to believe whatever he told us about and not to worship allah unless he legislated it for us this is worshipping allah and with this concept if you look at the vast majority of muslims in europe in america not only that even in arabia you will find that they're not actually worshiping allah azzawajal truly so what to do then we have to focus on rectifying our direction are we on the straight path because the vast majority of muslims pray fast give zakat perform umrah and hajj but when it comes to the real test whether they're muslims or not whether they give priority to islam or not the vast majority fail and i'll give you an example although this is not part of our lecture but as i said i didn't prepare for it so who cares a dear friend and a relative of mine who is practicing memorizes the quran and very good in his moral etiquette his wife had an accident last week and it was a minor accident but she does not have a driver's license so when the insurance company came or the police came to investigate she wrapped it up took the other car's number and details and they left the following day her husband calls the other party they meet in the same place where the accident happened and they called the insurance company the insurance company comes the husband says i was driving here is my driver's license and the other party gave his driver's license the fault was 100 on the woman so they did not compensate the damages in their car and they took the report and they left and he was telling me about it so i said to him subhanallah you are a practicing muslim and you memorize the quran when it comes to euros and reals and dollars you tend to forget easily isn't this cheating when you cheat the authorities and say that it was you who was driving isn't this lying when you signed the papers that you were driving he said to me yeah but uh it won't cost us anything they're not going to compensate us is it true but who will compensate the other driver for the damages and husk on his car he paused for a while and said my company my insurance company and i said would that had been the case if you registered your wife as a driver i said no they would not give him anything because she's not supposed to be driving on top of that the police would find us a thousand reals for driving without a driver license so i said subhanallah look how many mistakes and sins you've fallen into why because we consider ibadah to be praying fasting that's it and looking like a sheikh with a big beard that's it not the core of ibadah which is the fear of allah which is that the risk is in allah's hands which is i don't lie in my hand that says i do not sign anything that is false this is what real islam is and this is what the prophet taught his companions in mecca for 13 years to know who allah is to know what to hide is and this is not the time to go and explain to hida rabobia and luhiya and the asman safak there are so many other lectures and i have i think a lecture on my youtube channel by the name of tohit for the types of tohi i did it in the maldives and i did it in nigeria and maybe in malaysia which explains the types of tahiti and the implications of it so give it a shot and and look at it so as muslims living in the west what are we supposed to do i can't have the whole night to explain to you what you have to do because this is a very long process and a long topic to discuss in details but as i said this is just an eye opener for someone who's old and grumpy grandfather like myself who did not do his research and did not prepare for this lecture because i don't consider it as a lecture it's just a reminder between brothers and sisters so this is just a reminder so don't take it seriously just listen to it and inshaallah will be rewarded for it so what do we do if we live in the west first of all you have to identify that you are muslims okay everybody knows that no not necessarily saying i'm a muslim but i go to nightclubs and drink beer and fornicate with non-mahram women and cheat like so many muslims in the netherlands i know this for a fact a lot of the muslims are muslims by name not by true identity and this is what's tarnishing the reputation of the muslims in the netherlands in germany in europe and in the whole world when i say that i am a muslim saudi sheikh but i do not act like one if i am arrogant and i am sue me what are you gonna do i'm saudi if i'm arrogant if i'm ignorant if i'm not considerate if i don't care about people's feelings if i lie if i cheat if i abuse my wife if i cheat my neighbors if i uh uh take the money of my workers and then i say i'm going for umrah inshallah i'm going for hajj insha allah i am tarnishing the reputation of islam so for you as a muslim living in the west you have to always remember this beautiful ayah allah says in the quran there is no one better in rhetoric no one is better when they speak more than those who do the following three things number one make da'wah to allah they call people to islam number two they do good righteous deeds so it's not preaching i could preach you all day long i have the knowledge i have the technology as they say in the six million dollar man gentlemen we can rebuild him i can do that but talking is everybody's game allah says then does righteous deeds so when you talk you have to walk the talk you have to do righteous deeds you have to offer night prayer you have to fast voluntary prayers you have to be kind to everyone not only to your family and relatives and colleagues everyone even the disbelievers even the kafirs you have to be kind to them you have to be polite no offensive vulgar profanity words coming out of your mouth you have to lower your gaze you have to do good deeds and we can spend all the night talking about good deeds thirdly and to proclaim i am among the muslims what does that mean it means that you have to preserve your identity why is it when i look at you living in europe i can't differentiate if you're european or a muslim okay what do you want me to do we're like you saudi dress wear trousers i when i travel by the way and i'm traveling in two weeks time inshallah to egypt i wear jeans i wear a shirt polo shirt a t-shirt depending and i wear my nike shoes but tell me can anyone mistaken me for a non-muslim no way you look at my trousers it's above the ankles you look at my beard wow this guy's maybe he's sick maybe he's i don't know yeah but you know look at my moustache you know he's a muslim definitely so my identity is crystal clear i'm a muslim and you don't find me walking with a beer in my hand or whiskey or looking around at beautiful women flirting with them you find me lowering my gaze minding my own business occupying myself doing halal things whether reading or writing or whatever identity the muslims when they were in mecca with the prophet saw they did not wear special clothes no they were like everybody else normal arab clothes but they had their identity so you as a muslim have to search deep down inside of you am i proud of being who i am am i proud of my identity or not let alone doing good deeds let alone giving down so this is part of your obligations living in the west to give the hour to do righteous deeds righteousness can be helping in the community when it's halal and there is nothing haram to be performed all of these things are part of your identity now part of living in the west is to have your priorities set correctly are you deich or a muslim what comes first everybody in europe in america elsewhere they want you to be nationalists before you're a muslim so they say to you no you have to become british then muslim your allegiance to america should become more important to you than your allegiance to islam we say this is a no brainer i am a muslim before being saudi before being arab when islam and my government collide i'm always at the side of islam without any strings attached because i'm a muslim what was the prophet a muslim when there was conflict between him and his people he migrated he would not give any concessions in islam say oh you disbelievers i do not worship what you worship and you are not worshiping what i worship and i'm not going to worship what you are worshiping this is something that we repeat every sunnah in fajr and and also in our witter prayers you have your religion and i have mine there's no compromise no concessions now having said that all governments do not approve of this they say ah this is extreme you are extremist you have to be in a melting pot so muslims hindus christian jews all have to be nationalists having their allegiance to the country first then their religion islam does not permit this say that my life say that my prayer my sacrifice my life and my death are all for allah azzawajal who has no partners and by that i was commanded and i am among the first to embrace and announce my islam so this is what your identity is all about and this is what you live and die preserving your islam having said that this does not at all means that it doesn't mean that you're allowed you're supposed to stay in a corner of a masjid or of a room not mix with people not be active not socialize you must avoid everybody boycott everybody disregard everybody look down at everybody no no no no your understanding of islam is wrong why is it wrong because you're not learning your religion from people of authority you're not learning your religion from the quran with the understanding of the righteous predecessors according to what the scholars of islam teach you're not following sharia you're following your whims and desires you're following your urges you're following whatever shaytan tells you to do you do it thinking that this is part of islam which is not and this is why it is very important while you are in the west to increase your iman 13 years the prophet also spent upbringing his companions uplifting their iman so how can i uplift my iman sheikh we live in a society that nudity is everywhere alcohol and wine and whiskey is everywhere the the netherlands is notorious for legalizing marijuana you want to have brownies and cookies we have it there you can get stoned legally in marijuana everybody in europe knows amsterdam knows the red district knows everything so how can we live in such a society share well this is your test very easy you have to increase and focus on your iman how everybody knows according to the akita of allah iman increases with good deeds and decrees with sins so focus on doing good deeds and focus on reducing your sins how to do this it's difficult ah here is where you have to build a community the muslims cannot live like lone wolves they have to live in communities in packs so there has to be cooperation why i have my quran i have my sunnah i study my religion and i have lectures to listen to why do i need muslims because the prophet said to you alai salatu that the wolf only attacks a stray sheep and satan is like this when you are with the congregation satan cannot attack you when you leave the wolf does not attack the herd waits until one sheep says i'm fed up i need my space what is this i don't want to be with people i need time to contemplate so i'm gonna wander out of the herd for a while just to get a breather this is when it's gone and it's killed by the wolf who's waiting for it so many muslims are being anticipated and waited for by the devil in the same fashion so to increase your iman you need to be with the community but unfortunately we don't have this look at the muslims in europe do they have one islamic center to refer to no do they have one imam no what do they have they have in the netherlands i've been there masjids for the moroccans masjids for the turks masjid for other denominations masjid for arabs and egyptian or palestinian if you go to the egyptian and palestinian messages all what you hear in the lectures and the khutbah slandering and cursing the muslim rulers politics things that kill your heart i am in europe why are you talking to me about things happening in saudi or in egypt or in in jordan or in syria talk to me about what uplifts my iman teach me about the hate show me how to pray increase my iman so that i don't lie or cheat remind me of being kind to my parents and my kinship so that i can connect to them this is what drives me closer to allah not talking to me about the arab spring about revolutions about this about all of this is nonsense if you go to the turk masjid i don't speak turkish but probably it will be only hanafi teachings and strict hanafi teachings and i don't know the topics and if you go to the moroccan masjid also there is not a lot of emphasis on what benefits the people and they're all divided can't we come together put our hands together so that the west the disbelievers see a united front most likely no why because i'm the imam of the masjid if i put my hands with others my people would probably slip and go to them i want dominance i want control not all imams are like this but there are imams who take their position as a means of income as a role of authority to control the congregation so we need cooperation between the muslims we need the muslims businessmen and professors and workers engineers doctors to come together so that we can build islamic schools for our children to preserve their identity to teach them arabic to teach them the quran instead of going to public schools and doing all haram things they have to mix with the opposite gender they have to swim with the opposite gender wearing bikinis and maybe one no not sell a bikini but one piece swimming suit boys and girls they have to mix in sports the gymnastics in everything what what kind of islam is this therefore you as muslims in the west find many things that goes that go against islam what to do we can't live like we live in arabia so many times we are faced with things that are like a crossroad either go right or left is no way other than that so what to do an eye opener we have the concept of methacid and masala we have pros and cons advantages and disadvantages everything you do in islam it looks at the advantages and the disadvantages so whenever the disadvantages outweigh immediately you abandon it and if it's the opposite then you follow it so if i have to go to school this is an advantage but by going to school i have to take off my hijab i have to wear a swimming suit i have to be half naked i have to mix with the opposite gender not only that do heinous things the advantages are way less than the disadvantages what to do you can't say what can i do i am oppressed i'm forced allah says in the quran about those men women and children who were oppressed the angels at the time of death comes to them and says why didn't you worship allah they say we were oppressed we could not leave they just say wasn't allah's land so open and vast for you to migrate anyway and they punish them and they take them to hell to the torment of allah azzawajal because they did not migrate so you have to weigh the pros and cons advantages and disadvantages to evaluate which direction to take because there are so many haram things around us and there are so many things that we cannot find a way out i live in holland and i have to work to feed myself and my family so i got a job but the problem is on friday it's a full working day and i tried to ask them to give me permission to go for jummah they refused i said i will compensate you two hours later after or before any working day they refused so should i resign and if you resign what will you do beg live on benefits no continue to work pray the on time and you're exempted from friday because your livelihood and your risk and your job is one of the reasons that scholars said that you can compromise when it conflicts with juma like someone having goods to sell merchandise and if he goes to pray to jummah someone will steal it so can he skip juman and says yes because this is a legitimate reason what i wanted to say and i think i will conclude by this because as i said the topic is very vast and long and so many areas to talk about but inshallah this is more than sufficient to give you an understanding and an eye-opener and maybe you will have some questions that we can um elaborate a little bit more what is needed for you to do is to bring the community together and bringing the community together does not take place by sectorism by introducing oh i'm a salafi you're not a salafi so you are below me i'm better than you i follow the self i follow the prophet sallam you follow schools of thought you're this you're that this does not bring anyone closer to anyone okay sir then you're not salafi i never go around hanging a tag on my chest saying awesome a salafi i'm a muslim yeah yeah yeah you're a muslim we're all muslims what what kind of a muslim are you why would you not want to know i'm a muslim no no we have sunni shiri okay i'm a sunni what kind of a sunni i am from al had a sm oh also some ashari's consider themselves why would i need to explain and boast about it everywhere i'm a muslim you're a muslim if you see something wrong correct me if i see something wrong on you i will tell you that this is not according to the sunnah your belief is not according to akita allah says in the quran so the prophet saws says but without carrying a flag and saying i'm a salafi because such labeling would probably cause more harm than benefit especially in the west the moment anyone hears the word salafi they label them as wahhabis extremists terrorists maybe an isis wannabe which is not very healthy so even sheikha men may because this is a form of sectarianism is as if you're taking a party he's a salafi and this one is and this one is table and this one is this everybody is happy with the label what are you i'm from alaska who are they there anyone who follows the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the righteous three generations that the prophet praised but no selfie no atheri no such a thing this brings the people together and don't blame others don't point fingers oh you do this you do that you do this you do that nobody likes criticism try to gather the muslims try to bring them together try to educate them try to care for the muslim community and to help one another and to uplift the ignorance about religion and to abandon politics because this is what divides people turkish don't like egyptians egyptians don't like saudis saudis don't like yemenis what is this this segregates us separates us all of us are muslims you're closer to me than my own brother because you believe in allah azza and you're committed to islam so i hope again i apologize this is not a proper lecture but it's just a reminder chit-chatting and spending our time opening our eyes trying to understand our religion a little bit better and hopefully we will be able to elaborate a little bit more when your questions and allah azza knows allah so um i will tell the people in the dutch uh to the dutch audience what we're gonna do um so the first question is um when we try to become practicing muslims we want to follow the path of the self and we want to imitate the prophet muhammad in his sunnah and whenever we try to do this our parents and people in our environments call us different labels like extremists wahhabis terrorists how can we deal with this and how can we advise them well welcome to the club when the prophet allah came with his message what did his people say liar sorcerer magician poet priest insane all of these were labels given to the prophet did it stop him from continuing his dawah never did it deter him did it slow him down never this is our fuel when people clap to us and say oh shahasam you are okay masha'allah when the jews the christians the buddhists the hindus say shikhasam is oh mashallah is very intelligent very good mashallah his words are very nice i raise flags and i look in the mirror and say what's wrong am i doing because allah stated in the quran the jews and the christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their ways i remember i think seven years ago sheikh haifan al-hadat came to amsterdam and i saw a clip where he was giving a lecture to the muslims but it was an open lecture and then came this woman a catholic woman insisting to sit with him on the same table to shake hands with him and forcing her way on the muslims and the sheikh was very diplomatic he says he did not look at her he tried his level best now what did she want she wanted to break the muslims she wanted to break him so do you think if he shook hands with her she would be happy and go her way no unless you do exactly what they want such as unless you take off your islamic dress if you're a muslim take off your hijab your neck expose your body if you're a man mix with them drink with them eat pork and never mention anything about islam or allah or the quran they hate quran krept wielders they hate anything that has to do with islam and what kills the most issue of shaking hands and this kills me seriously because they want to force us accept their ways and i always you know i'm rude i'm i'm an old arrogant saudi sheikh again what can you do sue me you can't people you will usually say no you discriminate women and you you look down upon them why don't you shake hands with women duh why would i shake hands with women because this is human you have to treat them like humans said is shaking hands treating them like humans she says yes what about if i want to kiss her on the cheek because this is human to what about if i like to touch her body in certain areas just to make sure that she's human this is inappropriate this is disgusting in your culture is disgusting maybe in my culture is okay no no no you have to say shake hands this is the the least you can do this is the least i can do in your understanding not in mine if i were to tell you if you want me to shake hands with you wear a thunk and give me a lap dance this is outrageous how dare you speak like this that's she was doing that it just came why are you offended this is how we feel when you force yourselves onto us if i am lactose intolerant and you give me a glass of milk and say drink it and i said sorry i'm lactose intolerant what would you do you would be considerate and say oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry no problem or would you shove it down my throat of course not you will understand why because it's harmful for me medically and physically now if i tell you that shaking hands with the opposite gender is offensive and harmful for me on the day of judgment because it will throw me in hell why don't you accept this because you don't want to accept this your issue is not with touching my silky hands and feeling the warmth of my body your problem is with my religion your problem is with my conviction and this is why we have to stand our grounds family members relatives people calling us names so what the prophet was called names ali so everyone has a test and this is your test in islam you could have been tested and people say yeah but this is very difficult share this test is very horrible i said how much would you grade it out of 100 they say oh chef it's very difficult the pressure we're getting it's like 90 percent hardship i said okay compare it to other tests would you like to have colon cancer or ovarian or breast cancer with the chemotherapy radiation in the whole nine yards no no who would would like that if you were to be tested with that how much would you grade it you said oh that would be 100 and what about your test with such people labeling you as wahhabi or extremist oh no that is way less it's 80 your parents are alive yes what's your rating of losing one of them oh that's 110 i cannot bear the idea of losing my mom or my father okay what about your calamity of being labeled oh no that's 70 maybe 65. we can go on and on and on mentioning different tests only to find that what you're suffering from what you're facing with the community with your relatives with loved ones your parents accusing you of being extremist is nothing let them bark let them say whatever they say am i pleasing allah or not yes or no yes is allah happy with what i'm doing is allah pleased with what i'm doing definitely who cares and allah knows best um we will go to the uh second uh question inshallah the second question is uh why do people think that if you read muhammad ibn abdullah ibrahim allah his books that you are misguided that's the third question what about the second well the second uh was about innovation but you already uh answered it in uh okay good so why would anyone consider reading the books of muhammad a misguidance very simple you are ignorant of what you don't know so if you ask anyone who tells you ah you've studied the books of muhammad you're misguided say to them i can agree with that on one condition tell me where is the misguidance in his books he will tell you ah because you will become extremist you will become a fundamentalist you will become a jihadi you will kill people you will give the fear to people how do you know that the i heard people say that have you ever read any of his books no i don't have to people talk excuse me have you or haven't you sorry i haven't then how can you judge me who have read his books learnt a lot of them just based on what people say this is total ignorance so you don't have to respond to ignorant people when people come and say to your face and by the way they came they used to come to me and say this a lot especially haters when they say oh  hassan you're an ass should i be angry i say i say to them true this is my name as i am this is how they spell my name as i am so when people come and say you're an ass does this mean i'm gonna grow two ears and a tail no let them say whatever they want good people say good words bad people say bad words i'm not gonna be affected by that so those who criticize those who speak ill about the books of imam muhammad and abdullah are one of two either a deviant shia or a deviant sufi there's no third why because the books of muhammad ibn abdul wahab speak about akida about returning people to sunnah about purifying our beliefs from innovations and this is what the shia and the sufis thrive on this is how they live and they cannot keep their congregation their followers they cannot use them and buy them and utilize what they have if they started to read the books of muhammad and rabbi which basically are quran and sunnah with understanding of the salah so i hope this answers your question do you still have time for a few questions yeah well the nike is young okay so the the the next question is um are there differences in apido within ethere i think he lives within the ethereal there are claims that ethere that the ethereal ethereal of today is not the same as the back in the time of ahmed ibn muhammad rahim allah and so on this issue of difference of opinion in arcadia matters is a very sensitive and delicate issue so people say did the companions differ on issues of apida the vast majority say they did not because when you speak about akida the first thing that comes up to people's minds are the essential differences today whether the attributes of allah azzawajal like the ashari's believe in are limited to seven attributes of allah and everything else is not which is definitely wacko all these attributes mentioned in the quran the sunnah is coming say no this is not what it is meant this is metaphoric this is this this is that which totally changed is that so when you say that companions differ than issues are up either our salafi people immediately grow up horns and want to attack thinking that we are talking about ashari or murtazili or kadari all of these the companion is different no no definitely not the companions had never ever had any issues of this when you come down a little bit then you start to have these issues coming up but what is the use of it only to preoccupy you in argument and debates that have zero benefit to you or to islam or to the muslims the issues of al-qaeda that the aferi or the salafi people have differed over are negligible and they're not in fundamental issues like in taheed like in the beautiful names and attributes of allah like in belief in qadhar or belief in the um or the six pillars of islam in general they differed whether the dead can hear you or not they differ in issues that are similar to that but not of great importance so to come today and try to make an issue out of it or to occupy muslims by asking questions that are irrelevant i would definitely ignore and move on because this is not helpful at all and there is no use of it why go into here the selfie is different the ethereal who cares follow the quran and sunnah with understanding of the righteous predecessors to the best of your ability and if there is a difference of opinion over whether for example seven on the day of judgement are shaded in the shade of allah where there is no shade other than the shade of allah does allah have a shade some scholars say no this is metaphoric among the salafi movement because this may insinuate that there is light that allah gives shades to blah blah blah and some say no this is like the attributes of allah we have to believe in it as it is so others say no no it's not the shade of allah it's the shade of the throne of allah it's a shade that allah creates and not history this is trivial in a sense issue to compare it to the difference between our akita and the arcade of ashari's etc so don't preoccupy people with such things and follow the quran and sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors the next question is it's not about hakida it says you know here in the west the people are getting lessons about homosexuality and even to children what should we as muslims do to protect our children i don't know about holland i know that in uk you can do homeschooling in the us you can do homeschooling so you get your children put them in an islamic school if this is not possible because too expensive or you don't have anyone to teach in that islamic schools you take them home and you teach them and at the end of the year they give exams so you avoid such free mixing you avoid such haram things i know in the scandinavian countries to my knowledge i might be wrong sweden norway denmark etc that you cannot do homeschooling you're forced to do this and this is very bad when my eight-year-old daughter or son are given sex education on the use of contraceptives on the types of sex stories on how to put a condom on a dildo on how to refuse intimacy if the girls if the girl says no and the boy is eight years old and he sees these things this is very dangerous if not going to practice it the least he's going to investigate maybe with his sister maybe with his mother maybe in the internet maybe he goes to the red district and who knows what happens there so this is very dangerous we have to protect our children with all what we have but it depends on the resources and the means available whether you have muslim schools or not if not then you have to start planning to build a masjid a school many schools to incubate and to take in our children inshallah um the next question um it says how can you have an ex an islamic wedding when both parents of the bride and groom aren't practicing islam and have a western way of thinking and then it says music and culture put your foot at the door don't close the door put your foot tell them that i'm not having an islamic wedding i'm getting married i'm taking my wife you guys want to have a wedding with music you pay for it i will not attend it i will not come let them bang their head on the wall let them do whatever they want be a man being a dutiful respectful son doesn't mean that you become a doormat where they wipe their feet whenever they come and go this is a misconception that obeying the parents is a must in everything this is totally wrong if your parents say shave your beard or we will never talk to you until the day of judgment would you no okay they will not talk to me sheikh they are the wrong doers they are the oppressors not you you're following allah's law do you want me to tell me that it's allowed to break allah's law to please them no it's not if your father comes and says stand on one leg for one hour i said why father he says because i said so simon says you're not obliged to obey him sit down he said you're disobeying me you're not asking me to do something that's beneficial for you nor something that's logical why would i obey you if your father says give me all of your savings in the bank how much do you have i said i have 100 000 euros give it all to me why father because i said i saw i will not give him one real one penny one euro if he's in need really in need i will give him some but i will not harm myself just to please him so you have to put this in perspective they want you to do haram wedding i'm not coming it's my wedding either we do it my way or the highway and this would go very easily especially when you have a good woman who thinks like you and sees eye to eye over these things allah knows best work the last question how to deal with how how to deal with liberal muslims who support haram they are sinners and they are one of two either they are misguided but they're good people or they are full-fledged hypocrites that want to disseminate islam to destroy it and to attack it if they are ignorant good people we have to give them dawah we have to be patient tolerant why we have to teach them or we have to treat them like a doctor treating a patient so no matter what offensive things they say or bad way they deal with us we treat them as they're sick and we want the good for them unlike the hit full-fledged hypocrites enemies of islam people who want to destroy and harm islam and the muslims these are our enemies how to deal with them boycott them ignore them like roaches like flies when they come to speak to you and try to put their whispers and venom in your system ignore them don't pay attention to them so that they don't come over and or even if they were relatives boycott them because they're enemies of islam these people you have to focus and invest your time and wealth and knowledge to try to pull them back to islam we have finished the questions the eight questions or the seven questions actually um so i think yes i think i will conclude this uh this lecture yes for your time it was a nice lecture and a beautiful reminder and alhamdulillah i hope we can see you and next time insha allah and i will thank you for your time i will thank the moderators for their efforts and i will i want to thank the listeners for their uh for uh yani to benefit from from your uh from your lecture and um i think it was it for having me and i pray for all the brothers and sisters in holland and sorry the netherlands has the change i have always know it as holland but they decided to change the name so so i pray for them that they remain steadfast on islam i pray to them that allah saves them and keep them in good health security and to be able to spread islam not only by rhetoric but by their moral conduct by their by their good behavior by excelling in their studies and in their jobs and not living on the benefits of the state like a lot of unfortunately people do i pray that allah azzawajal would make holland a good place to live in and that i will be visiting again soon foreign"
