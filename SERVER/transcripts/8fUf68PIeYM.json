  "transcript": "this depends if the environment is of people who live in the west and it is next to impossible for them to have the Friday off and unfortunately they cannot come except at 12:00 and some shift can come at 1:30 and the other can come at 3:00 just before ass in this case I believe that it is permissible for them to offer the Friday uh prayers if you are talking about J uh prayer it is permissible for them to do it in this way because of the necessity of their lifestyle and the environment they live in but if it's their own choice no this is not permissible and I'm talking about uh um Western countries or non-muslim countries where Friday is a working day and they're not allowed to leave except for 1 hour and sometimes they don't allow them all to go at the same time so this is inshallah permissible on Allah"
