  "title": "Sinful for wasting water if we keep tap or shower on & wait for hot water to come? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "farook's question from Qatar says that you know we're we're in January now and it is cold so when we turn on the hot water tap usually takes five minutes maybe five minutes is a lot but assuming it takes five minutes or so before the actual hot water reaches us so the amount of water wasted down the drain wouldn't that be extravagance the answer is no there's nothing wrong in that because you're not doing it to waste water rather to reach the the time or uh the thing the substance that you are entitled to reach which is which is hot water what other peoples do I've seen this in some homes they bring a bucket and they fill the bucket with the cold water until the hot water arrives this bucket they use it to flush the toilet with so it's a fully win-win concept of course a lot of the people would be lazy would maybe hesitate doing it if what would people say who cares you're doing this to save water in order to please Allah azzawajal because there's nothing wrong in having a bucket in your toilet filling it up with cold water and leaving it once you use the toilet uh you can flush whatever is there with that water alhamdulillah"
