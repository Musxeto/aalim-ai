  "title": "Must we say our dua verbally for it to be answered? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "basically my question is if you for you have to verbally say what you want you have to verbally say what you want or you mean your lips are sealed and you just say it and visualize it in your head I mean like you have to like yeah verbally say like exactly what you want yes you do it is not sufficient for you to just verbalize it in your head lots of the people and I've said this before lots of the people say their AAR with their lips sealed maybe recite the Quran or do their Salat with their lips sealed they do their Ru and sujud and recitation of the Quran without moving their lips or their tongue thinking that this is valid and the sad thing is that this is invalid their prayer is invalid and this is why we Allah knows what goes into our minds this is correct but it is needed for you to move and articulate the words with your tongue and move your lips as if you're saying it silently not necessarily loudly but without moving your lips and your tongue it's like visualizing or fantasising something Haram would Allah hold you accountable for that the answer is no Allah has forgiven my umah for for my sake for whatever crosses their mind as long as they don't speak about it nor act upon it so alhamdulillah Allah has pardoned us from such intrusive thoughts but similarly if you recite the Quran do make Dua without verbalizing it without moving your lips and tongue it is not going to be counted and I hope this answers your question"
