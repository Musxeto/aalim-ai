  "title": "Praying in a Thobe or Abaya without wearing pants or underwear underneath - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Anwar says if a woman is wearing a sari or a man wearing a long G in this case is it mandatory to wear underwear when praying what counts in prayer is what appears from you so what I'm wearing underneath my clothes this doesn't impact the validity of my prayer as long as my clothes are not see-through so whether you're wearing a dress you're wearing abaya and you're not wearing anything underneath or someone's wearing trousers and is not wearing in underwears underneath or wearing something that is like a lung ghee or something there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah and the prayer is valid"
