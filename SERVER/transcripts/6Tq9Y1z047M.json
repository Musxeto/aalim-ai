  "transcript": "sister Raja from Saudi she stated that she's a new rivert and the school that she teaches makes it um mandatory to cover her face to wear the nikab and she says that she's not very easy with this well this is something depending on your conviction I believe that it is mandatory and we had a debate in UK few weeks ago with one of the scholars there uh whether it's mandatory or not and it's it's found on uh YouTube and also in uh uh various places it may benefit you I believe it's mandatory so you have to do it but if you don't don't believe in it then once you go to the school and come out from the school you have to be wearing the nikab because this is what you're getting your salary from and this is what you have signed your contract over if you want to go to the souk if you want to go somewhere else I would advise you to wear the nikab but if you don't want to do this this has nothing to do with your work it has to do with Allah"
