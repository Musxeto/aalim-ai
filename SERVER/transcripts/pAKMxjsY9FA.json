  "title": "Girl on menses does suhoor, pretends to fast cuz she's shy of dad, brother - sinful? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "asks and she says if a girl is on her period and she wakes up for sahur and eats up with her father and brothers and pretend to fast in front of them is this okay first of all what is prohibited for a woman on her menses is too fast and to pray and this is the consensus of all muslims anyone that comes and says otherwise risks getting out of the fold of islam so this means that the actual ibadah the actual fasting is prohibited upon a woman on her menses but if she pretends by not lying simply she doesn't eat she joins them for father she joins them for sahur and she does not say i'm fasting when they don't eat during the daytime she's with them doesn't eat is she sinful not at all there is nothing wrong in that especially if she's driven by bashfulness and shyness a lot of girls don't feel easy going around telling people i'm not fasting because this or that so is she to be blamed no there's no blame none whatsoever however the blame is if she is asking she is yes i'm fasting or she refrains from eating even when she's alone because she feels that it's best i don't eat or drink i have to do this i have to do that this is totally prohibited so if what prevents her from doing that is being shy and bashful and at the same time she is not lying she doesn't say i am fasting then there is no problem in that insha allahu azam"
