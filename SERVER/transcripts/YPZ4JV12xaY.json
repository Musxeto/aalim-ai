  "title": "Why do we say Assalamu alaikum (plural) & nt Assalamu alayka to an individual #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question my question was that that when we meet a single person singular person then we say himam alayum then why it Isam allum because we are saying to a singular person why we don't say because there are angels in the room present and there might be Jin who are Muslims present so and we may respect that individual so I don't address a father or a uh uh a prime minister or a king by saying hey dude what's cooking I do respect him by making it plural this is known in Arabic but beside the point even if he's younger than you you sayam alaykum because there are angels uh present as well and you intend that uh for everyone present"
