  "transcript": "foreign in mecca has given him the protection needed and he warned the dignitaries and the pagans of mecca not to get close to the prophet after almost 12 years of spreading the word of allah azzawajal one would say why were there no miracles to the prophet salallahu sallam to prove to the people that he is the messenger of allah and to comfort him to give him the strong belief that he was on the right track the answer to that is very simple moses may allah be peace and blessing be upon him was given the stick and that stick turned into a big snake that ate all the magic snakes the magical snakes of the sorcerers of his time so he came to them with a miracle suitable for their time at the time of jesus christ peace and blessing be upon him people were known to be perfect and excellent in meditating medicine so he came to them curing the leopard the deaf and the blind which was something out of this or out of that world at the time when our prophet sallam came he came with one great miracle that no one could reject which was the holy quran the arabs were people of poetry and eloquent in their words they were articulate and they used to pay a lot of attention to what they say and write so when the quran came they were astonished they could not do anything against this quran nevertheless the prophet saw was given a lot of miracles for example the splitting of the moon where the pagans looked at the two splits of the moon with a mountain in in between and after it came back again they said well muhammad ali is a sorcerer he made us see things that were not real he was given so many miracles but after 11 or 12 years it was time for one of the greatest miracles of all and what that was the event of al-israe and israel is the journey from mecca to jerusalem to and is the resurrection is the journey from there to the seventh heavens of allah azzawajal this miraculous journey what is known as the night journey took place in a few hours a journey that takes a month on camelback to jerusalem and another month to come back again was made in less than three or four hours this journey had the intention of relieving the prophet salallahu from his worries comforting him and to tell him and show him the great wonders of allah azzawajal so it was from allah subhanahu wa for the prophet salallahu to see and believe with his own eyes we are told that the archangel gabriel came to the house of the prophet or came to him while he was lying down in the masjid of the kaaba and he performed another surgery he cut his chest and got his heart out and washed it in a golden plate with zamzam water and then filled it again his heart with wisdom and faith and put his heart back again and sue it as it was as we know the prophet sallallahu assalam had the surgery twice in his lifetime once when he was five years old when he was actually sad in in the wilderness and the second one just before he did this miraculous night journey and scholars say that this operation was made again because he was about to see things that no other man can bear humans could not tolerate such a journey and that it was why he had to have this uh operation gabriel had a beast with him that was not as big as a horse and not as small as a mule it was in between and it was called al-buraq it had a name and this barak this animal traveled faster than light because he used to put his front leg wherever his sight ended so imagine how quick that would be and in no time they reached jerusalem and the prophet sallam went in there and he met all the prophets and messengers of allah who were at that time and one would argue and say we know that the prophets and messengers are dead so how can he see them well this is part of the miracle they are dead in their graves yet their souls are in paradise so this life which is called al-barzach which is between our life and the day of judgment the hereafter this life al-barzah has strange characteristics that are not similar to any of the two other lives in the sense that when people die their bodies are dead and the punishment or the reward is inflicted on their souls with some contact to the body that is dead in this life the punishment and the reward is inflicted on the body with some attachment to the soul and and on the hereafter on the day of judgment in paradise are in hell the punishment is completely inflicted on the body and soul as the reward is also inflicted on the body and soul together so the prophet salallahu saw the messengers of allah and he led them in prayer in jerusalem in al masjid al-aqsa and a messenger as we know is a sacred mosque it's one of the three sacred mosques that we are allowed to travel to and travel to meaning in the form of worship and the other two mosques are madina the the most the holy mosque in in mecca which is and the holy mosque in medina which is al-masjid and naval these these three mosques are the only mosque in the world that we are allowed to pack our bags and travel to pray in with the with with the intention of worship we are told the prophet sallam tells us that the man that built this holy mosque in jerusalem was solomon the prophet of allah sulaiman and when he when he built this uh mosque he asked allah for two things or actually he asked allah for three things but allah awarded him two uh which were he asked allah azzawajal that at the end of the things that he asked he asked allah azza that no one leaves his house to pray in the holy mosque of jerusalem allah will reward him that all his sins will be forgiven so the prophet sallam tells us that i hope that this has been answered by allah azza which means that we are asked and requested and instructed when we can to go and pray in masjid al-aqsa liberated from the jews who are taking taking it over and controlling it after the prophet salallahu sallam prayed and led the prayer in baton in jerusalem and of course before we continue this is an issue of dispute among scholars the majority say that the journey started from mecca there was a stop in jerusalem and then he was resurrected to the seventh heavens now this was the majority of scholars other scholars say such as kefir it was not this way it was the other way around he was resurrected to the seven heavens and that is why whenever he was met by a messenger he would be introduced to him and afterwards he went to jerusalem where he met the messengers and led the prayer and then came back to makkah and this sounds more logical nevertheless we will go through what the majority say and say that he first went to jerusalem what was the point of the prophet sallam going to jerusalem why jerusalem in particular simply because it is the place of most religions so most prophets and messengers of sons of israel were from jerusalem and most of their life they used to go there and this is where uh moses peace be a peace and blessing be upon him also was instructed to go there when his people refused and they were lost in desert for 40 years so that is why it was significant uh for the prophet sallam to go to the birthplace of most of the prophets we have a short break so uh stay tuned inshaallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hooder.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you just before the break we were talking about the night journey of israel and and and the prophet salallahu salaam and they reached jerusalem where the prophet sallallahu met the messengers of allah he led them in prayer and then started his night journey to the heavens one may use his logic but this is not acceptable one would say how is it that the prophet sallam chest was split into two his heart came out and he was aware of what's going on he didn't die there was there were no anesthetics or or whatever how could this happen twice to him without him being dead well this is something of allah's creations and in so many cases you cannot apply the logic and the modern technologies and sciences to what allah wants subhanallah there are so many times that we hear that people died for 12 hours and came back from the dead they were resurrected no but medicine cannot explain this here it's the archangel gabriel it's the allah's instructions to do this and it's been done so what what's strong in that there's nothing logical in that in the sense that you may not apply your human logic to it you have to believe that this is taking place because allah wants it to be there also how can a man travel from one place to the other in less than an hour from mecca to jerusalem well a hundred years ago if someone would say that we will be able to travel from london to new york in less than four hours they would have thought that he was crazy with the concords now now they're banned but before that it used to take four hours and who knows maybe it would take less than that in the future if they go out of space and come back again maybe it would take one hour only for them to do such a long journey we are not applying modern science and technology to this night journey because this was a miracle the prophet sallam was transformed there on albrecht this this uh beast and from there he was resurrected he took the night journey to the heavens and what we know at the moment is only the first level of the heavens and we are told that there are seven levels in one hadith we're told that between one level and the other is a journey of 500 years so you can imagine the the the distance and you can imagine how long would it take for a rider to ride for 500 years so long million kilometer trillion kilometer it you cannot count this so this what we see the space travel the astronauts spaceships all of what they can see and the probes trying to locate other planets in our solar system all of this is considered to be one level this is dunya and if you imagine the magnitude of this problem or of this creation of allah azzawajal you know how great allah is and how small you are and this can be imagined if you look at where we're sitting at the moment here what is the ratio between our size and the size of the studio one two ten for example okay what happens if i get in a helicopter and i go a little bit like a hundred meters above the ground i will see the whole area and if i go a thousand meter above the ground i will see the city and then i'll see the country and then i will see the continent and then i will see the world the whole earth and where am i there i cannot see me and i can see i can't see anyone else and imagine that this is only one planet in a number of planets in the solar system and the closest planet from us is about two years travel and the furthest is about god knows how long maybe 100 or 150 years of travel who knows and this is only one solar system and we're told that in our galaxy there are millions of similar solar systems and we are told that there are hundreds of thousands of different galaxies and in all of this where do i stand um my newt person we are told in the quran that the people did not give allah azzawajal his jew they did not give him his right where all the earth and the skies are at the palm of his hand the almighty so what is this once you realize your size once you realize your reality and this gives you a clear idea about the greatness of allah the creator of all of this universe the night journey started and the prophet sallam was headed to the heavens he was met at first by the first heavens dunya and it had a gate so gabriel knocked on the gate and this is a real gate it's not something fictional but we cannot see such things so the angels inside said who was it so he said it is the archangel angel gabriel and muhammad sallallahu alaihi so they asked him was he commissioned was he sent to his people he said yes so they greeted him and they allowed him in and the first thing he saw was a man a tall man with a beautiful face with people on his right and children and children on his left whenever he looked to his right he smiled whenever he looked to his left he had a grin on on his face so and a frown so he he asked uh gabriel who is this man so he told him that this is adam and those children on his right are his offsprings going to paradise and the children on his left are the offsprings going to hell and he met adam who greeted him and saluted him and uh told him good things then they went to the second heavens and there the prophet sallam again they knocked the door the gate and he was admitted in he met jesus christ and his cousin john the baptist there and they're all prophets and they greeted him and they saluted him and from there the prophet sallam went on to the third heavens and there he was met by joseph youssef and remember that when the prophet saw sallam was asked who is the most honorable and noble of all mankind he said joseph the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham and they're all prophets of allah azzawajal and when they went to the 4th heaven they were met by idris and when they went went to the fifth the prophet sallam met aaron harun the brother of moses and when he went to the sixth he was met by moses and we he went to the seventh he was met by abraham and abraham had his back to a structure to a building that was similar to the kaaba and it is called al-bait al-mamur the house that was filled with good things and he had his back to it albeit in the prophet sallam told us that it's a structure that angels perform something similar to hajj to it and every single day 70 000 angels enter it and then they leave it without coming to it back again until the day of judgment so you can just do the calculations and try to estimate how many angels are there if since the beginning of time 70 000 goes in and never comes back to it again so in one in 10 days you have 700 000 and 100 days you have 7 million and on and on and on again this was albeit through the process the prophet saws met the messengers and then he was allowed to go to the top level of paradise where it was close to our creator allah azzawajal and he saw wonders he saw things that were undescribable and allah azzawajal talked to him and we were told about the things that took place and allah subhanahu ta'ala revealed to him and told him that he had made 50 prayers obligatory upon him the prophet salallahu so wonders in that night journey he came back to us telling us about few of the things that he has seen he has seen hell and paradise he has seen malik the angel responsible for uh uh hell and he saw one the angel responsible for paradise malik never smiled and if you look in his face it is hell radhwan was the angel of paradise where whomever saw him was happy and so on the prophet sallam saw a lot of things unfortunately this brings us to the end of today's program but insha allah next time we will be able to go into more detail details about his night journey journey and until then allah"
