  "title": "Permission for Wazifa, Manzil? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Miller says I read many blogs and articles where people asked for permission from some mallanna to do any wazifa test B etc I really don't understand this why do we need to take permission from someone to do a la snicker this seems absurd to me I believe there's no such thing in Sunna where someone has to take permission to do any was Aoife please clarify this first of all the word wazifa ravi fuh is not founded in the quran and the sunnah this is something that people made up especially those in the subcontinent they've innovated it and also the word Manasa where people think that for every specific thing I need there is a certain drug or a certain verse of the Quran I should repeat like 25 times or a certain name of Allah Azza WA JAL so if I want to get married if I want my child to make it up in school if I want to pay off my debt if I want to do everything has a specific thing and usually those maulana make a lot of money out of it so many times I get these evil thoughts that I'm in the wrong business these guys just sit there relax take off their shoes put their hairs down probably and they give such wazifa and they charge money for it this is Haram this is eating people's wealth unlawfully but these ignorant fuel the fire they come to Mawlana my wife my daughter is not married for the past five years give me a believer so they write something to them and say repeat this 25 times after every Salah or read this a hundred and fifteen times before Fajr and after Witter etc all of these are innovations baseless has nothing to do with Islam it has to do with their corrupt ideology it has to do with ponzi schemes and making money out of the poor and the ignorant so you do not need to have permission from any mallanna from any scholar from any shape to make Vicar however you need to be careful that you do not innovate so I read the door oh it's nice I'm gonna say it okay you have to ask is this authentic did the Prophet say today's salat WA Salam can I say it this number of times fixed times at specific times or specific locations or not you have to ask not for the permission but rather to know the authenticity of what you're going to say and repeat because worshiping Allah Azza WA JAL has to follow certain guidelines mother Aisha said may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said whoever innovates in our religion was not part of it it is rejected so you have to first of all scrutinize whatever you had found whether it is according to the Sunnah or is an innovation that Allah would reject and not accept from you but you don't seek permission my permission - can I say this go ahead no do this do that no you just ask for the authenticity and Allah knows best"
