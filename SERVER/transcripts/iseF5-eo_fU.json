  "transcript": "they're doing something that is wrong so how can we Rectify this first of all there are things that are not within your ability so if a child of yours wants to sin and he is like in his 20s what can you do about this this is something that is out of your ability to change now we're talking about children who are seven or eight years of age you can force them you can reprimand them you have different ways to rectify this so if they are using their laptops or pdas to watch something that is Haram listen to something that is Haram you can take it away from them and advise them but when they are re when they reach a certain age and you find that they're doing a number of sins that you have no control to stopping them first of all you cannot Aid them you cannot help them second of all you have to block all the means that may assist them so if you give them pocket money and you know that they buy with this pocket money cigarettes stop your pocket money give them food give them shelter give them clothing but don't give them pocket money so that they would not use it in Haram or buying drugs or uh uh fornicating or going to nightclubs Etc if you give them a car TI the car away off them and and so on so you have to improvise seeking Allah's guidance all the time uh Consulting those around you to give you proper advice and help um evaluating the pros and the cons so sometimes if I take a particular measurement to uh uh evaluate something it may lead to dire consequences so I have to weigh the pros and cons and a Knows Best"
