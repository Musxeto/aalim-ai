  "transcript": "so I'm confused about Layman reading the Quran I haven't studied Hadith Sciences though I know Arabic I know that when I don't understand something I should ask a sheh now my problem is when I think I understand an Ayah but I do not for example in the Ayah I thought it meant that all Quran recited during the time of f has an degree of witnessing but I was wrong and it's only the Quran reciting during the prayer I'm not too worried about being misguided like by the Quran like the were because I don't think I would go to that extreme because I don't completely reject the Sunnah I just lack knowledge and there might be a Hadith somewhere that I don't know but it makes my interpretation correct but of course Quran being Divine speech when we read it in its original form it doesn't just go in one year and go up in next but our brains have to interpret it one way or another I'm about interpreting wrong and inventing lies about Allah when we read an Ayah and we think we understand it okay what's what's the question what should I do because very simple it's very simple read the Quran and to the best of your ability whatever you understand Allah will reward you never ever think for a second or a millisecond that Allah is just waiting for you to slip and then throw you into hell this is ridiculous Allah's beautiful names are 99 as mentioned in the Hadith as minimum and it can go up to Allah's knowledge Allah knows how many but this is what we were told and among them is the most forgiving the most merciful the one who guides people to repent the one who accept repentance from them so he's why do you neglect all of these names and insist that whoops he's waiting for me to give me a good whipping no Allah is most merciful so you read his Divine words that he revealed so that you read them and learn from them to the best of your ability you're going to be safe 99% because it is in Arabic and it's very easy to comprehend and learn maybe there is one or two incidents and cases that you misunderstood because there was a different interpretation to it and this is not a big mistake the companions themselves may Allah be pleased with them went to the prophet Alat and said to him that we have transgressed against ourselves and Allah Asel told us that whoever does this will be thrown in hell and a prophet said no this is not how you understood it correctly you understood it you misunderstood it Allah said in is great transgression this is the type of transgression if you fall into you're going to be thrown in hell not any kind of sins or minor or major uh um sins and the likes so even the companions had this understanding and made that mistake but it is Forgiven with the grace of Allah"
