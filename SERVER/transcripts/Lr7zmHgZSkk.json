  "transcript": "foreign there was a picture of like um so-called like God it was for like this um hierarchy we had to know um I crossed out that picture like I colored it in but you can still kind of see the like body so I just like ripped it out and I like ripped it into pieces but um is that like sufficient or some because I feel like after I doubted like maybe there was still some parts showing up his face and everything or like his body I did put some in the bin but like some flew away but I just left it as that so I don't know what I did was simple well there's no sin in what you had done you could have easily uh plastered a tape on it enough story there's nothing much to it you don't have any belief in it you don't have any conviction of it so just hiding it with a a tape or the likes would have done the job without the need of destroying the book and whatever is written behind it that may jeopardize your learning process and Allah Knows Best"
