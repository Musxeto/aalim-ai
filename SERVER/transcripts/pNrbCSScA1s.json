  "transcript": "the second question of rudder user from Ireland is 'what's the ruling on giving zakat to a sister we know that the cat is to be given as in verse 60 surah Tauba chapter 9 - 8 categories in NamUs sadaqa - lil for Cara Wilma snacking so the first two categories the poor and the needy so if your sister is either poor or needy and she does not have any reason to block her from receiving the cat what do you mean share well she's Muslim so she's non-muslims are not eligible to receive the cat and she is not part of your responsibility to provide for how's that if your father is dead if yo and she has no husband or children if she were to die who would inherit her me in this case it is my responsibility to provide for her because when she dies I will inherit her if she had any wealth this means that there is benefit from both sides so I cannot give her from zakat but if she has a son if she dies her son would take everything if she has a living father if she dies her father would take the rest of her wealth after they being distributed to those in need I won't get anything in this case yes I can give her from zakat and Allah knows best"
