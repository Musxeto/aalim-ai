  "transcript": "for as Anne says if a person goes into a contract where there is a late fee for example buying broadband internet they get into a contract that has late fees has the person committed a sin or is it when they get a late fee penalty for delaying the payment is when they are committing a sin first of all late payment fee or penalty is prohibited because it is an interest given in exchange for delaying the payment of a loan I'll give you an example I am a tenant in a building every month I have to pay a thousand euros for the coming month if I were to be late so I postponed the payment of tonight of this month's rent by a month or two and there is a clause in the contract that states that I have to pay 200 euros as a penalty for such a delay this is RIBA this is different than a penalty given to a construction company for example for delaying delivery meaning I give my money to a contractor to build me a house and in the contract it states that for such money that I'm giving him in advance he must deliver by the 1st of January 2020 first of January comes and the house is not finished there is a clause that every month he's delaying the delivery he must pay or I must deduct from the final payment XYZ and this amount is as a company datian for his delay now he agreed upon this in the beginning I agreed upon it in the beginning before signing the contract and this is saving my right to get my product on time as he committed to the time schedule this is permissible as long as the penalty is reasonable so if the whole project is a million euro and I request every month that he gives me two hundred thousand euros in five months time he will have zero no this is not fair it has to be something realistic with the delay so a penalty of five thousand to ten thousand euros a month is logical so these are two cases late fee penalty and then these penalty on constructions there's a third and it's not a penalty per se but rather it's a cost of a service for example I have a mobile phone and at the end of my month I have to pay for the previous month so so this is postpaid there is another service which is prepaid which you pay in the beginning of the month you have XYZ amount of minutes now if I consume my minutes before the month is over so I have like five days left the company offers me because now I cannot make any phone calls it's cut I cannot dial so the company says listen you have five days that you don't have any balance in I will sell you talk time or air time XYZ minutes but for a price that is higher than usual so instead of paying 1 euro for 10 minutes we will charge you 1.5 euros for 10 minutes and we will sell you 15 minutes 100 minutes and you agree upon that and they will charge you for it next month this is this Hallett totally Holland why isn't this considered to be late payment penalties there's no penalty they are selling you minutes so I have minutes I have a pen I can sell it to you now for $100 and I can sell it for someone else for a hundred and twenty dollars both of them are paying cash no one has the right to say why are you selling him cheaper than me why are you selling me twenty dollars more than him this is my pen I can sell it this is my company this is my my air time this is different than lending someone so the payment of the rent is due today but because you are unable to pay it I'm gonna increase 20% over it because of the delay in payment this becomes totally Haram and Reba and I hope this makes it clear for all of you"
