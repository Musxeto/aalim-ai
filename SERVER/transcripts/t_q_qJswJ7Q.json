  "transcript": "saying from bangladesh says uh if i'm praying and i finished my prayer and i did my afghar and i want to pray the voluntary prayer next to my right and left there are two people praying so i can't move right and left and i can't cross their borders or barriers when they're praying which is a little bit difficult because if you go to the following row you can walk in front of them but even though if let's assume that you can't go forward to uh um change your place going one step forward or one step backward does the job this is uh changing your location so you don't have to go right and left you can go also front and back"
