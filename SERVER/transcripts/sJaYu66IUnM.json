  "transcript": "muhammad he has whispers that there is maddy being discharged and these whispers are what shaytaan works hard to influence us by what does that mean it's not certain and there is a real legal maxim in islam one of the five important legal maxims in islam that states certinity is not affected by doubt this is pure why i'm certain it's pure maybe there is some stain of urine on it maybe is doubtful take it and throw it in the dustpan people think that for example i prayed after i finished it i got a thought that maybe i passed wind during prayer maybe is doubtful throw it in the dustbin but it's a it's a strong feeling sheikh it's not satinity so your prayer is still valid iman and kufur i'm a believer he's a believer she's a believer i cannot take someone out of the fold of islam without certainty maybe they have corrupt maybe they think bad of allah maybe they said something that could have taken them out of the fold of islam maybe perhaps i feel i think all of these are phrases of doubt throw them in the dustbin because your certainty of being a muslim cannot be simply crossed out as a non-muslim for something that is doubtful likewise i have a feeling that i emitted medi prosthetic fluid are you sure no no it's just a feeling if it's just the feeling and it so happened that you checked number of times and could not find anything then this is from shaytan whenever you get the feeling ignore it and pray so should i check every time before going to prayer the answer is no you only check when you go to answer the call of nature so he prayed before praying maghrib he went and checked and he found traces of mehdi you are valid move on why sheikh because you don't know when it was emitted it might have been emitted since fajr and it might have been emitted just before you checked few minutes yeah but i had a feeling the feeling does not count again because this opens the ocd uh uh gates for shaytan to mess up with your head"
