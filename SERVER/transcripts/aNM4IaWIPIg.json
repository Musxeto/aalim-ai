  "transcript": "so if I were to miss an emphatic we know that there are 12 rakas during the day and night if you manage to offer them regularly Allah will build you a house in Jannah what are these rakas two before Father prayer of Fajr four before the two after the after Maghrib and after Asia these are 12 emphatic the prophet never left them Allah when he was in Medina he used to skip all of them with the exception of the turakas before Fajr whenever he traveled So when you say to me that whenever I travel shall I make them up the answer is no because the Sunnah is not to be made up what about if I miss them whether I was lazy whether I had a meeting I forgot them there's no problem in making them up inshallah if you had the legitimate reason and if you did not have a legitimate reason the reward won't be the same but again still you can make them up insha Allah"
