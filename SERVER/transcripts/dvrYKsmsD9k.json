  "transcript": "uh she I I have a question that is a little bit long on explain it to me uh so the question is recently on internet I have seen a lot of reals about how the Western media perceives the marriage of AA and Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and as an Indian who lives in Hindu Community a lot of my friends and my family who are non Muslim had this question why is this marriage uh okay for you guys so is there any rational way to explain uh non-muslims and uh my friends and my family about it no no there is no reason to explain this to anyone because is so pathetic and so stupid of them to come and ask about this specific incident when they themselves worship cows mice private organs and 65,000 Gods this is illogical to come and point fingers when your house is not made of even glass rather it's made of spider web you don't throw stones at people point one point two all of Islam with its hundreds of thousands of topics and issues this is the only thing that you dislike about it well this is this makes it the perfect religion if you ignore the issues of monotheism ofed of prayers fasting zakat transactions the legal system the Shar system every perfect aspect of Islam and you turn a blind eye to all of this no no no no no I just want to focus on how did Muhammad marry a 9-year-old girl this is the only thing you found about Islam that is negative then this is a medal of honor thirdly can I ask a question how Dida feel about marrying Muhammad Alat wasam how did her parents feel how did the Neighbors the families the loved ones they say they were all happy so excuse me if the part is involved are happy and satisfied what's your problem oh we have Geneva convention where is your Geneva Convention when 40,000 individuals are killed and slaughtered and named in Gazza where is it you've left all of this and you come to the marriage of our Noble Prophet Alam to someone who is madly in love with him her parents are fine with it everybody's fine with it let this slide from all the centuries ago it's been 1500 years almost that this marriage took place when did the issue of him marrying a 9-year-old surfaced the first 100 years the second hundred years the first thousand it only surfaced like 100 years ago maximum 200 years ago what about the 1300 years ago where nobody ever said a single word why well the Jews didn't comment when he got married the Christians didn't comment the Hypocrites didn't comment the Persians the byzantian nobody said anything because that was the norm everybody did it and it was so normal that till recently the the age of consent is 10 in so many countries the age of consent of a girl is 10 tilted till today there are countries that it's 10 it's 11 even in France I think it is 13 years last month they've announced it so excuse me what's happening so at the end of the day dogs bark it would never ever stop the clouds from moving why should you pay attention unless you are a full-fledged hypocrite who doesn't like the religion yourself and that's why it's coinciding with the doubts in your head and I hope AA that you're not like this a proud Muslim doesn't care about about these ignorant imbeciles who worship private parts they have temples worshiping private parts they they worship mice they worship cows they do heinous things and claim that they are their gods they have the audacity to let them till recently 40 50 years ago they used to burn the wife with her deceased husband he's a she's a property of his and they used to throw them in the river you can see their Corp against her will of course she they're burning her cremating her against her will what what do you have to say about this oh no no hush we don't want to say anything this is hate speech excuse me but we they should get a life"
