  "transcript": "foreign countries in the laws and regulations are opposite to the Islamic rulings for example in marriage the law of a cafe country does not require the Valley of the Bride for the marriage to take place so my question is if a if a kafir husband decides to write a will or overseer for his reward wife what is the Islamic way of writing is it written on a piece of white paper and signed in front of witnesses yeah Salman are both of them kaffir one of the five kids reward and the husband is coffee the wife is a reward so they can't be in marriage together they have to separate if they separate and the cafe husband wants to allocate some of his property to his ex-wife which is not his wife anymore this is considered as a gift he can only allocate less than one-third of his wealth entire wealth he can write it on a piece of paper he can go and write it with a lawyer whatever sells whatever can be applied because his family would immediately jump the gun after his death and claim that this is not valid so he has to uh authenticate it with a lawyer in a legal fashion so that it would not be contested in Allah Knows Best"
