  "transcript": "it says Allah says in the Quran women of purity are for men of purity and men of purity are for women of purity I want to know that in this ayah what kind of purity Allah said about does it refer to physical purity I mean physical pure virgin girls will get physically pure virgin boy from marriage I mean those who are not physically involved in Haram relationships like Xena etc first of all this ayah is mentioned in surah and new alpha be fair to leave hobby FINA what - a little heavy that what I bottle it by a be not Penelope EBIT and those who interpreted these ayahs like if you go for the book of Zaid in Mesilla by even josie or if you go to the facility or you go to isolate the face here for chef Nissa Allah may Allah have mercy on their souls all of them another toughest here it clearly states that this is not what so many people think that evil men are for evil women now this ayah came in the context of the issue of slandering mother aisha and we know that certain or in the beginning it spoke to us about those who slandered mother aisha and some of them were among the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam it was spearheaded by Abdullah new baby salud the head of the hypocrites and those with him but they were so careful not to be coated so that they would not be flogged so they were discreet they would talk discreetly in secret but slander mother Aisha three of the Companions fell in this major sin Haman I beat Josh who is the cousin of the Prophet also Salam and the sister of law the sister-in-law of the profit her sister is Zeynep and the enemy is the mother of the believers has Santa bin thabit who was also the poet of the Prophet Alice a lot o sanam and master even musta is the cousin the maternal cousin of Abu Bakr and they fell in descent and they were flogged and Allah forgave them now having said that when you come to the ayah some people think that it refers to evil men must marry evil women and good men must marry good women but this is not the interpretation the scholars say the interpretation is good words good statesmen statements come out of good men and about good men and evil words and statements also come out of evil men and they can tarnish good people with it and so on the good people with it so it refers to the actions that are evil coming out of evil people and to the statements of slandering which is evil coming out of evil evil people while good people only say good statements and do good acts another interpretation is that a good person a righteous person must not marry an evil person he must marry a good righteous person this is the default not that if something happened it means that this person is evil and this person because he married an evil person no this is what is supposed to take place so this is an instruction and in this ayah some of the Salaf accused the Rafaela and condemned them to be disbelievers why because he said Allah says in the Quran app I Ebola to pee but that good people are associated and will be married to good women and Ayesha is a good woman by default and was wedded to the prophet alayhi salatu salam who is good so anyone of the raf allah who comes and slanders mother aisha and accuses her of zina of adultery he is stating that the Quran is either not telling the truth or that the Prophet Allah - Salam is evil audhu billah because if mother aisha is an adulteress and she's married to the prophetess and this means that he is also evil audhu billah min al shaytan al rajim enhance from this ayah they concluded that those who slander mother aisha is out of the fold of Islam and this is true there is no doubt in that any person who claims that la ilaha illallah muhammad rasool allah yet he accuses mother aisha whom allah azza wajal has proven her innocence in the quran which we recite till the day of judgment yet he insists in defiance and comes and says no she's an adulteress and she is an evil person this is definitely not a Muslim and cannot be a muslim [Music]"
