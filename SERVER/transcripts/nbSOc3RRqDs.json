  "transcript": "I want to ask you I was uh raised by my mother and lately my mother is sick because she's uh she's getting old and I'm really afraid if I'm going to lose her uh please uh give me so thanks to first of all Renee life and death are things that each and every living creature on earth must go through and this is inevitable you tell me how many around us have lived for more than a 100 years the average of the Muslim umah is between 60 and 70 the prophet says Alam and seldomly you will find someone going over 70 and you notice this and you see this the more they get older the weaker and fragile they are and it breaks our hearts when we see them in such a deteriorating State remembering that 20 years ago they were fit and strong and they cleaned the house and they cooked and they did all the chice on their own and probably they went to the farm and to the market and did 20 hours work a day and now they barely can go to the toilet wash themselves clean themselves they can barely eat they used to eat this much now they eat this little this is life so we love them we care for them and we wish but we know that this wish is not possible we wish that they could live forever but they can't so we have to believe in the predestiny in the Divine decree that Allah placed a date of birth and a date of death for each and every one of us not a single minute it can be earlier or later it has to be on that precise second that Allah pre-ordained it when we believe in this we're saddened we are depressed but it's inevitable we have to accept it as Muslims so when you have this at the back of your mind and you feel content with whatever Allah chooses knowing that there is no possible way that they will remain healthy and they will live forever this teaches you how to stand in the face of shaitan and defeat him and say to him I will not accept these negative thoughts that you're giving me instead of being worried depressed and sad I will utilize every single remaining moment in my mother's life to be next to her and to do whatever I can to help her to be dutiful to obey her and when Allah's judgment comes I have nothing to do except to submit my will to Allah and to accept it and to say this is life we are not here to stay we are in a transitional period we are here to do our time and then go inshallah to to Paradise for eternity and you if you do well you will be joined with your mom and your loved ones in Paradise so stay strong hold on and and inshallah things will be to the best"
