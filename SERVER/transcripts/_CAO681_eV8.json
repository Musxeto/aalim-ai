  "transcript": "from tanzania says uh in a long question she has an oral test to to test her english level so either as ils or the toefl or whatever test she has to undergo um she has to undergo in order to obtain a student visa and she she justifies that if she stays back in tanzania her father would opt and choose to get student loans which is interest-based so instead she wants to go with her uncle abroad to live and study and maybe work and i i'm telling and she's her question was the interviewer for this or the examiner for this oral test might be a man so is it permissible number one if there is seclusion you and him in a room that is closed this is haram number two if there's no seclusion or if she's a woman like you but in order for you to do all of this so that you can go to a kafir country study in a mixed university work in a mixed environment in this kafir country to support yourself all of these things are haram they all go against islam so what to do sheikh whoever said that you have to do your university degree or that it is a prerequisite for entering jannah as long as you know how to pray fast you know the basics of your religion you read the quran al hamdulillah if you have a high school degree what what else do you want for a woman that's more than enough because you don't have to earn and put food on the table you're not the bread winner it's the man's job to do all of this your job in islam is to be a good wife a good mother a good daughter a good sister and take care of the community which men cannot take care of this is the role as designed by allah azzawajal yes a woman can work but this is not her prime objective or a priority in her life and this is why we see a lot of error and deficiency in the systems of many muslim countries so stay back home stay with your parents do your degree online don't take any students loans and prevent yourself from falling into fitnah and temptation when you go abroad like this"
