  "transcript": "uh so she in one day I was late for us prayer in the congregation and uh we formed the second congregation but what happened is at the last raaka I actually kind of forgot that um how many frustrations I did but when I rose up from uh suud and I heard some people reading the atat and thought if I were to do one and I raise my fingers like the Sunnah they would correct me and I continued praying and I uh like finish the prayer and nobody said anything so was that the right thing to do or should I have frustrated one more you were praying in congregation you were praying with the congre I was leading the prayer no no I was leading the prayer and nobody said Subhan Allah to correct you no so you acted upon the uh um feeling that you had not done any mistake and hence you should have done prostration of forgetfulness after the sujud if you had real out whether you did one or two and you acted upon the certainity of people not correcting you so this doubt should have been rectified by suud just because you did not know what to do again and you did not offer it your prayer is valid in inshallah"
