  "transcript": "and my question is regarding about making Dua after every F prayer in congregation at the Masid and if this is B what should I do behind the IM okay Ahmed Ahmed H have you ever encountered a single Hadith where the Prophet Alat after congregational prayer he would go and make Dua in the companion Sayan aan yes or no no then it's a clear crystal clear B but the people in the subcontinent unfortunately the Deviant sects here and there they hold on they clinch to it so that they make sure that their followers would not go and follow the Quran and the Sunnah they want to milk them they want to have authority over them this is why they prohibit and forbid people to do so what to do as a Muslim when I go to such a Masjid as long as the Imam is not known to do shik he does not believe that the prophet Alat wasam sees the universe and he controls it as if it's in the palm of his hand and he's H nazer as long as he's Muslim he doesn't have any shik doesn't believe in soothsayers doesn't write amulets and sell it to people doesn't believe that we can call the dead or should call Malana jilani Tani Al badawi and the likes or Hussein he doesn't do any sh you can pray behind him the moment they start to do this congregational whether it's in whether it is in uh Syria whether it's in Jordan whether it's in Egypt whether in Pakistan whether it's in India you just stand up and leave your prayer is valid alhamdulillah and Allah Knows Best"
