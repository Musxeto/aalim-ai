  "transcript": "rahman al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen o sallallaho seldom americana a BD he wore a salir de mean nabina muhammad anwar adding he was happy he marine am Bardot assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 163 of the book of room that will a cam is hadith of samara even agenda may allah be pleased with him he says that I prayed behind the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam over a woman who had died in the state of delivery and the prophet alayhi salatu salam stood up to say prayer in front of the middle part of her body the significance of this hadith is that we learn from it the sunnah where to stand when we pray over a dead woman and of course this is only for the Imam because the congregation they cannot all pray at the same position and the Sunnah tells us that when you pray as an imam and the deceased is a man you pray next to his head so the head will be here i'll be standing and the rest of the body is likewise but if i'm praying over a woman then i should do as the Prophet did not in salatu salam and that is to stand next to her waist why some scholars said that this is so that I would be covering her body with mine so that the people would not look at her but this is not yani so strong and we only follow the Sunnah without looking for any justifications or any reasons because this is the reality of submission you follow without asking any questions as long as the hadith is authentic and this is what the Prophet did ra salatu salam it would not add any value to me to know why he did this maybe maybe it would make me feel better but as stated before it is very dangerous to go and looking for a justification for every single thing because I may succeed in finding a justification for eighty percent ninety percent or maybe ninety five percent the remaining five percent that are authentic and part of the Dean and I fail to find justification for them Shaitaan will come and make me reject them as it happened with a lot of the people what about if they are men and women how do I offer funeral prayer should I offer one for each or combine all of them in one prayer we should combine all of them in one prayer and how would they be it would be the man first and the women afterwards so the Imam would stand we put all the men between him and the Qibla and after that we put the bodies of the women now it goes without saying that when you pray funeral prayer you should have sincerity and you should try your best to make as much as da as possible because this is what funeral prayer for this is what it is for for what for supplicating and asking a lot forgiveness for the deceased because you would be interceding you'd be asking allah to accept your intercession so you have to as much as possible offer a lot of du'a for him as much as a time allows you to do this hadith number 164 Mohammed Amin Abu Musa rod Allen said that the messenger of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam has no concern with that woman who wills loudly shaves her hair and tears her garment in grief the second hadith as well narrated by Abdullah read Allah and the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said he who slaps his cheeks tears his clothes and follows the way and tradition of the days of ignorance is not one of us now these two hadith the prophet alayhi salatu salam in the first had it says I have no concern one would find it difficult to translate the word Barry because in Arabic Betty means innocent and the Prophet says I am innocent from those who do these things but this is not the accurate translation and I have no concern also this is not quite strong enough so how do we translate it to anybody means that I have nothing to do with those who do this so as if I'm disowning them and this is the actual thing the Prophet is this owning those who do these things what are they well those who wail loudly or shave their hair and tear their garment so is crying permissible for the deceased over the disease or not crying is permissible did the Prophet cry at a histological Salaam yes he did and he told a grandma now for side of nematic that is sad whenever your cost may allah be pleased with them when they objected he said that this is mercy from allah so crying by itself is not forbidden what is forbidden is to wail to start and raise your voice claiming that this disease is the only supporter the only provider what will i do i'm at lost without you all of this is forbidden now having said that there is an authentic hadith that the Prophet said that is salatu salam that disease is being tortured by his family's weeping and crying this is an authentic hadith the deceased is being tortured by the wailing well actually not waiting waiting is forbidden by the crying and weeping of his loved ones of his family and this hadith scholars disputed upon to the extent that mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her rejected it and said how can it be when allah azzawajal says well at s0y0 tone with laura that one will not carry the burden of others so if I'm dead and someone cries why would I be tortured with that so scholars had given a number of interpretations among the interpretations was that those who instruct their families to wail and weep upon them after the death they are the one who will be tortured because of this instruction and others say no it is not this it is those who know that his wife and daughters would do this yet he does not command them not to do it he didn't order them he didn't ask them actually to do it but he knows the minute I die they're going to do this in that to start wailing and so he is considered to be tortured and the third opinion which is the most authentic and this is the choice of Sheikh al-islam in tamiya he said being tortured in your grave because of the weeping and crying of your family is not a punishment how is that isn't torturing a part of being punished he said no the other hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam he said travelling is a piece off I've AB is a piece of torment so when I travel is someone punishing me the Prophet said it's a piece of torment of being tortured so when I travel is someone actually doing this to me they said no but it comes as a package when you travel you're homesick you're in a strange country things differ maybe you get the flu because of the change of the climate you have a lot of hardship when traveling all of this goes when you return to your home so likewise when a person dies and his family cries and weeps over him he is tormented why because he loves them not because Allah is punishing him so by this you understand how the scholars interpret and explain the different hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam so we're not talking about just simply crying we're talking about wailing and shouting and making a scene out of it the Prophet says I've got nothing to do with those they do not belong to me and I do not belong to them likewise those who pull their hair or tear their clothes the Prophet says are in salatu salam that also this is not part of me and the Prophet says are a solid wassallam it is part of the traditions and ways of jahiliyyah the pre-islamic era before Islam that they used to slap their faces and this continues until today unfortunately this continues until today among the Muslims worldwide you would not be exaggerating to say that this is human nature that people believe in any sense that is similar to that even men when they grieve some men would bang their head in the in the wall some men would probably break the window or smash the desk out of anger and grief and all of this is a manifestation of the lack of trust in Allah because those who do this are complaining on unless the key what does the believer do when a calamity strikes they say in lilla were in la heroes your own we belong to Allah and to him we shall return so when you say this you feel that the calamity is gone and not only that Allah would reward you immensely but who remembers it this is a problem umm salama may Allah be pleased with her said that when abu salama died i remembered the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam where he said whoever is struck by a calamity and says in la la ooh la la heroes your own allahumma journey female sea bati wolluf knee-high ramina few words we belong to Allah and to him we shall return o Allah reward me in my calamity and substitute me with something better than it umm salama says when abu salim I died my husband I immediately said this drug but then after saying it I said to myself who can be better than a busa lava the companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the brother of the Prophet erase a lot was salaam and after her waiting period was over the Prophet proposed to her in marriage and she became the prophets wife and the mother of the believers and then she said now I know imagine this belief you say this when someone bangs your car you say this when something happens at work you say this when you lose something but you say it with belief and you see it immediately Allah will reward you better than it because if you don't say it immediately if you do like so many people do they wail they shout the bank had their heads in the wall they complain and after one week they say hamdillah we're patient and tolerant in accepting a las too late that's why the Prophet item once passed by a woman wailing at the grave of her son her child the prophet said eraser al salam o woman be patient and anticipate the reward from allah and fear Allah what did the woman say this is what we'll find in sha Allah after the break so stick assalamu alaikum and welcome back in the authentic hadith the prophet is Aram passed by a woman wailing at the grave of her son who just died so the Prophet said yeah i'm at a la it tequila ha wat sÃª be Oh servant of Allah fear Allah and anticipate for the reward look at these beautiful words the woman unable to recognize the Prophet said go away you have not been struck by the calamity that I have so the Prophet did not say any word and left after he left the companion said to her are you crazy you know who that was that's a prophet alayhi al-salam so the woman immediately ran until she entered the house of the Prophet Elisha lobster and he did not have any Guardsmen and she said o prophet of Allah I am patient and I am anticipating for the reward a profit analysis on that verily patience is at the first shock meaning that it is too late the first shock when it hit you you should have been patient but after complaining or wailing or doing something that shows that you're not accepting a las decree this is too late therefore we should always ask Allah social for forgiveness and not to bestow upon us his trials and his calamities but when it takes place when it happens we should immediately say this great duong and the Prophet says a lot salaam that the those who do not follow the ways and traditions of the days of ignorance of jelly such as what women usually say when they wail what do they say they say oh my senate meeting the one who was supporting me yes anna d they say or they say that who will be there for us and they start to complain verbally and they voice their complaints as form of grief and this is what the prophet salallahu REO seldom said that is part of the wailing and part of the traditions and customs of the pre-islamic era and he has nothing to do with that and all of this indicates that the people have lesser degree of dependence on Allah if you recall when one of the prophets daughters are a salatu salam requested his presence because her son is dying what did the prophet that is still of solemn sake he told The Messenger go back to her and tell her it is for Allah what he has given and it is for Allah what he has taken so this child in your hand is not yours it's actually a las so this is what every believer should have in his mind whatever we have is not ours it is something that we borrowed so if Allah claims it it is Allah whether it's a soul whether it is wealth whether it is anything that we have this is not yours all that we have is borrowed money we are on earth on borrowed time because we are not here to stay forever we're not here to go on this is only a transitional period for us and that is why you find that a lot of the people not the Muslims only you have a lot of the people in non-muslim countries committing suicide why because they do not accept our laws rulings they cannot comprehend how could the loved one die how could I lose my fortune now with the credit crunch the cases of suicide are overwhelming their houses are foreclosure they lose their mortgage they lose their jobs what to do ladies you're singing that's it they think that this is the easiest thing as Muslims we know that there is much much worse to come which is the torment of the grave then on the day of judgment being thrown into hell and that is why no matter what happens to you you try your best to anticipate for the reward and to be patient the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam in one of the battles there was a man so brave so strong he was killing the disbelievers left and right and center and the companions were shocked and saying ma sha Allah this man no one has done similar to what he had done the Prophet looked at him and said he's in hell and the companion said what if this man is in hell then what about us one of them said I am the one who will be with him as his shadow and I'll tell you exactly what happens so the battle continued and the fighting in the man is watching when he was injured and he was injured seriously so the companion is telling us and he could not tolerate the pain so he put the tip of his short on his chest and he put the other end on the ground and he stepped on it until it went through his back so he committed suicide so the man went to the Prophet Elisha salam and said ashhadu an la illaha illallah whatcha do that you are the prophet of allah so the prophesied so what why is that why are you saying that he said o prophet the man who said that he's in hell he did so and so and so and so so this shows you that and the Prophet said that he's in hell because he committed suicide and whoever commits suicide goes to hell there is no excuse for you to commit suicide no excuse at all from this we know that those who go and say that we are free fighters and we would like to blow ourselves as suicide bombers is this permissible in Islam the answer is no this is considered to be suicide just shared what I'm killing a lot of enemy soldiers said no you are killing yourself and chef Ben bass chef monogamy shaker albani all say that this is suicide because on the day of judgment who killed you oh god I killed so and soaked again who killed you the bomb who didn't ated it I did say then you are the one who killed yourself and you go to help regardless of your good intention and so many people with good intention they go and kill themselves and nobody dies so they again are sinful this is not permissible in Islam and it's needless to say that the majority of those who commit suicide bombers they kill innocent people so they go to a supermarket and some of them goes to masjid or a place of worship even if they are deviant sex you're not allowed to do this and they kill the children they kill the women they kill the elderly discriminate killing and all of this is in hell whoever does this is not part of the way of the prophet alayhi salatu salam regardless of what he thinks or what he believes therefore one should avoid suicide one should avoid wailing and complaining of calamities by having full trust confidence and Lions on Alonzo Asian a lot of our illnesses is due to not having dependence and confidence in a large origin you have people believing that they are or they're having black magic evil eye in vain they have gin why is this they come to me chair give us rakia recite Quran why don't you ask a lot imagine oh I have sins no ask Allah depend on Allah rely on him and he will be there for you and he will answer you but when you don't rely on him and you rely on the ship or no Mawlana or on the saint or on this or that then how do you want him to help you and kill you whoever associates others with Allah Allah would leave him and whatever he had associated with allah azzawajal this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
