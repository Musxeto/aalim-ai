  "title": "Is imitating the kafirs / disbelievers kufr? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I I've been like suffering like with like repeating my sh so it's just these two things so my first thing is is imitating is itur and also um basically I do like a lot of things like I play when I'm playing soccer like as a goalkeeper I kind of predict where the soccer Ball's going to go so um I was wondering could you give me like a general ruling on what counts of for telling and what like is it permissible to like act on things that you think will happen in the future first of all Islam is certainty so anyone ask asking you are you a Muslim you would say definitely so do you have any doubts nope I'm definitely a Muslim so this is certainity and the rule is certainity is not affected by doubt now whenever you get intrusive thoughts saying that oh this is shik this is kufur you committed shik or kuur we say do you have proof do you have certainty that you did so if the answer is no then you just grab it and toss it in the trash can because doubtful things do not have an impact on certainty so thinking that I did this then I'm a cafir no imitating the kufar depends on what you're imitating in them if you imitate the kufar in going to churches in going to temples in worshiping their idols in sharing their rituals and their beliefs such imitation is kufur no doubt but if someone is imitating the kar in their customs in their Traditions someone is celebrating Christmas this is for the Christians yeah I know but it's fun or celebrating the New Year's Eve again why are you doing it well I could Pi a girl or two it's fun it's lots of booze and having fun and listening to music and this is Haram a major sin but it's not kufur there's no conviction related to it so I hope this answers your question and Allah knows uh best"
