a way of life away of knives assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato all praise belongs to allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode well we are going to be discussing funerals the jenna is joining us to discuss this topic we have our D issue we have chef Adam L hakin from Saudi Arabia CHEO Muhammad Ershad II from Canada and chef Salem Al Omari from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us now we know that death is a part of life this is a reality that really nobody denies and if you were to ask mankind about most matters they would very rarely agree but one matter on which all of mankind agrees is we are going to die because this is undeniable we see it you just go to the graveyard you see all of those who came before us have left and as Allah says every soul is going to taste death so this is a reality that first of all we can't escape so that means we must be ready for this and if all of us are going to die all of our family members our friends and this is the reality not that we want to focus too much on the depressing side of it we need to be sure that we're ready so we hope insha'Allah that in this series we're going to be able to prepare everybody for this inevitable journey back to Allah now before we even mention death we have what leads to death which of course is sickness being unhealthy all of these things and sometimes it might not even be sickness sometimes it might be sudden that Death Comes or growing old or growing old yeah however we're going to look at the case of we're going to have like a planned death we assume that somebody is very unwell and they're going towards death so I'm going to start with you share a sim before a person even dies if we see that death seems to be coming close what are the things that we begin to do as a Muslim to help this person I guess there's not a planned death we're not planning to die or it's a setup and then the person dies right what up line connecting me like somebody's like terminally ill yeah we're assuming that death could be around the corner for any of us of course yeah so how do we begin signs of death are more apparent in a person and it's coming closer and closer yeah you can start checking moment no no rather pass the ball so if we could assume that somebody seems like they're very close to death maybe terminally ill how do we prepare them as a Muslim sure bismillah my recommendation and and of course this is for everybody but they should prepare and close their accounts basically so what I mean by that is if you are going to travel from one city to another city or from one country to another country you start you know selling this and closing up these deals and closing shops and all of these things start closing if this person is about to die and it's like leading to the death you want to look at his account so for example how is this financial situation and part of the repentance and preparing to go to the hereafter is getting his financial affairs if he has any debts pay off the debts if you know a lot Qatar laughs there was some hot Amin there the repentance to it and so on and so forth how is that person with their family members maybe they have some relatives that they haven't been speaking to and they've committed Haram all these years it's time now that the person repents and and they should have repented from before but now that you know the issues become very grave and serious and so on like each aspect of their life they fix their accounts and basically it's like a suitcase that they say you know I'm going in hereafter and I was once actually with a person who was I'm in the hospital about to die and I sat with his family members and I actually almost like an accountant we went through this person's deeds and we said let's check this one off check this one off do Toba for this one this one and then I got to some points where I said we can't do anything about this and he'll have to go to the hereafter with this one and it shocked me like maybe if he was alive maybe if he was younger we could have done something about this but at this point this one's going in a suitcase what are these types of things not specifically for that case but what are the types of things that because we the hamdullah we're healthy we're young what are the things that we can prepare for now so that we can not get in that trap where you know we can't fix it later on yeah you know two things that I find that you can get really stuck on number one and I actually mentioned them was finances imagine if somebody has a hundred thousand dollars in Reba debts you can't pay it off and neither can the children pay it off and this person may be the credit cards or something's gonna default so he's going in the hereafter with the Reba debt right or family members what if they've cut some people off those people have died or you can't get in contact with them or something like that and many years have passed and they've been committing Haram so fixing a person's financial situation fixing a person's relationship with their family members and so on a not cutting somebody off for more than three days now you mentioned that twice in here and I'm going to ask you chef Shannon when we talk about debt sometimes we take debt very easily we think I was just a little bit of debt however we know Islamically that debt is a very very big thing now our last you shall tell him about the importance of making sure that we avoid debts and the reason why we want to avoid them come to La Salette to set up a little suit in their early he or solid area Medina I'm about before we talk about the debt and clearing the debts that's going to come in the sequence inshallah it is part of a large mercy and the sign of a large mercy that you find a Muslim most of the Muslims they fall sick before they die because a loss of hunt Allah wants to cleanse their sins wash away their sins and Allah subhana WA Ta'ala who is the most kind most merciful when he loves someone he puts him through the tests and the tila so much so as the Prophet Allah Allah mentioned that he would be walking on earth without a sin without a sin so this is Rama actually the person falls sick so that all his sins are washed away so when his soul is taken because the state in sha allah where loves place to the general this is a chance actually and death as we mentioned in the beginning it is inevitable it's coming it's coming it's the truth that no one can deny and what is death a human being mainly the two components that constitute this body and this what we see this frame the physical part which is the body and the soul the soul which is a secret no one knows about it life is the combination of the two so when this soul leaves the body that is death so it's not the clinical death it's not the death of the brain it is when the soul leaves the body that is the real death now this death which Allah ordained upon every human being was going to taste it should be always there in our minds those who are living because remembering the death motivates you towards righteousness prevents you from falling into sinfulness helps you to concentrate in your players so always keep death in your mind as one of the Salaf said if I forget death just for a short period of time my heart changes becomes hard so always keep this in mind as the prof salah salem said at zero that's zero i mean dick we had demon like that always remember this destroyer of all desires this Savera and cutter of our desires death so when your nafs incites you to do something wrong something to displease allah remember death what if I die now I don't want to meet Allah in this situation I don't want to meet him sinning in this situation and subhanAllah many people Allah terminated and the the life in situations displease a lot many and on the other side many people umv them you wish that I was that person a person died in the Rada he can see in the YouTube and then a CD never we many in their suits many reading the Quran these are masha'Allah this is the death that one wish to have so the death my dear brothers and sister should be always there because many people and you remind them and about the mouth the death change the subject see this is childish behavior this is a reality you're going to face we are going to spoil our mood yeah but this is a reality we don't remind each other about this we don't remind each other about our preparation for this visitor that's around the corner and it's the Shaitaan that makes us procrastinate I'm still young and shall after this I will but if you go to the graveyard and see the graves how old was he infant five years ten years twenty years thirty years different so death comes without a prior notice yes Allah gives a sign to prepare ourselves like this you see the gray hair ah oh yeah a community here the Warner has already arrived so get ready nice O'Connell initial on this note we're going to go to a very short break so we'll be back continuing this very good topic so dear viewers to stay tuned insha'Allah we'll be back after a very short moments assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome back to yours we're here without the issue of discussing the topic of funerals and deaths now before the break Jeff Salem may Allah reward him was reminding us about the reality of death how to prepare for death all of these matters you know we can't avoid this you can run as far as you like but the inevitability is that death is going to catch every single one of us now we were getting from what chef Mohammed Meah lord have mentioned about the things that we tried to do before death how to prepare ourselves some of which are repentance for our sins of course which would probably be the most important but then we also have some matters and as I mentioned one of them was the debt and I'll ask you should ask him about this we always find debt is coming up debt is an important thing about death why is there such an importance placed upon debt I mean if you were to ask a non-believer he would say death frees him from debts now he doesn't have to worry about these things whereas for the believer you find that it's not the case it seems like it's a heavy burden could you explain to us exactly wine smell don't handle now sort of slowly like I'm a bad - the reason is that the Prophet told the soul Allah who are you and he was telling them that Allah forgives all the sins of a martyr who dies in the cause of allah azza wajal with the exception of debt and this highlights the danger of that that a lot of the Muslims are falling into if you go to any Muslim family you'll find that their houses and mortgage they buy their car by lease to own or leasing wise you find that they're paying their kids tuition in installments it's all debt they rely on credit and I'm not going to go into Haram credit which is the vast majority borrow in interest which is RIBA I'm talking about the normal debt this normal debt is something that the prophet alayhi Salam warned us from and there are even greater dance when you actually take something from a Muslim and deny it so this is not only a debt this is that and cheating and depriving someone from his own rights there are debts that you have to pay to your wife when you marry and the dowry you don't give it in full some of them just give half of it and the rest of that they say inshallah they will pay it and some of the wives did not receive a penny from her dowry it's with the husband and the husband says what does she need of it and this is a debt that is extremely dangerous in Islam and we are recommended not to borrow as much as possible of course sometimes you have to but it's different than when you are in a necessity rather than when it is just something to show off with I know a lot of families who borrow just to go for a week or two for vacation and come back and the man works the whole year to pay off that debt of course this is not what is intended however I beg to differ with Sheikh Mohammed in the sense that at the time of dying or when you're sick you start to clear your debts and clear your finances and to do things so that you prepare your suitcase this is not the case and we know that 99.9% of the Muslims will not be able to do this because they've lived their entire lives on sinning on taking people's money so when you train a person when you condition a person to do something and at the end of his life you say okay now it's time for you to quit it's not gonna be possible it's like someone who's an addict you can't just overnight say quit kick the habit this is not gonna happen that is why Islam focuses on a person striving doing his best to live as a Muslim there will be shortcomings and these shortcomings come and go but at the end of the day when you want to believe yourselves from these shortcomings it will be easy unlike a person who is so indulged in these not shortcomings in these sense it would be crazy to ask him to come out of them because it's not gonna happen but of course there is always hope in a larger so we try our best to ask the person who's dying as much as possible to try and relieve these sins give the things that he has transgressed back to their lawful owners but this is our role yet what is his role what is the individual who's dying role in this Shack Sally mentioned about death and its inevitability what I would like to ask them to join me there is the issue of sudden death now death can come in two ways gradually and with warnings and it also can come in as a sudden death let them comment and then I shall I'll grab the bull back again just as well because you've mentioned this and I suppose a balance between what chef Mohammed had mentioned which is ideal being able to prepare for this death or as you've mentioned the fact that a person really their whole life is a preparation for this and we know that the Prophet peace be upon him people would ask him when will the hour be and he would say to them what have you prepared for it and this is not a dying man this is you know a healthy person healthy man saying what have you prepared so the reality is no matter who we are stick dying young old we all get to prepare now in the sooner the better you know something came to my mind that I hadn't realized when you said that how some people other than Muslims that death for them is a ring of they think they're debt-free now that they're dead it reminded me actually about those stories you hear of the Great Depression where people became so or stock market crashes they become so intense that they commit suicide and then I thought you know like you don't really understand based on what you said now I understand that they're almost like is if they're freeing themselves by killing themselves but a Muslim would say no this is gonna be a double punishment then not only are they gonna pay for their debts but also the suicide is Haram as well so a Muslim the prophesize em say you can't escape debt by dying that's something very amazing that you know like for me I just like it just hit me a Muslim can escape debt by dying that they're actually going to be accounted in the hereafter for the death drops I sound like it's an encouragement to take care of one's debts before they and this shows the I suppose the respect that Islam gives to the right of others if we owe money I mean we can't you know buck this we can't hide from it we have to give these rights whether it's a worker as when or the Prophet peace be upon him said pay him his wages before his sweat dries then imagine the one who says it's no problem give it a month two months and then if you die you have this debt upon your shoulders so this is an important thing that when we face the grave we don't want to have the rights of any one resting upon us because we will be held accountable for this now Jefferson was mentioning we have sudden deaths how can we prepare for sudden death is it something that one should be prepared for I mean or do we think you know I'm going to plan I'll be in a hospital I'll have my family around me all making door are you know how do we contemplate having these two scenarios as a Muslim hamdulillah the sudden death actually the prof salah salem told us that it will be the one of the signs of the hour it will be quite rampant towards the end of time yes i was with him just few minutes ago I always tell my brothers you see we are like this light lamp you don't know when it's going to turn off to burn burn finish expired that's why I lost want Allah says Allah to muten a lantern the movie should not die except in the state of Islam what does this IME means be prepared 24 hours all the time around the clock death is there in your mind I might die now and many of us they have this five years planting years planning and they don't know that just few seconds after this you're all finished so always you have to be prepared you have to be in the state of Islam ready many of us they fear death why do we fear death because we are not ready there's nothing me rahim allah said before he died said the son of the seventy who was 70 years old is longing to meet his long longing aspiring yearning to meet his Lord practicing what practicing Muslim but if you shave Imam so my dear brothers and sisters Shaitaan is playing with our minds is fooling us and he's going to forsake us on the Day of Resurrection and he will rebuke us and he will address all his followers you fools why did you follow me I had no power over you what McInally aleikum o some tiny landau to convince the ship to come on that's what I will do this Shaitaan was fooling you he's going to tell you I wash my hands of you blame yourself did you see me no I just called you guys and you followed me when your Lord your Creator won't you openly in the Book of Allah against me but you followed me so this sudden death subhanAllah imagine you are a sinner and you die finished too late only will pray for you and ask Allah subhana Allah so keeping in mind that I might die now and this is I'm talking to all the Muslims and the young ones who are indulged in Haram keep this in mind do you want to die while you are browsing the net watching pornography keep this in mind what if I die now you want to be resurrected like that or you are flirting where you are going with a woman you want to die while you have that so that's why I lost fantasy palatable to NYLO and to Muslim ooh not die except in the state of this submissiveness which means you are prepared and this what the difference between us and the forefathers who preceded us death is always there as sofyan even Saudi rahamallah or ignore IANA when he was breathing his last said he said and one of the son of they mention in his biography they said if the hour is tomorrow it cannot do any more because he's worried during his most there's nothing he can add there's nothing you cannot I saw panel on may Allah allow all of us to prepare for death as best as we can make Allah reward you are the issue for contributing to this episode and may Allah also reward you our dear viewers we hope insha'Allah that you've benefited from this program and we hope as well that you'll follow us in our coming episodes until then I greet you all assalamu aleikum o rahmatullahi wa barakatuh"
