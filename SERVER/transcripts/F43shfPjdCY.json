  "transcript": "ald I believe we have Hadith number 13 with us the Hadith of Abu may Allah be pleased with him so who will read it for us yes brother narrated Abu alansari the prophet may the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him said while defecating neither face nor turn your back to the kah but face either East or West Abu a added when we arrived in sham we came across some labories facing the therefore we turned ourselves while using them and ask for Allah's forgiveness okay thisi of Abu may Allah be pleased with him and we know how important Abu a is to us what is he well known for yes he was the host of The Prophet Alam when he first migrated from meccah to Medina and the prophet stayed there for maybe a month or two Allah knows how long and we know also that he is among the companions who were buried in Turkey costantin as he surrounded it with the Muslim Army though he was blind and though he he was over his 80s he could not fight blind and and and and so old but he wanted to give moral support to the Muslims by being with them so that he would enlarge the Army and this is a great thing that Muslims should always put in mind when you are with the non-muslims you're making their group bigger so if there are 10 non-muslims and two Muslims with them anyone who looks he would say that there are 12 so you're giving them value you're adding value to them we should not do this you should always commit yourself and be among the Muslims as a whole group and that is why one of the of Sal the prayer of is that the prophet used to go from one way and come back from a different route callers say why one of the justifications and this will come inah later on they say that this is so that the prophet would give Salam to as many as possible around the Medina and others said no this was to impress the Hypocrites and the disbelievers whenever they saw so huge people going to the Masjid and those who came back are others not the same faces so they oh these are Muslims they're that big and they're that strong now Abu may Allah be pleased with him is telling us about something that we should do when answering the call of Nature and as reported or stated before in previous programs Islam governs every single thing in our lives not only prayer and fasting and pilgrimage but even how to answer the call of Nature and this is what the Jews found it ridiculous as in sah Muslim they said to Salman Al fari your Prophet taught you everything even how to defecate and he said yes he instructed us not to face or give our backs to the so the Hadith the prophet says whenever you want to answer the call of nature do not face the and do not give your back to it so it's not only while defecating while defecating or urinating you should not give your back or your you should not face the what is the this is of course you're all Muslims but sometimes maybe non-muslims are watching us so so they say what is is the direction that Muslims face when they pray and this direction is mecah and in mecah there is the cubic building which is known as Al so this is our out of respect when people direct to it for prayer the prophet says do not face it or give your backs to it when you're answering the call of nature but Head East or west so here in India should we head east or west north and but the prophet said East and West why because in Medina their was to the south of Medina so the prophet is telling them do not face south or north because this is facing and giving you back but if you apply this literally to people in India it would not be the same because if they face East or West they would be doing what the prophet told them not to do so they have to face North or South understood inshah now Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that when we went to Asam what is Asam it is Syria Palestine Lebanon and Jordan this area is the Blessed area known as aam politically nowadays a sham is only mentioned as Syria politically but regionally or how how it used to be known as this was mentioned about the four countries so he said when we went there we found that they had toilets but their toilets were directing to Al so what did he do he said we turned ourselves while using them and sought Allah's forgiveness so if the toilet was built in the direction of he used to sit doing this so that he would divert himself from facing the and he would also add to that seeking Allah's forgiveness not only he would turn away but he would also ask Allah for forgiveness as he does not know if Allah would forgive or not now the question is what is the ruling on facing theah and giving her back to it is it completely forbidden not recommended one is not recommended one is forbidden both are permissible it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and before we go into that dispute we would like someone of you to read the following Hadith Hadith number 14 narrated Abdullah Bin Omar I went up to the roof of offa's house for some need and I saw Allah's apostal May the blessing of Allah and peace be upon him answering the call of nature facing sham Syria Jordan Palestine Lebanon then he got it as one country with his back towards the kiah okay this Hadith was reported in alkari first of allb Omar the companion of the Prophet Alam went on top of ha's house who was haa the wife of the prophet the mother of the Believers and what is her relation to Abdullah she is his sister he said that I climbed over the roof he had something but accidentally saw the prophet wasam answering the call of nature he wasn't spying because spying on the prophet is an act of blasphemy if a person does this intentionally he would have committed an act of apostasy this is R he has to be executed why did he do this it was unintentional he went up to get something from the roof he went up to pray he went up to sunbathe of course this is hypothetical but yeah he went for any legitimate reason now we have two hadiths Abu tells us the prophet says do not and the prophet here was giving his back that is why Scholars differed as they usually do and that is why we are instructed to go back to the Quran and Sunnah to find out which is the most closest opinion that would please Allah Asel and therefore as we stated before if you recall whenever we have two conflicting evidences what is the first thing we do we try to reconcile and join together if not one abrogates the other if not one is stronger than the other if not we abstain until someone else finds the answer and informs us so we go on to this conflicting issue the prophet says don't do it and then ends up doing it himself what to do Scholars say one of the opinions is always apply what he has said and neglect what he has done why because Sall alai tells us to do something this is part of Islam by not doing it or by doing something else there is a possibility that it is an exception for him a speciality for the prophet so for example we are told wherever you go to sleep and wake up if you want to pray what should you do you have to make Evolution however in theah mother tells us that the prophet Alam went into deep sleep until he snored yeah he was sleep you know the prophet was so tired during the day he only slept an hour or two so when he slept he slept really bad and then he woke up for f and went to pray without W said oh prophet of Allah where are you going I'm going to pray he said yes but you slept until you snort he said I am not like you all of you my eyes sleep but my heart never sleeps meaning that I know if I've nullified my woodo or not so this is what a specialty I don't want someone tomorrow working for f prayer and going to prayer what's this said my heart never sleeps but my ey sleeps a you sleep your heart sleep your kidney sleep everything in you falls into deep sleep even when you're awake we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back asalam alaykum and welcome back going back to our Hadith so there are cases where the Prophet has special features that we cannot share with him another example Allah tells us in the Quran marry two three or four and if you are afraid that you will not be fair or just then only have one this is the instruction of Allah it's permissible for us to marry four a lot of the Muslims now are happy to have only one or actually they are not up to having more than two because survival is more tasty and beautiful than dying or being tortured so they agree on just keeping one no problem the prophet had more than for the prophet died marrying nine at the same time so one would say okay I will do this to no this is a special case for the prophet a privilege from Allah it's not for me and for you and there are so many examples so the scholars say when the prophet tells us to do something and he does something not like it there is a possibility that this is special for him so we always go with what he had said we go with the rhetoric we don't go with the action this one way of doing it however there is another way of looking at it by saying that yes when the prophet says don't do this and he does it this means that it is not forbidden but it is not recommended and they give an example the prophet forbade us from drinking while standing up he said this is not permissible do not drink while standing up and in the bukari in the authentic Hadith the prophet came to zamzam and he drank from it standing up alibu Talib said I don't care whether I drink standing up or sitting down because I've seen the prophet drink standing up so scholar said um what to do the first do not drink standing up they said okay in this case it is not forbidden it is not recommended why how do we know this fundamentals of a rule of Thum whenever there's an instruction or a rule or an order in the Quran or in the sunah this is obligation unless another Hadith or a or something makes it from obligation into must recommended and whenever there is a Prohibition in the Quran or in the Sunnah this is Haram this is prohibited this is forbidden unless another evidence makes it softer and makes it Mak or unrecombined to do the scholars differed over six or seven or even eight opinions regarding facing and giving you back to the while answering the call of Nature and IM in his beautiful book a big book made of four or five volumes it's actually made of nine but when printed two and two and two and two or three makes it four or five volumes alog together he said and he mentioned these different opinions some Scholars said it is completely prohibited to face or to give you back when answering the call of nature period full stop who backs this UPL and a number of Scholars other Scholars say this is the hardest huh other Scholars say no you have to look if it's in the open if it's in a place outside of buildings if it's outdoors then it is prohibited for you to face or to give your back to the but when indoors because you have walls in front of you you would not be actually insulting Thea your because there are walls in front of you this this is okay third some say it is permissible to urinate in a Direction but not to defecate some would say this is dependent of also you can add to that facing the moon or the sun they even added that that is not permissible and some even added the Jerusalem B Al orid all of these are different opinions of Scholars so what is the most authentic opinion the safest is the first one do not face or give your back to the the more realistic and in accordance to the majority of Scholars that as long as you are indoors as long as the toilets in your house it's closed and and surrounded by wall it is okay however it is recommended that you turn away as Abu used to do may Allah be pleased with him but the safest is always not to do it and this is Illustrated when one of you builds a house when you build a house definitely you'll be sinful if you inst instruct the engineer to have it in the face of ah she it's a small toilet I don't have uh much space to maneuver it's your problem it is your house you're building it you have to build it on the Islamic Foundation but if you buy a already made made house if you go to a hotel room if you rented a place and you unable to do this then I hope and pray to Allah that this is okay inshallah now one of the the things that we have to bear in mind do you know that spitting in the direction of the while praying is prohibited you all know this because the Hadith is clear the prophet saw a man leading prayer there are people behind him and while he was leading prayer he spit in the prayer the prophet said this man must never ever lead anyone in prayer why because this is a great sign of disrespect now what you did not know or what you do not know is that there are Scholars that even went an extra mile by saying not only in prayer even if you're not in prayer it is not permissible for you to spit in the direction of why because this shows disrespect and among those who chose this opinion shh Nas Al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul he supports this opinion and he says that it is forbidden he has his evidences and allegation however the majority of Muslims say no it is only limited to prayer nevertheless always it's better to be safe than sorry you don't have any place else to spit except in the direction of you do so out of respect try to avoid doing these awful things and bad things in the direction of so I believe before going to the following Hadith we will take your questions yes brother Shake nowadays most of the time in Salah the mobile Rings you know so and good question most of the time it is film songs and you know so you are praying others are getting distracted so what is recommended mandatory towi I'll tell you first of all when a mobile Rings it is mandatory for you to turn it off yes movement is put your hand turn it off look and unlock the key and turn off the mobile or put it on silent now a lot of the Muslims they hang up and the man PS again and again and again so you end up having him calling you throughout the prayer you you've occupied yourself and everyone in the Masjid what to do if the mobile Rings answer it if the Mobile ring answer it because the person calling you he will hear the Salah he'll know that you're praying so he'll not call again but if you hang up he says maybe he hung up because he doesn't want to talk to me maybe he hung up by mistake maybe he hung up because the network is not working so you answer it first of all second of all he saying that people are putting ringtones and as movies as songs this is Haram in your prayer or outside your prayer it is not permissible at all to put any melody or song as a ringtone one it is not permissible at all to put Quran in your ringtone someone said and he he answers the a is not finished and even worse he would say Allah there's no God and he answers and This is distracting the meaning it is not permissible to have the aan as a ringtone why because aan is a form of worship and Allah made it to call people and to know that this is the time for Salah so if you're playing it at 12:00 in the evening there is no Salah so you're making fun of thean is it permissible to have Dua Allah this is an issue of dispute among Scholars I personally would consider it showing off why are you making the Dua as your ringtone you want to listen to the Dua no I want to people to know that I am a righteous person I'm committed to Islam what's the ruling on having Nashid putting aasi putting B putting Zan Baker or whoever a Nashid is a Nashid it's poetry no doof as long as because there is no do it's okay but again for men maybe it is acceptable it is extremely inappropriate for a woman to carry a mobile and then while in the market while in somewhere you hear this Nashid coming out and everybody's looking at her you try to make a low profile so yes if you get this in prayer you have to turn it off and better more before you go to prayer always try your best to make it on tilet if you have any music related ringtones it is completely prohibited don't be sinful not only that get the sins of those who listen because when I listen to you your mobile ring and it's a song that reminds me of the old good old days oh I think I'm going to download it from the Internet or if it's a new song ah I don't know this song this singer is is very nice voice what what song is it and I download it then you take all the things that I do because of your ringtone I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
