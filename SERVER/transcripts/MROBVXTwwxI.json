  "transcript": "alhamdulillah je my question was if one hears the name of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam while praying what should he or she do should they you know say it should they say the supplication salutation upon the prophet while praying or should they say it after the prayer while praying a person should not offer the salutation upon the prophet wasam when he hears his name name especially when the verse of the Quran for example mentions his name m or when Allah says that he and his angels offer salutation upon the prophet Alam oh you who believe offer salutation upon him we do not offer salutation while listening to the recitation of the Quran because we have to be attentative and it was not reported that the prophet alai wasallam ordered us to do so during Salat yes if you hear his name outside of Salat we offer salutation thousands of times per day sallallahu alaihi wasallam because we love him and we know the great reward that Allah has placed for those who offer salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam however because it was never reported to us that offering salutation upon him sallallahu alaih wasallam when hearing his name during it was never reported that he had ever done such a thing or his companions or the we refrain from doing that and Allah Knows Best"
