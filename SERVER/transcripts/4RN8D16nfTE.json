  "title": "Can men dye their beard with black henna? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "how are you I'm doing great alhamdulillah just I want to ask about henna for beer but black color it's allowed in Islam or not allowed okay first of all using the hen to change the color of the hair where it's white is a Sunnah and it's also permissible to add to it a special herb called a catam which gives it sort of a dark brownish color the prohibition from using the color black was mentioned in other hadiths for example when Allah be pleased with him the father of Abu Bakr was brought to the prophet Islam in all of his hair was white totally White the prophet said Abu Bakr you should have informed me I would have come instead of bringing this elderly man to me I should have honored him and come to him so the prophet accepted his Islam and he said change this white and avoid black so the prophet clearly told us to avoid using the color black so you can use henna that's a Sunnah and you can mix it up with other substances that would change it from being read into dark brown but not black and Allah Knows Best"
