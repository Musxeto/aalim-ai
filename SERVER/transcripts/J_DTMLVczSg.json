  "transcript": "um does a person know whether allah has forgiven him or not unfortunately not imagine if we were to be confident that allah has forgiven us what would that lead to most likely more sins and at the end of the night i ask allah for forgiveness and i know that allah will forgive me then i get a sign that allah has forgiven me i'll go to more sins and more sins but we have to have both fear of allah and hope in what allah has and these have to be balanced if there is too much hope then the bird would be tilted and would crash and if there's so much fear and despair of allah azzawajal the same thing happens so we made a mistake we're sorry we repent we are remorseful and we ask allah for forgiveness we are hopeful that allah will forgive us but we're not certain so it's always balance and this would lead you to jannah insha'allah"
