  "title": "Will I get reward of reciting whole Quran if I recite surah Ikhlas 3 times? Suffice VS Reward Assim",
  "transcript": "shabiha says i'd like to know if i would get the reward of one whole quran if i read three times surah al-ahlas in my salat we know that the hadith of the prophet where he said that equals one-third of the quran so reciting it three times is as if you have read the whole quran the answer is yes but there is a difference between which means the reward and which is mean to suffice so it's one of the pillars of islam to perform hajj once in a lifetime true the prophet said in an authentic hadith he who prays fajr in congregation and remains seated in the masjid making thicker until the sun rises and he prays to raqqa allah will reward him as if he had performed rumrah and hajj complete complete complete so a smart alec comes and says okay pilgrimage is mandatory once in a lifetime and the hadith says if i do this easy task in an hour or so i get the reward of a hajj in addition to umrah so i don't need to do that i don't need to perform hajj i said no you got it all confused there's a difference between al jazeera and and there's a difference between reward and to suffice you so the reward yes you get the reward but it does not suffice from the original task or the original work and you have to do that as mentioned in the quran or as mentioned per the sunnah hope this answers your question"
