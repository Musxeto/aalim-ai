  "transcript": "I'm here I want to ask um from my understanding if you have committed a scene it's best that you go and take Udo and pray to but let's say if a Fu prayer is approaching um do you have to pray separately or you can um you know um ask for forgiveness in the Fue prayer for example if someone committed a sin and then zor is coming so do I have um to pray to first and then zor or or I can just combine thank you first of all you cannot combine this is a given because the two of repentance are separate than the of or or any other and you cannot combine them with f prayers so they have to be separate and it is highly recommended that you pray them as soon as you do your sin and not wait for couple of hours or do it few days later that wouldn't work the moment you repent from that sin you offer them and then you can offer prayers afterwards and Allah Knows Best"
