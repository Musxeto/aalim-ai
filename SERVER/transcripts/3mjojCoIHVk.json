  "transcript": "the prophet said in the authentic Hadith be victorious or help and Aid your brother whether he is the aggressor or the person being oppressed so the companion said oh prophet of Allah giving help to our brothers when they're being oppressed is something we understand but how can we help our brothers if they are the aggressors the prophet told them by preventing them from oppressing people by preventing them from inflicting harm and unjust unjustice and unfairness to others so this is what a Muslim should do you should help your brother whether he is the wrongdoer or the one who's been uh uh wronged and then the prophet said piety righteousness is here and he pointed to his heart three times or pointed to his chest three times and this is an an indication that Allah the almighty looks at our hearts Allah the almighty looks at our souls not at our physiques not at our wealth and clothings and the way we look and that is why as reported or narrated in Muslim the prophet said Allah does not look at your bodies and your colors or how you look and another ation or at your wealth but Allah looks at your hearts and your deeds and that is why we know that one should invest all what he has in purifying his hearts a lot of the Muslims nowadays if you tell them brother fear Allah you're doing a sin you should not do what you're doing he comes to you and says I I am a I'm a great believer of Allah piety is in the heart righteousness is in the heart and he justifies his wrong actions by claiming that his heart is filled with Iman and that he is a True Believer well this is a misconception because the prophet said as we heard in the Hadith the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said that Allah looks at you your heart and your Deeds so if you claim that your heart is pure well your Deeds should prove this your Deeds should be the evidence backing up the claim that your heart is pure and clear and that is why most sinful people do not have piety do not have righteousness in their hearts and a lot of the Muslims unfortunately again have something that corrupts their heart and this is arrogance and this is where people fail to purify their souls fail to be humble as the prophet Alam instructed them to be brothers and Servants of Allah and I believe that we would uh uh conclude this Hadith inshallah next time next SU day when we talk about arrogance and the dangers of it and Allah knows best we should start in with the questions yes the the the one that told you that the nose should touch the ground is mandat he is saying the truth the Hadith of the prophet in the he tells us that I was commanded I was ordered and instructed to prostrate on seven parts of the body the head and he pointed to his forehead and to the nose so this means that it is part of the thing that we should do and Allah Knows Best the second Hadi well this is an issue depending on you and how convenient"
