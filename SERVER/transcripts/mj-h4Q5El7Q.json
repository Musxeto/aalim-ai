  "transcript": "we've noticed that a lot of the locals here only play the F so he asks a very good question he says that is it acceptable to only pray the F and the answer is yes definitely it is this is the bare minimum you know the bedwin who came to the prophet ask him about Islam and the prophet told him to pray five times a day and he said nothing more and the prophet said nothing more except if he would add to volunteer and offer some uh Naf or voluntary prayers the man said by Allah who sent you I will not add anything and I will not uh uh deduct anything I will do exactly as you have stated meaning the five Salas the five uh uh mandatory prayers the prophet said he will enter Jenna if he is truthful this means that this is the bare minimum however I highly appreciate what the people from the subcontinent from India Pakistan Bangladesh they install in the children since a very young age that they must pray the voluntary prayers and I see them in the Masid I see them at the workplaces mashallah they are a sight that gives joy to me and to all Muslims when they we see youngsters observing their Sunnah as they observe the F this is highly recommended and praiseworthy but it is not mandatory so if you would like to encourage your youngsters to pray at the beginning the F so that they would not uh be uh Angry with the way things are happening and maybe neglect it yes no problem but try to encourage it and try to uh um install in them the love of the F and the Sunnah as well and Allah Asel Knows Best"
