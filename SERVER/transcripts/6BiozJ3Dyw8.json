  "title": "Is hating apostasy but not the apostates make me a kafir? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh fedon from turkey he says that if i know apostates and i hate what they say but i don't hate them themselves would that be an act of kufur for not hating the disbelievers this is too technical fedan and as again we're going into details and the devil is in details this individual let's assume his name is ahmed he apostasized and he left islam so now you deal with him in a cordial matter in a friendly way you invite him over and as if nothing had happened of course not now hating his disbelief hating his apostasy would definitely cascade down to hating anything related to this man yes i'm not going to attack him i'm not going to beat him up i'm not going to spit in his face but nobody can say that i have to embrace him and take him in and invite him for the dinner or lunch or have normal relationships with so yes there is some ambiguity if he's an apostate and he says things against islam we have to hate what he says and we have to hate him personally and not have anything to do with him you"
