  "title": "Women covering their hair at home and in front of their mahrams and other women - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sanna asks is it permissible for girls to keep their head uncovered in home this is a common question we get especially from the sub-continent they have this belief that a woman cannot sit in her home without wearing hijab on her head though there's no one inside the home and this is totally baseless not only that they say if the Adhan is being called you have to cover your hair if you want to recite the Quran you have to cover your hair if you want to go to the bathroom to perform Google you have to cover your hair and all of this is nonsense this is baseless any scholar who recommends this and says it's good he is not a scholar he has no knowledge and this is why we do these programs this is why we give lectures this is why we would like to revive Islam truly and purely from the authentic sources from the Quran from the Sunnah according to the understanding of the three favored and blessed generations of all times now if I go to Pakistan if I go to Egypt if I go to Morocco if I go to the u.s. if I go to Indonesia if I go to any Muslim country or see a Muslim community I will find a lot of innovations people worshipping Allah differently to one another is this Islam just why is your Islam better than mine I'm not saying it's better we say that Allah has revealed the Quran in Arabic for the Muslims to read Allah has revealed the Sunna and preserved it for the Muslims through the science of hadith so that it explains the Quran thoroughly without any doubt to people so why are you leaving the whole in the center behind and following Tom Dick and Harry where in the Koran or in the Sunna that a woman is burdened by wearing hijab covering her hair to eat or to recite the Quran or when the Adhan is called this is nonsense where in the Quran it says that she has to cover or wear something on her head in front of her father brother or uncle this has no relation to Islam this is why we urge our brothers and sisters come back to the original Quran and Sunna come back to the original Islam don't go to Tom they can happy don't go to these called scholars who take your money and become rich and all what they know is Simon Says do this and you blindly follow them Islam is a religion of obedience to Allah and to the messenger sallallaahu Selim it's a logical religion not logical without a compliant complying and implementing is Quran and Sunnah know it goes side by side and when there is whatever there is a conflict we go with the Quran and Sunnah but almost 99.9% it's always according to everyone's logic it's a logical religion with the grace of Allah Georgia so this is nonsense do not listen to anyone that tells you as a woman you have to cover your head when the event is being called why show me something from the Quran from the Sunnah or from the companions may allah be pleased with them recommending this and you will not find such a thing"
