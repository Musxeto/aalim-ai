  "title": "Can we use soap, brush our teeth or use miswak in between doing wudu? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Fatima says can we apply soap brush the teeth during ablution we know that ablution has six pillars what are these pillars number one washing the face which includes turning the water in your mouth and sniffing the water up your nostrils and blowing it out number two washing your arms from the beginning of your fingertips till your elbows including your elbows number three wiping over your head which includes also wiping your ears number four washing your feet including the ankles to the ankles number five the sequence the order so face arms head feet you can't switch number six to be simultaneous meaning that you don't leave a gap and the issue of not leaving a gap is relative so usually brushing the teeth or using the miswak according to the scholars is negligible it's it's minute amount of time like 30 seconds or so or maybe a minute but opening the door or answering a phone call or checking if the food is cooked or need to be turned over or not this breaks the simultaneousness of your wudu and hence you have to repeat it from scratch likewise if you for example while washing your arms found out that there's a barrier so you're engaged in scrubbing it and washing it with soap Etc that may take some time but it is for the purpose of voodoo not for something external so this amount is also Exempted and accepted without any problem in Allah Knows Best"
