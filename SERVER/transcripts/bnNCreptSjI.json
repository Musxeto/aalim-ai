  "transcript": "perfect with no pleasure other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of knife Islam is a way of al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen o Sole allah wa sallim ala nabina muhammad all praise is due to Allah we ask Allah to exalt dimension in grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam welcome to this episode in the last episode we discussed innovation and we said that many times people present particular evidences or events that took place before at the time of the Prophet Allah system or shortly after to justify inventing into the Deen up until today it kind of opens the door for anyone says look you know the Deen is flexible the Dean is easy and you know you can get to Allah in many different ways you choose the way that you like you can use this way he can use that way as long as it is a bada it's fine we said that this is not necessarily the correct approach then whenever we say that the issue comes of Omar about the land who bringing the people together behind one imam after they were scattered and then him making a particular remark that is used profusely to prove that this is fine I would like that we address this issue in a way that this evidence can be understood by every viewer to see whether this is a justifiable a statement there's a justify bid our does it not really do so first of all the hadith that we caught it last time where the Prophet said Alice was a mess and asyndeton husana fella who a Jew how add Roman army Rabi ha lay across from dojo to him Eliana p.m. whoever leads people whoever teaches people something that is good in Islam in religion particularly he will get the reward of those who follow him until the day of judgement without deducting any of their good deeds and likewise whoever leads people or teaches people something that is bad he would have the burden and the sense that they have committed without deducting any of their own sins you have to understand the origin of this hadith the hadith is on the side people unfortunately extract what they want without looking at the context for example one says for what you don't live mousseline so if I'm praying someone says woe to those who pray I'll interrupt my prayer no and stop the guys is quoting a verse from the Quran yeah I completed Allah says that occur above salat do not approach prayer okay I'm not gonna pray now complete the eye while you are in the case or in the state of intoxication so this hadith was said when a group of tribesmen from Mooga came with torn clothes and signs of fatigue and hunger appears on them and mother is one of the honorable tribes of Arabia the Prophet is a sons face changed and he went to the pulpit and he encouraged people to donate to give in charity and nobody moved until one of the Ansar one of the Companions went to his house and came with a big sack of food and clothes that barely his hands could carry them and he place it in front of the Prophet or sir the minute the people saw this they immediately went to their houses and brought whatever they can until a big pile was formed in front of the Prophet or Sam and then his face changed and he was happy so seldom as if it was the moon on middle of the lunar month and then he said this hadith so my question is did the man who brought the first sack was he innovating he was actually following the Quran and the Sunnah and that is why the Prophet as I'm said that he taught people something that was in the religion now this is extremely important to understand the context and what the hadith implies so that you can understand what Omar had said and done may Allah be pleased with him could we also add the usage of words you know he didn't say many today I feel Islam that and he said Manson novel Islam is Sunnah a stroke but they the innovators themselves say that okay if I for example throw a mullet and I celebrate the birthday of the prophet on a saucer and I have done something that is a shouldn't as something that is good and they understand this from this aspect they think that whatever you innovate as long as it is not evil to them and evil is quote-unquote they this is OK for them so if you want to go to hadith of Omar may Allah be pleased with him look at the origin at the time of Abu Bakr and at the time of Omar may Allah be pleased with him in the very beginning people during Ramadan used to pray individually or two or three in the Masjid praying taraweeh night prayer but what is the origin of night prayer it was the doing of the Prophet himself relief Sam's which is not be done that sense that is why the Prophet himself prayed three nights or four and the congregation was framed behind him the Companions every night were gaining momentum and and size so the first night second night third night they used to pray behind the prophets and tell away in the Masjid at the fourth night the Prophet did not come out so they started calling him a prophet of Allah we would like to pray and the Prophet justified that by saying I have seen what you have been doing in the previous days or nights had I not feared that allah azzawajal will mandate taraweeh upon you I would have continued but due to my fear that I would burden some of my Ummah one of his compassion to yes so refrained from doing that now after his death Salam AHA Jerusalem there is no way that taraweeh prayer would be mandated or imposed because there is no way there's no revelation so when Omar may Allah be pleased with him the religion is completed then the religion was complete so when Omar may Allah be pleased with him and he's a guided Khalifa he's a guide the Caliph when he saw the people scattered praying on their own he decided to go back to square one which is reviving the of the Prophet himself at a solution and he gathered them to pray behind obey Him in the cab and until we meet daddy so he did this and he said to that when he saw them praying behind one Imam Mehmet will be Totti Tilka referring to what she asylum mentioned in the last episode that the linguistic meaning of that it seems that there are many quotations from the Sahaba believe you mentioned one in the last episode and perhaps if we can add some more where the Sahaba explicitly said and spoke against Buddha the one in the Dean of course I believe it's even miss Ruth who may who might have said you know that the bid are every bit as deviance even if the people shall assume it or presume it to be something good some people would justify what you've said what Homer hottub said ma'am a little bit AHA yeah alright if what you're saying which is the Sunnah of the Prophet Sawa's and if you label it as better so it would be it would be the best better because it's the sender of the prophet sallallaahu cell so I think there is a play with words here for that because the AMA hopup did not do any better here he just followed the Prophet SAW was elected and I think most of the or the main reason that makes people misunderstand this is is how to use this they take the word without a context without knowing the linguistic meaning and they try to interpret it or abuse the meaning of it to the side that they want to support we have this group of individuals individuals who are ignorant or they're not knowledgeable and therefore they think that what they're doing is piercing to Allah however because it falls under badar the scholars say there Nia is valid there will be rewarded for their Nia but the deed itself will be rejected yet we have another category of people perhaps scholars who push these innovations and who propagate them and who call for them what is our stance in regards to these individuals I mean what are they guided are they misguided are they to be followed are they to be obeyed do they hold the same privileges and rights as other scholars do they have a special treatment perhaps that can be touched upon briefly before we take a break regarding the issue of the teller ear that you mentioned he cannot call it be da and in the sense that it is something private because there are we Asuna the props alehsalaam prayed it so this leaves no room for anyone to argue so the only meaning left is the lexical meaning the only meaning left is the lexical meaning not the legislative one correct so walk behind prophet muhammad sallallaahu son what he did you do what he didn't do you abstain from it that's why the ulama they classify the traditions of the Prophet Salla Selim because no one anyone's statement words can be accepted or rejected except the process of myself as Imam Malik said we can't reject what's in Abu Bakr did if it is not aligned with github and Sunna with what feed Norma did while loving and respect weren't live in because they are human beings and they have their own et heart yes okay for example when it comes to tomato we know that the promise of our Selim recommended the tomato but they were not doing that I'm actor whom should be followed return hatch and the hajj and the house of curls sir so you follow the Prophet SAW Allah Allah so their ulema they classified so not every statement if a companion is an authority in itself and should be followed no we will take a break and then you will tell us about the classification insha'Allah after the break the cycle of tyrants or for interrupting Sarah Mary come on it's a lie but I cat Hey Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh as promised before the break you said there's a classification that was made which is necessary in order to remove the doubt can you please shut some light on these classifications yes inshallah so there earlier mother classified the sooner categorized the sooner to four categories suna pelea which means the oral Sunnah the sayings of the prophecy verbal the verbal sooner fairly the actions of the profs wasallam soon a taqueria the approvals of the sanctions of the prosperous Elam and there's a fourth one which many people are not aware of soon Latakia suna tertia which means the things that the problem did not do in spite of the need in spite of the need the need is there and yet he didn't do it for example he made a dam with no the atom for the Salah yes okay to call for prayers but he made some players without Adam eclipsed player whether it is solar or lunar each player with few other so if someone comes now say we will make a Don for the lunar or solar eclipse player or for the eighth player we tell him this is Vida ha innovation there was a need for it he didn't do it it's problem didn't do it subhanAllah so it is a beta in spite of the need revelation was coming down didn't do that that's why so do we understand that something could be a a bada and be good near yet with the good Lea and the act being endorsed originally by Islam still doing it in a particular time or a particular place may still categorize it as innovation if this sooner this act that's why if the propsal asylum didn't do it in spite of the need need was there necessity was there and yet he didn't do it it is without ado did the prophet salah salem do it or didn't he if he did where because someone say it is good after this is hair this is good brother what makes it good number one number two does this good or did this God was the problems less LM know it or didn't he he did second question did he teach it to his companions or didn't he he did where show me please he didn't how did it reach you then who taught it to you something the Prophet didn't teach to anyone it is good and you are saying that we have to do it when the prof salah salem didn't do it sir in order for Allah so Allah to accept your Hamel the ulema they say there are three conditions should be fulfilled number one to him which means worshipping Allah alone without associating any part no Sheik number two sincerity number three Matata which means toted compiles with guitar answer now is there an evidence for that for everyone there is evidence is there one comprehends okay because the Dean from the beginning we mentioned this Dean as Allah said wa ma tacoma rasool ullah who do oh man how come an event oh the cat Canela convey rasool allah is swattin husana so allah has made him the example to follow he warned us in many places Feli a double adeana Ujala funa an MD and receive home fitness abhi mother been eliminate those who might deviate from his path or his way lest catastrophe or calamity befalls them so the Dean is to follow the footsteps of the prophets of Allah Allah so if any of the conditions are not fulfilled then Allah will not accept yes you worshipped Allah but not the way he wanted maybe the last iron suratul calf yeah from Akane or Julie Jarabe very I'm and I'm a nun sorry huh whether you should be rebirth it'll be he I hadda so whoever wishes to meet a large the vigil and to be on the safe yes he should worship allah azza wajal for the I'm ravenous our honey should offer good deeds and a deed is not good and yes it is in compliance with the Sunnah of the Prophet as a son because so many people are doing so many deeds but they're not good and you always find in the Quran Allah Dina I'm gonna I'm gonna study hard those who believe and offer or do righteous deeds so a deed is not accepted in good unless it is on the path of the Prophet Oh sir I am what I you should behave as little beer and then he should not associate any other with Allah and for bailing me out when he was interpreting at a verse of Allah Azza WA JAL Leah blue oh come a you come a tsunami I'm Ella and this translates to Allah Azza WA JAL is testing you to see who is among you is the best indeed fotomat said do you know what the best in deeds is Allah Georgia does not accept a deed unless it is sincere for his sake and it is accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet I saw Sarah now you know the Dean our Dean a few one who goes through the Quran and Sunnah we we see the elements of Turkey banter heap at a rib you know encouragement to do good to follow the Sunnah and yet we have ayat which do tear heaps like a form of frightening or scaring the people against Paula Cohen against the Sunnah and one of these ayat which I hope we can address quickly which falls under heap is Kwame you Chaka Khan Rasool member dmattia Bayon 11 Hooda Huerta Barrera civilian minion new only Himmatwala honestly animus Atmos IRA whosoever opposes and contradicts the messenger after the guidance has become clear follow the path other than that of the believers the Sahaba at that time Allah said we will allow him to travel on that path and we will cast him into the Hellfire and what an evil abode an area which the least we can say is frightening because going against the messenger entails total loss I mean every believer is a Muslim because he wants to enter paradise can be protected from the fire so I've gone against the Sunnah if contradicting the messenger is going to defeat that very purpose so taking a matter of bida lightly becomes a very serious problem and it does seem that in Ouma today there's a lot of laxity regarding this issue so words of wisdom or what what advice can we give to the Muslims in regards to the gravity of the situation so that we can avoid bitter you know totally I believe that those who are watching are not actually analyzing themselves or scrutinizing themselves so there what any a lot of the Muslims would say oh it's nice what you're saying is beautiful it's not addressing us though they might be indulge in up to their necks or to up to their ears in Bidar and this is what astonishes me why do people do better is it logical if I talk to any layman and say okay do you love Buddha do you love to go against the Prophet Isis and what would he say no no okay why are you doing it then so the issue as the Sheikh said earlier it's a problem of knowledge it's deception maybe and the blind following of those who are deviant who live on doing this and controlling people because usually those leaders of deviant sects and groups have the control over their followers over their flock sheep yes so they don't want them to go out and liberate themselves because Islam is it in a religion of Liberty you have no one between you and Allah as ocean so I believe that this is also something to be elaborated on maybe later on I think one of the reasons also an inner reason it's the issue of love or whimsical love that you love somebody to the degree that everything that he does you do forgiving what Islam taught us we love Allah Spano Tyler more than anyone else then we love the Prophet sallallaahu Salam more than we love our parents more than we love our ulemas more than we love our kids more than we love our spouses so this love when it is translated that means that everything that the prophets Allah Allah everything that he did I will do because of my last time that's why loving the prophets Ilan Selim should be translated into action and we need to teach this to our kids when they are young you like it you love the Prophet SAW Selim more than me if you know that the prophets Allah Selim did something and I do something else you have to follow the prophets Allah LM done follow me this is a good way of raising your kids to follow the Sydenham wouldn't be fair to say that whenever a person is ignorant of the Sunnah he is more knowledgeable of the Buddha in the sense that whatever you revise or actually whenever you abandon a Sunnah you're reviving Abaddonn pretty isn't it the statement of one of the righteous predecessors that whoever supports an innovator he has actually helped in the destruction of Islam well I mean the Kulin could talk to him on a la fête de Vionnet of allah comes you know becoming if we're going to acquire a las love by simply following the Prophet re so Salaam then that should be the biggest gift but it seems that it's not really perhaps shortcomings on part of the you know us the people involved in the ayah that these ideas are not really this is desire yes this is frightening ayah so structure stone then this means that if I'd like to test my love if I'd like to prove my love to allah azza wajal this has to be manifested in my actions yeah but I think it's not scary shape I see it from the other way if you do this Allah love you what else do you want so it's something really and yeah what he meant I mean scary in the sense that the love of the Prophet wasallam is conditional it's not a claim we all know that he used to go to Maria and to drink honey as in half so didn't have honey they didn't have honey so they wanted to stop him so they agreed among themselves whenever the Prophet comes to you say Oh foul smell from you and they did and the puffs awesome said no no it's only honey I'm not going to take it again so much so that Allah revealed yeah you only really matter having my halal of temporary I thought that's why you forbid yourself from something halal seeking where that the pleasure of your wives why sure our beloved one is Allah our beloved one is Muhammad Salla license so whatever Allah tells you pleases him ask yourself is this deed pleasing Allah it might seem yes it is pleasing Allah if it is pleasing a lot of the problems were Selim would not have missed so he either have said it if it's from the Sunnah either the Prophet Isis till I'm said something about it or he did it himself or he approved it he's doing it him and he can try it or the fourth one which he may need was there but he didn't do it like for example the tendency to raise the hands and make du'a after every obligatory salat in congregation we know that we don't have an evidence for example that the Prophet as I'm ever led them in a congregational draw after the obligatory Salah so we can safely say leaving that is the Sunnah because the Prophet alleys of Salam could have done so there was a need for it yet it didn't do it yeah this needs to do to be elaborated upon because I have good news for you there there will be a future episode inshallah where we will have the time to elaborate on this because the time for today has ended suzaku Mela care for your valuable input and zakhm Alafia for tuning in we'll catch you in the next episode insha allah wa salaam alaikum wa rahmatullahi Vericut we live"
