  "transcript": "uh so i just have a question about giving saka to someone that i know uh he sells alcohol he has a shop that sells alcohol because um he doesn't have money he's poverty-stricken um i have talked to so many people to talk to him and give him money for my family member or anything like that to advise him not to sell out for her anymore but he's in africa but because you know there's so much you can do to to someone that needs money so can i say giving saka or can i make his contingent upon him stop filling up on giving a lot of money okay first of all selling alcohol or consuming it or buying it or carrying it or making it or whatever all those involved are cursed by allah azzawajal secondly if he has a shop that sells alcohol this means that he's supposed to be self-sufficient if he's not self-sufficient this means that when i give him zakat money most likely he will invest it by buying bottles of whiskey so that he can make profit out of it and by this i would be also sinning so if he is a muslim but a bad evil sinful muslim and i know that he's in need he's poor he's below poverty line and he needs financial assistance yet he's doing sins and most likely he would utilize my money my zakat to enlarge his sins and expand upon it what to do don't give him financial assistance in the form of cash rather tell him i have zakat money i will give it to you in the form that benefits you without giving it to your cash because you said haram what do you want me to do pay your rent pay your electricity bill or buy you food for and provision for your family whatever he chooses you do that with the zakat money and it's a done deal insha'allah you"
