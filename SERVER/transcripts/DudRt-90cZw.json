  "transcript": "and a contradiction with a verse he read from the quran but i don't know which one it was relating to most likely of praising oneself and like liking to be praised with things that they did not do there's no contradiction there's no arrogance there is no boasting about it when a person does a good deed and people praise him for this so if i go for hajj and people say well you are lucky you went for hajj hajj is blessed may allah forgive your sins and i'm happy because of this good deed and of what the people are saying did i do it for the sake of their praise no i did it for the sake of allah so in the companions went to the prophet isam and said to him oh prophet of allah sometimes we do good deeds and people praise us for them the prophet said no worries at all this is an early glad tidings from allah azzawajal so when you do something that is good and you're happy this is quite normal everyone is happy for worshiping allah azzawajal everyone is happy when he concludes his fasting and breaks his fasting the moment he breaks it he's happy because of the good deeds because of allah's forgiveness because of so many factors and likewise when you perform a sin you are saddened by it you feel remorseful and you regret it this is a sign of iman because what pleases allah pleases you what angers allah angers you and there's no boasting about that and allah knows best"
