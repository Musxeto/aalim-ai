  "transcript": "[Music] and welcome to the 13th class of the islamic faith and the last thing we talked about was a description of what iman is because we spoke about the iman and kufur and the things that a person nullifies his islam with and then we went into the chapter that deals that with the fact that iman is a combination it's a cocktail of conviction belief which is of the heart rhetoric the things that we say and actions the things that we do with our limbs and the deeds that we um [Music] perform so now we stopped where the sheikh says faith may increase or decrease and may be removed altogether it is increased by practicing what the religion prescribes and recommends and it it is decreased by committing sin it is not removed that is entirely except by the disbelief and associating partners with allah allah the almighty says true believers are only those whose hearts are filled with awe whenever allah is mentioned and whose faith is strengthened whenever his revelations are recited to them also the believers may grow yet more firm in their faith also allah says it is he who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers so that they may grow more firm in their faith all of these evidences and many more indicate a fact and this is crucial for a person who wants to be part of a sunnah to believe in and this point is as follows when we say iman immediately we think the six pillars of iman to believe in allah to believe in a day of judgment to believe in the angels the messengers the holy scriptures and in the pre-destiny whether good or bad when actually iman is in addition to this classification is also as the prophet said allah composed of 60 plus branches in another narration 70 plus branches the highest is and this is something that is said and believed and the lowest is removing obstacles from or harmful thing from people's path or way and bashfulness shyness is a branch of imam so we have actions removing things we have bashfulness which is something in the heart that cascades on the body and also we have iman as a totality or a description that is opposed to silk or kufa now where did people go wrong to the extent that we have so many sects in islam and cults one major part of them going wrong is when it comes to the definition and understanding of iman what is email muslims let me rephrase that as we've just read faith may increase or decrease so the level of your iman can go up and can go down and the three verses that we have read to you it clearly indicates that this is a fact so that there a man would grow so that their iman would increase and it's there in the quran and there are so many other evidences supporting this now we have two opposing major sects divisions in islam we have al-khawarijj and we have al-murjiya and strangely enough their belief though contradicting 180 degrees to one another yet they meet and agree on one concept regarding the definition of imam and what is that they believe that iman is a package deal either it is there fully or it is not there at all unlike who believe that it can increase and can decrease so the essence of iman is there it can grow to be complete and it can diminish until it is small but still it is there and this is why the sheikh says um in the third line it is not removed iman totally it is not removed when we can say that this individual is not a muslim it is not removed except by disbelief and associating partners with allah and we will come to discuss this issue a while inshaallah coming back to our point and they both believe that a man is a whole this they agree upon but what nullifies it they differ so for example the hawari they say yes iman is a whole if you do one single major sin this is indication that there is no eman in your heart hence you are a kafir and in hell fire for eternity whoa that's frightening so if i lie you're in hell not only that you're a kafir you're a disbeliever i can chop your head off i can take your money what is this if someone drinks intoxicants he's a calf he's in hell forever why it says because iman is a package deal by breaching some of it the whole thing is nullified okay martezilla are a bit like the hawari but they were a little bit more specific they said yes if you commit a major sin if you fornicate if you steal money all of these are major sense then you are stripped of the title believer but we don't say that you're a kafir excuse me how is this possible yeah we say that there is an area in between and kafir this area is for those who commit major sense okay that's nice to know well actually it's not that nice because we believe what that by committing a major sin you will abide in hell fire for eternity whoa so you're like unfortunately as a conclusion yes but no we don't see a kafir yeah but the end result is i'm in hell forever with the cover so what's what's the difference and how dare you say such a thing when allah says in allah does not forgive those who associate others with him but he forgives what's ever below that to whomever he wishes so they come up with arguments etcetera but it doesn't work nobody buys it this is not part of islam this is not from the methodology of so let's go to the other party al-murjiya says yes iman is a package deal okay so do you share the same belief of the khawaris no no no no no on the contrary we give you a card blanche do whatever you want of major sense you can do the whole nine yards as long as you have iman in your heart and it's firm then you're safe whoa so if i don't pray you're a believer you're kidding me if i consume intoxicants and do drugs you're still a believer do you have islam in your heart do you believe in allah azza yes i do you're clear so if i fornicate party all night long go clubbing do whatever i want you're a believer exactly like abu bakr roma of man and ali's belief and of course this is pathetic this is nonsense it's insane it has nothing to do with islam and this is unfortunately what the vast majority of muslims nowadays believe as long as i am it doesn't matter what i do allah azza loves me allah azzawajal will protect me allah would forgive my sins and part of them say that my iman is exactly the same as the iman of jibril the archangel peace be upon him so i could do whatever i want where did this come from it came from their ignorance of the quran and the sunnah in addition to the philosophies of the greeks that were that were imported at the beginning of the abbasi caliphate when the muslims have conquered so many lands and knowledge was booming and this is this was the golden era for the muslims in scientific discoveries in expansion of territory in wealth pouring to them to the extent that one of the one of the abbasi caliphates caliphs he said that whoever translates a book from greek to arabic whether it is philosophy aristos or whatever his name is and uh the others pluto i don't know their names in english we didn't get a chance to exchange business cards but aflaton arrested in arabic so whoever translates such a book he gives him his weight in gold so people went like crazy translating books that had pure shirk pure cover who cares who's monitoring this is a greek book by a famous theologian by a famous philosopher and we're getting paid so it's a win-win to us this caused huge damage to the muslims because they started adapting these philosophies and talking about islam from such a perspective which led to innovations which led to shirk which led to deviant beliefs so both got it from the same source this is why we study akida to purify our beliefs according to the quran and the sunnah not according to philosophers now we don't want to make this too complicated because to a lot of the non-arabs and to some arabs this is boring so many philosophies so many things we would like to stay focused on making it simple so my conviction would not be distorted by so many sects and cults and what they believe in what not to believe nevertheless it is important to share with you how such deviations started without going into deep details so that you know how allah privileged you when you follow the appeal of allah which is natural which is pure and simple the sheikh says no one's belief is confirmed after one has been a disbeliever except by so a person who's a kafir reversed to islam we cannot confirm his islam except with the following number one belief which combines the heart's word again the translator used the word mind when it should have been hard this is the islamic terminology used in arabic so we should stick with it so that you don't get confused because we have mind reading we have mind thoughts etc when what counts in islamic terminology is the heart so no one's belief is confirmed after he one has been a disbeliever except by one belief which combines the heart's word and acceptance of the divine message with the heart's actions which is to love allah and his messenger and to love what allah and his messengers love so this we spoke about last class that the heart has a saying the heart has a conviction the heart has actions of its own number two declaration by the word of mouth number three physical action now these three are important in order to be a true believer and watch out we are talking about a theoretical theoretical concept we're talking about generalities we're not talking about about an individual and why am i saying this disclaimer because when you go into studying these things shaytaan may make you jump to conclusion and makes you say oh shaykh asam says that we have to have the conviction which is the belief and the rhetoric of the tongue and the actions so if someone does not do the actions then he's a cafe so my friend is a kafir because he doesn't do so and so he doesn't pray it's a total different ballgame in totality in general the concept is clear you have to have the belief you have to say it and you have to act upon it if you don't act upon it at all and this is in general terms somebody says yes i'm a muslim i believe in my heart that prophet muhammad is truthful and that the quran is the word of allah i have no problem in that okay why don't you pray no i don't want to pray but i believe why don't you fast i don't wanna fast why don't you refrain from haram because i don't have to now this person is not a muslim i cannot go to my neighbor or to my brother or to my cousin who doesn't pray doesn't fast ramadan and does all the sins and say you're a kafir because here we have to fulfill the conditions one two three four and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles available to prevent me from giving fear one two three four and this is a process that scholars muslim judges muslim ruler are entitled to do not us laymen we're talking about the general concept so you have to have these three things available to be a believer let's go on and and read what the sheikh uh says whoever mentally this is by the heart accepts the faith and is able to make the verbal declaration but does not do so he's not a believer this is very important a man proposes to my sister and he's a levert and he said yes i am a muslim i believe in islam and i do this and i do they said okay did you read the shahadah in the islamic center said no did you read the shahada in front of muslims no okay why don't you declare your islam um yeah i will i will when insha'allah inshallah i will declare islam i believe in my heart you have to declare islam no this is judging me you're judging me and you're interfering in my own affairs i told you i'm a muslim how dare you i'm a muslim i believe in allah in the quran i've read so many books i've done this and that you refuse to say even if you have conviction in your heart it doesn't work you have to say allah allah so whoever mentally accepts the face of faith and is able to make the verbal declaration but does not do so is not a believer he's not a muslim end of story you refuse to say it you're not a muslim similarly a person who mentally accepts the faith and utters the verbal declaration okay this guy accepts with his art says verbally and is able to do the actions that are particular to islamic faith but does not do them is also not a believer so he comes and says okay uncle i'd like to marry your daughter your sister your sister whatever i'm a revert i'm a muslim your declaration of islam yes this is my certificate i said it in the islamic center in front of 5 000 people good good for you so do you pray no do you fast no no not yet you read the quran he said no um do you refrain from doing sins i said no it's okay i still have do uh weeds you know i smoke pot and i party even every now and then i celebrate christmas and so so where is your actions as a muslim um i believe in allah and the prophet sallam and i say the shahada no you have to walk the talk now my sister says why are you doing this we want to get married we want to get things hannah you get married to a muslim the guy doesn't do anything related to the actions of the body and without that he is not a believer he is not doing any of the sharia aspects of islam nothing and he cannot be muslim until he starts to practice now there is a difference between general practice and specifics i'm not talking that this person becomes a full-fledged min like the companions doing everything in islam no we are all sinners and we have a shortcoming so yeah he may default on some of the aspects of islam he may not be able to abandon certain sins he may be weak in practicing some rituals some mandatory acts but in general in totality he's doing his level best to practicing islam this is different from someone who refrains from practicing anything that is mentioned in uh islam now on the other hand the chair whoever wants to utter the declaration or to do the actions but is unable to accomplish his purpose falls under what allah says allah does not charge a soul with more than it can bear and allah says allah does not burden anyone with more than he has given them which means we're talking about someone who's selective by choice not to practice islam so someone comes to us and says i'm a muslim i want to become a i'm a muslim and a practicing muslim but i cannot say the shahadah why because i'm mute i can't speak this is okay or someone who says i cannot fast because chronically i'm ill i have answers i have huge uh um and very bad case of diabetes i have to eat every couple of hours or my insulin goes down and i die so it's okay this is a different story altogether because allah doesn't burden you beyond what you cannot bear so you have no problem in that our problem is with someone who can practice but refuses to if a muslim does something that annoys his faith that nullifies that breaks his eman whether verbal physical or mental his faith is totally annulled so what does that mean the things that nullify islam can be by conviction can be by rhetoric and can be by actions so i as a muslim if i believe that someone else can know the unseen other than allah can predict my future and i believe in that this nullifies my islam even if i say ash even if i pray because the conviction goes against islam and confirms that other than allah can know the unseen other than allah can provide for me other than allah can give life and death etc in the heart i didn't say anything wrong i didn't do anything wrong now likewise if someone has a strong conviction that fills his heart with iman but he says things that are kufur or shirk so yeah he's a believer and he prays on time but when he speaks he says blasphemous things so he says a joke mocking islam mocking quran mocking the prophet makes fun of hijab makes fun of the muslim men when they perform hajj and they shave their heads according to what allah ordered them in the quran and he makes fun of that these things are said by the tongue and these things nullify a person's islam as allah mentioned in ayah 66 in chapter 9 do not apologize you have committed and disbelief after being believers now you're not not the believers anymore and this is only by the tongue so like when you say you enter the circle of islam and you're one of us you're a brother to us likewise when you say the word of kufur you accept the fold of islam someone has conviction in his heart and he never says any kuffar with his tongue but he steps willingly and intentionally on the quran he prostrates to an idol glorifying it he does things through action that nullifies his islam then he is a kafir so if a muslim does something that annuls his faith whether verbal physical or mental his faith is totally annulled as we have said words action and belief together constitute faith and are compared to the three raka's of mariber if a worshiper does something that invalidates his prayer in one rakah the whole prayer as a unit is invalidated even even though he might have prayed the other requires well so this is something that many people think that this is not logical i have conviction in my my heart i am saying the word of islam yes i'm short in acting upon it and you say that this nullifies my islam as i explained earlier it's a package deal in the sense that your actions must be a representation of what's in your heart if you totally abandon things that the sharia tells you to do and you commit things that the sharia tells you not to do in totality not small things but the whole thing this means that you are not a true muslim so likewise in maghrib if you pray the first rakah excellently the second rakah beautifully the third rakah you pass wind the whole prayer is void you have to repeat the wudu and your prayer this does not contradict what we have said that faith increases with offering more of what islam requires and decreases with committing sinful actions be they less or more serious so again this is a great cause of confusion to people who don't do not have knowledge many times in counseling sessions i get with men and women saying that this is not kufa so no this is sinful yes but i'm enjoying the sin this is not kufur guys this is not kufur this is a sin there is a difference between a sin that decreases a man and worships forms of worship that increase iman and there is something that nullifies your iman altogether sins are not like this sins that are related to human nature reduce your iman sins that are related to the core of iman such as stepping on the quran intentionally insulting the prophet these nullify the core of iman and this nullifies islam in totality so likewise the fact that all of a prayer is rendered invalid by doing one thing that is contrary to it does not contradict that it is greater and better when more of its good action is done what does that mean now if you nullify part of your prayer through passing wind through giving your back to the qibla through talking this nullifies your prayer likewise your prayer which is similar to iman can be increased in value and can be decreased while the prayer itself is valid the sheikh says that it is greater and better when more of its good action is done such as longer recitation of the quran stillness and glorification of allah if i recite the quran longer while in prayer does this add more reward to my prayer the answer is yes so if i recite shorter surahs the reward is less but the prayer itself is not the validity of the prayer itself is intact as in the case of iman being reduced or increased so the sheikh says it is a lesser prayer but not invalid if one does what is discouraged what is makru such as looking to the sky during during prayer so while i'm praying i do this does this does that invalidate my prayer no but definitely it decreases the reward of your prayer and or stretching one's arms on the floor when entering the prostration position so one puts his whole hand and arm and elbow on the ground when prostrating like a dog or like a beast this is makru but it does not invalidate your prayer nothing invalidates faith except what allah has stated in the same way that nothing in validates prayer except what allah has defined so i hope this clarifies a little bit of the concept of iman being composed of belief of the heart and the belief of the heart is composed of saying and acting and also the saying of the tongue and the acting of the body these are a combination that must be present in general or in totality in order for someone to be a believer he may increase in his belief according to the acts he does or decrease his belief according to the acts he does not do but the core is still a believer in totality unlike when someone nullifies his belief whether by the actions of the heart or by his rhetoric or by the actions of his body as we have explained and allah so we have um like 20 minutes for the questions and question number one rabia says i was wondering if it is permissible to say that is to add allahumma amin after the recitation of sayyid still far and also while reciting the quran the verses where there is a dua of the prophets of the prophets are written is it permissible to say after the recitation of it means oh allah answer my dua or o allah respond to my dua and the sunnah and the best way of a muslim is to follow what the prophet alaihis used to do and we know that the prophet alison when he used to make dua he would never conclude his dua with ami when he says so for us to say i mean would not be recommended if we did not say that this is an innovation because definitely the prophet sam would only say and do what is best and if he didn't do it then we shouldn't do it he used to say amen [Music] and the companions used to say whenever he makes dua or someone makes dua and we say amin in response to that someone's dua but for us to say i mean to our own dua or whenever we recite the verse of the quran [Music] after reciting this ayah this is not from the sunnah and we must avoid this and not do it fahad says folding clothes in the prayer is this like is it disliked act or prohibited what is the difference between disliked act or prohibited macro and haram so macro is what a person does and he's not sinful but if he abandons it for the sake of allah he's rewarded and likewise if a person does it he's sinful but if he leaves it for the sake of allah he's rewarded so he's asking now folding the clothes for prayer is this considered to be disliked or prohibited the jurors differed because in essence as the scholars of us say that whenever a prohibition is stated then this is by default something that is sinful unless other evidences from the quran or the sunnah would demote it into makru so for example when the prophet salallahu salaam prohibits us from drinking while standing up there is a prohibition there's a hadith so what is the ruling on that the default is the prohibition do not drink standing up means that it is prohibited and you're sinful if you do it now this prohibition was actually let's start from the bottom this prohibition was promoted and made less in civility into macro and some say into even permissible when the prophet himself was as in drank zamzam water while standing up so now we have two sort of conflicting evidences don't drink standing up and he drank standing up so let's see what the companions say we go also in sahih bukhari and find that may allah be pleased with him the fourth caliph the cousin of the prophet salam and the son-in-law of the prophet haslam the husband of fatima he says i don't care whether i drink standing up or sitting down four i had seen the prophet ali susam drink standing up so what does that tell us it tells us that drinking standing up is not halal however it is definitely more rewarding just to drink sitting down due to the prohibition in the beginning not to drink standing up so likewise when we come to the hadith that do not fold your clothes when you want to pray the default is this is an instruction in order not to do something which mean it is prohibited and sinful unless proven otherwise do we have any proof technically speaking no however the majority of scholars say that this is not sinful rather it is makru where did they get this understanding from do they have any evidences the answer is no but the jurors tend to demote or promote a ruling if they could not find the reason or the justification for it so they say that ah this is something that is related to nothing of haram rather it is humanly better where did you get this from i don't know it sounded good so they say yeah it sounds good okay you agree i agree you agree so the majority say for example eating with your left hand is makru what the hadith is crystal clear yeah it is christopher but we don't know the point to make it haram so we say that it is makru and sometimes by them saying macro like in the hanafi school of thought they have two types of macro macro not recommended and macro prohibited they call it or tenzi and this is something that a student of knowledge has to be careful when studying so that he would learn the terminology used by the jurors of a particular school of thought in before jumping to conclusions so the default is the hadith is crystal clear it is prohibited to fold your clothes when you pray so part of the folding of the clothes is this if i am doing this and just before prayer i do this this is folding i should not do that and pray like that folding your sleeves i should not do that one says okay sheikh what about if i have my pants below my ankles i say 24 7 you're sinful whether you're praying or not but due to the fact that prayer one has to do the level best not to be in a state of sin we tell you you've you've got to fold this because it's the lesser of the two evils and allah azza knows best kinsa riyadh says can i gift my non-practicing cousin bags they do not cover you give me idea what gift can i give to them so that they don't cover and they are my kinship first of all it is prohibited for us to assist and facilitate sin so if i know that a friend smokes i cannot buy him an ashtray or a lighter because i'm facilitating the sin likewise if i know that my sister does not cover her face does not wear danika i cannot buy her makeup knowing that she's going to wear makeup and go out if my niece is not a hijabi unfortunately i cannot buy her perfumes because i know she's going to wear the perfumes and go out she has no restrictions towards that therefore buying a bag would it fall under the category of tabarruj that is no all women even nikabhi's hijabis they wear their backs they're pursed so there's nothing wrong in that because it's not related to hijab but yes if you tell me i'd like to buy my cousin female cousin something that she would use where nan maharam can see her that would not be permissible and i hope this answers your question says if i'm away from my city and i am in a hotel where there is a masjid nearby there's friday prayer the jumu'ah becomes mandatory upon me even as a traveler this is an issue of dispute a lot of the jurors say that a traveler is exempted from praying friday prayers now in order to understand the whole issue we have the concept of a traveler who's traveling from point a to point b so this journey of his he may pass by a village a town a city but he's just on his journey he's traveling he's not settling he's not staying or spending the night such a traveler even if he passes by an area where the friday is given he's not obliged to pray because he's on his journey a group of travelers a hundred on a boat or a ship a cruisership traveling from cyprus to meccanos in greece go to roads mykonos is not good roads island and it's jummah time so they say like listen we have 500 people muslims let's pray jummah said no this is not permissible and if you pray you might say invalid what yes it's invalid why because that prophet islam traveled a lot and so many times jummah was there and he never collected his companions who were with him on a in an army an expedition or whatever and he never threw a friday prayer not only that during arafah in the hajj where tens of thousands of people were there and it was time for jummah it's a friday the prophet did not order the congregation to pray jumu'ah rather he prayed the torah has combined to it afterwards so a traveler does not pray juman scenario number two i'm traveling from london to new york i arrived on thursday friday i'm staying there for a couple of days maybe and then tomorrow is a friday and there's a masjid nearby should i pray or not a lot of the scholars said that you're a traveler you don't have to pray but the most authentic opinion is that as long as you are in the town or the city and you're not commuting you're not traveling and there's a masjid next to you allah azzawajal says in the surah called the friday prayer or the friday day allah says all you who believe whenever the call for friday is given then you should walk and pray it so now i who is in my hotel room in new york or in moscow oren whatever and the message is next door or nearby do i have to pray the answer is yes because you're a believer and allah has made the call for you as a believer to go and pray with the muslims so this insha allah gives you a background where the jurors who said no you don't pray came from and also it gives you a background where those who said you must pray are coming from and allah azza knows best last question of today afrina says is video permissible for women we're going to have a picnic party of some of my close surrounding friends all females can we make a video on this it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion and this is what i have adopted throughout the years is that taking photographs or videos of women is not permissible unless it is for a legitimate reason such as identification uh and the likes why because women's photographs and videos defy the purpose of hijab so the sisters say okay but nobody's gonna see it except me and this is why you end up seeing a lot of the sisters doing this in front of a mirror showing their six packs showing there how beautiful their head is i've seen teenagers spending hours in front of the camera and pretending to be bloggers or vloggers with a v and this is what you do when you put your eyelashes and this is what you do when you put the makeup what put the foundation first and they spend hours with you videoing themselves islamically this is not permissible just to say why we're gonna keep the mobile nobody's gonna see it yes but it can be stolen you can sell it it can be damaging thrown yet it still can be retrieved even if you format your laptop or your device specialists can still retrieve everything on it and a friend of mine a personal friend of mine came to me once and he said yesterday i went to downtown and i bought a second-hand laptop so i took it to a friend of mine and i said this is a sort of new laptop yes it's secondhand but it's formatted i need you to install windows and i need you to put all the necessary programs in it so his friend said okay the following day he brought him the laptop and he saw and he said to him i restored the formatted hard disk so now you can use the programs and the software for free so my friend opened the laptop and he was shocked by the photos that were restored from a hard disk that was formatted and everything was erased and deleted and he said well i was so shocked alhamdulillah he has iman he said i immediately closed the laptop and asked my friend to format it again i don't want to retrieve anything he said i saw photos of women muslims hijabis who are not in hijab who are in very intimate positions thinking that this is only between me and my husband so my take against this is that a woman's chastity a woman's privacy a muslim as body is more sacred than to be preserved or captured just for a silly reason as we're friends get together we would like to to film a video and allah knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's lesson until we meet insha'allah um today's monday thursday i'll leave you alone"
