  "title": "Wearing of silk cloth for Men",
  "transcript": "Silk For Men the prophet the Hadith is authentic came once to his companions carrying gold in one hand and silk in the other and he said the prophet Alam that these are Halal for the females of my umah and they are prohibited for the males of my umah so this means that it is prohibited for a man to use or to wear silk clothing and some Scholars due to other evidences say that it is permissible only to have embroidering in your cloth that is as wide as four fingers not more so if you have a normal cloth and you have four fingers embroidered with silk this is permissible less it's permissible more it is prohibited so it is totally prohibited to wear natural silk whether it's in your garment it's in your tie it's in your socks it's your uh um pajamas this is all prohibited now synthetic silk is halal because the name itself doesn't make a thingal or the actual thing so the natural silk that comes from the worm that uh produces it this is prohibited for men to use but the synthetic silk polyester or whatever they call it with uh uh chemical making this fabric this is halal for men to wear"
