  "title": "My family is from Tablighi Jamah, Tips on how to give them dawah - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh he asks about his family and they're all practicing righteous muslims but they are from the tabli jamaat and he's the youngest and he doesn't know how to approach them in dawa due to the fact that he's the youngest and due to the fact that they've been in this field for like 30 or 40 years so he's asking what are the tips to give dawah for them or to them well first of all dawa is an art and you require a lot of wisdom and before all this wisdom and knowledge guidance from allah without that you're bound to fail so guidance of allah is something that i don't know if i have or not i make dua i do my due diligence i do my best and move on wisdom means to know where to place things so what is wisdom wisdom is to know where to place this pen so if i place it in my beard it will fall and i would look stupid this is not wisdom if i place it in my pocket when it's still on i will have ink on my pocket this is not wisdom turning it off or or whatever you call the pen and putting it that's wisdom so wisdom is putting the thing in its right place and you need to weigh the consequences so okay i saw something wrong if i speak it will have the ripple effect for sure that would cause them not to listen to me for six months but if i keep silent they would understand that i'm dealing with wisdom though i hate what's happening they know that i hate it but they are quite satisfied that i have the wisdom not to address this issue so first of all you have to have knowledge in order to make dawah second of all you have to prioritize the things you're doing dawa for so i if i have a large family and they're all elders practicing bearded muslims who pray five times in the masjid and who go three days for for feasibility or 10 days or 40 days and they have the bayan and they have this and that and i can't just simply come and say um celebrating mode is biddah they will not accept this from me oh so you telling me not to say what is halal and what is haram and not to enjoin virtue and righteousness and not to forbid evil advice no i'm not telling you that i'm telling you to think long term you being a teenager or in your early 20s and they are in their 60s and 70s you don't want to begin in on the right on the wrong foot you need to focus on how to address them how to prioritize it secondly you have to avoid using names that they may resent or look down upon so definitely don't use sheikh bimbas or binatha mean or albani because they think that they are extremist wahhabis fundamentalists salafis khawaris whatever don't use my name or anyone else who for that sake would be labeled in their eyes what to do use only the quran and the authentic sunnah they believe blindly they believe blindly in riyadh which is compiled of the majority of authentic hadiths so look for it for your evidence there whenever you speak to them address the issue with quran try to make them love you and respect you first of all because if all of us sudden you start bombarding them with haram haram innovation shirk this is not right this is and you don't have any track record to show them that you have knowledge or you have real care for them they will not accept it so you focus on the first three to four months to be dutiful to be respectful to be obedient to help them to honor them to offer them hospitality and show them that you're doing all what you can to please them once they have this bond with you and they believe okay this our boy omar is masha'allah a good kid he's a learned kid masha'allah he memorizes a lot of the quran and for us in bangladesh memorizing the quran is a great honor mashallah he's a good learned kid now when you address important issues when it comes to shirik for example or believing that other than allah brings benefit or other than allah may protect from evil now when you start to tell them that no one can can do this except allah azzawajal and show them the verses of the quran they will abide by it if you tell them that wedding of tawis is shirk and you show them that one has to connect only his heart to allah and that the prophet warned us from this and that in the authentic hadith they will acknowledge that insha allah bit by bit but you have to work your way up the pyramid and it's a very steep place and it's a difficult climb yet when you reach the peak you will feel the beauty of it insha'allah izner says"
