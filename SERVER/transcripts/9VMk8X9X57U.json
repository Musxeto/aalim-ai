  "transcript": "my question is um this morning I prayed Sergeant but 15 minutes after prayer I looked outside and it was already light outside so I don't know if um I need the uh Saturday's time or not so should I now this question a lot of the Muslims keep on asking about it and actually you guys have to use your logic we know that you have to pray at this specific time mentioned by our Prophet correct correct let's assume that it is from five to six o'clock the Sun rises you prayed when you don't know Before Sunrise or after Sunrise you don't know so one of two options one either you did pray on time so you're safe two which is why you're asking maybe you did not pray on time what is the solution if you did not pray on time if you prayed after the sun has risen no one ever says repeat the prayer why would I repeat a prayer I already prayed oh because you prayed after the time has gone out so if I pray after three hours wouldn't I be also praying after the time has gone up what's the reason for repeating the prayer it doesn't make any sense so to come back to your question this is just the thought process that I'm trying to teach you so that you don't have to ask another time if you prayed thinking that the time was fine and then discovered that the time has already expired you cannot do anything because if your prayer is invalid system invalid praying it again doesn't help and if it is valid because you did not know alhamdulillah you have not done anything wrong you don't have to repeat so either way Dima do not repeat your prayer"
