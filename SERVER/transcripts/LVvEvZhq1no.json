  "transcript": "in ald [Applause] for [Music] [Applause] [Applause] m Islam is a holistic religion and this beautiful religion covers all aspects of Life Allah says in the Quran say indeed say there is no one better in speech than someone who says or who who calls to Allah and does righteous deeds and proclaims I am among the Muslims and why is that because many people may call to Islam but they're not sincere many people may do righteous Deeds but they may not show it to people those who have righteous deeds and sincerity must Proclaim must announce must Express their identity and this is what we have a problem in we live in a cafir country country but we failed miserably to announce our identity they say you have to blend in you have to merge you have to compromise you have to let go this is not what Islam is all about Islam is a religion that gives its followers dignity honor Islam is a religion that part of the essential fundamental of it is to be unique not to simulate other beliefs and other religions rather you have to go against them as part of your own belief don't we say in the Quran or in the in our prayers which [Music] one guide us to the straight path which path the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not of those who have earned your anger or of those who are astray we don't want to be like them we want a separate path than the Jews and the Christians that's why you find that the Muslim is always unique has his own identity wherever he is you can recognize him if he's Alaska or in Siberia or the jungles of Africa you can tell that this brother is a Muslim whether he's wearing Arab clothes he's wearing pair of jeans he's wearing a three-piece suit you could tell he is a Muslim because he's a servant of Allah and he follows Allah's commands in every single step he makes the prophet wasam when he came he did not come to make a revolution he says in the authentic Hadith I was merely sent to perfect good character meaning good character was present before he came but he came to perfect it to make it complete and this is why Islam acknowledged some of the characteristics ICS that the disbelievers and the idol worshippers had because they were good Islam approved courage generosity truthfulness honesty fulfilling your promises all of these were approved in Islam and the status and the position of Islam when it infiltrates societies is very Crystal clear we're not here to clash with the community or to face them headon rather sovereignty is to Islam Islam prevails Islam rules and it is not ruled Islam dominates and is not dominated but we don't Clash this is our belief this is our religion Islam has scorned and criticized Nations before us who gave their back to Islam and decided to follow the Norms of their forefathers Allah says in the Quran and similarly we did not send before you oh Muhammad any Warner into a city except that its affluent said indeed we found our fathers upon a religion and we are in their footsteps following Islam came to control and to govern how things should be done in the shade of worshiping Allah alone and this is what we all claim we did not come here today except to express oured to Allah our obedience to Allah being servants to Allah and when Allah tells us put your forehead on the floor we say we comply and we obey we don't have any objections because we are Muslims we are Servants of Allah Asel so we need to submit our will to Allah we need to surrender it's not something that you can apply your logic and say hm I'll choose this and I'll skip that this is not Islam Islam is to adhere Islam is not to use not to use your logic be careful if you lose your logic with Quran or with the Sunnah you'll end up in Hellfire this is exactly what Satan did Allah told him prostrate to Adam he said whoo this is not logical I'm better than him you created me from fire and created Adam from clay it doesn't make any sense I refrain what did Allah do sentence him to Hellfire for a gazillion years for eternity and this is the fate of each and every one of us may Allah forbid if we decided to follow our own logic and say no I don't like this this doesn't make any sense why would Allah do this why would uh uh the prophet ordered me to do this who are you to object you're a Muslim you you follow and you are honored to be a Muslim and to be proud of your identity part of the governance of Islam is clearly described in the Hadith where the Prophet first came to Medina so he found the locals celebrating two days it's their festivals they've been celebrating for hundreds of years so the prophet said what are you guys doing so they said these are two days events we celebrate every single year for centuries so the prophet said stop this Allah has substituted you with better than them and these are our two only cele celebrations in the year which means as Muslims I'm proud not to celebrate Christmas I'm proud not to celebrate Thanksgiving or Halloween or New Year's Eve or Valentine Day as so many Muslims unfortunately do and you get presence who's this from I Secret Valentine masallah do you see sure but this doesn't prevent me from sending you some chocolates and red roses it does if you believe in Islam you know that this is Haram don't belittle it just because you're in the Melting Pot everybody around me is doing it so what the heck might as well no you have to have your identity I am among the Muslims likewise what we wear has to fall under the governance of Islam bear witness when Islam came to Mecca the prophet didn't tell the companions take off your clothes and wear like weird attire no they still wore what they're used to because this is what they wear but Islam came to govern so Islam puts guidelines for what is halal and what is Haram for women they must not cover their bodies they must not wear transparent clothes or clothes that is tight and exposes their body structure and and and and and bones and curves they must not wear something that is solely known to be for disbelievers and they must not as well wear anything that draws attention because women are supposed to conceal their beauty and they say only for their husbands and mams for your eyes only not for those out in the street to look they don't wear colorful abayas and with uh uh adornments and flashy stuff likewise men they're not allowed to wear silk pure silk Muslims it's Haram for m males to wear silk to wear gold to wear something that exposes their thighs as in the case of shorts or to wear something that exceeds their ankles and covers it because this is a major sin that would put them in Fire and they must not look like disbelievers so he's wearing a pair of jeans and a t-shirt imitating the disbelievers no all all Muslims wear suits and shirts and uh uh trousers and the likes there's nothing wrong in that but the moment you start to be confused to those who meet you should I say Salam alayum or not why well the brother is not wearing um Islamic attire in the sense that he's wearing a necklace he's wearing earrings he's doing this he's doing that this is imitating the disbelievers and this is when you lose your identity I seek forgiveness from Allah for myself and for you so ask Allah for forgiveness and this is one of the times where the Dua is answered when the IM sits between the two you have debts ask you have illnesses ask you have a problem in your marriage ask it's less than 15 seconds but Allah responds to you in [Music] yes alhamd Islam came with a perfect religion because it came from Allah who created us and know knows what is best for us yeah and this is why Islam prohibited demonic and satanic habits that include changing the creation of Allah so it is pro prohibited in Islam to pluck the eyebrows both for men and women as the prophet cursed whoever does this it is prohibit Ed to have tattoos on your flesh and I see a lot of the Muslims unfortunately who live in these countries think that it's cool to have some ink on your skin not knowing that they are cursed for this but when they see celebrities when they see athletes and when they see those whom they look up to doing this this is when you lose yourself you lose your identity you lose your pride and honor when you imitate someone like those also Islam prohibits connecting the hair with extensions and it's a major sin Islam honors hair the prophet told us Whoever has hair should honor it doing what offering it coffee of course not honoring the hair is to Cal it down to put some um oil or the like so it would not be um um not looking good to Cal it and to have it tidy and clean and this is why in Islam it is prohibited to have and is to leave some part of the hair on your head and shave others so this kind of haircut is Haram in Islam but unfortunately a lot of the Muslims think it's cool and with the weather here everything you do is cool also it is prohibited in Islam to show your respect in a way that conflicts with your it is not permissible to bow to people or to prostrate to people is not permissible to kiss people's feet as in some cultures it is not permissible to squat as in some African cultures when you meet elderlies it's not permissible for any man even an elder person to place his hand on people's heads as a form of blessing and whether they're women or men this is not from Islam the prophet shows us the importance of the man in his wife's Life by saying if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone I would have ordered the wife to prostrate to her husband due to his huge status and importance in her life among the cultural things that we Arabs have and we're rejecting and refusing to fight it is free mixing especially in weddings and I believe that this is prevalent also here you have men and women mixing in weddings the groom comes in front of all the women and the Bride Comes wearing her Haram dress no hijab exposing every hour possible and she sits in front of nonah men clicking photos enjoying what they're seeing and the poor cow next to her is just smiling and proud yeah this is my wife yeah don't you feel like that you're not a man anymore where is your jealousy let alone where is your Islam such cultural things and customs expose Us big time because this indicates if I'm a true Muslim following the Quran or the Sunnah or otherwise and we have habits Customs that we call part of our honor and dignity which has nothing related to honor or dignity in some Arab countries we have what is known as honor killing so if your sister sister if your mother if your daughter allegedly is dating someone or talking to someone you feel obliged to kill her thinking that this is part of protecting your honor not knowing that this is part of throwing you in hell big time this is a major sin it has nothing to do with honor but this is what culture does to you when you don't have Islam in your heart some cultur do this horrendous act shameful act on the night of the wedding when they give to be known for this in front of everyone have some shame have some honor have some dignity and this happens in so many cultures so many parents insist not to give their daughters except to their nephews you're not selling and buying this is marriage if she doesn't have any chemistry with the man proposing even if her if he was her cousin you have no right enforcing her even if you are her father you have no right enforcing her you're the one who's getting married get married to him she's the one who's going to live with him 24/7 under the same roof so fear Allah and abide by Islam and its teachings Allah Asel says in the Quran but no by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you oh Muhammad until they make you judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission you will never believe until you implement this Ayah in your life and accept Muhammad to be your judge and to be your mentor and to be your leader who would be the only one to lead you to so are you going to follow or are you going to follow your whims and desires your customs and traditions your Clans aspirations this is what you have to decide and the choice is yours Allah m"
