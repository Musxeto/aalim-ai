  "title": "Is it permissible to pay a Bribe in order to get one's rights? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a which says is it permissible to pay a bribe in order to get one's right have some work to get done with one of the government departments and if the official does not take a bribe he will cause trouble for me is it permissible for me to give him a bribe first of all bribery is a major sin in Islam the Prophet said in an authentic hadith alehissalaam may Allah curse the one who pays the bribe and the one who receives it la ilaha Rossia wilmore Tashi it's an authentic hadith no doubt about it and it is totally prohibited to deal with it if you look at a society if you look at a country that bribery is widely spread in it you will find it one of the worst countries in the world you will find it at the very bottom of the scale of the civilized countries and this is obvious you go to some countries and nothing goes through without bribing you bribe the officials you bribe the judges you bribe the police you bribe the governor you bribe everyone and anyone who holds a public office becomes rich within a couple of weeks because of this so bribery is an epidemic that destroys the community now my question is if I am forced to do it what do you mean you forced to do it he says there is a tender that people are bidding to get for constructing a building for the government if I do not pay a bribe I may not get a chance to join in well this is not a necessity so chair I have to work I have to get jobs said yes but instead of dealing in construction by a car work as a taxi or as an uber auras or whatever this is not a necessity because there are others who are in the same boat and what you're doing is you are taking someone's share because of the bribe you're giving so the higher the bribe is the more possibility of you getting the job and this is not your right so what should I do when is it okay for me to pay a bribe scholars say that it is permissible for you to pay a bribe when you require and you need to obtain what is lawfully yours or to protect yourself and prevent yourself from any form of aggression or vuln for example I bought a car from Europe I shipped it to my country all the paperwork's are okay and the law has been followed when the what would you call customer a customs officer when the customs officer came he looked in the papers and said you have to ship your car back again why it doesn't fall under the categories permitted to enter show me something I won't show you anything I went to his boss his boss is as corrupt as he is if you don't pay us so much money we will not get the car in this is my car I paid my own money I did not break any laws what to do scholars say in this case give them the bribe it is haram for them they will eat equivalent amount of it in Hellfire through their stomachs without any doubt as for you you are not sinful for what you had done because you wanted to get what is lawfully yours likewise if someone wanting to inflict harm to me or to my family by saying that the house you live in is not good for human not consumption for human standards so you have to vacate your house and we will destroy it and demolish it and you can build some other house on the land I said why the guy says because I said so what are you gonna do about it you go to the governor you go to the officials and no one is listening to you so you have to follow the law but the law is doing injustice to me there's nothing wrong in the house said well he's the one in charge so it's obvious that he wants harm for me and I cannot repeal and push back this harm without giving him a bribe Islam says give him the bribe and he will consume it in Hellfire on the day of judgement so this is the scenario that allows you to give a bribe but in other cases where it is uncalled for and it's not a necessity and it's not to take what is lawfully yours or to prevent harm from coming in unto you then you will be as sinful as they are"
