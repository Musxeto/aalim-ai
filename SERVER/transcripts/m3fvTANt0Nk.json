  "transcript": "a very common and and and usual question unfortunately a lot of the people in the subcontinent live in joint families and this is good in a sense for the parents but it is bad for the daughter-in-law especially if there are other um siblings of the husband living alone so first of all it is the god-given right to the woman to have her separate quarters Islam demands that a wife has her own quarter even if it's a bedroom and a bathroom and a small kitchen it isolated from the whole house so nobody enters there without her permission and she can do whatever she wants there without being exposed to the rest of the family second of all if she out of her own Goodwill agrees to live with the parents may Allah reward her for that it is not permissible at all to mix with the brother-in-law or to take offer hijab or to be IM modest in front of him because he's a total stranger not only that he is worse than a total stranger you see if I come to the house she will be protective of me more than she is from her brother-in-law your husband would be protective of me and more jealous of me than of his brother-in-law this is why in theah the prophet gave a strong warning when he addressed the man and said do not enter upon women do not enter upon women meaning those who are not not do not enter upon your mother your sister your wife your daughter your aunt no so any woman who is a nonaham do not enter upon them so one of the companions may Allah be pleased with them all said oh prophet of Allah what about alamu alamu refers to the uncle of the husband the brother of the husband the relative of the husband whom the husband usually trusts a lot so the man is saying okay prophet of Allah he's my brother I trust my brother I know my brother the prophet said two words which translates to your relative is equivalent to death if you want death to come and visit your wife visit your uh uh mams then let the nah mix with them this is a very strong warning from the prophet Alat so it's not my ruling I didn't make it up this is the ruling of Islam this is the teaching of the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam so definitely you have no excuse she what to do my husband forces me my parents in-law are taunting me and this happens when the mother and father-in-law are ignorant are people from the Dark Ages they have no knowledge in the Quran nor in the Sunnah all what they want is what's in their head to be implemented in the house so the Mother-in-law because she was taunted by her mother-in-law when she first got married because she worked as a servant to her sisters-in-law and she uh wept the house and cleaned and did the dishes and cooked now she wants to experience the same power and control over her daughter-in-law don't you fear Allah don't you have daughters of your own would you like your daughters to work like this so definitely uh this is a long uh topic and you have to be diplomatic you have to be wise you have to weigh the consequences you have to sit with your husband and tell him that these are your rights and you fear that Allah would punish him severely for not giving you your uh uh rights now uh Khadijah"
