  "transcript": "um Shake I have one question um actually I have a non-muslim friend and asked me that I studied the Quran Bible and Torah but the Quran says that the gospel and the Torah are words of God so I where are this book today so what what any any had this ver or I don't understand your question just understand if if I heard was correct and your friend is saying that I studied the Quran and the Torah I don't know what is your question but if you're saying then is the Torah the word of Allah the answer is yes the Torah and the injil are both the today have been altered and corrupt by the sons of Israel who came and changed many of it and this is why the New Testament we have which they call the Bible has nothing related to the inil except few verses because the vast majority of it is The Gospel according to John Luke Paul and Mark so these are not according to Allah rather to what they've said and what they've written and what they've uh um seen and the contradictions are Beyond yeah logic so no one says that this is the word of Allah but the real Torah revealed to Moses peace be upon him and the real injil revealed to ISA peace be upon Him is the word of Allah"
