  "title": "Is it sunnah to lick fingers & plate after eating? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yeah uh my question regards when I finish eating the food okay can I clean the blade by my tongue perable no problem I I believe that you're asking about licking your plate not that your tongue is so long that you go and wipe people's plates and yours as well and if this is your question the answer is yes it is part of the Sunnah and the etiquette that you clean and wipe your plate whether with your fingers and lick your fingers for the Baraka the blessing of Allah unlike the Posh people who would say h this is disgusting this is this this is food this is Allah's blessing and provision for me I don't treat it as something that's irrelevant this is something Allah has giving me so yes it's part of the Sunnah if you eat with your fingers that when you finish you lick your fingers and if you finish eating your uh from your plate you clean it with your finger and lick your finger or you can lick your plate as well but try your level best to choose when to do this due to the fact that there are so many people that anticipate this imagine if I'm doing this in a five stars Hotel said I'm going to do the Sunnah and I grab the plate and I start licking it in front of everybody and they're taking shots of me and posting it on the internet oh the Barbarian Muslims look at what they're doing did I do any good for Islam would they understand no the media is waiting for you to slip to make a single mistake magnify it and tarnish the reputation of Islam because of you so be careful in what you do as as always measure by the consequences so this is a Sunnah if I don't do it I'm not sinful but if I do it and this causes more harm than good then I have lost the advantage and Allah Knows Best"
