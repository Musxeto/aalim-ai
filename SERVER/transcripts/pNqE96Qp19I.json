  "transcript": "foreign I was wondering what the ruling was on prolonging the event and making it melodious as I was considering practicing this event may Allah be pleased with him was the companion who saw the Adan in his vision and he went straight to the prophet Aslam and told him about it he was the one who saw the adhan yet the prophet told him teach what you had seen to Bilal because he has a nicer voice which means that it is intended that the Advan is recited in a melodious and beautiful voice but not to exaggerate and take it to a level where it becomes a song sometimes you go to places like Egypt you go to places like liberated Syria or to turkey and you hear the Adan and it's so beautiful you can't hold yourself but really enjoy the voices the way it's given it's subhanallah something out of this world such melody in the Advan is quite acceptable as long as it does not resemble songs and they extend it to be like 10 minutes instead of the average three minutes two minutes to three minutes so as long as they're doing it in a melodic way that attracts people inshallah this is fine"
