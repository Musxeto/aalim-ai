  "transcript": "what to do with a husband who does not want to provide for me or his children my husband tells me to go to my mother's to save dollars and or money and gives lame excuses to not find work I just had a baby ten days ago your husband is sinful without any doubt allah azza wajal says in the quran yamuna are the mahabhava malabar Wahby my alpha woman am wali him that the men are protectors guardians over women for what Allah has excelled them over them and for the money and the wealth they provide for them and scholars say that if a man does not provide for his wife his wife has a legitimate reason to seek separation and divorce and the judge would give her divorce because the man is incapable of providing for her she can live with him but deprive him of his sexual rights so she is not sinful for that if he's not providing for her or she can live with him and provide him with her with his sexual rights and make dua and try to make things work and this is up to her but definitely he is sinful"
