  "title": "Does reflux (vomit) that comes out of the throat break your fast? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ali says some vomit comes up to my throat and then I swallow it I'm not sure if it entered fully into my mouth does this break fast because it originates in the body stomach reflux when it comes to your throat and you swallow it this doesn't impact your fasting this is not vomit but it if it comes to your tongue to almost close to spitting it out and you swallow it this invalidates your fasting so if it just comes to the top of your throat and you swallow it no problem if it comes to your mouth you must spit it out and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
