  "transcript": "faizan says how do we remain steadfast when our parents order us to do sins and they'll scold us they'll shout at us they may be beat us it's very easy remember those who wear with the prophet alaihis was how did they behave and react to the abuse of their people to the torture to the torment did they give up no they were steadfast like mountains so whenever you are abused or scalded for not disobeying allah always make it a form of entertainment for yourself that if i were with the prophet salaam i would have been among his favorite companions i would have remained steadfast but if you budged if you gave in to their pressure this should sadden you because such pressure if you were at the time of the prophet sallam much less of it would have caused you to be with the hypocrites against the prophet so remain steadfast by showing your gratitude to allah be diplomatic but explain it to them that there is no going back this is a red line i'm not going to disobey allah to please you anything that pleases you and does not displease allah i'm willing to cross the oceans for you the moment you ask me to do something that displeases allah there is no way i'm going to accept this"
