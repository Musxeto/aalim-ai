  "title": "Wrong age on my birth certificate, is my income halal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sheikh some people have their birth certificate reduced by a few years yani one or two years or more than that from the actual date of birth as a result the companies that employ people up to a certain age they can work up to a few extra years using the false birth certificate so now my question is will his income be hidden in those extra years jazakova first of all it is a mistake that the individual has no power over it's not his fault a person is born his parents try to make her make him older than the actual age so that he can work earlier not knowing that he will be retired also earlier at the prime of his youth so it's not your fault it's your parents fault they've lied they've cheated and generally speaking you cannot rectify this imagine me going to the authorities and saying that listen this is my birth certificate i am actually three years older they say you're lying prove that to us you can't prove that to them therefore legally at the moment you're obliged by what is documented what's written in your birth certificate and what's written in your birth certificate is that you are this old you can apply and your income would be halal insha allah"
