  "title": "The dressing of Prophet ï·º (Characteristics of Prophet) Ash Shama'il Al Muhammadiyah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the chapter that deals with the clothes the dressing of the prophet and this includes a number of the first one was narrated by um Sal uh may Allah be pleased with her she said that the apparel dearest to Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam was the shirt or the Kam now what is a Kam the second Hadith also would be on the same uh um platform the apparel dearest of Allah's messenger um was the shirt he used to wear the third Hadith also proves that the prophet s wasallam used to love wearing shirts muaah narrates that his father came to the prophet wasam in a group of men from mua to give him the Pledge of Allegiance and he had his shirt set loose what is to have a shirt loose meaning that the buttons of the shirt were uh set loose so I inserted my hand in the breast of his shirt and touched the seal so he went from inside and touched the Seal of the Prophet what does this all indicate one it indicates that the prophet used to love wearing of shirts or kamis what is a shirt a shirt is a dress that has two sleeves and an opening where you insert your head from so anything that has this description is called a and it usually has buttons to button it up so the prophet used to love this Kam why because it conceals the body well rather than having just a piece of cloth on top of you like we wear in when we go for or this can fall off this needs to be all the time um rejoined and tied well while the Kam by itself you can uh um be mobile you can uh you can be mobile meaning you can move around you don't need to be aw um careful that it would be uh it would fall by itself or the likes the Hadith of the Prophet that when mu uh uh that his father came to the prophet and his buttons were unbuttoned this doesn't mean it's a Sunnah otherwise why wear a shirt from the first place with buttons buttons are made to conceal Your Body by buttoning them and close the shirt but sometimes you may due to heat due to any other reason unbutton some of them so it is not a Sunnah per se to always unbutton your shirt and go everywhere like this and say well this is Hadith and it's a Sunnah no it's not a Sunnah it is something that was randomly done rarely done by the prophet Alat wasam for such a purpose then in the following Hadith an Malik may Allah pleased with him says that the prophet Alam came out leaning on us when he was sick he came out leaning on ASB z may Allah be pleased with man with his father wearing an outer garment of chorus C cotton fabric which had thrown On Loosely which he had thrown On Loosely then he led them in the ritual prayer what kind of a garment was it it is is a harsh rough material that was made from a fabric brought either from bahin or from Yemen which indicates that the prophet sallam was not wearing something that was soft that was luxurious that was expensive rather he used to wear whatever was available and he uh uh wore it loosely meaning that he brought it from underneath and threw a left arm and threw it on his right and from underneath his right arm and threw it to his left so it's it's like a crossing over his chest so that it would not fall easily uh the following Hadith is by Abu Al may Allah be pleased with him he said that when the prophet of dawned a new garment whenever he wore a new garment he would call it by its name then he would say oh Allah prae be praise be to you as you have clothed me with it I beg you for its goodness and the goodness of what it has been made for and I take refuge with you from its evil and the evil it was of what uh it has been made made for what is this Hadith about whether it's a head garment or a shirt or a waist strapper or a suit the prophet would used to call it by oh Allah you have given me this uh uh shirt praise be to you as you have given me this shirt or these trousers and I ask you of its goodness what kind of goodness we're asking Allah for to conceal our to make it last and not wor off to make us wear it without any arrogance or showing off and seeking refuge in Allah from anything that is contrary uh or contradicting with this and this shows you how a Believer is supposed to deal with Allah's favors and blessing when you ask Allah when you praise Allah who Among Us remembers to praise Allah whenever he puts on a t-shirt or a trouser or a new piece of cloth or a a turban or whatever when who Among Us always seek Allah's favors and blessing through what we''re been awarded and seek refuge in Allah from its evil rarely you will find people connected to Allah through this concept and this is why following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam and always showing your gratitude and appreciation to Allah shows how a true thankful and grateful servant of Allah you are"
