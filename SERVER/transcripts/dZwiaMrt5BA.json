  "transcript": "no hand from Bangladesh yeah I I have to add something before I asked the question the thing is when I started practicing Islam I barely found anyone like who is like-minded like I had to do a lot of thing myself so what happened is over the years I like what I would do is like if I feel like anything if anything benefiting me I would just like create and do it like no matter how difficult my stream or what other people say if I think like it's benefiting me I will just do it like as the Hadith says like do what benefits you and don't look back so over the years like with this approach I didn't have any issue but what happened is like recently I did something like I don't really like I don't know how didn't I realized it was realistic really a stupid thing to do like I don't know what or not so I was thinking and how did I not see the obvious harm that is coming from this so after the whole thing like I'm really like feeling broken inside I like I want to know is it actually possible to someone to like seek Allah said and like to place dikhara and to try to do the right thing but still like end up making the wrong decision and like if you're making himself like fall into a lot of Fitness or something like this what what kind of things you were praying is tihara for worldly things or religious things or things related to Islam and knowledge what uh yeah like marriage video did something on I would highly recommend that you try to book a counseling session if you can afford it and we will talk about it but I'll answer your question in general istihara is only to be done for worldly things whether to buy a car to go for an interview to marry a woman to move into another house to go to the gym worldly things you've made your mind to do a particular task before doing it you pray to our guys and make the Dua and go ahead with it things that are related to Islamic knowledge no it's it's not feasible to know okay this is an issue of dispute hmm what should I do I should tiny my name anymore and try to figure out which one okay I'll take this one I'll praise the heart and go ahead with it no it doesn't work like this you have to do your due diligence you have to ask Scholars you have to look for evidences and research it then once reaching a verdict to know which is most authentic follow it without istehara a lot of the people praise tihara and complain years later that it didn't work out so a man comes and said Sheikh I heard your lecture about I found the right woman I did my due diligence she was okay checked all the boxes I pray this tahara I propose we got married said mashallah broke he said but 20 years later we divorced so so you want your Sahara to be 20 years lasting no the Estacada was to get married getting married at that time was a good thing how you managed your marriage is your responsibility not test maybe you had lack of communication you had lack of respect maybe you did not do your obligations maybe she didn't these are not related to a stiharis should I get married or not go ahead go ahead how to maintain this marriage this requires extra work from your side and Allah Knows Best"
