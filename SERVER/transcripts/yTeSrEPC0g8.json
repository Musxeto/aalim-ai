  "title": "Father in law touched with lust, her marriage invalid? Hurmat Al Musahara authentic? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh my question is uh in hanafi maab they say that if a father-in-law touches her daughter-in-law or looks at her with lust the daughter-in-law's marriage with that man son becomes unlawful due to musar and I have heard that in M Abba and Abdul razak there are some kind of hadiths like that those narrated from T and and this book has been recked by sh a are this hadiths sah according to the scholar of had to my knowledge the answer is no these are not authentic and these are not even classified as meaning that this is not the word of the Prophet Alat not alone that it is weak it is not attributed to the prophet so the ruling of making such a marriage invalid and breaking such a marriage is not related to Quran to the Sunnah why are these guys so adamant on making this something in Islam it is not part of Islam imagine a father-in-law hates his son's Mar marriage to this woman so he goes and touch her in an unlawful way and this means that the marriage is broken so anyone who doesn't like his sister uh his uh uh sister-in-law his daughter-in-law will ask the father-in-law to touch her inappropriately or to think of her in an appropriate way and the marriage is dissolved what's the fault of the man and his wife what is their fault where is in Islam their held accountable to some sick pervert touching her or thinking of her lustfully come on what kind of religion is this this has nothing to relate to Islam and they insist no we have this yeah go and get a life don't destroy people's marriages I have hundreds of counseling sessions coming to me asking for the ruling and people crying and weeping and don't we don't want to leave our spouse we've been married for 16 17 years we have five children and just because my father-in-law did something inappropriate just because her brother did something inappropriate my marriage is dissolved my family is broken my kids are lost what kind of religion is this yet these people insist on it I don't know if this is is in the core of the Hani maab but I don't have to even research it why because I'm a Muslim who relies on Quran and the Sunnah not on whatever Tom Dick and Harry says with all du respect to Dom and Dick and Harry and the old uh the ogs as they say I have no problem in that but no one can shove down my my throat something that is not part of Islam and every Muslim should follow follow this not their sects or their school of thoughts or whatever people say in this book or that book yeah we have the easiest and most purest of all religions on Earth with the references to the Quran and to the authentic Sunnah if the prophet said thisat we say we adhere and Obey and follow but anything else no we don't adhere we don't hear uh follow and we do not comply with until it coincides and agrees with the Quran and the Sunnah otherwise it's rejected I hope this answers the question"
