  "transcript": "but Bertrand says is it permissible for a woman to broadcast her voice without showing in the face it's an issue of dispute I'm inclined to say that this is not permissible because out there there there are a lot who are sick and perverted that would be influenced by the beauty of your voice and the content that you're giving and they might even fall in love with that so better to be safe rather than to be sorry and this is all the time we have until we meet you in Charlotte next Monday is it yeah I live in fear Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
