  "transcript": "uh she I had a doubt regarding uh paying or giving s to Mid for the renovation the Masid is just next to my door where we usually go and pray all our for players but the doubt I have is because it is it does the Innovations like the M like the entire LEL they decorate the entire Masid with lights and uh the entire month after uh every prayer they have M and they have congregational Dua after every so since they do all this B uh is it okay for me to I mean give some charity for its renovation since the renovation is now going on uh they asking me for money so I just want to make sure about this and then pay them as long as this Masjid does not stand on endorsing shik then it is alhamdulillah a message for the Muslims despite the fact that they're doing Innovations these Innovations are prohibited in a major sin but these are not shik or kufur if they need help to renovate or to fix the lights you may help them because Muslims still pray there and their prayer is accepted for the sake of Allah but if there is another Masjid that is a Masjid that follows the Sunnah no it is best to give your money to that Masjid and help them rather than help this Masjid of innovation but if you give the money to them while they're not doing kufur or shik this is permissible inshallah"
