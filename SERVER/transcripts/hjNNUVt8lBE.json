wabarakatuh and welcome to a new episode of home that alikom we finished up to now 42 hadith and hamdulillah and we have hadith number 43 on who would give us the honor of reading it Kodama narrated Aisha read Allah on her the prophet sallallaahu Salam and I used to take about from a single port while we were Junu in a set of major sexual defilement during the menses he used to order me to put on an is our dress one below the waist and used to fondle me while in aitikaf seclusion in the Masjid he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I was in my periods minces Bihari this hadith Maharaja may Allah be pleased with her is disclosing three of the etiquettes that we would not have learned other than the ways of the wives of the Prophet Allah so strong because definitely a worker omar osman ali none of them knew what was happening indoors so what are these etiquettes one we spoke about this before and that is that the prophet sallallaahu are you seldom used to perform rustle with mother aisha from the same container and this teaches us a number of lessons 1 the intimacy between the spouses and the love shared between them two that taking water from the same vessel would not make it impure as some people think men may think that if a woman not in her purity puts her hand in the vessel the water would be rendered as nudges well the doing of the Prophet Adam and his wife meant that this is the wrong conviction this is the wrong idea thirdly that no one can look at your private parts no one can look at your IRA except your wife and vice versa and this we learn from this hadith and we learn how wrong it is to say that it is not permissible for them to look at each other they narrate a hadith which is weak that I as I said by Allah he did not look at me and I did not look at him but this hadith is not authentic and a lot of the scholars use this to say that no they should be modest they should cover themselves he if I cover myself from my wife and she covers herself from me do you encourage me to go and look somewhere else this is my halal this is my wife and it is permissible for me to look at her as it is permissible for her to look at me the second thing is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam while and her menses would not seclude her would not make her stay away from him on the contrary the Prophet is teaching us that if a woman is in her menses though intercourse is not permissible as mentioned in the Quran until she is pure and she showers or she takes a whistle however it is permissible for the husband to bundle with his wife and to enjoy one another without having intercourse and that is why he used to cover the area sallallahu sallam he used to instruct her to wear and is armed which is a garment that is worn from the waist down so covering the restricted area and other than that the sky is the limit and this is an etiquette that the Jews were not used to when the Prophet came to Medina everything that the Jews used to do the Prophet ala Sasaram did not follow them because they used to get the women in their menses out of the house they would not sit with them they would not sleep with them they would not eat with them they used to consider them to be filth and nudges to be kept away Islam came and said no no this is not acceptable at all first of all the menses is something decreed by Allah it's not the woman's fault second of all what you're not permitted to do is intercourse and that is why some of the Companions went to the Prophet when they saw that he goes against the Jews and everything though they said o prophet of Allah the Jews don't have intercourse with their women while in the menses shall we do and the Prophet our Islam was outrageous said no this is forbidden which means that this is a divine instruction it's not from the Prophet he just wants to go against the way of the Jews no because the way of the Jews was wrong and the normal way is a woman in her menses needs compassion needs love needs care needs to know that her husband is not using her only when she's pure no he has to embrace her he has to fondle with her to show her the love he has for her and the third portion of the hadith that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam while in arity calf and ehtekaf we know is seclusion thirty calf is to be in a Masjid not necessarily in the middle of the desert with no water and alone but to be in a masjid where people pray though the Prophet is salat wa salam while in seclusion when did he make his Attica huge Willie in the last 10 nights of ramadan but he did it in the first ten nights and he did it in the middle ten nights and finally he did it in the last ten night and also he made it in shewhart once he got angry with his wives because when he saw that they were all making a tea coffe with him and each one is building at in the Masjid he knew that this was not for Allah and there is a part of their jealousy they want all to show that they are with him so he told them take all these tents out I'm not making Attica but he made it up in shewhart afterwards so the Prophet while in is Attica he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I was in my period while I was in my menses now Kali tell me what do we learn from this part not the woman cannot enter the Masjid when she is in her menses but this is exactly what I wanted to hear because even in Saudi Arabia a lot of the women neglect this fact and we hear a lot of Diaries a lot of so-called scholars saying no no it's okay to enter the Masjid if you're going to listen to a lecture or to learn something or to do have Quran and this is completely prohibited this is the choice of a ship of the Aziza minbars beneath a mean and all the trustworthy scholars from this Hadees not from the thin air the prophet alayhi salatu salam while in seclusion instead of asking i should to come and wash his head he used to get his head out of the machine because he knows that it is not permissible for a woman and her menses to enter the message not only that there is a hadith where the prophet re saw salaam instructed mother aisha while in ehtekaf to give him a towel or a piece of cloth Cumbre and she said o prophet of allah i have my menses and the prophet said i know your menses is not in your hand meaning that you can enter your hand but your body cannot and that is why the prophet said you can give it to me but you cannot enter the message to give it to me so this is an important issue that we all have to any pay attention to do we have any questions or we move on none of you have any questions of menses verse not moving on to hadeeth number 44 we'll read that to us a volunteer yes brother narrated I shall ready Allah and her the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam used to lean on my lap and recite the Quran while I was in my menses this hadith is regarding the prophet alayhi salat wa salam leaning on mother Asia's lap and reciting the Quran remember previously we said the ruling on putting your feet in the direction of fibula reciting the Quran were you sleeping all of this we say that this is bad etiquette now the Prophet is doing this with a woman with her menses leaning down or maybe putting his head in her lap and reciting the Quran all of this is permissible don't make things difficult as long as they were not made difficult by the Quran and Sunnah and there never are difficult things about the Quran Sunnah so make things normal and natural unless it is disrespectful you should avoid that other than that you cannot say that this is haraam or Haram and that is why Allah strongly said in the Quran do not say to what your tongues described to be haller or to be Haram so that you would make lies on Allah so you know what is halal is known what is Haram is known and we should stick to that and again and again and again the way we treat our spouses are on the extreme unfortunately we see this a lot either you find men not dealing properly with their wife their hard their harsh they are impolite they show no compassion and love they refuse as mentioned before to eat from the same spoon or to drink from the same glass this is one side of the equation this is not the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the other side we will mention in sha allah just after the break so stay tuned assalamualaikum and welcome back as we mentioned before the break people in treating their spouses are on opposite directions one you would find a man who is harsh and hard and impolite not treating his wife appropriately insulting her in front of her children not showing her any kind of love or compassion if she falls in front of him he says watch out don't break the tiles instead of saying inshallah nothing is wrong with you he never takes her out he never cares about her feelings he never respect her in front of her family which is all an Islamic and this is definitely not among the best of the Muslims and on the other extreme you will find a man who is a Valentino masha'Allah - vertically is caring and loving he does not eat with his wife until he puts the candle light dinner and maybe some music no music is haram but he doesn't care he he this is what he wants with his wife and whatever she says he does that for her so she is the man and he's the woman she whatever she want she wants to travel without a Muharram go my darling I love you - she wants to go and work and mix with other men it's ok I trust my wife she does this she doesn't want to add the hijab she wanted as many skirts she does this end mix free with non Muharram it's ok I trust her and this is definitely not the way of the Prophet halasana the Prophet told us that at the youth will never enter Jannah and they said what is it the youth he said is the man who allows evil to enter his house he allows ill practices of his wife he does not have any jealousy so this is a description of that now these two extremes Muslims have to be in the middle and what is the middle path the Prophet Adam used to love his wives he used to eat from the same place where Aisha had taken her bite and drink from the same place where she sipped her drink he used to race with Aisha when was the last time you raced with your wife whenever I asked the Muslims wherever I travel about this question I get a lot of answers none of them to deal with racing it deals with boxing with jujitsu with wrestling yes I wrestled with my wife I pinned her down to the ground I punched her in the nose I'm not talking about extreme sports I'm talking about racing jogging this is what the Prophet used to do a little odd Salaam and he raced with Aisha once and she won and few years later when she got more meat into her body he raised with her and he won sallallahu alayhi wasallam he was almost 60 years old when he raised her so don't look at the negative side always look at the bright side how would the Prophet I used to talk with his wives when they were in expedition 3-4 weeks traveling on the camel he used to come and talk to her he used to go to all of his wives nightly and talk to them and see what they have when what they have done and just to have the love going on this is the way of the prophet alayhi salatu salam which we are definitely missing we'll take one hadith and then go to your questions hadith number 45 are she that said I asked Aisha please be upon her what is the reason that a menstruating woman completes the fast that she abandons during a monthly course but she does not complete the prayers she Aisha may Allah be pleased with her said are you Maria I said I am NOT Maria but I simply want to inquire she said we passed through the spirit of menstruation and we were ordered to complete the fast but we were not ordered to complete the prayers Muslim and the following narration in the narration of Albahari we were the Prophet and used to get our menses but he never ordered us to offer them the prayers missed during the menses Aisha be pleased with her perhaps said we did not offer them that is a miss prayers algo hari okay and this hadith a woman Mirada goes to hashem ll be pleased with her and asks her why do we make up for the missed days of Ramadan when we get our menses and we do not make up for the prayers we missed throughout the whole year and look at the answer of Aisha she said are you hariya are you from the Huaraz who were killed in her oorah I do want them no I'm just inquiring because the people of the Huaraz would follow the Huaraz sect even their women make up for the prayers miss and the prophet described to us re so salaam how hard they are in forms of Prayer didn't he he told us that these people if you compare your prayer to theirs you would look down at yourself and if you compare your fasting to theirs you will look down at yourselves they recite the Quran but the Quran does not exceed their throat why because they worship allah azzawajal on the wrong concept they pray all night long they fast all day long but they are not worshiping allah azzawajal properly the Prophet said if you can kill them kill them because they are deviant they go through Islam and out as if you throw a pray with an arrow and the arrow goes through it and goes out other way it's exactly the same so aisha was inquiring are you among of this deviants act she says no no I'm not but I just want to know what's the justification she said this is how the Prophet instructed us so there is no justification it's compliance the Prophet told us make up for the days mister Ramadan but he did not tell us to make up for the prayers missed and scholars justified this by saying the days miss and Ramadan they're 7 then 8 the 9 maximum 10 it's once a year but the prayers miss are many and it's once a month so it's much much difficult for women to make up and that is why allah azza wajal had made this much easier for them so I think we should pose here and see if we have any questions masha'Allah okay first question brother it sounded Sheikh Salim Prophet used to recite Quran in Aisha's presence when she was having menses what about the women touching the Quran while going through menses or in Jannah what is the beginning of your question you told in one of the hadith that Prophet SAW Allah Allah yes this is what I was missing your question said the Prophet said and you did not offer salam on the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet said that his salat wa salam the most miserly person the most stingy person is the one who hears my name and does not offer salam on me allahumma salli wa sallim ala whenever you mentioned the prophets name in writing in reading in your house you always give salutation to the Prophet array salatu salam if you love him if you don't don't we forget and it is our duty to remind one another when you offer salutation to the prophet alayhi salatu salam allah will mention you 10 times with one salutation and the Prophet said is awesome the closest of you or among you to me on the day of judgement are the most who offered salutation on me allahumma salli wa sallim ala nabina muhammad therefore we always have to offer salutation on the Prophet sallallahu aleyhi why are you assalam the question is what's the ruling on a woman in the case of menses reciting the Quran the answer is the most authentic opinion is she can recite the Quran 24/7 the difference is in touching the Quran but recitation if she memorizes the Quran and she is in the case of menses recite the Quran as much as you want touching the Quran is an issue of dispute the most authentic is that she should not unless with something that considers to be a barrier like a glove or a piece of cloth and if she goes to school and it's difficult for her to use this she can touch the edges of the pages but not the writing and the busiest way is to carry a mobile phone a PDA an iPad a Samsung tablet whatever it's not advertisement on a laptop a PC whenever she needs the Quran from it it's hard for her to touch because this is not an actual Quran as you said that a woman in many situations she can't enter the mosque so but some scholars say that if she's a student or if she has to give a lecture or something like that she is permitted if it's a dire necessity or something suppose the student who's learning in the mosque who doing some hips of the Quran so can she do that and the second part is that I've heard many people saying that a woman can't even look at the Kaaba which in the state of minces okay first question is in accordance with the basics and that is even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him said to his people Allah is about to send rocks as a punishment on your heads I say the Prophet says so and so and you say Abu Bakr says so and so how do you reject the sayings of the Prophet as Salaam with Abu Bakr and Umar and likewise I will not say that rocks would fall on our heads but similarly the Prophet Anissa salam forbade aisha from entering the message because she was in the state of her menses and when she complained that I am in the state of menses how can I give you the homra or the piece of cloth he said I know it's not in your hand so getting your hand in is okay so if this teacher wants to teach with her hand and their body is outside of the machines Harold going inside the message it would be completely against the Prophet saying that is awesome so even if scholars say it's okay why should I care about what scholars say I have the Quran and I have the soon so I cannot go outside of these now one would say but she teaches in the message and she has to well she teaches because of the money or she teaches because she wants to please Allah Allah is telling her not to go to the Masjid while in the state of menses as for your second question regarding that some people say that a woman in her menses must not look at the Kaaba what happens if she looks at the Kaaba would she be burnt to death or would the Kaaba be uplifted or destroyed this is nothing to do with vampires you know you showed them the Kaaba they die we get our religion from the Quran and from the Sunnah now nowhere in the Quran nowhere in the Sunnah the Prophet says that a woman in her menses must not look at the Kaaba no way if we go back to hearsay or this person says this this person says that our religion will be diluted it would not be the Islam we know I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fear man allah assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
