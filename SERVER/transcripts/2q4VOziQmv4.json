  "transcript": "that order so then he gave here be screaming after no maroney's well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to contemporary Islamic concepts and issues I'm your host our machine in this episode we will continue our conversation on the concept of takfeer last time when we were speaking about that fear we established what that fear is the reason behind it and who is allowed to make the fear and the share give us a wonderful explanation defining for us what duck fear is the reasons and purpose behind takfeer and also who is allowed to do the fear we said that we will continue our conversation in discussing the the rules and conditions and obstacles that that one can face when it comes to the concept of the fear so let's start off by welcoming our wonderful guests share Qasim and Hakeem assalamu alaikum and welcome to the show why you can sit down what I'm gonna law he bought a car to and it's I'm happy to be here and it's always a pleasure to have you on show so the last episode you give us a wonderful explanation of how allah subhana wa tada has set down rules for attack fear we didn't get into the detailed rules and the conditions of taqueria but you spoke about people misusing that fear and you gave us the two sides that you know one side throws around took fear left and right with any bad deed that you do or any major sin actually that you do they put you in thick fear and the other side who completely denied the clear as if it doesn't exist almost and you said that a lot some high others laid down principles so let's start off a little bit with the rules of duck fear what are some of the rules when it comes to duck fear okay and unless a lot to sell more slowly like you already know Sophia my today be Hoda first of all Allah Azza WA JAL did not put to us the rules of takfeer as in 1 2 3 yes yet the scholars who look into the Quran who look into the hadith of the Prophet Isis I mean his sunnah came up with a number of rules so rule number 1 as mentioned earlier tuck fear is not something that a person simply gives away or labels others with without knowledge because this is something that allah azza wajal has preserved for him for him for himself and the prophet s restaurant is the one who is interpreting that to us and teaching and deliver elaborating on such evidences so it is not for anyone to come and label others otherwise we would be living in a jungle I don't like you I give you takfeer and in the 70s there was a group in Egypt who were notorious in giving takfeer and killing Muslims it used it was called attack fear well Hydra so they give takfeer to anyone their name was stuck here they name the group was tag fear well Hydra and they give tech fear to any Muslims who did not join them so they use the same concept of George W Bush if you're not with us you're against us and they used to rob jewelry shops and people's of savings saying that they're kafir so we can do whatever they we want they used to rape and assault women because they are careful we occurred and this is totally against Islam the concept of abusing and raping and harassing even for the kafir it's not permissible but these guys were lunatics were fanatics a better group came after them or at the same time saying that we are at work off what the Bayon we're not like them no we don't give to clear to people but we don't give Islam to people either so we are in between you name are come or come Rashid mmm you look like a Muslim but still I have to give you a test so it's a multiple question test it's a yes you have like 10 minutes answer it if you fail you're a kafir it's tired as well you know I'm just making fun of everyone to this extent they went I would not pray in this message it why are you the Italian the Imam is reading the Quran yes but I don't know if he's a Muslim or not so this shows you that there deviancy is evolving and it is based on ignorance these are ignorant they have ill intent maybe they look sincere to you but because they have diverted from the understanding of the Quran listen they have reached this conclusion so rule number one tech fear is not to be given to anyone because this is an Islamic ruling set to us by Allah and the Prophet Ostrom except those who are blatant kafir so then we have to cascade the issue further rule number two that fear is divided into two types a general type which is known as attack fear by description and this is widely spread in the Quran whoever does this is a kafir this act is covered so we are giving it's like cursing someone when the Prophet says is a lie on Allah who aquila RIBA may Allah curse the one who deals with Reba I cannot go to someone working in an interest-based bank I tell her or someone giving service and I say masha'Allah you open accounts he says yes I said may Allah curse you why are you doing this is because the Prophet cursed those who deal with Reba no the Prophet cursed are they so Salam and those who are described by the following characteristics likewise takfeer is two types one general takfeer so we say whoever prostrates to an idol is a kafir but if I see someone prostrating to an idol I cannot say PAH Abdullah is a kafir because now he's prostrating to an idol which a lot of the people don't understand and hence fall into tech fear because of their negligence of the second ruling he said yes whoever does this is confident as I agree so he's doing it at the moment I disagree because there are conditions to be fulfilled maybe yeah he may be the guy dropped his keys and he's looking underneath the idol for it and you thought that he was frustrating how can you give him takfeer without fulfilling the conditions and ensuring that the obstacles are not there we will talk about this if you wish and if there's you know we're getting to the obstacles inshallah for that yeah so these are the rules at that fear my description the fear of an individual and this is what we don't want and this is what the Muslims the terrorist groups extremist even the youngsters are easy to draw the gun they have like hair trigger fingers huh they come and say look at the rulers of the Muslim countries they do this and that they're covered so the ruler is a poet is a news you read this on their face books and the social media platforms accusing every Tom Dick and Harry of ko4 and they have no knowledge and when you tell them fear Allah we say they say we know Allah better than you subhanAllah this is the greatest sign of ignorance so the fourth rule is to identify the conditions know them and make sure that they're implemented and to identify the obstacles and make sure that they are not there because these obstacles prevent you from giving takfeer the lack of fulfillment of these conditions prevent you from giving takfeer as well and finally takfeer is a ruling given by the scholars after communicating with a particular individual of what he's doing and why he's doing it and the consequences of his action that fear is given by them accordance to what we see in this world what happens between the individual and Allah Azza WA JAL and Hereafter this is not to us so even if we give the clear to an individual after fulfilling all the conditions that he is a kafir we cannot say he's in hell because this is something only Allah knows about but we are told to judge according to what we see and I'll give you a third and final example I hope I didn't bore you to death no no I'm actually writing down some questions that have for you that coming to my mind we know that children are not accountable so we know that if a child dies that he will the most authentic opinion end up in paradise but what about if a child - of a disbelieving parents of Christians Jews whatever and he dies do we consider him to be a Muslim and treat him as a Muslim the answer is no he's five years old we say on the day of judgment he will only sha Allah go to paradise in this life he has to be treated as a disbeliever like his parents so we don't bury him in Muslim cemetery we don't wash him shroud him or pray funeral prayer though he is not accountable but we judge him in accordance to the dunya rulings and I hope this it makes sense so basically if a child dies then the rules of Jannah and burial depends on whichever religion his parents are they they conduct it but we believe that he will go to Jannah on the day of judgment that's between him and a las americano okay some of the questions that popped in my mind one of the things that you said was once the scholars see this sort of act in a person then you know they communicate with this person to you know inform him of what he's doing and then they make a decision or you know come to a verdict after that so I mean what I would extract from that is that this person has to be informed that this this act that he's doing is gopher is that is that the case here that for example if I see him doing an act that's good for and then I communicate with this person or and not me but as Islamic scholars they communicate with this individual to figure out if this person's intention or does he even know that this act is go for is just uh well actually it has to be communicated if there is room for doubt for example there are things that totally get a person up to the fold of Islam so if someone for example sees almost half and he knows that this is almost half and he says look at this or add he puts it on the ground and he steps on it so he knows this Quran and he's telling everybody that this is Quran there's no justification for this this is a full-fledged kafir on the spot you don't have to say what was your intention was it to get like couple inches higher or it was it to reach out for the show no there's no excuse if someone curses Allah or mocks the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam or denies an eye of the Quran it says yeah this is I have a Quran I don't believe in it so definitely that this is blatant cover you don't need justification for it most cases of cover you have to clarify and you have to a give and take that's why there is the concept of esta Taba this is the request of asking for forgiveness of asking for repentance of an individual so esta table is not for me I go to a specific individual who's been accused of a sin or of an act of apostasy or Cofer and I give him a ste Taba the jurors usually give him three days to change his mind so for example a person doesn't pray he prays said I don't want to pray you don't believe in the pillars of stem just I believe in the pillars of Islam but I don't want to pray I will chop your heads off because you're an apostate he said I'm not gonna pray so we lock him for three days to give him chance to reflect after three days he come on pray this is one of the pillars of Islam you're not a Muslim if you don't do it say I know but I don't want to pray in this days after Easter tava he is - beheaded because he's a full-fledged kafir even if he admits it leaving prayer and this is the only deed that leaving it nullifies Islam nothing else notifies us them what leaving such a deed this person is a full-fledged kafir other than that maybe he has obstacles to prevent us from giving him takfeer so we have to interrogate him we have to communicate with him why did he do this explain yourself we showed him the evidences maybe he was ignorant etc so these fall under the category of fulfilling the conditions one two three four five and ensuring that these obstacles do not exist because there are obstacles that prevents us from giving tech-free to that individual well I have one more question in sha allah but before we go for that question we're gonna go for a short break and after we come back from the break we're gonna continue with questions dealing with the conditions of takfeer and then we'll get into the obstacles and the conditions that are there or barriers that are there we can say for when a person is doing takfeer or somebody else so stay tuned Oh check I was wondering can I ask you a question be my guest can I make HT had on my own astac fear and Islamic concept our Salafi is a sect do I have to give Dawa to people and is interfaith dialog Haram now hey this is not one question these are important topics and issues that require we sit and discuss them inshaallah thoroughly actually why don't you guys join us for these discussions on contemporary Islamic issues and concepts welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on header TV now before we went for that short break we were speaking about the rules of duck fear we said when we come back we're going to continue with the questions on the different categorizations that the share' gave when it comes to the types of duck fear and then we said we will get into the barriers of the obstacles that that are in the way of a person that is about to do took fear so chefs one of the categories that you mentioned was the clear by description meaning that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala gave a certain description and said you know this act is good for now the question might come to mind is that what about a person who doesn't know about this act he doesn't know that this act is gopher or even this act is bida or whatever it may be he doesn't know he thinks this is a perfectly legitimate Islamic act and maybe this is a society he grew up in maybe this is what he learned from the scholars but he's a layman he doesn't know that this is good and he commits this act does he become a kafir or is the act cofrin the person is still Muslim it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that a law does not hold people accountable until they know well McCune Mahadevan had done a battle Allah would not torment a group of people or a nation until he sends to them a messenger and the messengers job and role is to inform people of what to do and of what not to do and this is the most authentic opinion because it fits our laws fairness and justice and another question that usually comes to mind is that if there were to be a group of people in Siberia or in Alaska or in a far remote area in the jungles of Africa or the Amazon who had never heard of anything related to Islam what is the ruling on them to us we say that they're kafir you remember you're either a Muslim or a non-muslim hold on Muslims are kafir so we treat them in this life as kafirs we don't give them salaam we don't pray for them that allow it forgive their sin however we know and acknowledge the fact that those who do not know those whom allah azza wajal did not send them the sufficient knowledge knowledge to be accountable they'll come on the day of judgment and they'll be tested and tried accordingly to be decided whether they go to heaven or hell so this includes those who did not receive the message those who were deaf blind and could not communicate so there are no means of knowing or learning those who were insane since puberty okay they're not accountable but we have to decide whether to put them in heaven or hell and the likes on the day of judgment the hadith states that Allah Azza WA JAL when they come and give their excuses of being ignorant of not hearing of not meeting the messenger Allah would tell the Hellfire to send something like a big snake and Allah tell them enter it and those whom Allah Azza WA JAL wilt that they would be from the people of paradise they will enter it though their seeing it's from hell and it's taking them to hell but because of their compliance of Allah's order this means that they're believers and it would take them straight to paradise those who use their logic or hesitate and say how can we enter hell and we see it's blazing fire these are disbelievers because now it's the only command that Allah has given them and they've seen heaven and hell yeah you don't have to think twice so because of their refusal it will take them forcefully and they will be among the people in hell very interesting now something that you also mentioned in the first half of the program was that there are obstacles or barriers before one can even go and do touch fear now or what we want to do is discuss at least some of these barriers and some of the major obstacles if you can do that for a sec oh okay we well let's go for there because there are conditions yeah and there are obstacles and usually they're interlinked so one of the conditions is knowledge so the obstacle is ignorance so if a person he was ignorant of the ruling I cannot give him takfeer and I'll give you an example in the sahi a man gathered all of his children and family while he was at the time on his bed the deathbed and he said how was I with you and they said you were the best of fathers the best of husband the best of so-and-so them the man says by Allah I was a sinful person and I want you after I die to criminate me cremate me the word is to cremate me and to take my ashes and scatter them on the top of the mountains and the bottom of the valleys on the oceans and listen to what he justified this he said because by Allah if Allah was capable of bringing me back he would torment me and torture me severely so after they did what he they asked them to do Allah or did that the the the top of the mountains and the bottom of the valleys and the oceans to gather his remains and the man was standing in front of Allah so Allah Almighty and this is the Haditha Allah Almighty says what caused you to do what you had done my servant and the man says fearing you o Allah and then Allah says to his angels I have forgiven his sins taken to paradise now the man declined or denied the fact that Allah is capable of resurrecting him after being cremated and throw Deauville all over the place but he did not do this except due to his ignorance and this is why Allah accepted his excuse and admitted him to Jenna so ignorant is quite important yeah should I go on or yeah okay so the first one what I understand is knowledge and ignorance since the person is aware that this act is gopher right then it's a different story if he doesn't even know like the the hadith that you mentioned that you know even though he said something that's good for saying the Allah subhana WA Ta'ala but he said it out of the fear of Allah Samanta he didn't know that this act was good for and he had sincerity in him and allah subhanho wa taala you know forgave him for that sincerity that he found in him so that's the first condition we got up first in an order but that's one of the major condition yes what would be and and this would also fit the example that some people ask what about those who worship graves go goats who go to Spears and saints and ask them for intercession and do this and do that what is the ruling on them would their ignorant be part of the obstacles that would prevent us from giving them that fear no answer is yes because they don't have knowledge so this is one of the things now the other obstacle would be misinterpretation so the person is not ignorant but he understood something in a wrong way so his misunderstanding would block us from giving him takfeer okay and it's similar it's similar to ignorance as well but in a different way so he he doesn't understand the concept he misunderstood it correct example odama even him alone one of the Companions of the Prophet exorcism at the time of Omaha Bob the second caliph the Companions found him drinking wine and the guy drank wine and was wasted it was drunk so they didn't know what to do what is this he's a companion of the Prophet as a son and he's drinking so they told her OMA about him so I'm gonna be Allah be pleased with him told them to ask him and interrogate him why did you do this because it's an act which is a major sin but it is unexpected from someone in his caliber as a companion so he said that there is a verse in Quran chapter 5 certain mérida verse number 93 it's a long verse then I don't think I'm going to read the translation but it simply says that there is no burden on those who are righteous and believing and and and kind no matter what they consume if they were righteous and right and so on so and so so he said Allah says that there is no burden on me no matter what I could consume now he did this out of misunderstanding the verse the verse was revealed when the people in the Battle of orchard started thinking of their brethren who were martyred and they were martyred before the prohibition of wine so some of them went to battle with faces of wine in his stomach because it was permissible there's nothing wrong in it he wasn't doing any Haram so there's no prophet of Allah they were martyred with traces of alcohol of intoxicants in their bodies so Allah revealed this ayah saying that there is no fear on them because they were righteous they were practicing and it wasn't prohibited at the time so Omar when he knew of his justification may Allah be pleased with him sent to his companions and he told them to explain it to him and then ask him do you think that wine is halal or Haram if he said it's Halong chopped his head off he's a kafir but if he said it's Haram yet due to this justification I can drink it then flog him 80 lashes so he admitted that it is haram and they flogged him 80 lashes so misinterpretation can be one of the excuses of preventing someone from falling into that fear thank you very much we've come to the end of the program now it's it's a hundred that we were able to cover at least two major obstacles to give the viewers an idea of what are some of the conditions and obstacles when it comes to thick fear dear viewers I'm hoping you guys benefited a lot from these programs inshaallah keep joining us for more contemporary Islamic views and on contemporary issues and until then may allah subhanho wa taala bless us all assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh my habits of the money you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on a Sunday he gay here is cream enough to know more honest well senior to me returned to the guidance of Allah I will set you free"
