  "transcript": "is it a must to obey my self entitled elder sister she always orders me to do things like making a cup of coffee or other things she can easily do on her home by simply getting up from bed so lazy not to even get up from her bed or the couch whole day she a lot of the times doesn't even pray Salah on time or even misses it out of laziness IE her a lot of times to avoid arguments but sometimes just say no politely due to being busy in something for examp and then she starts ranting expressing like I'm being very mannerless first of all this is not how families are run the relationship between siblings should be based on respect on mutual benefits and if it's based on one-sided Simon Says this is not normal I'm not obliged to obey my elder brother or my elder sister because they're not my parents yes my parents say go and prepare a cup of tea I would do that without any questions asked my brother says do this I say say please he does not have the right to order me around and boss me around for his own interest just because he's older than me it has to be mutual respect so the sister Cooks cleans irons does the home Shores for me when she tells me I need you to drop me at this place or to to bring this for me from the grocery shop I would say with all pleasure I would do that and I would love to do that but if she's just bossing me around no I'm not obliged to obey her at all let her do whatever she wants to do"
