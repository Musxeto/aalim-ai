  "title": "Is repentance still accepted when sun rises from the west & when we are about to die Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so check uh we know that uh that one of the conditions of october is that that tawba should be at the time when it's accepted if it is any time after then it doesn't benefit the one repenting and that time repentance accepted is before the sun rises from the west and before the time of death so my question check is if the sun rises from the west but a person is still alive and wants to repent is the repentance of the person accepted the hadith clearly states alongside with the ayah of the quran that once the sun rises from the west repentance is not accepted because there are two times that repentance will be rejected and not accepted a time that is general for the whole public and that is when the sun rises from the west this inaugurates the beginning of the day of judgment so there is no repentance accepted and the second time is individually calculated and this is for each and every one of us when the soul is exiting the body so on his deathbed when he is dying and then he says whoops i think time's up game was over so i'm going to repent no the here he is not his repentance is not accepted and allah knows best you"
