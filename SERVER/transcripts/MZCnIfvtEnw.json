  "transcript": "to there is this new document that France demands foreigners to sign and it contains a lot of bad things like engaging to respect secularism and homosexuals rights uh however however this document is not obligatory for like certain people coming from certain countries and they have warned uh and they have warned some people I know to not sign but there are still a lot of them that I know that I didn't work and I'm afraid that if I do if I don't like I will sinful like should I tell every single one to not sign or like it's who cares about these documents with all due respect such documents are only for legal purposes it's like the agreement you sign when you download an app or you buy new software or you would like to get a service they have like 10 pages saying that if you do this if you do that if you do agree who cares your laws and regulations that go against Islam we don't care about it we sign it because we don't care about you all who cares so don't make a fuzz of such things now if you have a legitimate reason to go to such countries yes but sign it and move on WE resent all what they call for we hate all what they call for and they are the biggest Hypocrites on Earth the Geneva Convention the whatever uh International laws all applicable to the Muslims but non-muslims they could kill you they could Slaughter you they could skin you alive they could rape your women they could displace your children they could kill 20,000 children in Gaza no problem 45,000 and Rising killed since that day and no problem they're Muslims well you can kill them but to do something else if the Muslims open their mouths all hell break loose no this is illogical so who cares about their documents or what about they say the hell with them all"
