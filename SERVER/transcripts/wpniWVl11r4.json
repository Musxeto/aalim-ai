  "title": "Is it permissible to eat stunned meat ( in the west ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um um in the past I asked you about the ruling eating stunned meat and um here even though Germany is a Christian country unfortunately it is um they mandate that the meat should be stunned before slaughtered and there are sh here that they prohibit eating meat here but there are people I know personally they just unfortunately don't care and they just want to insist going to this restaurant like so so my question is are these people who don't care and putting thems at risk eating this these meat where it could be dead meat be held accountable now the question is CD to you is when the animal is stunned is it dead or only drowsy um dry then this is the 100% because the slaughtering took place while the animal was alive when does the animal become Haram when the stunning causes it to die so after it's dead like you bang it on the head with a hammer and you killed it or you Electrify it and it's dead then you come and Slaughter it this is this is Haram this is dead meat but if you stun the animal or the chicken and it becomes drowsy so that's it's easy to handle and to slaughter this is halal without a problem inshallah and I hope this answers your question"
