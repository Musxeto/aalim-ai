  "transcript": "how to be patient when you look at your calamity and compare it to other favors and blessings of Allah that has he that he has given you a man once came to a scholar and said scholar Allah has tested me with poverty and I'm poor he said I'll give you a hundred thousand for one of your eyes I said of course not I'll give you a hundred thousand for your arm I'll give you a hundred thousand for your leg and the guy says You're crazy I'm not going to give you any of those so mashallah you have billions you have millions of on you and you complain that Allah is testing you with poverty Allah has given you so much and most of the people unfortunately show their ingratitude I'm not thirsty by the way yeah I always ask people describe this glass some say half full some say half empty it's the same glass correct those who say have full are the appreciative people they always say Allah you gave me half full class I know people who have no water in their glasses I know people who don't have glasses to begin with so they're always content and happy like those you go to and visit in poor areas gave us everything gave you what you're paralyzed you're blind you don't have a roof on your head you don't have food on the table so yes but Allah gave me so much this is weird and those who say it empty they're always bitching and whining excuse my friendship they're always complaining why why not full I know brothers who have six or seven glasses they have bottles bottles they have tanks so they're never appreciative to what Allah has given them when you compare what you have with those deprived you'll always be on top and be grateful and be thankful always say alhamdulillah for what for what Allah has given you if your Calamity is in your wealth say alhamdulillah is not in your body sure I've lost my business okay would you like to give you back your business but lose the ability to walk to be paralyzed no sure how would I do this no no I'd rather be poor but be able to walk be able to see be able to eat if your Calamity is in your health praise Allah azzawajal that it is not in your religion the worst of all calamities is in that in people's religion to lose every single penny in your pocket to lose your wife and your children to lose everything you possess but to maintain on Islam is better than to keep it and lose your Islam why because at the end of the day you're dead we are all Walking Dead when are we going to die huh how old are you Uncle he says I'm 90. so how long you think you're going to live I've heard of no he lived 950 years so I think I have another 860. come on you're dying everybody thinks that I still have some overtime I have spare time maybe another 10 years every 20 years at the end of the day what will happen you're dead so when you manage to understand that the best and most valuable asset is your religion whatever you lose is okay alhamdulillah I pray five times a day I pray fetch your own time I pray with you I fast I give charity and I'm content with whatever Allah insha Allah when you look and compare these calamities and see how it materializes into good deeds and hasanat then you will be happy because when you come on the day of judgment you will find mountains and mountains of Good Deeds um who's this it's yours I I think I'm in the wrong chamber I I didn't do all of this yes you did you were tested and you were patient and all of this is yours because you're of your patience and what helps you tolerate calamities as we have a little time is that if you tolerate a Calamity then you'll be rewarded but the Calamity will remain and if you don't tolerate it you will be sinful and the Calamity will be the same a man loses his son he's one of two either he's going to be patient or not those who are patient would say and his content you lost your son aren't you sad and I'm weeping but I'm content Allah chose the best for him and alhamdulillah he did not make many sense so inshallah he will await for me in Jannah and Allah will substitute me with something better and this is Allah's decree and uh ortainment so I'm happy with that is his son going to come back to life no but he's rewarded the other one starts banging his head against the wall tears his clothes slaps his face complains objects why me why my son why not my neighbors why not my friends what did he do to you what did I do to you and he keeps on complaining and objecting for a whole month what happens after one month he comes down he forgets business as usual he goes to the gym he eats he drinks he enjoys life as nothing has happened is his son coming back to life no but he's sinful and he will be punished for his uh way of behavior and among the greatest of all favors and blessings of Allah upon us that calamities do not continue they must end imagine how many calamities have passed by you in your life and you remember oh in that year this happened I lost my job I lost my wealth one of the business partners cheated me and took off my money I was afflicted by this I was incarcerated uh now alhamdulillah everything is fine calamities do not continue they must come to an end and this is why Allah says in the Quran so verily with hardship there is relief verily with hardship there is relief two reliefs with one hardship so definitely you will win if you are patient"
