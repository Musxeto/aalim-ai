  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] our foreign lesson we talked about the seven conditions of trading that are required in order to make the transaction valid so we talked about the agreement or the consent between the two parties involved which means that if one of them was forced or was not at agreement then the transaction is not valid we also talked about the conditions required in the person buying or selling in that he has to be an adult he has to be sane he has to be rational and he has to be free so these are four conditions required thirdly we talked about um the seller being the owner of the product he's selling and it is not permissible to sell something that you do not possess that you do not own fourthly we talked about the product that is being sold in that it should be something permissible to use and that has benefit in it without a necessity and we talked about this definition and what are the ins and outs of it and we stopped at number five so num the fifth condition is that what is being sold has to be possible to be delivered to the buyer because if you do not have the ability to deliver it then this would be a form of and the transaction of means that there is some sort of ambiguity some sort of deceit and this is not permissible in a transaction for example i and you we go to a big lake and i tell you that there are thousands of types of fish in this lake would you like trout fish you said yes indeed i do so i said okay i'll sell five of those for an x amount of money and you say okay i buy it and you give me the money and then i tell you okay here's the lake go and fish i'm selling you something that i'm unable to deliver for you how is it possible that i'm selling it to you if i tell you look at these pigeons in the air they're yours for five dollars and you give me the five dollars and say okay go ahead and catch it if you can this is not permissible whatever is being sold must have the possibility and the ability to be delivered to the one who bought it otherwise there is rare and this is not permissible the sixth condition is that the subject must be known must be identified if i tell you i'll sell you whatever it is in this wallet for 10 euros now there is a possibility that there is a diamond necklace in that wallet that costs 10 000 euros and most likely there is nothing in that so this kind of gambling is also and if you notice that all the conditions of haram transactions revolve around three things around riba around transgression zone so if i sell you separately i have a camel and the camel is pregnant so i tell you i sell you what's in the camel's belly for a hundred euros and you buy it can be born dead it can be a twin it can have any defects in it buying something you're not sure of you don't have a clear idea of what that thing is this is not permissible likewise selling milk before you milk the cow a few different types of transactions by name which the prophet assad prohibited such as hassat and hassan is a pebble a small stone the arabs used to say throw your stone and whatever it falls upon it's yours for one you for one euro so this kind of ambiguous transaction is haram other interpretation for that is to hold the stone and you say throw it as far as you can as far as it reaches this land is yours for a hundred thousand euros again this is ambiguous you can be weak and only drop it for two meters and you can be very strong and throw it for hundreds of meters so such ambiguity is haram in islam likewise when i come and i tell the seller or the buyer either one he says whatever you touch is yours for ten dollars and usually it's a dark place so he just puts his hand on whatever he can touch and then all of a sudden discovers that he landed a jackpot and he touched something very expensive or that he only touched some junk or trash so this is also haram likewise when we agree whatever i toss and throw to you you will buy it for ten dollars so i can throw something cheap i can throw something expensive this kind of transactions are totally prohibited in islam finally the seventh condition is that what is being sold should be defined and the price should be clearly stated so before we depart i must tell you what i'm selling you and you must know what you're buying at the same time you must tell me how much you're paying for and i must accept that it is not permissible to say i sell you my mobile phone and you say i accept so now we know the mobile phone but how much is the price we don't know and we depart and leave the following day i say where is my phone i said where's my money so you give me fifty dollars no i was hoping for a five hundred dollars no this is too much i can buy a better virgin a newer one and we get into dispute islam prohibits such disputes you have to be clear on what you're buying and what you're selling and how much you're paying for that likewise if i tell someone listen i'll sell you my mobile phone for a hundred dollars i said yeah i accept here's a hundred dollars and then i bring him an old 1995 nokia maybe so what is this so there's a mobile phone this is like 25 years old and this is not considered even to be a phone it's considered to be a fossil maybe he said this is all what i have we get dispute so he has to know exactly what you what he's buying the specs the color the looks of it it's not sufficient for me to go to a butcher's shop and say i'd like to buy a sheep he said i have sheep he said okay how much he said 500 and i give him 500. what is the weight of the sheep is it a male or a female how old is the sheep all of these render the transaction invalid because i must know before we get into this contract so that i would not feel i was fooled so many times in arab countries where they don't have a meter in their taxis you go in a taxi or in a cab and you say i'd like you to drop me at such and such place how much is it get in no problem we won't dispute don't know how much no no no problem don't don't don't worry about it you get in when you reach your destination the guy says i need a hundred and he said this usually people take ten so no this is too little and you start to fight you get someone to work in your apartment a plumber how much you gonna charge me for fixing the faucet no no no problem don't worry it's nothing and after he finishes he asks for a hundred where i see that he only deserves ten so you have to be clear you have to be clear from point one from the very beginning that this is the task this is the payment this is a product i wanna sell and i wanna sell it for this much and there's no ambiguity you can see and tell and examine it in front of your eyes these are the seven most important conditions in order to make a transaction legitimate and halal now the following paragraph deals with the concept of purchasing items in installments so some people say that this is haram and riba why they say riba is lending you a hundred in exchange of 120 in installments so likewise if you buy a product when you buy it through installments you pay much more than what you pay when you buy it in cash i said this is true but there is a difference between reba and buying things through installments riba is cash in exchange of cash so there's no benefit for the community it is exchanging money with money and this is clear river no no dispute in that while selling in installments is selling an actual product for an agreed amount of money there's no ribbon in it i'll give you an example tom comes to me and says how much you are selling your mobile phone and i say a hundred dollars dick comes five minutes later and says how much you're selling your mobile phone and both are paying cash i said ninety dollars does tom have the right to object and say why do you sell it for me for 100 and you sell it for him for 90. no he doesn't have the right this is my product if i wish i sell it to you for a thousand you don't want to go buy somewhere else that's your problem so when tom comes to me and i sell him the phone for ninety dollars cash and when dick comes to me and says i don't have the cash so i said to him i'll take 120 dollars for this mobile providing you give me ten dollars a month and he agrees upon that there is nothing wrong in that at all because this is selling a mobile phone for a different price than another person who comes and pays cash this is my product i can sell it as cheap or as expensive as i wish and its demand and supply you don't like it go somewhere else and buy it so there is nothing wrong in that now the book mentions to us four conditions one the seller has to be in possession of this article that he's selling why are we saying this we're saying this to avoid a trick in reba so now i'd like to buy this phone which is cash 100 i go to the seller and the seller says sorry i can only accept cash and i don't have cash so i go to harry and harry says no problem i'll buy it for you and sell it to you for a hundred and twenty dollars ten dollars a month and i agree to that and we signed a contract harry does not own the phone has no interest in the phone all what he's interested in a hundred dollars in exchange for 120 dollars that's 20 profit within a year that's good business to him so this is haram firstly because he sold me what he does not possess what does he what he does not own and the hakeem of him hadith may allah be pleased with him that the prophet prohibited to sell what you do not possess so by blocking this way we close down the route that people dealing in riba use a lot of the banks even the so-called islamic banks use the same methodology you go to them you say i'd like to buy this property there they go and check on it all legit this is no problem we'll buy it for you and we'll sell it over the duration of 20 years for an x amount of money sounds good to me so they make me fill a contract and sign it committing that i won't default and change my mind i'm committed to buying it some even ask for a down payment negligible amount but it's still a down payment and i'm okay with that as well now this the scholars say is haram first of all because the bank is not interested in profit or loss the bank is only interested in profit and he did the same mistake that the prophet hasn't prohibited which is selling what he does not possess therefore he's guaranteeing the prophet as if he is lending me cash the money i go buy the property or buy whatever i want to buy but i'm obliged to give him every month a fixed amount of money with interest this is totally prohibited in hama so this is the first condition that the seller must possess what he's selling in installments it's mine i'm not going to get it from somewhere else i have it in my stores secondly to pay more than the price agreed if the purchase default if the purchaser default on some of the installments ah this means that the second condition is that we must agree on a fixed final price whether i default on payments or not whether i delay it or not this is beside the point i agreed to buy your property that you possess for a million dollars it's a big mansion and i'm giving you installments every year a hundred thousand dollars ten years we're done one month or one year i said i don't have money you have to wait for me for a while if you come and say to me okay i'll wait we all have suffered with the covered 19 outbreak and our economy is down the drain but instead of having the the final pro price as one million due to this lockdown and your delay in payment is going to be a million and 150 000 grams this is clear riba and this is totally prohibited once the price is fixed before signing the contract nothing can increase it not even a single penny so nothing is accepted whether it's inflation whether it's interest rate that's going up whether this or that the price is fixed and cannot be increased number three the set that the buyer must fear allah azza so just because the price is fixed this doesn't give you the right to delay payment and say what is he gonna do it's one million dollars one million dollars he's not gonna be able to add one single penny so this year i'm not gonna pay it off i'm gonna default maybe next year i'll pay him this is haram if you're capable of paying you must pay on time or allah azzawajal would punish you for that severely number four the seller may not retain ownership of the goods after the sale so that we do not enter in a transaction of aina which is a haram transaction and a trick for riba what is reina arena is when you come to me and say hey listen can you give me a loan nope i don't give people loans it's a waste of money and time i give me a i give you a loan i don't know when i'll see you again and i would be freezing my money for nothing this is capitalism so in order to avoid this trick and this dilemma they introduced a trick so you come to me and say listen i need a hundred dollars in loan i said well i don't have a loan but if you wish i will sell you my telephone for a hundred and twenty dollars in installments so you pay me ten dollars a month for a whole year how is that he said why would i do that i said okay because then once you buy it for me for in 120 dollars in installments i'll immediately buy it from you cash by giving you a hundred dollars she said this is what i want i need a hundred dollars cash in my hand and i'll give him 10 a month for 12 months that's 120 for the phone sounds okay sounds fair and square the transaction is done both will go to help because of this transaction is actually riba your interest in selling and buying the phone is zero his interest in buying the phone is zero or what he's interested in in getting a hundred dollars cash all what i'm interested in is getting twenty dollars on top of my loan for him by a hundred dollars and this has by the way many many many pictures and forms for example in parts of arabia some of the arabian countries and it's found hugely in the subcontinent in india pakistan and bangladesh i need money and there's no one to lend me money so i go to a rich man and i give a rich man a proposal he cannot refuse so i tell him listen do you like my house wow man your house is huge it's a big mansion with an olympic-sized swimming pool and a tennis court and a squash court and about the building room and a home theater cinema well this is heaven man so i said listen if you give me a 10 million dollar deposit the money is yours it's just a deposit i'll rent you my home for five dollars a month i said the king five dollars a month sixty dollars a year to rent this mansion when usually the normal rent is a hundred thousand grand i said i'm on man said okay it's yours for three years five years and whenever you want to leave i'll give you back your 10 million dollars this is totally reba because the loan is the 10 million dollars and the interest the reba is living in the house for free so this is the interest one gets on such a big amount of loan though they call it insurance or a deposit and twisting the words and playing with it doesn't change a bit doesn't change it a thing at all so it is important that we are knowledgeable that we learn the ins and outs of our transactions before getting involved in it unfortunately most muslims deal in transactions business investments accounting auditing without proper islamic knowledge you know at the time of um the second caliph he used to go as a ruler into the market carrying his stick and when he whenever he sees someone who does not have knowledge in selling and buying who does not know the meaning of reba and the different shades of riba he used to hit him with a stick and kick him out of the souk of the market and he would say to him do not spoil our markets why because being there and having transactions that are haram without any knowledge would spoil the business the transaction is void someone comes in after the second event of jummah how much are the peaches there's five dollars okay give me three kilograms done deal the transaction is invalid after the second and then all transactions are void i didn't know that now you know so you have to learn your religion the ins and outs of halal transactions the conditions are there fulfilled is there any is there any wrongdoing or transgression is there any reba in it is there any haram transaction that the prophet prohibited such as which we had that just described this is a must for you to learn before you go into such transactions now we go into a different form of transaction which is haram and this is one of the major seven sins in islam and that is consuming riba or known as usury so what's the definition of it first of all in arabic reba is stemmed from the arabic word to mean to increase allah says in the quran allah comes to the charities and increases them so riba is increase in lingua in in arabic language linguistically when it comes to the definition the legislative definition of reba we have to understand the origin of riba so that when we explain it it becomes a bit clear there are two or three types of river there is something known as rebel fable river that of increase there is riven nasiya river of delaying of time and there is the river of addain related to loans we come to a hadith where the prophet says telling us that there are six categories that are mainly used in riba so it says gold in gold let me narrate the hadith for you in the section dealing with types the prophet said if gold is sold for gold silver for silver wheat for wheat barley for barley dates for dates salt for salt then it must be one for one an immediate exchange whoever gives or asks for extra uh commits usually the giver and the taker are the same so what do we understand from this these are six categories stated by the prophet and scholars looked into them and they found that two of them share a common denominator and four of them share a common denominator so some scholars say that riba is only identified in these six categories nothing else nothing less and this is the opinion of ibn hasam so the vahreh but the vast majority of schools of thought and scholars say that this is not true cascades to whatever is identified to share the same features and characteristics of these six items or categories in a nutshell it's very long discussion but the scholars came to segregate these six categories into two one that involves gold and silver two that involves wheat barley dates and salt so scholars started to look why gold and silver what is so important about gold and silver and they found that the reason for prohibition is known as effeminia which means the value of price scholar said that anything that is commonly used by the people to be known as a price of something then it shares the same riba conditions with gold and silver throughout time gold and silver were always used as a means of buying things and exchanging things so it was sort of a currency so if we humans in a community decided that this stone normal stone emeralds rubies would be the price for buying and selling and renting and leasing then this also falls under the category of gold and silver now nowadays we have currencies bank notes so euros dollars reals yens dinars dirhams these are all considered to be prices for things we want to buy or lease and we give them in exchange for such services and transactions so they share the same rulings of riba which i will come and talk about later on inshallah as for wheat barley dates and salt the man the scholars looked into it and said whoa what is this what can we find in this so they said all four categories are eaten can be stored without fearing of decay so it's not grapes grapes i can keep them for five days seven days and then they go rotten not barley not wheat not dates and not salt i can keep them for a long time storing them for a long time and the second feature or third feature is that such items are either weighed or measured by size this means that potatoes or watermelons that are counted cannot fall under this category corn can beans can dry beans and so on so now these are the six categories that the prophet prohibited us to exchange if it's from the same category unless the quantity is the same and it's hand to hand the exchange is simultaneous there's no gap in it so this or these are the six categories of riba now we go back to the definition riba is to increase linguistically and legislatively it is to increase in specific categories which we have just mentioned what are the dangers of riba allah says in the quran allah has made trade lawful and usually forbidden also allah says o you who have believed fear allah and give up what remains do to you of interest reba if you should be believers so this is a serious warning and allah mentioned in another warning that he will wage war against those who consume and deal with riba and who can stand in the face of allah azzawajal if he wages war against you not only that the prophet cursed every single person that deals with rival or has any contact with them the prophet says he cursed the one who devours usury the one who pays it the one who writes the contract between them and the two witnesses to the contract the prophet said allah they are all the same in the narration they are all cursed alike so i am the jew and the loan shark that gives people loans i'm cursed you're the one who's getting the loan to pay off medical bills or to buy a house you're cursed he's the the clerk writing the contract he has nothing to do with it right that i gave 100 000 to so and so and he has to pay it so and so he writes he's cursed and there are two male witnesses signing that they've witnessed this transaction they're not being paid for anything they are also cursed like the clerk like me who devours it like you who takes the loan and pays interest we're all in the same boat being cursed exactly like one another and this is one of the major seven sins of islam so this is something that we should reflect upon especially how much we personally are involved in such loans people say no no no i'm practicing muslim what do you mean so many practicing muslims with beards longer than mine are living in homes bought with mortgage haram mortgage and when you ask them to said wait we asked the sheikh so and so and he said it's okay because we're living in a cafe country subhanallah so he tells you that it's permissible to deal in riba with a kafir so yeah this is not haram so what about having sex with his wife because he's a catholic no this is haram subhanallah is far greater than that you and the sheikh who gave you fatwa are delusional people practicing as well having credit cards cards and borrowing with reba a couple of years ago a brother who prays with me in the masjid mashallah long beard attends classes came to me and said sheikh i'm in deep trouble said what what's the problem he said i bought something through my visa card or american express and i was hoping that i will get money from my company to pay off before the grace period but the company withheld my salary so now in couple of days the visa or the american express company will charge me riba he said why would you do something like that sallallahu i thought that i would be able to pay it off but i was wrong and may allah forgive me so many people fall into it knowingly or unknowingly so this is why you have to learn your religion this is why this course is about to teach you how to not fall in such haram transactions or at least ask before you fall into such a transaction and then tend to regret it for the rest of your life i think we will stop here and take your questions and we have like 15 of them so the first one is from abdul qadr he says in london dawn is at 4 45. am and fajr event is given at 3 45 a.m which one do we follow for praying and fasting as true dawn i'm confused everyone in london follows the 345 evan but i don't know if it's right or not i don't either know whether if it's right or not i would advise people in london to follow the region park which is the central park masjid and if they are like somewhere in birmingham they would follow the green lane masjid because these are the islamic centers in the uk of course they can follow also al-munta del islami in london among other places now i always advise people to stick to calculations because this is the calculation we are applying in saudi arabia and following and this is the calculation which our major ulama such as and others approve of and considered to be authentic so i don't see any reason why we cannot implement such calculations in the uk and allah azzawajal knows best but i know that there are extreme opinions of some of the brothers in the uk where they tend to make fajr as early as two o'clock or 2 30 a.m when other calculations are like four o'clock so an hour and a half or two hours is too much and just to follow someone out of the blue because he makes it more difficult this doesn't mean at all it is right while the um calendar or the umakora calculation is well approved by the majority of muslims so i believe that this is best to stick to and allah knows best fatima says if my sister and i want to pray separately in the same room and at the same time can we pray in the same raw leaving a small gap between us there's no problem in that you can pray in the same role you can pray one in front of the other there's no preference for that at all afiya says if a non-muslim neighbor passes away is it permissible for a muslim to visit there and to see the deceased or to give condolence to his family it is not permissible to give your condolences or participate in the preparation of the corpse of a non-muslim deceased so all of these rituals we must stay away from after they finish and they're through with their burial there's no problem in visiting their homes and giving our condolences with to the deceased family but not to participate in the bathing or in the shrouding or in the preparation of the funeral or in the burial or the accompanying ceremonies this is not permissible afiya says i know allah azzawajal won't punish for a same sin two times like if someone slaunders a woman and the muslim ruler punishes him with 80 lashes allah won't punish him on the day of judgment for the same sin but my question is in a non-muslim country government punishes a person for his crime or sin which is not according to allah's law will allah punish the person for the same sin the answer is yes the prescribed punishment in this life is a divine command so allah says to us those who fornicate you have to flog him or her a hundred lashes if the ruler decides to punish such a perpetrator with five years in jail this does not exempt him from the punishment of allah azzawajal in this life nor in the hereafter so yes this has no impact on his punishment on the day of judgment and allah azza knows best name some of the acts which are like charitable deeds other than giving money the sky is the limit the prophet tells us smiling in the face of your brother meaning the same person of the same gender so a girl smiles to a girl a boy smile so a boy this is charity helping someone who's lost is charity giving a hand to someone who cannot execute a task alone is a charity helping someone carry something is a charity putting water in the bucket of your brother when you are taking water from a well it's a charity enforcing virtue is a charity forbidden evil is a charity even the morsel you put in your spouse's mouth is a charity groceries you buy is a charity a good word of advice or a kind comment is a charity the sky is the limit we can go on until it's sunset but sunset is within like an hour and a half from now everything you do for the sake of allah is an act of charity frida says does methi break fast is it okay to pray to hajjut in the morning if i ever slept so these are two questions the first question does methi prosthetic fluid break fast the answer is no prosthetic fluid comes out or is discharged when someone is sexually aroused so if you see something that draws your attention sexually if you think of something if you touch someone your spouse you kiss her usually this is discharged and this breaks wudu and it has to be cleansed by sprinkling water or washing it and it does not invalidate or affect your fasting what affects your fasting is ejaculating semen while you're awake through masturbation through any of the other acts that simulates masturbation and would lead to ejaculating semen this invalidates your fasting if done intentionally lyric says how should we count with the finger the thicker after the for the diker that is counted 33 times and the one ten times is the form the same the answer is there is nothing nothing prescribed in the sunnah so some people say that each finger has three joints so i say subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah subhan allah subhan allah subhanallah i do this 15 times and then i do it again this is 30 then i do one three of them and that's it but there is nothing prescribed in the sunnah so even if you do subhanallah subhanallah and you do it again five and a five and that this is sufficient and it's not something that would make you loss and lose count because they're little number and you do it in a matter of minutes insha allah hasleen says is it permissible to watch a fun video in which men is uh are performing as if they are women by dressing like women's the answer is no this is one of the major sins in islam the prophet said allah may allah curse men who imitate women and may allah curse women who imitate men so this is a major sin and it's totally prohibited and haram watching it is a form of endorsing it and you're happy with that sin and this is totally wrong ailana says my parents still practice vida they never be regarding uh they're they're never be reading to listen meaning oh i think she means they're never ready to listen to me while saying them or telling them about sahih hadith in this case what should i do should i ignore them the answer is you can lead a horse to water but you can't force it to drink the elders think of us as still children not qualified to teach them or to give them advice because what do we know they are the elders they have all the knowledge and the experience so they are usually suffering from a combination of arrogance denial and ignorance if you tell them once what they're doing is wrong and they persist and continue leave them alone you've done your job it's not your duty to shove it up to shove it down their throats not only that out of my own personal experience when i was young i was so active and insisting on forbidding evil wherever i see it no matter what the circumstances are no matter how harsh the response of the people would be i thought that i was doing jihad as i grew older and wiser i hope i discovered that you can't force a horse to drink what i can do is i can learn proper knowledge from the quran and the sunnah i can walk the talk so they should be able to sense my sincerity kindness and unconditional love to them i can obtain the evidences straight from the quran the sunnah without using so and so said and the scholars of so and so country said because usually this makes people defensive so i started doing that and it wasn't long before those around me loved me respected me and most importantly believed in me so with the grace of allah i started getting calls from relatives who were full of innovation and may i may say sometimes shirk because of the super sufis they were following and the grave worshipers so they started asking me questions they started seeking my advice and now i would not be exaggerating if i can if i say that they're like uh a ring around my finger say doing whatever i tell them of course i would only tell them what is halal and part of our religion not that simon says but they've reached the extent of having their confidence in me entrusting me you should do that it's a long way inevitably and eventually you will reach there but you have to work from today don't go to innovators and people of grave worshiping grave worshipers telling them that sheikhoun islam even said they will never listen to you but show them from the quran allah says so and so no one can argue with that the prophet said in the authentic hadoop so nobody can dispute that so if you do this you will find a lot of progress in sha allah says if a family we do not know personally asks for financial help stating that they need to pay electricity and interest bills internet bills and school fees as the husband is not getting salary in the current situation are they eligible for zakat can we believe them or do we need to investigate their financial condition this depends if a family comes out of the blue begging i wouldn't give them from zakat this is allah's money allah's right in the money that i have saved so i have to be sure where i put it so if someone comes and begs beggars are not people of decency usually they can often be liars and you have a way to judge by looking and investigating so you should go and investigate if a neighbor of mine comes and asks i know his truthfulness i know that he has been my neighbor for so long and he can't lie to me i would give him without investigating but someone who comes out of the blue i don't know him i've never seen him before and he claims this and that i shouldn't give him without cross referencing and confirming habiba says i and my cousin sister we're living together in a country now i'm not working so she's the one buying the food and provisions which we both eat but her income is haram she's a non-practicing woman am i having a share in her sin although i do use to advise her the answer is no her haram earning is haram for her it is totally halal for you to eat but keep on advising her hina says my question is now a days people are talking about a series made in may allah be pleased with him is it allowed for us to watch no any film or series that depicts the companions of the prophet islam it is prohibited to watch the actor himself behaves as a companion and tomorrow's series he would be a drunkard or a womanizer no one can depict the companions as they are the best of all of this ummah after the prophet allah and we have to respect them and not involve them in such nonsense here a second question about zakat do we have to pay zakat at once or we can divide it and pay it next month no you have to pay it at once you can delay it for a week maybe or 10 days if there is a real need for that but not more than that finally abdellatif says please i want to ask what is the ruling concerning engaging in what in an online investment that is in this case you are aware of the products the company deals in and they are halal products so you invest your money and the company does the selling and buying at their offices to their customers across uh on your behalf it means you the investors are not directly involved in the sales so periodically you receive a normal percentage profit based on the level of your investment can a muslim engage in such a business the answer is yes there's no problem as long as everything is legit you're investing your money there is a share of profit and loss that is well known to you that you may probably lose your capital or parts of it depending on the business and you may get a profit and the profit is not fixed amount of money it's variable so it is a percentage of the profit that the company generally makes like it's five percent of the profit so if the profit is a hundred you get five if the profit is a million you get x y z etc this is insha allah and there's nothing wrong in that and allah azzawajal knows best so this is all the time we have until we meet you next monday with allah"
