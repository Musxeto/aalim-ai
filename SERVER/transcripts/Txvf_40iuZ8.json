  "transcript": "from Pakistan says her friend asked her this question and she made a false oath while holding the Koran and she says what should she do well first of all there is no great emphasis when you make a normal earth by Allah's name or when you hold the must have some of the scholars even went further and said that making an oath on the must have is an innovation is a bida some scholar said that this is to give an emphasis like when you give an oath after a sir or when you give an oath next to the member of the Prophet as Salam or next to Mohammed Brahimi in Mecca but this is beside the point this was not done by the Prophet as some of his companions so the act itself is not from the Sunnah and it is closer to be a clear innovation yet this does not impact the oath so whether you say verbally wallahi I didn't do this and you were lying or you put your hand on the must half and say well like I didn't do this and you're still lying it's the same thing secondly there is no expiation for oaths that are done for things that were in the past the expiation is only for the things in the future whether that you would do it or not do it so if I say wallahi I will not enter your home indefinitely or I won't have lunch with you tomorrow and then I break my oath I have to expect if I say wallahi I will bring you the money tomorrow and I don't I have to expiate but something in the past well I I didn't take the pen whether I was lying or telling the truth regardless there is no expiration even if I was lying there is no expiration because it was something in the past whether I'm sinful or not this depends on a number of factors now if someone was put under the spotlight and he was forced to swear and take an oath over something that would jeopardize his safety so someone is hiding in my room and an assailant the perpetrator is asking is there anybody in the room if I say yes he's going to kill him if I say no he says swear I said okay well lie he said no swear on the most Huff he brings up for an bring me six copies well lie he will lie he will lie he's not in the room there's no problem in that because this is something that I was forced to do and likewise if I did it dealt with my honor if it dealt with a woman under pressure from her husband who is insisting as an ignorant imbecile that she swears and takes an oath on the Koran that she didn't have any relationship before marriage some of your business what I did before marriage if he says no you have to swear by Allah or I'll divorce you if she says the truth she's gonna be divorced and her reputation would be tarnished forever no take an oath and this is forced both under compulsion you were forced to do this and inshallah this is not sinful or not knows best sada from"
