  "transcript": "question was if I were to set the alarm to wake up for Fajr and I wake up and intentionally snooze it and go to sleep and then I don't wake up until the sun is in the middle of the sky I miss Fajr so am I sinful this is in Allah's hands if you were mostly certain that when I snooze the alarm definitely I'm going to wake up within five to ten minutes before the time is over I know myself I've done it a gazillion times in this case you're not sinful but if you intentionally do this without setting the alarm again to ensure that you're gonna wake up and you know for certain that you're not going to wake up then you are sinful and Allah Knows Best"
