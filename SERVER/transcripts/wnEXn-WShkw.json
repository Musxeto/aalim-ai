  "transcript": "this email says there is a saying which is circulating the social media it says God cannot be everywhere so he created the mother what is the Sharia ruling saying and hearing such a statement this statement is a blasphemous Smith statement because it first of all attributes to allah azza wajal something without an evidence how dare anyone say that Allah did so-and-so because so-and-so without evidence from the Quran oral the Sunna are you a prophet to make such a claim do you receive a revelation from the heavens telling you to say these things of course not secondly when someone says Allah cannot be everywhere now what do you mean by cannot be everywhere because some Muslims when you ask them they say that Allah is everywhere and this is also wrong and not true Allah told us about himself in the Quran and the Prophet alayhi salatu salam described to us allah azza wajal that he is over and upon and above his throne above everything else in this existence in this universe so everything is below Allah is ocean and we know that now to claim that Allah is everywhere we have to ask that individual what do you mean by allies everywhere do you tend to tell me that Allah is not above his throne do you tend to tell me that Allah is everywhere around us may Allah so shall be exalted so he can be in this room he can be in a farm he can be in a shop definitely this is not true and this is to some scholars blasphemous they usually coat the ayah in Surat in MU J Dilla where Allah says subhana WA Ta'ala have you not considered that Allah knows and it began with knowledge have you not considered that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth there is in no private conversation 3 but that he is the fourth of them nor there 5 but that he is the sixth of them and no less than that and no more except that he is with them wherever they are so they say ok Allah is telling us that he is with them wherever they are I said yes but didn't you read in the beginning that Allah said have you not considered that Allah knows so allah azza wajal is with us with his knowledge with his sight and hearing and with his power so actually allah azza wajal is above the seventh heaven over his throne yet he can control us and do anything he wills through his knowledge hearing seeing and power over us and this is a manifestation that he is with a soprano razajin but not like those who say that he's everywhere so he's in the cup that I'm drinking tea from he's in the bathroom may Allah be exalted to suffer Allah what a tuba la so when they say that God cannot be everywhere this is questionable and this is disrespectful to allah azza wajal and when they claim that this is why he created the mother now this is blasphemous who told you that this is why he created the mother this is insane this is illogical this has no reality to it so listening to such a statement and repeating and they're circulating it is definitely prohibited Romar from Australia"
