  "transcript": "question he said he finished prostration and he raised his head from the ground then he thought that he did something wrong and he wanted to correct it so he went for procession again is it valid answer is no once you raise your head thinking that your prostration is valid there can't be something that you can correct so either your prostration is invalid then we tell you yes go back and correct it and it can't be invalid unless you did not prostrate well but you did prostrate well if you said subhana rabbi al-avim instead of subhan rabbil allah the prostration as a pillar is correct you've done it on the seven organs that we're told to do it you've done it to the qibla there's no reason for you none whatsoever to repeat it so this is not a valid thing to do you"
