  "title": "Shias use the 12 imams hadith to prove they are on the right path! - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is from Fatima she says I'd like an explanation of this Hadith because the Shia always quote it as evidence to support their arguments in Muslim it is narrated that Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam said Islam will continue until the beginning of the hour and there will appear among you 12 imams coming one after another all of them from qur first of all we as Muslims do not pay attention at all to whatever this deviant sect known as Shia say or claim because we know that they are usually blatant liars and that they are um not telling the truth and they would hold information and they twist things and one of the things that Twisted is this Hadith the Hadith states in the following words as per Muslim and says I went with my father to the prophet Alam and I heard him say this matter will not be over until 12 calips and he said khif not Imam all from quray in another narration Islam will still Prevail and be strong and in honor up to 12 cffs and in another narration this religion will still be strong Invincible up to 12 cffs in alari the Hadith was 12 Amir 12 rulers so the word Imam is not mentioned and there is a huge difference between an Imam and a Calif or a ruler because according to the Shia an Imam has an extra level of being obeyed being um an authority and religion and that he would also add more to uh um the World by being infallible they believe that their imams never make mistakes and all of this is of course not true and aifa is a ruler and he as per the Hadith rules where Islam is invincible and honored and strong and none of the 12 of the imams so-called imams of the Shia ever had this except for Ali he's the only one who held the sword and protected his followers as a ruler as a as the fourth guided rightly guided Khalifa may Allah be pleased with him and the rest are not known to have ever reigned they alone have the strength to uh uh protect their followers and specifically the last one of them number 12 who no one saw he's hidden for the past eight nine centuries as they say in a cave no one ever met him he does not exist he never guided someone who went astray he never gave a fatwa or taught something he never enforced virtue or prevented Vice he never done anything let alone to be Invincible for his people or for the nation that he's ruling he's always been hiding and Afraid and weak and cannot do anything and this is the same with the Shia they've never had any Reign or uh um a ruling that would would protect them or give honor to the is to Islam as a whole and make Islam Invincible it's all been weakness and humility and deceit and betrayals throughout the time may Allah protect this and by the way as people and Scholars say the concept of the Shia being the 12th Imam or jaia this was later on in time like on the fourth Century in the beginning the Shia were divided into Cults and sects so believed only in the IM of Ali they believed in um having only four of them such as uh Ali Al Hassan Hussein and Muhammad Ali and these are K and others said the imama continued to jaur but none of them again rained and Islam was never Invincible or strong in their under their reign because they've never reigned and again the Hadith says specifically and clearly all of them are from qur and we know that the prophet Alam was the most eloquent in speech and he was giving the concise of speech he would not say they were all from qur when he could have limited it and said they're all from Banu Hashim or even limited it more by saying all from the descendants of Ali to widen it and say from quray means that they're not from his descendants which is the fact and it is referring to khf so again we don't pay any attention to such um uh tales and lies of the Shia trying to justify their falsehood"
