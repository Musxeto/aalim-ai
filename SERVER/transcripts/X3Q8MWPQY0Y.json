  "transcript": "say it says is creating games to earn money Haram the answer is no creating games in general is hella providing that the games themselves are hella so if you create a game there is innocent it's like you know in the back in the day we used to play Atari which is the generation before Nintendo which is definitely before Playstation whatever so Atari it was a very simple game where you could play handball with a wall or with a computer where you get drones dropping bombs and you had these cannons that used to kill them when you used to play with pokum a nut pok√©mon what's it called I don't know this the thing that each the things I think it's called become a Pokemon or something like that so all of these things were innocent so if there is no music and you design such innocent games this is hell at making money out of it surely he'll add there's no problem in that but when will you make a game like playing poker or blackjack or roulette if you make a game that involves girls and boys and you design human figures and this is not permissible if you design something that provoked promotes violence and killing like this pub G in fortnight we've seen the massacres in El Paso in Ohio in different American States very sad and unfortunate but where did this violence come from from setting arms yes openly to wackos and to maniacs you can buy a gun easily the restrictions they put is pathetic but also these videogames influence the children while they're growing up so it it becomes like programming them to be susceptible to violence and inflicting harm to the others as part of winning or expressing their rage so designing such games and making money out of it is Haram and Allah as Arjun knows best"
