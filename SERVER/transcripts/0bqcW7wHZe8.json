  "title": "How to determine prayer times on plane? Going towards west, direction towards the sun Assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "if one is traveling west and the sun always seems to be in the same place does it mean that someone who is flying for 18 hours or maybe even 21 hours wouldn't pray a single prayer for the entire duration of their flight okay so you tell me nasra how do we know the prayer times when we're flying by the position of the sun then this answers your question if a person is flying westbound this means that he may not see the sun moving except in a very very slow rate so if i am to travel in the morning at ten o'clock going to kuala lumpur from saudi arabia the flight is eight hours plus i leave at 10 o'clock am i reached there almost 8 00 or 9 p.m so i would find that though have already lapsed maybe even later than that time and if i'm going back home from the east to the west i may not pray a single prayer on the plane because i'm pursuing the sun i'm after the sun so the sun is unable to set because i'm flying in the same direction so it i would reach there maybe two three hours after my takeoff though it is an eight hour flight therefore i determine the time of the prayer while on the plane through the position of the sun so in fajr time it's very obvious when it's all dark and then i see the white light or line in the horizon in the direction of the east i know this is feature time so i pray i don't need to follow any app i can see it visually in sunset the same thing goes in maghrib because it's daytime and all of a sudden it's becoming darker and darker and i can see the sun setting and boom it's it disappears it's maghrib time rohran asar might be a little bit tricky because i need to know whether the sun is in the middle of the sky going a little bit to the west so this is the time of or a little bit more this is a time of asar asia time is also easy when i see the redness at the the place where the sun had set disappears this is isha time so loharan asar is the time where you have to estimate and if you wait until it is like an hour before sunset and you pray aloha that would be a no problem because alhamdulillah you can combine you"
