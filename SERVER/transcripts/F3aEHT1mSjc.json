  "transcript": "foreign yesterday when I woke up I found myself in an embarrassing position where I could have um masturbated while I'm asleep and on that day I kept the homemade cursive on my private card before I slept so I went to check if there is anything on the cursor that could indicate that I secreted many and I found nothing but check some descriptions of the many of women said that it could be white and thin and the cursive is white so I thought it could have dried up now and I just can't see it should I take coastal line between my prayers first of all there is nothing as masturbation while being asleep because when a person is asleep the pen of accountability is uplifted so whatever he does in his sleep he's not sinful for that secondly the prophet said which means that obligation of taking a Russell only materializes when a an individual sees semen being gushed or ejaculated so if there's no nocturnal emission when you wake up there is nothing there's no discharge then there is no Russell mandated upon you thirdly women's semen is not white it is yellow and thin as described by the prophet Allah and this means that there is no obligation of Versa upon you finally whenever there's doubt we go and refer to the default I'm doubtful is this mug Pure or nudges the default it is pure until proven otherwise you are pure because when you went to bed you were pure you did not have any ritual major ritual impurity when you woke up you still are in the default state of purity until proven otherwise until we have a proof that shows us that you are in the state of major ritual impurity and this is not does not exist and Allah Knows Best"
