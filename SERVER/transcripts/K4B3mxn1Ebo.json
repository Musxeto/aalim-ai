  "transcript": "khadijah says I love my parents very much and I want to take care of them from far how would it be possible to take care of them as a girl my husband doesn't want to see my parents but it is very painful for me please suggest me what to do first of all we have to always remind Muslims that we all have rights and obligations and once I am fully aware of my obligations and rights life goes smoothly once I focus only on my rights and neglect my obligations then I have a problem secondly we have to understand that in laws are not kinship I am not obliged to contact or to see or to talk to my in-laws my wife's family as halal and Haram I'm not Allah I'm not supposed to do this it's not an obligation meaning that if I decide not to ever go and visit her parents this is not how long but at the same time it's not the best thing to do because her father gave you the jewel of his life which is his daughter so the least I could do is respect him and my mother-in-law for what they had done to me yet they are not like my uncles and aunts from my kinship whom I'm obliged to call and visit and take care of likewise for the wife herself her in-laws her father and mother-in-law are not an obligation for her to call and to be kind to and to serve this is not her obligation of course out of good behavior one would do this for on telly but it is not a must so if your husband doesn't want to see them no problem lets him rest you can go you can take the children you can visit them you can call them you can see if you can help them cook for them whatever it is needed the sky's the limit providing that your husband approves of it but do not force them to go with you as this is not an obligation upon him"
