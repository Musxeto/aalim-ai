  "transcript": "as a doula from Canada had four questions the first question is a frequently asked question a lot of those who used to be a students all of a sudden become lazy lack motivation waste their time over silly things and they feel that they're doing something wrong and whenever they try to rectify it they find that they are yawning they are lazy they are trying to they're falling asleep simply they're not being able to rectify these things so what is it the vast majority of cases that I have gone through maybe relate to the issue of evil eye and so many brothers and sisters who call me and some of them even get counseling sessions and I speak to them and I give them hints of what is happening and I asked them to do rock here and subhanallah they do rock here upon themselves I don't do repay for them I don't ask him to go to people to do rock there for them they do rope here upon themselves and three to five days it's gone this is an evil eye I remember once one sister who is a well-known Daria and she called me and she said sure I'm having this depression lack of interests of things I'm unable to give any lectures I'm unable to do anything and she started crying so I told her that this is an evil eye what's the cure okay who's the one who will cure you Alonzo Gee means this is the basics you don't have to be a rocket scientist you have to be a Muslim to know this so I advised her to go and take Umbra with her husband and after they finished the Umbra she goes and prays two Rakas next to the Kaaba raise her hands ask Allah surgery to relieve her from whatever she's suffering from drink a lot of Zemzem with the intention of cleansing her system from this evil eye a couple of hours later humbly she called and she said jazakallahu khayran I'm good as new so I believe that most cases of brothers and sisters who were good in school and all of a sudden something bad happens and they're unable to continue their progress this is evil eye it can't be from your own parent by the way them loving you liking what they see and say wow he's excellent without saying Aloha Mubarak evil eye does not have to be done by an enemy or adversary it can be done by yourself to yourself you look in the mirror you can give yourself an evil eye and you can also will either be laugh have a problem with your siblings giving you an evil eye not all out of hatred but something they see which coincides with the destiny of allah azza wajal in addition to an evil spirit that the person has and does not know because he did not say aloha mubarak it takes place so in sha allah if he does this I hope we shall learn couple of days that he'll be as good as new"
