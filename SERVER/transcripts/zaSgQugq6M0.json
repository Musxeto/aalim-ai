  "transcript": "if you sell a slave now one would say slavery is banned so yes it's bad but slavery was there and slavery is not something that Muslims should be ashamed of because people think that Oh Islam promotes slavery does Islam promote slavery there is only one means of having slavery and that is through capturing of prisoners of war if I go to Burma where they're very poor or Somalia and someone comes to me and says do you want to buy my son or my daughter he is seven years of age nine years of age I'll sell him for one hundred and fifty dollars and he can become your slave that's cheap I'll buy him take two said oh you get one free so is this halal definitely not this is a free man a free child I cannot buy the only means of slavery in Islam is true prisoners of wars none muslims disbelievers so if someone attacks my country i would the army defend my country and we get prisoners of wars what do we do with them send them to Guantanamo no we enslave them oh this is against human rights well them attacking us is human rights it's ok any no this is human rights how he is a slave he's like an animal being sold and bought and not having rights yes but this is for his sake come on how could it be for his sake when a surgeon goes to your son and cuts open his stomach to remove a tumor is this for his sake or not definitely he's bleeding he's in pain yes but this is for his sake likewise this disbeliever who was an enemy of Islam I can execute him and get it over with what what I'm giving him is an honest and decent life I feed him from what I eat I clothe him from what I wear as the prophet or the diocesan not only that the prophet alayhi salaatu them in the Quran and in the Sunnah whatever you do expiation free a slave so if I have intercourse with my wife during the month of Ramadan while fasting this is a sin it invalidates my fasting what to do free a slave if I'm driving and I kill someone by mistake expiration three asleep if I tell my wife that I don't want you and I'm not even going to touch you you an exactly like my mother then I feel remorse and sad and I would like to continue living with her free a slave if I say wallahi I will not come to your school tomorrow and then I change my mind expiration free asleep and it goes on everything in Islam three yesterday free yesterday free slave does Islam promotes slavery Islam promotes freedom for slavery but by living in our houses and looking at we at how we treat them and looking at how we worship allah azza wajal this would make them accept islam voluntary because there is no compulsion in religion and that is why the prophet Isis I'm said in the authentic hadith I am astonished I am amazed of people being dragged to paradise in Chains who would be dragged in paradise in Chains everybody goes to paradise willingly the Prophet is giving us a metaphor because these prisoners of war they were enslaved so they were in changed and these chains made them accept Islam and hence enter paradise as if they were dragged into it so this is not our topic but you have to clarify things because when people talk to you about Islam you don't know the beauty of the religion you will feel inferior you will feel weak so there so I'm sorry as Islam promotes slavery no it's not like this and always turn the tables on their heads not physically but any so that your terrorist is putting the tables on her head now we have woods we're dying always turn the tables on them by asking them to look into their own books their own religions and they'll find slavery being bought sold not through jihad through enemies as long as you can capture someone and sell it then this is permissible in Islam al hamdulillah it is the greatest religion and if you study it you know why so"
