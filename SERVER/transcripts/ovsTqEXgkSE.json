  "transcript": "[Music] the one who missed fasts of Ramadan and died can anyone else make up for his fasts secondly when family members who are old or someone who is sick and they cannot fast can they give Vidya expiation instead of fasting keeping it or keeping in mind the ayah which says and fast the same number of days first of all Allah mentioned in surah al-baqarah as we mentioned earlier in these reminders that fasting is an obligation a fixed number of days whoever is traveling or sick may make them up later on when this excuse does not exist any longer now those who continue to have this excuse permanently whether they are too weak and vulnerable to fast due to their age or they are chronically ill which prevents them from fasting and definitely prevents them from making up later on in this case Allah has made them pay an expiation for missing such days of Ramadan for every day they miss they should feed a poor person and this poor persons either being given raw food about a kilo and 0.125 grams a kilo which is half a Saur Saur is made of four wood a mood is what collects in the two hands of an individual a normal sized individual so four scoops makes us our anise R is approximately 2.25 kilograms of rice so it's a measurement of size not of weight half of it is approximately one point one to five grams of rice you can give this for every day you miss after the day is over of Ramadan the other alternate alternative is is to cook a good meal so some biryani some rice chicken some rice meat a good normal meal and you feed it to a poor person either after the Sun sets day by day or at the end of the month on read or afterwards you cook food for 30 people depending on Ramadan was 30 days or 29 days and you invite them to eat and fill up their stomachs and this is what even a bus may Allah be pleased with the man with his father used to do when he got old now what about if a person dies should his heirs make up for him now can I offer prayer for a deceased person yeah you can make dua no no I'm not asking about that can I pray two Rakas and say oh allah these two rakahs are for my deceased father there's no if my mother went into hospital and died missing seven days of prayer can I pray on her behalf there is no so can i fast under the halves well this is a technical question and the scholars disputed on it as they have disputed and most of the issues why do scholars have different opinions don't we have the same core I'm the same surname yes but this is a long topic not all of them have received the evidences so the early scholars like abu hanifa malik abu hanifa in arab-american medina shaffer II was in a raft and in Egypt imam ahmed was also in that region not all of them had printed books because after the death of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam there were four prominent companions of the Prophet Elisha - in Medina of the lab neuroma and they do not have it so people learned from them one in Kufa of the love in Massoud one in Mecca Abellana bus these are the four companions that the four schools of thought come from so it depends because after Omar may Allah be pleased with him died and in his lifetime he used to prevent people from dispersing the Companions he kept them in Medina but then he started sending few here and there and when he died they all spread around and each one had knowledge that some did not have so the knowledge that were conveyed and and delivered to a body for example was not full because he did not travel to Yemen he did not travel to Egypt he did not travel to Syria he did not travel to Horus on which is sort of like Iran the Russian countries Afghanistan or whatever so his little his knowledge of the hadith was limited now man mmm Malik was in Medina so the vast majority of the companions were there he learned from each and every one of them or those around him his knowledge in hadith is far greater that's why he has the Book of Allah ou akbah Imam Shafi I was in Mecca then went to Medina and memorized it by heart from him and Malik and then he traveled to Iraq where he met the students of Abu Hanifa and learned from them then he went to Egypt so he collected more and more and more hadith and the fact of a man mattock and Abu Hanifa Imam I met was the greatest of them all in sense of traveling so he traveled to Yemen and heard from up the reserve the compiler of amis unnerve he went here and there and collected it traveled so many long years that enabled him to be the Imam of hadith Imam of Ahlul Sunnah wal Jamaa and he compiled his huge book of Moosa Ned Imam Muhammad even my mama had been Hamburg which is well known so now again we come back to the issue why did scholars differ because of this either the evidence the CERN that hadith did not reach him it might have reached him but he does not believe it is authentic it might have reached him and it was authentic but he does not believe that it fits the issue we're talking about he says there is no evidence in it it's about another issue so the understanding of the hadith and how to implement it differs from one mm to the other and there are a number of reasons the Imam haven't aney aney allah have mercy in a soul compiled a beautiful small book translated but it is packed with information and knowledge it's called referral madam I mean in metal alum uplifting the blame from the great Imams so you do not blame them you have to understand why they differ once you read the book you'll find that insha'Allah easy so again a person dies can we fast the Prophet said that his salat WA Salam Mamata sauna and whoo-whoo-whoo whoever dies his heir must fast so scholars differ than interpreting this hadith with the authentic on its ascending so how do we understand it first of all we have to look at this individual may Allah have mercy on his soul he died when he got sick did he recover or he died soon afterwards number one scenario one a person skipped 30 days of Ramadan because of his illness sure while came the Okada came the ledger and he was still ill he could not make it up and he died before the following Ramadhan without recovering in order to make up do we fast on his behalf nope do we feed people on his behalf no why because he did not get the chance to make up and we did not get the knowledge whether this is chronic or not we were hoping and waiting and anticipating that he may recover and then make it up for himself scenario two he got sick and Ramadan he did not fast sure while he became healthy so he has from shawol till the following Ramadan to make up he can make up but he didn't because he had time and he died said oh ok in this case his heirs should fast on his behalf because he's not sinful he didn't do anything wrong he had the time frame is still extended and he had the ability to fast but he did it yet he's not sinful so in this case his heirs can fast on his behalf how they can divide it so if my father died skipping 30 days of Ramadan and my father has ten children each one of us fasting three days would do the job so if each one of us fast three days these are 30 days a hamdulillah it's done it's over and this is the most authentic opinion other than that can I offer Mondays and Thursdays for my father who has passed away no can I offer three white days fast out of a fast as Europe no these fastings are making up for what the disease did not fast only applies for fast things that are mandatory because as we know the fasting is divided into two types obligatory fasts and voluntary fasts obligatory fasts are passing of Ramadan definitely making up of missed days of Ramadan hmm fasting up of expirations wallah he I will not eat meat tomorrow and they brought me a very beautiful big piece of steak well-done black pepper sauce I want to eat it expiate I don't have money to free a slave or to feed ten poor people or to clothe them then you have to fast three days fasting becomes obligatory upon me if I break my oath so expirations of things that you have to fast if I kill someone by mistake I have to fast two consecutive months if I do the hard and so on so many expirations these are obligatory and finally if I make a vow if Allah cures my uncle and he is dismissed and discharged from hospital on his feet healthy I will fast one day now this is a vow I pledged something this is makrooh a lot of people deal with Allah like this or Allah if you make my daughter pass the exams the board exams I will slaughter sheep I will pray ten hours of night prayer I will fast a whole month what are you doing you're obliging yourself something that Allah so Jill did not oblige upon you why because you're trading you do this for me I do this for you and this is makrooh the Prophet prohibited us from doing it erase about two cinema if you already pledged and committed to it house you have to fulfill it as long as it is obeying a large the Virgin so the vows are number four these are mandatory fasting others are voluntary the mandarin mandatory fastings are the ones that you're allowed to make up for your deceased who had a legitimate reason for skipping Ramadan voluntary fastings no can do so Mondays and Thursdays white day's Arafah are sure are alternate days like the would peace be upon him all of this is not allowed for you to do so [Music] [Applause]"
