  "transcript": "only to the individual if I'm praying on my own and I don't want to recite the faat why your prayer is inv valid and to the IM himself if the Imam prays and he doesn't recite the fa so these two their their prayer is invalid the third one you can add is the m the follower who does not recite the fa in the silent prayer because he did not rehear it from the Imam so he does not recite it his prayer is invalid but the the M who's praying behind the IM in a loud prayer J then he does not have to rate the question and answer session and inshallah after recap we'll be continuing the session inshah okay we start inshallah so this is a recap of what was uh done yesterday uh we had an introduction of Quran and of the definition the benefits the types of the summary of it and this inshallah you will get a copy of all of this this is something to remind me of what I should say so this this is not enough for you to go through dependently there are books that I advise you to buy unfortunately the only book available in Arab in uh English is Dr y's book and it's called um studies of Quran or introduction to it's it's a very good book um most of it inshallah is uh correct and and uh easy to read and learn if you know Arabic there are for may Allah have mercy on his soul and this book is being taught in most universities of Saudi Arabia everyone studies this book in the universities when they study Shar also there is a very good book which was recently written by Dr fahi and is considered to be one of the best and actually most likely that Dr Yas brother y all of us we benefited a lot from it so you can tell because it is a thesis for the University so he had studied really hard to come up with this book I don't believe it's translated and I don't believe it's possible to translate it because this uh uh science is built on on Arabic so it's it's very difficult and I had a very difficult time going through the material just trying to transform it into something acceptable in English so if you go into this but again you are going through this course to have a general knowledge not specific knowledge for specific knowledge you need a sheh and you're in the wrong place if you're thinking that you are in the presence of a Sheikh shs we mean definition is not any person who comes who speaks nicely he looks like a sheh no there is a criteria for but we because of our limitation in Arabic we you know try the best we can get and this is unfortunately the best we have uh there is and history of compilation of the Quran and how it was done the first stage second stage and the third stage and we spoke also about the suras of the Quran and how they were organized the beginning of the suras and the types of it and the disjointed uh letters now this is a challenge to read uh so what do I do"
