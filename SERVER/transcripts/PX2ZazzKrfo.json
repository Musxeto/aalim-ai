  "transcript": "perfect with no pleasure other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of knife Islam here in the hamdulillah naidu who wanna start you know who on a stealthy row when I wrote you below him in Sharia and foo Sina women say yeah TR Molina may yeah ad hello fella model Ella why my you'd lil fella had yella washer do a la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah why should one no muhammadan abduhu or a pseudo sallallahu alayhe wa ali was happy women to be humble son in the day o me Dean was sulamita semen Catherine I'm a bird after praising Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and asking him to exalt dimension in grant peace to the prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam I welcome you brothers and sisters to this particular episode and it is a continuation of what we have discussed in previous episodes in regards to marriage and I'm your host Abu Musab watch the Akari and to my right is brother abdul rahim green brothers a demon army and brother awesome and Hakeem now we discussed many different issues and we praise Allah for the facilitation provided there are a couple of other points which we have to deal with for example let's assume for whatever reason either the parents are preventing the children from getting married there's financial issues preventing the marriage from taking place perhaps cultural reasons people tend to go in another direction not realizing the dangers that lie there in can you elaborate on what path that is and what is really at stake pray Allah Zena which is a shameful deed in reality allah subhanaw taala has warned us against that the desire has to be fulfilled either legally or illegally lawfully or unlawfully so the lawful way is the marriage because it is something naturally cannot keep suppressing and suppressing that desire will cause something else so Allah subhana Allah has permitted the marriage for the the people and has prohibited zina allah Xena it is this illicit relationship illegal relationship with a woman so fulfilling your desire with any woman who the opposite sex whether you are married who are not married okay because some days I think they differentiate between adultery or fornication and know it is Xena that means having chemistry your relationship with the opposite sex it is Xena and it is a shameful T so Allah subhana Allah saying well at atropos inna to see the beauty of the Quran he didn't say do not commit zina well at atropos zina okay an affair he said Martin so here in this regard Allah is telling us well at Aqaba zina do not approach the zina so anything that will lead any Avenue that will lead to the Xena to this shameful deed it's Haram prohibited in Islam Suzy so privacy is being alone with the woman because that leads as the Prophet Allah Salim said if a man and a woman having privacy or together then the third person would be they shoot the Shaitaan the devil okay so well at atropos zina so no halwa which we call it privacy halwa with the woman well at akribos Xena why we should not approach the Xena lowered the gaze because this gaze not lowering the gauge also triggers the desire Allah so Allah who created us knows this McCullum Amenia hope dooming wife Abu Perugia tell the believing men to lower their gazes and to protect the private parts so there is a link between the look and the reaction of the perfect man for the benefit of the viewers she has him because the term illicit relationship intimacy is somewhat broad and it could be understood from some that the mayor you know a touching of a woman or being with her seclusion is zina so that's why I hear this hadith explains it I mean so the eye commits adultery when you look lustful look that is a form of of zina doesn't necessitate punishment no it doesn't necessary to punishment but it is a sin on your part hmm that's why the accidental one look you will not be held accountable for it but the intentional one yes sir Han Allah and this is exactly in the Bible what a sunny Salam said he already committed adultery for his eye so the looks and chatting and sitting cause all these are ways leading to to the sinner for this they lead to the sinner so Allah is warning us to say well at akribos zina and the same way is it about the hammer do not come near to it so in the same way anything that will lead to the zina it's Haram and it should be blocked so that even you has to be blocked and as I think this point has to be mentioned and it might be a bit sensitive but I think we have to talk about it because this is a epidemic problem in the Muslim communities throughout the world is the problem of pornography what you have is when when marriage is made difficult maybe through cultural reasons family reasons one of the things that you find particularly men they start turning to pornography and this may be not just pornography with that masturbation almost is definitely going to come and this is really a major major problem this is causes serious psychological problems and actually it's one of the reasons for the very damaged marriage relationships afterwards because a man and this is research done by non-muslims that when a man constantly exposes himself to these images of women and these films he begins to think of a woman as just an object a sexual object he can't have a proper intimate relationship with a woman many of these material is becomes extremely violent and very yes distich and they start treating the woman I've had to unfortunately deal with cases like this this is a really serious problem and I think that also the other consequence of fornication itself is that when the intimate relation between the man and the woman is treated as a pastime so what they call casual sex it's just treated as an entertainment as a sport what has happened is that something which Allah has given between the husband and the wife as maybe perhaps Allah knows best one of the primary bonding factors what what is one of the things that allows a man to bond with his wife and the wife to bond with the husband on a very deep and profound level is the intimate relation if you treat this very I mean even it's cool by some religions as sacred Achatz because it's so special between the husband and the wife if you treat this as just fun and games then think about it when you do get married what is there that's going to keep you together you know I've done all of this you know what is it and this is the reality this is what you find is that this is another just beautiful aspect of Atlantis's of you see how this religion mashallah gives us such a beautiful package when you you bring it all together and you see how I lost my mother has given us this beautiful way of life it's very unfortunate that people fall into this really terrible sin and it's a sin why because it damages us individually as a society this is what Allah doesn't need us to obey Him or not it's he has no need of us we need to obey Allah cos this is good for us and this is what people should remember well Allah has said keep away from this so keep away from that it's because it's for us it's for our own benefit so who follow that path and fall into that trap what are some of the things that one should be aware of consequences of you know someone enjoying themselves without being legal a wedlock as shannon mentioned that fornication in the hadith is not limited to the actual intercourse but even things that draw you closer to that though it's called fornication of the eye education of the ear fornication of the hand when touching for an occasional feet when walking the Prophet says at the end of the hadith and once private part either verifies this or ignores it meaning that the real fornication takes place win and the course takes place and this is the major sin not that the previous sins are not so serious they are serious because there are means to the major sin allah azzawajal does not make something forbidden unless it's harmful to us and unfortunately it is widely spread among the men and among the Muslims I get so many calls and complaints from sisters from their husbands isolating themselves from the family and focusing on their internet focusing and usually if I had an example sorry to interrupt you of one brother who didn't even want to have intimate relation with his wife he would just enjoy himself with pornography he couldn't even have intimate relations with normal normal and couldn't do it but he could yeah but he was masturbating to pornography this is his problem this is how terrible it was imagine this yeah not only that I was in a European country I was moving from one city to the other for a conference and a sister cause on my local mobile and she complains of her husband who is involved in Dawa and organizing conferences and so he's not a daddy but he's so involved he's practicing brother and she's telling me that and she told me about the features that are definitely the features of someone doing something wrong which is giving her back to the wall and your face to the room so no one can see what you're doing on your laptop or Ian and he's putting the headsets and he's chatting watching things up till 2:00 a.m. every day and I told her that this is definitely something wrong it's an Islamic you have to advise him she said okay I'd like you to advise him Ison I don't know him she said he's sitting next to you I was shocked the guy he was sitting next to me his wife was on the phone and she's telling me about him but the chef the thing it's like a almost endemic disease and I think again we need to go back to the reasons Gary that the United Nations is actually pushing for the age of consent for the age of marriage to go higher and higher why what is the consequence the only consequence of this can be the increase in in zina somebody with some of the ayat and there are some narrations we also have from the prophet alayhi salatu salam in regards to the harmful byproduct of zina but that would be after the break in sha allah so stick around we'll be back soon Salaam alaikum welcome back so we dealt with some of the ayat that scare and frighten the average believer from trying to be involved in this abhorrent Actives inevitable language you said could be fornication and adultery I believe usually the way they categorize them is adultery is for married people or previously married people fornication is for unmarried people who've never been married before there's a difference in the Penal Code in Islam in regards to each one of these crimes but what do we have from the prophet alayhi salatu salam that explicitly warns against this behavior the Prophet on is cilantro salaam as you all know address the muhajireen the immigrants who came to Medina because they're coming to a new country to a new place this was suitable to give them this warning so that Satan may not lure them down to doing something that is wrong and no one can recognize them so the Prophet and this is what usually happens when people travel they tend to loosen up because in their own town in their own City they're afraid that if they do something wrong they'll be recognized and blamed for but when you travel abroad no one knows you so whatever you do nobody's watching except Allah subhanAllah forgiveness for all of us so the Prophet said that if some yeah marshal mahadji oh you immigrants do not indulge in things that may destroy those who were throw you like those who have been destroyed before you predecessors and among the things that he mentioned he mentioned a number of qualities he mentioned the first one on the list was that do not openly or secretly fornicate or indulge in adultery because this transgression this act of evil if you make it widely spread it is the rule of a large ocean that any country any city any community does this Allah social will employ them will turn to diseases and epidemics which they never heard before yes so these are new diseases they never heard of this and so peril I remember and that in the early 80s this was greatly interpreted to be aids herpes and all the venereal diseases that were spread in the early eighties where it was booming and now it's a little bit less but it's still there the HIV side is they call it now sexually transmitted disease and there's so many I haven't even heard of them before I mean there are new ones who is coming new ones coming it's like what's this oh it's another STD sexually transmitted disease and as the zina increases exactly as the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said so far enough and I remember sorry chef said it doesn't only have to be a sexually transmitted disease it could be any type of disease so the the disease does not necessarily have to be a STD for example it just could be just new diseases coming and the problem is that these people who are far away from Islam and they are not even interested in looking into Islam they neglect their heedless of the fact that what Islam tells you is the solution for all of your problems now they are not tackling the source the core the problem they're tackling the effect and the byproducts of the problem so they're telling you how to have safe sex how to teach the children at early age in school which shows you that these guys are not thinking correctly there's there's something wrong with them in recent times I saw some documentary or something about a carnival in some country I mentioned in the country and part of the it's a carnival that attracts many different people from all over the world and one of these special unique qualities of this particular carnival is that the government will be donating the 10 million condoms or something for all the guests who have the tendency to come and and you know get involved in this abhorrent act with the local people the local women over there and it's endorsing its endorsing it you know because people will do it anyways so it seems that there's once the human beings are distant from their creator and from the legislation as the hadith says if you don't have any shame then then do as you will and people just do whatever they whatever makes them happy but this is a dangerous thing the it's funny you just mentioned it the hadith says if you don't have any shame bashfulness the word arabic word is higher and is one of the branches of a man a man now if you connect the dots as they say those who fall into fornication and adultery into illegal sexual relationships have no shame have no higher and you're just mentioning this issue of this carnival what do the people do they think that this is art they think that this is civilization we as we know it see this kind of civilization in the primitive jungles of Africa and in the modern nations and countries of today's world the sign is one nudity so the primitives of the in the jungles of Africa they're nude because they don't have any religion they don't have any thing to abide by you find the men and women losing clothes right and if you go to the European well not necessarily but countries that do not believe in what we believe in you find them praising nudity and this is a sign of freedom to them and this is the core sin that or the byproduct of the sin of our forefathers Adam and Eve peace be upon them when they ate from the forbidden fruit what was exposed their nakedness their nakedness are there any other harmful effects what does the believer have to be concerned about in terms of the punishment in this life and in the life to come what is at stake here yes here I would like just remind myself have in mind my brothers and sisters about what the problem so on the night of ascension he saw I saw those the adulterer and adulteress is in that oven okay there's like like a furnace okay like the oven and the the flames are coming from underneath them and they are burning their price at fast that private parts by which you were enjoying this momentary transient pleasure okay you will have that severe punishment God knows for how long maybe forever he knows so Han Allah it's not only that you are having miserable life here those who are leading such immoral life they are miserable life they're not happy that's why they this leads then they become well-versed later ok so fulfilling the desire with the woman this is not sufficient so he has to do something else so at least to the diversion because now he is not he's eccentric he's not normal person and this is the opposite shift Baraka we're talking about the Baraka in marriage this is the opposite this is exactly what you two think is that it doesn't matter what you do this because this is a satisfaction out of it you have to find something more and more exciting more perverse you have you have all the sexual deviance ease because there's no but that's why a lotta by Fiat on has has many tricks has many ways so he takes you in stages moving you from one state to another stage okay until he takes you out of the fold of Islam Japan will not believe you and I believe there's one area if I may add this I objected to bring the point home it's a scary ayah because it the person reaches a point of you know being totally confused whoever turns away from the remembers of the right man which is the Quran and the Sunnah and everything which Allah revealed we shall assign for him a devil who will be his close companion not only that he will this companion of his estate on will continue to mislead him from the path while they think they are rightly guided and many people have reached you know it's not a big deal you guys are making a big deal blowing things out of proportion she's just my girlfriend one day we will get married and inshallah we will do it over to Allah will do heads together and she's not true because I mean subhanAllah human being he has this fitler also you find for example a boy who is messing around and then he repented and now he is practicing now he decided to get married he will not marry that girl he will look for he will come to his mother says mother I want to get married they want your heart to be near copies you know they want her to be these because because he want to feel safe when he's away someone to trust so I am telling the sisters don't ever ever trust men okay unless you're married okay unless he is married and he tells you I am sincere I want to marry you don't believe him you say come through the proper Channel okay when Arabic you say you come through the door of the wind all the thieves they come through the windows okay so never open the door for him they are indeed hungry wolf as Imam general Abidine made a rhyme Allah made it very clear in the Yellin of the leader Nissim it'll kill up Toto for money the men who are looking at women they are like the hungry dogs roaming around that lump of flesh oh man depiction and this is Subhan Allah exactly we see it every day all of you they travel all the time the moment you sit and see a woman next year hi hey hi mind your business what ha and if he has her little boy with her Oh cute boy well you're playing with the chair why that's debate you want to have to understand this is this is a fact we have to address this fact in this life will have miserable life as a lost front Allah promised women are Agha I'm describing their home initiative bunka when I heard who you multimatic whoever deviates and turns away from my remembrance from my Dean from my way that I have chosen for him you have made Shaitan blanket this narrow life miserable life and we will raise him on the Day of Resurrection blind I can look here our time is up for the episode was accomplished here for tuning in and we hope to be together in the near future salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato"
