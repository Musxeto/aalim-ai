  "transcript": "a sister says my husband commits adultery I do not want to be close to him can I give him an ultimatum there only when he stops he can come to me or am i sinning regardless first of all I do not know if these are only doubts or true accusations based on concrete evidences if we assume that these are only doubts then your sinful for not complying with his demands and fulfilling his rights in Islam we do not base our actions on doubts we base our actions our views our verdicts and our choices on certainty I could doubt and this is opening the door for Shaitaan for the devil for Satan to mess up with my mind I can open the door for all types of doubts a brother comes and says assalamualaikum shaikh how are you I'm doubtful is he a Muslim or a hypocrite I haven't seen him pray for a couple of months maybe he's a kafir so I don't give Salam back out of Allah I enter a message it and I've seen this with some of the brothers we see people seeing a message the majority of them go to pray and one says you guys pray I'll wait for you in the room why don't you come and pray he says I don't know about the mmm what is his r√°pida maybe he's this maybe he's a Shari maybe he is the Oh Bundy maybe so because I don't know his Ikeda I will not pray behind him I ought to be left you cannot doubt people like this because then I'll doubt whether you are a bastard born out of wedlock or not how dare you this is my idea but I wasn't present when your father married your mom and I don't know if she was pregnant at the time or not when he married her they could have been in a relationship and if you go on this road you'll end up either being attack fili or you'll ruin your life and the life of those around you I get callers calling me with OCD being possessed that with the idea that his marriage was invalid years decades ago and he keeps saying that okay maybe I wasn't a Muslim I said the Shahada now do I have to renew my my marriage what why the guy is calling me and he's relentless no matter what I say and and do with him to the extent that he said share hollis III renewed my marriage contract okay but now I want to know are my children born out of wedlock should I get rid of them or they're still my own children how do we let him the shaitaan/the regime it is you who opened the door for Shaitaan and you will only suffer the most and those around you therefore if you are doubtful of your husband you should cast these doubts away and fear allah azza wajal and act as he's still faithful until proven otherwise but if you have concrete evidence if he has confessed of his heinous sin or of his relationship with his coworker or with anything that proves to you that he is an adulteress or an adulterer that is in this case you have all the right to refrain from sleeping with him because any normal person would fear catching STDs sexual transmitted or sexually transmitted diseases anyone would feel that so it's your god-given right to protect yourself and healthy and-and-and-and health and to refrain until you are certain that he's committed until he makes his medical check and proves you that he has no illnesses and then you can resume that without the problem inshallah"
