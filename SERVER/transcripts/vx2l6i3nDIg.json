  "transcript": "yes question is asking the div this is not true this is a fabricated not authentic Hadith this is not a question though yeah so the question what if the divorce was genuine what if the divorce was genuine was genuine this is why I'm saying to you the concept that the most hated act to Allah is divorce is not true there is a chapter in the Quran by the name of and sometimes divorce is mandatory if your wife doesn't abide by the hijab free mixes has boyfriends in you're you're shocked don't be I have counseling sessions men W he coming to me in the counseling sessions but it's in Zoom luckily for them it's not life because I would have the guy says she my wife cheats on me she has boyfriends sometimes she goes out with them spend nights I said okay but I love her she in Arabic we say Hab May the house lizard loves you with are you crazy you're not even a man how dare you do like I love her I I forgive her I forgive her I say may Allah not forgive you because the prophet said the youth the one who allows such sins to be prevailing in his wife's attitude and and character he will not enter Jenna so coming back to the what is the question all I forgot what the divorce was yes sometimes the divorce is genuine in this case is genuine sometimes it's highly recommended how if your wife is someone now the sisters will be angry because in order for me to give this equation I have to give the other equation which is when are they allowed to seek but this is not a marital issue but again it is recommended for you to divorce your wife if you see the trajectory of marriage going down how long you've been married 3 years and how are things worse to worse we had so many reconciliations we sat with therapists Mar marital uh uh counselors and we brought her family my family sheh she is having rage issues she's always breaking things disrespecting me in the street calling the police she called the police six times upon me sh and they've investigated me some cases put me in jail for 2 three nights okay what what are you waiting for ditcher get married to someone younger more beautiful more religious and then move on the same T goes with the sisters HH if your husband is like this but I don't have time to elaborate more sometimes the divorce becomes Haram why because she isi she is righteous practicing and you want her to serve your friends to go and mix with you in couple retreat and you want her to come with you to the beach in Mombasa Nairobi they don't have beaches yeah alhamdulillah anyhow so in this case yes divorcing her because of this reason is totally prohibited and you are sinful for that and so on"
