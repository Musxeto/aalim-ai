  "title": "Seeing blood or spottings after the menses / period ends - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says I know that one of the signs of purity for menses is dryness but every time I think I'm pure and it is dry a few hours later I see blood that does not look like spotting well if it does not look like spotting then it has to have the flow of the blood like menses which is not normal a woman may vary in her period time so she may have for example and fixed period of six or seven days after a few years it may be prolonged into nine days twelve days it may be cut short into two days it doesn't matter what matter is is the flow of blood however the scholars say that the maximum per month per 30 days she cannot have more than fifteen days of menses so if she has seven days and then a purity of ten days and then she has another menses of seven days or eight days now the total is 25 the moment she exceeds the total of periods seven plus eight the fifteen then she should consider this to be a stay Harbor meaning that she performs what she prays and she makes woudl every salat after the event and she does not consider this flow of blood to be menses because it exceeded 15 but most likely what the sister is asking about is spotting yes there is a brownish discharge yellowish discharge few spots of blood but it's not the flow of blood of the normal menses and hence the sign of purity once she has detected it and she found that she is totally dry then she should perform Russell and ignore whatever spotting or color discharge that comes afterwards and Allah surgeon knows best"
