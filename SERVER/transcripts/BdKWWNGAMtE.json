  "title": "Is it permissible to hang verses of the Quran around the house or in masjids? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling on hanging verses of the quran on walls the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible why this is the word of allah we're not hanging a photograph or a portrait of some other artist it's the word of allah scholars say that quran was not revealed to be a form of decoration as we see in some messages or in the vast majority of messages in the muslim world could it be that all these muslims are wrong sheikh the answer is yes because who defines whether we're right or wrong the quran and the sunnah and the understanding of the three favorite generations companions tab in tablet and they did not do any such thing the kaabah never had verses of the quran written on it the walls of the masjids whether in makkah or medina never had the quran written on it and if it was something to be followed or to be done the companions would have done it the tabernae would have done it so hanging the verses of the quran is not honoring it it can be insulting it taking it as a form of decoration especially when people don't pay attention to it especially when they pay a lot of money just to show off with it so many people you enter their homes you find so many verses you ask them don't look tell me what's on the walls i don't know i've read it maybe years ago but i forgot so what's the purpose of it decoration"
