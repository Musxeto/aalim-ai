  "transcript": "so shik my question is isn't itah to pray if it is Sunnah then if one leaves that prayer for any reason will he be sinful I wanted to know that first of all when you use such a terminology as Sunnah the first thing that jumps into people's minds is the definition of Sunnah according to the Judas who say a Sunnah is what you are to be rewarded when doing and if you skip it you're not sinful unlike waj which is you're rewarded if you do it and if if you skip it you'll be sinful so this is the first thing that comes to people's minds however there is another definition of Sunnah which is the way so anything that the prophet did in his lifeat this is labeled as Sunnah regardless of the ruling whether it is wag mandatory or recommend recomended must or permissible or Mak not recommended Oram prohibited the five rulings that deal with legislative rulings so when someone says is praying and is praying these five prayers Sunnah the answer is yes in the sense that the prophet did it but when we come to the five legislative rulings is it Sunnah meaning is it recommended if I do it I am rewarded and if I don't do it I'm not sinful answer is no definitely it is Wag It is f if you don't do it you're sinful and you'll be punished for that going back to your question brother fad so the the two we ordered to pray before sitting when entering a Masjid is it Sunnah meaning recommended the answer is no it is mandatory it is wag if you sit without doing it you'll be sinful if you pray it you have reward so it is Sunnah in the sense that the prophet usually did it and he ordered us to do it but it in the sense of rulings it is mandatory and wag"
