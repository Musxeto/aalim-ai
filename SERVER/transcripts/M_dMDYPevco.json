  "title": "Can't wash face due 2 skin condition, have 2 apply cream Tayammum / combine prayers? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is I have a skin problem for which I visited the doctor and she gave me a cream which she asked me to apply during the during the day and keep it applied throughout the day so until almost Asia time I told her that I might need to wash my face because of making wudu and stuff she she said that I can do it twice um a day but it's not recommended because the strength of the cream is very high and it actually irritates my skin and I've been using it since past two three two three weeks but it's not giving the result it's because it's not being applied as the per the recommended plant so my question is can I do te amo in this case and if I can what is the proper way of doing for this so you have one of two options option one is to combine and um or switch to Asia according to whatever is convenient for you so for example if you pray Fajr then you apply your first time and you stay until the time of Asar and you combine to Asar at the time of Assad you perform mudu then and you wash your face and you apply the cream again you pray afterwards it's Maghrib time you can combined with the same time at the beginning or if you can and you want to use the second time of applying the cream you can time and wash your face apply the cream and Prima remination this is alternative number one alternative number two if combining is not that easy or possible and it's best not to wash your face altogether for improvement as a result and the doctor is trustworthy then you can perform anti-mum as described you strike the ground once with your both hands and then you wipe your face and you wipe your hands and that is it some narration says that you start with your hands and then you wipe your face but all inshallah is a good and Allah Knows Best"
