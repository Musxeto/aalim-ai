  "transcript": "basically in uh the person doing the he did some of it in Arabic and some of it in English at school uh there was not a full aah of the Quran um in Arabic and was a valid I was told by one of the teachers there uh that as long as you just mention it in English that still counts there not an Islamic school um do I have to pray like four um like as first of of all there isn't anything specific in regards of other than it should be two separated by sitting in between and the prayer which is two Ras led by the Imam SCH schools of thought and many scholars say different conditions in regards to the number of attendees some say 40 is the minimum and the most authentic is three is the minimum Imam and two uh in the congregation listening to him some say that it has to be included in it the and an Ayah and Hadith but there is no proof of that in the Quran or in the Sunnah it's from the scholars therefore I believe that it's a Friday speech Friday if the IM fulfilled it whether he recited part of an Ayah or a full Ayah or he did not recite an Ayah at all then his prayer and theba is valid inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
