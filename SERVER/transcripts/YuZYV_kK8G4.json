  "transcript": "I hope you are fine alhamdulillah sh from past two three months I am in great dilemma because I think I'm a cfir because of the Whispers I think because there are some traditional methods of curing diseases told by our Prophet wasam like disease like pneumonia and others but if I believe that there were methods told by a prophet centuries ago and if I say that and some methods are not applicable nowadays in many regions and if I believe that uh all methods should be backed by doctors and some medical researches which are told by our Prophet am I committing kufur no you're not committing kufur unless you are opposing the prophet Alat wasam and rejecting what he has said sometimes the prophet would direct us to use honey and this is mentioned in the Quran if someone says no honey is not good honey is not a medicine honey cannot be consumed or used as medicine at all and he acknowledges that this is found in the Quran and the authentic Sunnah this is a pure cafir yeah there's no doubt in that he's rejecting something known from religion by default but if he says that me honey is not valid for all illnesses yes it's good for many illnesses but there are some certain illnesses that we cannot use honey for that this is totally fine and and legit so it all depends on your conviction if you rejecting the Hadith of the Prophet Alam as if he does not know or as if it's inapplicable or as if it's unscientific then there is a problem with your Iman but if you acknowledge the Hadith and it authenticity and that it works in most cases but there are cases that it may not work with or we do not we may not know the ingredients and the dosages it should be consumed through then there is nothing wrong in that Allah Knows Best"
