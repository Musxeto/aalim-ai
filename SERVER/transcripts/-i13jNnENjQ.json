  "transcript": "whenever you are confused whether you trade the number or a number that is more always take the Lesser number for example if you doubt whether I have prostrated the the second frustration or only one frustration the lesson number is one frustration this is sure and certain so if you're in doubt whether I prayed three ra or four ra the Lesser number is three so you continue as if the only the the Lesser number took place and you pray the fourth raak or you pray or offer the second prostration and continue your your your uh prayer as normal and then before you um uh conclude your prayer after T you offer two s of forgetfulness and then you offer Salam when is this this takes place when I am not sure whether I prayed two ra or three whether I made one frustration or two frustrations when I have no clue it's 50/50 this is what you do you conclude your prayer you offer tah and just before you offer Salam you off for two prostrations of forgetfulness of sah and then you conclude it with the Salam I hope this answers the question"
