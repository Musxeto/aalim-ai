  "transcript": "says what about al hind is this authentic or not yes there are many hadith that are weak and there are some hadiths that are authentic and the scholars say that this battle would inevitably happen at the end of time some say that this would happen when isab peace be upon him and his mother descends where he kills the antichrist at the jad this is when it will take place and allah azza knows best however muslims don't occupy their time and themselves into the future rather than fixing their present before that time comes we may be long gone and allah only knows so we are going to be held accountable for our actions what did we do and what have we failed in doing not about whether there will be this razwatul hind or this the mahdi's coming or not all of this we believe in but if we just sit on our lazy chair and contemplate about this error that is going to come that would be negative thinking in the sense that whenever we sit with our friends and we discuss all the vice and evil things happening in our era we usually justify what's happening by saying what we see of vice and evil is the result of those who came before us and those who will come after us will solve these problems okay then what's my role what's your role he said nothing we have just come at the wrong time at the wrong place so this is the doing of those who came before us and no one will be able to fix it except those who will come after us after us and we are negative we have negative zero impact on things and this is wrong you have to do something in order to progress to improve the things that are happening in your community and in life and allah knows best faizan"
