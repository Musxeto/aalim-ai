warahmatullahi / legato hadith 199 and hadith number 200 deals with fasting that is prohibited in islam so we need someone to read this for us yes brother Mohammed bin up binge offer reported I asked jbeil bin Abdullah Allah be pleased with both of them did the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi assalam forbid the fasting on friday whereupon he said yes in an edition of muslim by the Lord of the Kaaba and the volume honey 200 abu hurayrah allah be pleased with him reported the prophet of allah salallahu alayhi wasallam as saying none among you should observe first on friday except if he observes first before it and after it very well and this you had is we learned that the prophet alayhi salatu salam forbade from fasting the day of riding in the so he he went to his house and he found one of his wives fasting friday so he asked her did you fast Thursday the day before she said no he said do you intend to fast tomorrow Saturday she said no he then said break her fast so what is the ruling on fasting Friday scholars say it is not permissible to isolate Friday with fasting for the sake of Friday can you give an example people have work the full week and they have only friday as a day off so one decided that he fasts every friday because it's his only day off what do we say to him say this is not ssible this is forbidden either you fast Thursday with it or you fast Saturday with it as in the hadith either you faster day before or the after ok in this case is it always forbidden to fast Friday the answer is no there are exemptions there are exceptions when scholars say if you're not fasting that day because it's a friday but because it coincides with a Shura for example or with out of a for example in this case it is permissible it is also permissible to fast Friday alone when you are fasting mandatory fasting such as making up for Ramadan I don't want you to say such as Ramadan because if you're fasting ramadan whether it's friday or not it's going to be before a day of ramadan no doubt in that no making up for ramadan i miss the day because of traveling then the only opportunity for me is the fasted on a friday to it no problem i have an expiration too fast I'd like to do it in friday no problem you're not fasting for the sake of friday you have something legitimate to do and that is why you can make it on friday like when i come to the masjid after a short prayer can i pray 2 rakats so i can sit down then i said 'yes yes why because i'm praying two rak'ahs in order to fulfill the order the instruction of the prophet who said salala salem whenever you enter a message do not sit down until you pray 2 rakats this is regarding the fasting of friday what about the fasting of saturday it's the same thing it's the same ruling you cannot fast it alone either faster day before it or the day after it or it is permitted for you too fast if you are fasting a mandatory fasting such as a day of expiration a day of oath miss day of ramadan or you're fasting it because it coincides with the artifact or ashram and now we move on to hadith 201 the hadith of Abu roubaix 8 and we need someone who would read it for us yes brother about obeyed the free slave of evening as her reported I observed eid along with omar bin al hot tub holy Allah and he said these two days the messenger of allah sallallahu ala Salem has forbidden observing a fast on them one is the day of fitrah at the end of your fast and the second one the day when you eat the meat of your sacrifices Joe Callahan so now we know that it is forbidden to fast fridays alone too fast Saturday's alone and also too fast the day of Adolf Hitler which comes at the end of Ramadan and their eid al-adha which comes on the tenth of the ledger but before we go on commenting on this hadith fasting friday and saturday are permissible when you are fasting the fast of the wood peace be upon him you remember he fasts a day and skips a day this means that one week you will fast Friday and skip Saturday but the next week you will skip friday and fast saturday scholars say that here you're exactly doing what the Prophet told you not to do and that is to separately fast Friday without a day before it or after it and likewise the Saturday so is this permissible scholars say yes only if you're fasting the fast of the wood because it is not intended for friday nor for saturday but it is intended for the best of fasting which is the fasting of the wood as the prophet peace be upon them all as for the hadith it is very clear it is completely forbidden to fast the day of rate alpha tour and the day of eid al-adha except in one condition what is that condition anyone yes then we have not sacrificed the have you when you night sacrifice the honey it is permissible to fast idle futur is rather aydelott ha now you must know there is no fasting acceptable on the day of 8 or of the day al hajj at all point full stop no way any type of fasting would be accepted what you're referring to is on the eleventh twelfth and thirteenth of Hajj yes these days are also forbidden for us too fast except for a pilgrim who does not find money to buy a sacrifice and slaughter it for him only it is permitted to fast three days so this means that not only the two days that Ahmad mentioned may allah be pleased with him also there are three other days so why didn't he mention them scholars say that these days that rumor mentioned are completely forbidden too fast no excuse but the other three days there is an exception that you can fast them in and not to any one of us only to the pilgrim who is offering temperature or Quran and is unable to buy sacrifice understood ashalla question if a person killed someone by mistake we know that he has two fast two consecutive months correct or wrong correct what does he do if Ramadan coincides with these two months is ramadan considered to be one of them yes and no yes no they have to be separate than ramadan so if i start on the twentieth of Shaban and I fast 10 days of these two consecutive months and then Ramadan comes what do i do I fast Ramadan when it comes I start my fasting could no you do not fast and drama bond anything so what you do this is an exemption so you skip their eat the first day of read then you continue with your 11th day of the two consecutive months because the ten days you fasted they are okay Roma Bahn read you break her fast second day immediately continue what happens if I am fasting these consecutive months in the month of the ledger so I fast the first day second until the ninth so I facet nine days then I break my fast for how many days for for it ha and three days of at a shriek and on the fourteenth I continued my 10th 11th of the nine days that I have done understood inshallah good so these days even if someone makes a pledge and he says it's a pledge on me that I will fast the day of photo what do we tell him you even if you fast it's not accepted your sinful and you have to give expiration for you mean for your oath that you made because if you make a pledge to do something and you're unable to do it you have to give calf are at Ali I mean you have to give expiration of an oath for example someone says I will pray six hours every night to the rest of my life after two three nights the guy discovered that no way he can do this the maximum he could do is probably an hour and a half of two hours and then he's dead or if someone says that it's a pledge from me to allah azzawajal that i will fly he cannot fly so what to do he has to give expiration of the amine or of the oath he made which is feeding 10 people shelt our clothing them or slaughtering a sheep we have a short break stay tuned inshallah with assalamu alaikum and welcome back hadith number 202 one of the brothers yes brother narrated abu site the prophet salallahu alaihi salam forbid the fasting of two days either ah da an eagle feather to finish days and also wearing a sama a single garment covering the whole body like a mummy and sitting and pulling both legs to your body while being wrapped in one government and to pray after foggia and a surprise this hadith of Shaytan her dream allah be pleased with him he stated that the prophet alayhi salatu salam forbade us from two days of fasting two types of wedding clothes and sitting and two types of prayers so to fastings to form of wearing the garments and sitting and two forms of prayers as for the fasting you know that it is the same as hadith roma the day of Qatar and the day of now is it that they endured a Aloha it is the same now have meaning slaughtering and eight is called dado el agua so it's the same day as in for example come off as we will come to know if you say to offer ziara tell awfully father powerful Hajj they are the same toe off it has three different names but it's the same thing now the two days of fasting we know that wearing the garment one is called HTML or some map or some math is when you have a long piece of cloth that is not sufficient for you to have into two so what they do is they wrap themselves the undergarment and then they go on and drop the upper body so one would be like a mummy and this is not very comfortable in movement and also may result in exposing your outer if the whole thing falls because it's not tightly wrapped and also it would not be easy for you to be mobilized and to move your hands because you are wrapped in it so the Prophet forbade from wearing such a thing and scholars say that it's not forbidden it is highly not recommended unless it would result in exposing your our then it would become forbidden the second one is the profit at a solo sir I'm described it as a lefty ba you know what elective ax is elected back when you sit waiting for the Friday or when the Imam is giving hot bar and your cross-legged and then your back is tired what to do you see a lot of the people raising their knees their feet are on the ground so they're sitting like this and their knees are here and then they surround their knees like this this is called HTML or elective back now the Prophet says if you're wearing one garment and that is the lower garment the chances of your hour of your private parts being exposed is very great because if you raise your legs like this usually people in front can see something because usually if it's a one dress it's not going to be so long and covering and tight so the Prophet says if you're wearing one garment this is not recommended for you to do if not forbidden but if you're wearing a short while if you're wearing a trouser is underneath can you do this yes no problem because your outer is protected and covered and from this we see that Islam highlights greatly the issue of Allah and you have to take care of it now so many times I finish prayer and I leave the message it and why leaving people are still completing the prayer you see them when they're frustrating you see their backsides and they're praying not knowing that their prayer would be nullified by such exposure if it is for too long or too big areum Islam protects your private parts and your outer and your body so that no one would be able to look at it unfortunately the Muslims today they find it fun and means of entertainment to go out wearing shorts or exposing their bodies women find it entertaining to wear tights or see-through or something that is not so protecting the chastity and this is all from Shaitaan who took the pledge that he will expose them and will as he exposed the hour of our great grand father and mother Adam and Eve and they were descended from Jenna because of that he is working on doing that he'll in so-called civilized countries what is the most prominent thing there nudity and if you look at the films and the media if you look at the news you will find women you know news anchors wearing many jeeps and miniskirts huh and the men are covered entirely with the tie with everything but the women are so exposed and they would consider that this to be the fashion this is exactly what Shaitaan does take off your clothes and let's have it Phoebe Islam tells you no cover your body cover yourself protect your chastity the only one who can look at your body is your spouse no one else and this shows you what civilization they are bragging about is truly about and the two prayers that we are not allowed to pray of course after other and after Roger moving on to hadith 203 yes Faison narrated abu sa'id i heard the prophet salallahu holly was seldom seen indeed anyone who fats for one day for a loss pleasure Allah will keep his face away from the Hellfire for a distance covered by a journey of 70 years now this hadith highlights the importance of fasting during jihad during fighting for the cause of Allah and scholars differed in regard to this hadith some of them said no too fast a day in the cause of allah meaning for the sake of allah so if I fast while I'm in my house for the sake of Allah then this is for the cause of Allah and scholar said no this is not true because whenever the Arabic word is feasible Allah whenever the word feasible allah is mentioned this is strictly for jihad likewise those who are fighting for the cause of Allah usually they will be preoccupied in guarding in building their camps and taking care of preparation for the enemy and that is why the prophet sallallahu REO salem gave them great deal of reward for the fasting of that day what is the reward Allah will depart Allah will keep their faces away from hell the distance of a 70 years journey how far is 70 years journey if you travel from here to America for example and it takes you 15 hours flying this is 70 years so you can imagine the distance of fasting one single day and this shows you that fasting is one of the greatest deeds that a person could offer because it is a sign of sincerity when you pray people watch you pray when you give the cat people benefit from the money but when you fast no one can know that you are fasting and that is why fasting is a sign of sincerity that allah azzawajal loves do we have any questions yes brother shared my question is regarding the oats I'm asking about the expiation for the oath she I wanted to ask that if a person he smokes and he realizes that smoking is haram sneham and the next day he says that by a lie will not smoke from tomorrow and as we know that smoking is an addiction so he might smoke so is there any leniency regarding this person or has she yes he has to do the complete Cafaro because if he complies with his oath with his jahmene Allah would brought him twice because this is a repentance and this is fulfilling his Jimmy but if he breaks it Allah will punish him twice because he's going back to a sin and at the same time he broke his you mean but the sin of breaking his Amin would be expiated by the calf ara yes brother Salaam walekum she rams long she is there any exhibition for voluntary fast suppose I fast on Tuesday Monday Wednesday just to please Allah but I'm offered it food then I break my fast is that allowed as long as you did not take an oath if you are fasting voluntary fasting scholars say that you are your own Amir what is the meaning of your own Amir meaning i am the master of myself i can break my fasting anytime as long as the voluntary so if I'm fasting Mondays this is voluntary nobody obliged me to do it or I go and visit a friend and he puts this food in front of me that is so delicious they said tell you what we have a lot of Monday's coming and I break my fast and I eat i am not sinful at all at all i'm not sinful because this is voluntary and Allah would not punish me for that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
