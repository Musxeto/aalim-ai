  "transcript": "foreign foreign we are in the very beginning of the fourth year of hijrah the set was the muslims were simi defeated in the battle of uhud and all their enemies were encouraged to attack them as they thought they were a weak prey to be attacked in the very beginning of the fourth year in the month of muharram the prophet salallahu through his reconnaissance team knew that tribes from bani al-assad are trying to invade medina led by tulayha even kuwailit and his brother salam so he sent to them his great companion and his brother in suckling and he gave him a flag tell him to go and fight to the la in the land of bani assad and to invade them so he went with his companions until he reached that area their tribe and as he went in they were taken by surprise so they fled their homes and lands as usual terrorized by the muslim and they left their camels and sheep which abu sharma took with him may allah be pleased with him he stayed there for ten days hoping that they might come back and feel men enough to fight him but they didn't what about the number of the army well it wasn't a very big expedition but it was fair because if you go within 50 or 100 of them this would suffice afterwards there was also in the same month of muharram of the fourth year a military expedition but this military expedition was composed of only one single man and this man was abdullah ibn unes one of the brave warriors of the prophet and the prophet salallahu called him and he came and he told him i'd like you to go and travel to arafah and particularly in the valley of there you'll find a man by the name of kharidam sufyan al-hudali he is gathering the tribes in that area so that they can come and attack us in medina so go to him and kill him and abdullah did not object did not question the prophet sallam by saying you want me to go and attack a full army this is strange he did not ask him but he had only one concern and he asked the prophet i have never met this khalid sufyan so how would i recognize him the prophet told him that the minute you see him you will feel the shiver in your body so he went he traveled for two to four or five days because from medina to mecca it's about three day journey of course now by airplane it's one hour yeah it's it's about 400 plus uh uh kilometers so by car usually from makkah to medina it's about five hour journey on camelback or if you're walking then it's far uh longer he went until he reached that area and it was us our time the story tells us that he said as i was walking i was afraid that i may miss assad prayer so i prayed while walking and bowed and me frustrated while also walking until i've finished my asa prayer and this indicates to us that even if you are on a sacred mission even if you are at the cause of allah don't mess with prayer some of us may think that okay if we are in a lecture if we are doing a program it's okay for us to postpone prayer until the other prayer comes because we are are on a just cause this is unacceptable you as an individual your priority is to pray on time some people say that if i'm in work doesn't mean i'm worship allah what do you think about this well this has a right to it and wrong the wrong part of it would be to justify any sin or anything that is bad that will be a result of your work so they say as long as you're working and this is a form of worship of to allah then it's okay to postpone prayer it's okay to work with females it's okay to cheat because this is at the side of allah and this is unacceptable the the right part of it would be that if your cause is to get money that would save you and suffice you from begging people and that would be enough to feed your family and to clothe them and to give them a decent life then yes this is a form of worship but it is not at all close to prayer so if your job means that you have to postpone or delay prayers then you have to look for another job regardless because essentially you have to pray on time no matter what happens going back to our story abdullah ibn anais may allah be pleased with him went to this man khaled sufyan and khalid suffered looked at him and testing him what do you want abdullah he's not afraid so he has what they call nowadays a poker face nothing could change in his face he just looked him in the eyes and said i heard that you're gathering to fight that man he didn't even know he didn't even name him as form of humiliation and and and he's not even paying attention to to show him that he's not a muslim i heard that you're gathering people to fight to fight that man and i wanted to be with you so he said okay sit down he sat down with him for a while and abdullah had no names had stories and poetry and they chit-chatted for a while an hour or two until the guy was feeling secure and liking this stranger because i i like the way he talks and just before sunset abdullah nice told him what about if we you know walk around i'm tired of sitting so khalid said yes why not and they walked around together until they were away from the camp and behind one of the hills and then he jumped on him and he chopped his head off and immediately he went back to medina and he went back to the medina and gave the glad tidings to the prophet sallam that your enemy is no more existing and the prophet sallam prayed for him and asked allah azza for him for forgiveness and not only that he gave him the prophet salallahu ah a branch a stick so he took it and went and then he came back to the prophet prophet of allah why did you give me the stick with what to do with it it's just a stick i have swords i have everything the prophet told him that on the day of judgment those who have sticks with them are very few and i want you to be among those very few the stick is a form of prestige you know to point at it's not something that you fight with or to it's not a cane it's just something to have in your hand and abdullah is put it into his will that whenever he dies it should be put along side of him in the grave and so they did i heard sure that the prophet sallallahu alaihi had to use the stick with him no this is not correct the prophet sallam did not use a stick with him though he was quite old he was 56 at the time 55 56 years old but he sometimes had what is called as anaza and it's a short spear and he sometimes used to carry it in order to use it but he did not have a cane with him he would sometimes uh deliver the friday speech and having a spear like with him or a stick so that he could uh deliver the khutba and and the oration of friday but it was not a cane that he used to use to walk with the following month was a tragic month also for the muslims it was the month of safar the second month in the islamic calendar the prophet ali salatu-salaam sent six of his companions and other stories say that he sent ten with a group from adul and kara tribes came to the prophet and an envoy came to the prophet asking him to teach them about islam he introduced islam to them so they asked him to send people from his companions to teach their people so he sent with them 10 of his companions with a double mission one was to teach these tribes second to look for information about what quraish is preparing and doing so these companions of the prophet sallam went with these men and in the way they did not know that adal and kara had an agreement with the tribe of whom their leader was assassinated few weeks earlier by abdullahi his tribe arranged to rent these people from the tribes of adul nakara so that they can draw some of the companions of the prophet sallam and they can kill them in exchange i believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we will be back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the hereafter as well allah each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it and welcome back abdullah the two the envoy of these two tribes came to the prophet allah pretending that they are accepting islam requesting him to send few of his companions to teach them about islam and so did the prophet knowing the risks because he knew that there is a risk always when you send a small number of your companions with complete strangers but the prophet salallahu for the sake of allah he had to take the chance in order to spread the word of allah he sent 10 with these people and he made a leader to them awesome may allah be pleased with him they used to travel at night and camp at daytime so that no one would feel of their presence and in the middle of the way near an area called ar-rajir and this expedition is known as the expedition of rajir they were surprised to find a hundred and some narrations say two hundred men from judea waiting for them and they were all archers they were not brave enough to fight with swords so they surrounded them and tried to calm the muslims by saying we mean no harm to you it's just that we have to take your prisoners and then give you to someone else that's all we don't want to kill you seven of the companions would not adhere to them and their leader was awesome eventhabit may allah be pleased with him what they did not know that the people in quraish wanted to to lay their hands on some of the muslims so that they can execute in exchange for their loved ones that died in badr and also the tribe of judea wanted to avenge the blood of her of their leader who died a few weeks ago and also there was a price on the head of assam inhabit and why was that was one of the strongest warriors of islam and he was an excellent archer and if you recall in the battle of uhud ten of the people who carried the flag were all all from banu abdidar and six the first six to die of them were all brothers the sons of abu talaha beginning with man and so on and two of these were when he killed them before killing them he would say take it and i am the son of ibn abi so as they were dying their mother came to them in the battlefield and asked them who did this to you and both of them said a man by the name of ibn abi so she took a vow on herself that i want this man dead and i want to drink wine in his skull so he wants she wanted his head and she wanted to drink wine in his skull so she put a price a very high price on his head and the traders the polytheists were happy to know that he was the leader because this meant that they're going to make a lot of money seven of the companions would not adhere to them would not surrender and they fought until they died one of them was awesome with habit now a funny thing and and a very amazing thing about to ask him you've been through with me i'll be pleased with him was that he when he gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet salallahu and shook hands with him he said o prophet of allah this hand that shook with your hand i will not touch a disbeliever with it and no disbeliever would ever touch me and this just to show how far away from this belief he was to the extent that even physical contact he would not allow and of course as we know it's okay for muslims to shake hands with non-muslims and to sit with them and to eat with them but with awesome it was a different story because he was so far away from them and he would not ever sit alongside with them because they insult allah so this is his way it's up to him if he doesn't want to shake hands with anyone it's his choice so no one could say well this is extreme or this is too much no it's not if i don't want to sit with a particular person or shake hands with it's my own freedom to to do and choose whatever i want therefore as they were killing him he supplicated to allah and said o allah inform our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam with what's taking place with us tell him what's what's happening and oh allah as i protected your religion at the beginning of the day protect my body at the end of the day because he still did not want them to touch his body as they killed him they wanted to go and behead him so that they can take his head to sulfur this woman who had a price on his head so as soon as they killed him they went down to cut his head off but allah azzawajal sent swaps in the bees and surrounded his body and they could not get close to him so they said it's okay we wait until sunset and then we can be able to do this and as soon as the sun set subhan allah allah sent a flood of water coming and swept his body until this day no one knows where his body is and allah this is what um said subhan allah allah the almighty protects those who protect his religion i heard that there's a vision quran came down got revealed from allah about that particular person that he that allah said from the believers men which they were honest or they fall for the promise or the pledge with allah so is it for that particular companion it can fit him but as we were told by the prophet sallam that this this verse from surat al-azab is also applicable to talhah may allah please with him who defended the prophet saws bravely on the battle of uh among the believers there are men who uh gave their vows and and and pledged to support allah azza and his messenger he said that is among them but this also applies to all companions and all believers who are sincere honest and truthful in their belief now as we said seven died three surrendered because they had the choice whether to die or to surrender now it's up to you also in similar situations that if a person is under fire and he is sure that he has no escape so he has the right to surrender and he has also the right to fight until he dies and this happened with assam and sabbath he chose to die and this happened with uh the companions of the prophet who gave and as soon as they throw their their weapons they were approached by the disbelievers who wanted to tie them and tariq thought that this is the beginning of the treason so he took his sword and he fought with them until he was killed and said they were sold to people in mecca and was sold to the family of al harif in amir who himself he killed him in the battle of batter so his family wanted to avenge their father by killing and zaydim na defenda was bought by safwan ibn umayya whose father also was killed in the battle of badr and he wanted to kill one of the muslims in his place khubaib may allah be pleased with him had a strange story he was given to the family of eben and he was kept there as a prisoner and he stayed there and just before he was executed he requested a blade so that he could shave the private parts as in islam it's called istad in islam it is part of nature to remove the pubic hair and to remove the underpit hair so he requested this blade though he was about to die yet following the sunnah and complying with nature is something that was in all the companions of the prophet saws even just before he died he knew that he had to clean himself so one of the ladies in that house gave him this blade and as he took the blade she did not notice that one of her children went into the prison cell and he was sitting on her babe's leg you know it's a small child and the blade was in the other hand and the woman was terrified so he looked at her and he said are you afraid are you afraid that i might kill him don't be and he gave her the child in peace which again teaches us that muslims don't have this revenge and hatred in them because if i knew that someone is going to kill me in matter of hours and i had a chance to kill any one of his loved ones i would have done that islam does not permit that and it's not as real like it's not back you know actions or something to kill innocents or children or women i think it was a good example for you know non muslims to know that the real islam or the companions they know whom they are allowed to kill and whom they are not of course they were told not to attack and not to harm children women and the elderly i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time oh hmm hmm"
