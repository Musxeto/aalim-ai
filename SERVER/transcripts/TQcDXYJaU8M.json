  "title": "My dad owes me money, can I stop visiting him? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my father asked me to make a bank loan and promised to pay me back but he obviously didn't and now he owes me 50 000 Ringgit in the meantime he went for Hajj and bought a new car it made me very sad hence the question is is it okay if I stop visiting him is who stopped visiting his father because of the Loon that he didn't pay first of all this is very very sad and unfortunate when my relationship to my father whom the prophet said the father is the Middle Gate of Jannah meaning you will not enter Jannah except through your father it's very sad when my relationship to my father is affected by money when the prophet him said you and your wealth belong to your father and over 50 000 stinking Ringgits or dollars I would have second thoughts no fifty thousand yeah actually they come and go in seconds who gives it who takes it would you like to give fifty thousand to your father and he goes for Hajj and he buys a new car what kind of a car is this chip anyhow would you like to give it to your father in this way being dutiful being respectful showing him your generosity and paying him back some of what he had given to you all of these years or would you rather have cancer and pay all of this for your chemo and a radiation therapy I think with your head Allah has given you so much you are allowing shaytan to corrupt the relationship between you and your middle gate to Jannah over 50 000 Ringgits I don't know where where these people come from but Noah kiss his feet every single day and Obey him and give him everything more than what you need seeking allahab seeking Allah's a pleasure and wallahi you will find this in your children remember you boycott your father your children will come and boycott you one day and Allah Knows Best"
