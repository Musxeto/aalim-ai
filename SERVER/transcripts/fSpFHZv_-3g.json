  "transcript": "when he received revelation uh jinns could travel in space but after revelation it started they are shooted by missiles okay so what's the problem could you verify this yeah this is true before the message of the prophet allah the jinn lost the ability to eavesdrop from the heavens and they stated this in the quran where allah azza says that they complained that there's something wrong now we're prevented from eavesdropping and this is new anytime one of us tries to each drop then a meteoroid just knocks him off and that was a sort of glad tiding that the message of the prophet hassam is coming that was that is why they were prevented from eavesdropping or hearing anything that may resemble of telling the future for soothsayers after the message of the prophet salaam this resumed because there was no need for it to be blocked and till date they still can each drop and steal little information of what might happen in the future and mix that with 99 lies as we are told and allah azza knows best"
