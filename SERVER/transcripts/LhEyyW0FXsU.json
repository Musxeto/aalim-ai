  "title": "How to respectfully address our elders in Islam (kissing forehead, standing with hands behind back)",
  "transcript": "yes sir thank you very much sir I have a question like how to respect adults in Islam um the grammar that we must um say to them the tone how we should um say them the body language like the obligation of putting arms at the back uh to stand straight and separating the legs so please sir thank you very much sir I would like to know how to respect there is nothing ala prescribed in the Shar handbook that says when you address your grandma you have to stand in a particular fashion or do this or do that the general guidelines are when you are addressing or talking with the elders you have to be respectful now what they consider to be disrespectful if it goes against Shar don't pay attention to it for example in some countries in Africa it is disrespectful if you don't squat to the elders so what it is not permissible to squat in some countries Asian countries is disrespectful if you don't bow to the elders and again this is against Shar you don't do it even if they consider it to be disrespectful because the guidelines are set by Shar anything else is fine so if for example in Shar it says that the same same gender when you meet the elders you kiss them on the forehead there's no problem in that it's a cultural thing it's a sign of respect that's fine so you have to go alongside filtering the culture and the Customs through the lens of Quran and Sunnah of Shar and if it doesn't go against it there's no problem in it inshallah"
