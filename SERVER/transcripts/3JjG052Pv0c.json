  "title": "Show I'm angry when someone asks about my sins What if parents ask? Is it disrespect Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "but someone asked you about what to do if someone asked us about a sin we have done and you told us that we should like you know show we're like offended so they don't access again ask us again but like what if our like our parents or like uncles us about a sin because like wouldn't that kind of be like disrespectful to like first of all the answer was giving generally speaking now if someone asks you have you ever smoked have you ever talked to a girl have you ever watched porn have you ever skipped Fajr intentionally all of these are sins usually main mainly speaking if you did not do the sin you can simply say no if you were not anticipating such a question from someone who's not entitled to ask you such questions even if you did not do them you should feel offended and if I'm recalling correctly this was in regards of a shooter asking the girl in the interview that he's proposing to if she ever had a boyfriend or if she is a virgin and this is a sin that Allah has concealed and no one has the right to expose it and you don't have the right to go and tell others yeah I did this in the past and alhamdulillah Allah guided me now um all is good no this is totally prohibited so I was advising the girl to act offended and to kick the boy out because no man in his sound mind would ask such an inappropriate disgusting question yeah I need this is inappropriate at all nobody would you like people to ask your sister about this every now and then and or ask your mom every time they meet them of course not Allah concealed it keep it concealed but if someone like your parents your uncle ask you about a sin you can't act offended most likely because that would offend them but you can't Dodge the question and there are many ways of dodging the question this is not the time to teach you how to do that but in short you must not expose yourself and at the same time you must not lie so if they say have you ever smoked before oh yeah I used to smoke like a chimney and drink like a fish what is this why would I smoke who smokes in his right mind and and destroys his health and money this is ridiculous they wouldn't insist and say no no did you smoke because then you should be offended even if it was this straight so there are many ways of dodging such questions and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
