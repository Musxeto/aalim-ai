  "transcript": "[Music] ald for [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] in [Music] [Music] [Music] before I begin my I believe that it is important to bring to your attention one of the etiquettes of jum prayer and by saying this I'm not compelling you to adhere to it but at least I have to relieve myself from the responsibility of not telling you and that is one of the beautiful eates of jum or a number of etiquettes include the reward of one year praying and fasting for each step you make from your home to the Masid imagine so if you walk 10 steps you will be rewarded 10 years as if you have fasted these 10 years and prayed night prayer the whole night what about if I live 100 steps away a thousand steps away you do the math these eates unfortunately are not seen visibly in this Masjid which means that a lot of the worshippers are not doing it the prophet says you do the translation the prophet said whoever wash for and cleans himself well and walks to the Masjid and does not ride walking from your car to here suffice and he draws closer and sit to the IM this etiquette cannot be seen when you sitting at the end of the Masid or at the anex of the Masid and relaxing away you have to draw closer to the IM I'm not getting getting any Financial reward from you when you get closer but you will the prophet said and he listens and he does not divert redirect his attention to anything else meaning that even the Salam he does not answer when someone says alaykum he does not answer he does not look devoting all of his concentration and attention to the IM the prophet says he will be rewarded with every step he makes the reward of a full year of of fasting and prayer so I relieved myself from the responsibility now it's in your courtyard to deal with it coming back to our may Allah be pleased with him said a very beautiful Hadith and this Hadith goes as follows the prophet sallallah wasam said the most beloved of people to Allah is the one who brings most benefit to the people and the most beloved of Deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy or relieving him from hardship or paying off his debt or warding of hunger from him the prophet says for me to go with my Muslim brother to meet his needs is dearer to me than observing in the mid of Medina for a whole month and whoever does not act upon his anger Allah will not expose him and whoever suppresses his rage even though he is able to express it Allah will fill up his heart with Hope on the day of judgment and whoever goes with his Muslim brother to meet his need until it is accomplished Allah will make him stand firm on the day when all feet will slip and bad character or conduct spoils Deeds as vinegar spoils honey this is a beautiful Hadith we can make this a lecture that lasts so long because we need to implement this in our lives all what we usually do is concentrate on individual forms of worship how manyas did you make how many ha did you perform how many hours do you pray night prayer do you fast Mondays and Thursdays and the three white days Etc this this is what signifies to us what a good Muslim is in this Hadith the prophet goes a further step upwards in elevating our IM in showing us that true Iman is when you transform your good deeds to benefit others so in the beginning the prophet says that the most beloved among us to Allah are the those most beneficial to others either by using my reputation to help you my knowledge my wealth My Own Strength as long as I can give you a helping hand this means that I am most beloved to Allah because I'm doing this for the sake of Allah subhanahu wa tala not to be praised by people and then the prophet says focusing a little bit more on the Deeds not on the doers the most beloved Deeds to Allah is when you make a Muslim happy when you relieve him of his hardship when you feed him and save him from Hunger this country Kuwait is and was well known for their charity and for their good work worldwide you never see the name Kuwait without attributing it with charity work orphanages feeding people always coming to their help and this is something coming from a non Kuwaiti and it's coming from someone who was not helped by kuwa alhamdulillah this is a testimony for truth the people of this land are blessed and their blessing has reached the whole world alhamdulillah if you look to the opposite side if this is the best deed beloved to Allah then what is the worst deed hated by Allah most definitely it is causing calamity for people definitely is making people starve and if you look at some of the people around us you find them from this category as well there are always Black Sheep In The Family the prophet says Allah the almighty will torment will punish those who torment and punish people in this St there are people who are Professionals in this you go to them in government offices with a simple paper to sign and they make you take a week a month a year for no reason though they can do it on the spot legally you my friend and I must ask ourselves when was the last time we made a Muslim happy when was the last time we fed a Muslim who was starving and who was hungry when was the last time we relieved Muslims from their trials and calamities our children their teeth are filled with cavities because of the sweets they consume on daily basis while Muslims all over the world are starving don't we have a responsibility what when was the last time we paid off a debt of a Muslim loans and debts are everywhere the prophet emphasized that one of the best Deeds to Allah is to pay off a debt of a Muslim the issue of debts require a separate lecture on it imagine the prophet says whoever lends silver twice as if he offered charity once what does that mean if I give someone 10,000 din as a loan for a week and he returns it after a week I have my 10,000 Dinars in my pocket Allah would reward me as if I have given 5,000 din as s and the money is is where it's in my pocket not only that listen to this even greater Hadith the prophet says whoever Waits and postpones the payment of a debt for someone who's broke Allah will give him for every day a and if the new date was due and he still could not pay it off Allah will give him for each day twice double the amount s in simple English someone borrows 10,000 din from me I set a week limit for him after one week he says apologies I do not have money can you give me 10 more days I said yes I can give you 10 more days for each day of these 10 days Allah would reward me as as if I PID 10,000 as Charity how much 100,000 in charity yes this is the reward 10 days are over and the man says W I don't have the money can you give me some more time sure now this new date is open or set for each day Allah would give me charity of 20,000 din us you do the math of this small amount how much is it is multiplying because I just want to help my Muslim brother debts in Islam are not recommended for me to ask but for you to give definitely it is one of the gateways of jenah if you utilize it well instead of putting it in Banks where they lend it to others with RBA or without RBA and utilize it and you're not benefiting from it the least then the prophet goes on to explain to us the importance of suppressing your anger of preventing your rage from coming out and he tells us that there are a number number of rewards one of them is that Allah fills your heart with satisfaction one of the hardest things in life is when you're oppressed and you're able of expressing your anger because there is a window for that and the other one cannot defend himself yet you decide to suppress it this is difficult but because it is difficult and hard Allah will fill your hearts with satisfaction and content a feeling all the wealth in this world cannot buy not only that in another authentic Hadith Allah tells us that you will be given the choice on the day of judgment in front of all of the people to choose from the whomever you wish and another narration to wear from the garments of dignity and honor and this would be in front of all of the creation later on the prophet in this Hadith mentioned twice the issue of walking with your brother in fulfilling his needs and wish every one of us has needs and so many times people call us can you come to me to this government office or to this company I need your help Ling hand people know you can you do this favor for me so many times if not all we apologize we refuse because we're busy we have so many things on our plate so we think the prophet says for me the prophet of Allah to walk with my brother until his wish is fulfilled until he gets what he desires this is better for for me than sitting in M of Medina for a whole month in you do the math the weight of sitting and worshiping Allah and making VI in Medina Masid for a whole month is not equivalent for me to go with my brother and do whatever he needs in half an hour in an hour in a day Subhan Allah the prophet mentioned this twice and that in the second time he said Allah would make make his foot steadfast when on the day of judgment feet will slip and fall in hell and this shows you the importance of helping your Muslim brother of course in halal not in Haram in legal things not in illegal things the prophet did this exactly in the authentic Hadith a young girl would come to the prophet take an appointment from him and the prophet approves of that and then she comes on the date of the appointment holds her his hand and drags him behind her walking in the streets of Medina talking to him about her problems a young girl a slave girl and the prophet listens to her leaves his companions leaves all the ARs he has leave all the cases leave all the teaching all the prayers just to fulfill the wish of a young slave girl [Music] also may Allah be pleased with him one of the great Companions of the prophet he says every morning when I wake up and I do not see people wanting things from me at my door you know when people want something from someone who's rich they usually Quee outside his house so that when he comes they ask him of what they need hakeim says every morning I wake up and I don't see anyone outside I believe that this is a Calamity and a test from Allah this is a trial I'm at loss when I see people wanting wanting me to do something for them I'm happy and I'm joyful because Allah made me one of the means to fulfill their desires and their needs according to what pleases Allah through me [Music] [Music] among us there are certain people that whenever they are mentioned people praise them people thank them people compliment them because they're known in the community to be beneficial to others usually people go to them in times of calamities and difficulties to ask them for a helping hand for a good advice or just simply to express their anger and frustration in order to hear a comforting word such People Are People of jenah if they cannot help you they will give you a good da if they cannot assist you they will ask Allah that he the almighty would assist you this would comfort your heart on the contrary there are people that you go to and they will help you but not without a price a price of insult a price of humiliating you and feeling that you are begging them for something Allah says in the Quran kind words and forgiving of faults are better than S followed by injury I can W off your D I can give you 10,000 Dinars but if I give it to you and keep reminding you every single day didn't I give you and I expose you in front of the people I gave him 10,000 dins this is injury this is insult that I would not rather take or accept if you give me kind words and forgiving of faults that would have been much better for me and this is why the prophet concluded this beautiful Hadith by saying bad conduct and behavior spoils your good deeds like vinegar spoils honey what happens to honey if you put some vinegar on it it spoils it likewise if you do me a favor but you insult me you remind me Abu may Allah have mercy on his soul he used to sit in the shade of a neighbor of his and then one day the neighbor came to Abu hanifah borrowing some money from him Abu hanifa gladly gave him this loan and since that day he never sat in his shap fearing that the neighbor whenever see he sees Abu hanifah he thinks that he's benefiting from the loan that he had given him and this may break his heart how many times do we break our beloved and our dearer people to our hearts on daily basis how many times do we tell our spouses didn't I do this for you didn't I help your father didn't I do this for your cousin haven't I given you so much how many times have we done this and this spoils your good deeds and renders it as void and as if you did not do it you must not humilate your Muslim Brothers you must do whatever they want you to do as if they are doing you a favor not the other way around because when you ask when they ask you to do something for them you are the one who's getting rewarded so they are the cause of your reward do not humiliate do not insult do not render your good deeds as void due to your bad character or conduct now we are in the era of this is known for us Arabs as Vitamin wow what is everything you do you have to know someone it's not what you know it's not your education it's not your it is who you know and this is the biggest sign of corruption in communities and societies when the Muslim World depends on who you know and people if not breaking the rules and regulations they will bend it for you just because they know you this means that we live in a corrupt community and Country Allah Asel has ordered us to cooperate on on on righteousness and not to cooperate on evil and vice this is what we see in our communities when there is so much transgression when people are trusted when they should not be trusted the prophet was asked oh prophet of Allah when is the day of judgment the prophet said s Alam when the is lost wait for the day of judgment am man trust when it is lost and gone from communities then anticipate and wait for the day of judgment so the man says and how is it wasted how is am and Trust wasted the prophet said when the wrong people are appointed at places of power then anticipate the how would a person assume a position in a company in a government office in a country if it were not for the if he's not qualified this shows you that we have to work from our own homes trying to benefit the Muslims trying to benefit the community this is far greater and far more important than spending your hours Without End praying night prayer this is far more important than fasting voluntary fasts nothing comes close or compared to F or to Ramadan but when you come to auxiliary forms of worship voluntary forms of worship benefiting the Muslims making them Happ happy is far greater and Allah Knows Best m"
