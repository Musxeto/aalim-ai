  "transcript": "dear sneha rahmanir rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen o sallallahu wasallam o Allah Colin Mubarak motilal al-amin Davina y de ahi wasabi he remain dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Ramadan is the month of mercy it is the month where allah azzawajal forgives sins more than any other month it is the month where a large orajel accepts the repentance of his servants and slaves more than any other occasion the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said oh people repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness for I repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness 100 times a day so if the prophet alayhi salatu salam whom his sins the past and the coming have all been forgiven yet he still asks Allah so Allah for forgiveness and he depends to a large division how would we then be the prophet alayhi salatu salam acknowledges that allah azzawajal is a tell web one of allah's beautiful names is that he often accepts the repentance of those who repent to him and he is a fool most forgiving so the Prophet is awesome though he was given an open forgiveness from Allah zerochan yet he often repents and forgetful asks Allah for forgiveness because he's worshiping Allah social through these beautiful deeds and through acknowledging the names and attributes of Allah the Almighty and this was not merely a statement said by the prophet alayhi salatu salam because the Prophet did not say things he did not do unlike other humans the Prophet is awesome always walked the talk he always did what he preached and even more to the extent that he sometimes used to leave things he loves to perform and offer for the fear that Allah may make it obligatory upon the Ummah and he doesn't want to burden his Ummah the prophet alayhi salatu salam sought a las forgiveness more than a hundred times a day and this is something we fail to do probably you know in a week or in a month so many days pass us without repenting to Allah without seeking Allah's forgiveness which is a clear manifestation of the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam when he says I am the most knowledgeable of you about Allah and I am the most fearful among you of him so knowledge and fear go side by side you cannot fear allah azzawajal without the proper knowledge because then you would fail you would fall into despair and you cannot have proper knowledge without feeling a large region because this means that your knowledge is not true it is not correct the proper thing for a Muslim to do is to love Allah to fear Allah and to hope in what Allah has for his righteous servants a blog nomer may allah be pleased with him and with his father tells us that we used to count in a single gathering when we sit with the Prophet aerosol salam we used to count Rob bill Philly were to Molly o Allah forgive me and have repentance on me in the current etowah braheem verily you are the one who accepts repentance and is most merciful we used to count this phrase a hundred times for the prophet alayhi salatu salam imagine him saying this salala slm with his people not intending for them to hear it but when they're not talking or when he's not being addressed with something this is what he used to say and I know scholars of contemporary times who used to do this whenever they were idle and no one is talking to them and they're not talking to anyone you could hear them mumble with asking Allah for forgiveness or praising Allah soldier or remembering allah subhan allah ta'ala and this shows how well-connected a person is to his lord because a proper Muslim is not only connected to Allah through the five daily prayers but rather he is connected to allah azzawajal through remembering allah when you remember allah frequently weather before going to prayer or after you conclude your prayer or within your own prayer when you're walking when you're talking when you are entering a mall to buy something or a supermarket or when you enter the lavatories or when you exit Allah's remembrance is twenty-four seven in your mind so the prophet eraser some was doing this now repentance is remorse so when a person does something wrong there are conditions for his repentance to be accepted among them is remorse and the hadith signifies the importance of remorse so what is actually repentance repentance is when you make something that is wrong you feel sorry for it you are remorseful for doing it so you repent you go back before you did the sin and you ask alonzo gel for forgiveness you can ask Allah for forgiveness without repentance and this is verbal so many people say I stopped for a lot of stuff for Allah but this is not like the actual and true repentance which is an act of the heart because remorse is in your heart and one might say what kind of sins should I repent from the answer all sins Allah social addressed the believers and he said to them and all of you repent to Allah o believers that you may be successful and repentance is not an option no one can come and say I have no sense what should I repent from because the prophet alayhi salaatu sir who is humanly infallible sallallahu alaihi Salam though he makes sense but not major ones he makes minor sins and he repent to Allah from them and Allah has forgiven them and likewise with all messengers and prophets of Allah soldier though the prophet Adam was humanly infallible yet he himself used to seek a las forgiveness so we hear a lot of people saying that we have so many sins in our records and their heinous and they are so huge and big and we feel that Allah will not forgive us I hear people from different religions interested in Islam Buddhists hint Hindus from different religions and when they hear and learn about Islam they immediately fall in love but then they refrain and they say what we have done so many wrong things we have associated others with Allah we have committed what is known as the cardinal sin what is which is shirk we committed and Allah says that he does not forgive people associating others with him and he forgives anything else people misunderstand this ayah first of all allah allah does not forgive shirk if a person dies without repenting but if a person who had committed and associated others with Allah all of his life if a person kept on prostrating to a statue all of his life and lighting candles and then repented Allah would erase all of his bad deeds all of his sins not only that Allah would transform them into good deeds Wow so if you had a million since Allah would turn them back into a million good deeds and this is explained clearly in surat al where allah so jeal tells us that those who do not associate others with Allah and do not kill any innocent people and they do not fornicate and whoever does this would face great torment but those who repent Allah would change their evil ways into good deeds scholars have two different interpretations one say that Allah so L would literally change the bad deeds into good deeds so the sins would be transformed into hasanat others say that allah azzawajal would change the evil ways into righteous ways so associating others with Allah Allah will change it into toe heat worshipping only Allah killing innocent people Allah would change it into security and people are safe from your tongue and from your actions fornication allah azzawajal would turn it into chastity and either ways you are a winner so at the time of the Prophet aerosol salam this thought crossed the mind of some of the companions who wanted to accept Islam but were hesitant because of their heinous acts and the bad things they did before accepting Islam so allah azzawajal revealed this beautiful aya say my slaves who have transgressed against themselves by committing evil deeds and sins despair not of the mercy of Allah verily Allah forgives all sins truly he is oft-forgiving most merciful 3953 so allah azzawajal is the most merciful no sin is greater than his mercy and this is conditional that is providing you repent and you come and seek Allah's forgiveness after doing what you had done and when we talk about shirk go for hypocrisy these things that nullify Islam you must repent before you die if you die in such a state you'll go straight to hell no questions asked however the major and minor sends these are under a las will under the Divine Will if you die without repenting it's up to Allah he may come and forgive some of them or all of them and he may not he may hold you accountable for each and every one and you have to pay for that in hell to be purified of it so no matter how big how hard how see is your sin is this is the time you are in Ramadan where the gates of hell are closed and the gates of heaven are opened this is the time for you to seek unless if pneus if you have it in you allah the almighty told us that his forgiveness is even available to those who attribute a son to him and this is one of the hideous sins a person can commit the Christians when they say that Jesus is the Son of God how can that be when God does not have a wife how can he be a god when we know that God is not created once a God is created then he ceases to be a god anymore a god that can be crucified and humiliated and cannot defend himself this is not a god and why would a God cry to another God saying why do you forsake me why do you leave me if you're a god do something so allah azzawajal has condemned those who attribute a son to him he does not beget the almighty and is not be gotten this is the surah chapter 112 that all Muslims memorized by heart which describes their Lord they know who they worship they know their creator unlike many who have gods and don't know their gods and don't know their reality allah azzawajal abhors those who attribute a son to him nevertheless allah the almighty called them for repentance opens the door for them to come in and seek His forgiveness Allah says to them in the Quran after mentioning how bad is what they say about him and making him one out of three and making him the father of a son Allah says will they not repent to Allah and ask his forgiveness for Allah is oft-forgiving most merciful even if you fell into that trap of Satan and said that Jesus was the son of god allah azzawajal does not close the door in your face he opens it and he orders you to come repent to him embrace his final religion Islam and accept him as your Creator and the only one worthy of being worshipped and he shall turn all of your bad deeds into good deeds not only that we know that in surat al baruj where allah tells us about this tyrant king who ordered the people to worship Him and when they refused after seeing with their own eyes the miracles of allah azzawajal which were displayed at the hands on the hands of the young boy Abdullah Ilona they refused to go back into ship so this tyrant king dug trenches and filled it up with firewood and built a huge fire nothing that man ever had seen before and then it was the Inquisition if you accept the King to be your Lord to be your God and you worship him you're saved if not you burnt alive and thrown into this inferno the whole people of the village willingly fell into the fire because they believed in Allah Almighty and they believed that this life is a transitional phase and after it it is either paradise forever may Allah make that my Adobe and yours or it is Hellfire may Allah give us refuge from it so they threw themselves because they did not want to go back to the darkness after seeing the light to those who threw a las servants in hell of this dunya to the to those who threw them in the fire because of their belief and conviction Allah did not even close the door in their faces Allah the most forgiving the most merciful opened the doors when he said verily those who put into trial the believing men and the believing women by torturing them and burning them and then do not return in repentance to Allah will have the torment of hell and they will have the punishment of the burning fire Subhan Allah even those who tortured your servants your righteous slaves yet you still open the doors of repentance for them and you will forgive them something that is even funnier than this the prophet alayhi salatu salam tells us that a man and his killer end up in Jenna so they said how is that possible a prophet of Allah he says a Muslim and a kafir they fight and defend the kafir that this believer kills the Muslim so the Muslim is martyred and ends up in Jenna and later on this disbeliever reverse to Islam and he dies so his bad sins are trained to good sins and he ends up with his victim in paradise what a beautiful religion this is what a beautiful Lord we have who forgives sins who pardons sins the prophet said alayhi salatu salam allah the almighty spreads out his hand at night to accept very pendants of those who did wrong during the day and he spreads out his hand during the day to accept the repentance of those who did wrong during the night this will continue until the Sun rises from the west and we all know that one of the great signs of the hereafter of the day of judgement is when the Sun ceases to rise from the east and it rises from the west so with a lord that has the names of the one who repents and the one who forgives with such beautiful attributes with the Lord spreading his hand in the day and in the night so he always accepts those who come to him in repentance he always answers the call of remorseful hearts and he sees the tears running down from sinners eyes where else can we head to there's nowhere to go except to him allah azzawajal tells us fulfill who in law run to Allah the Almighty scholars say it's a human nature when you fear something you run from it if you fear a lion you run away if you feel a snake you run away but when you fear Allah the Almighty you run towards him in repentance and in forgiveness because Allah social would not turn you away and he will accept you when you come to him isn't it time for us in this beautiful month to seek a las forgiveness and to show a la true repentance if Allah intends good for you and for me a lot almighty will make us repent Allah the Almighty will facilitate the way for us to seek His forgiveness otherwise we should acknowledge that we are deprived from his mercy may Allah so jeal have mercy on us all we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back we have samra from saudi arabia and said i'm making sure sample avocado i think i have three questions yes the first one is we know that I know that our good deeds take it multiplied by default 10 times but I also know that allah azzawajal he multiplies our good deeds to more than God 7700 and even more than that my question of how can we yet how can we get that how can we get as good needs to be multiplied to so many more times okay okay my second question is is there anything to tell us that in the Ramadan the reward for reciting one later of the Quran is 700 by default by something like that okay I'm a third question is reciting fluid in his class we get well award for a site and one once we get reward finish typing the Quran were sorry really catches reward for reciting wonder of the Quran is there anything to

house on that land but for five months ago I decided not to build a house on that land and now i'm thinking to sell it in fact last month i try to take the price of the land in the market what is the price but still with me so my first question is that whether i should pay the cow on it now because i decided to sell it three months before only and the second thing still it is with me I'm not this is one question a second question of mine is share my brother is there his team with my mother since long we last 20 25 25 years and he was working somewhere he was doing some job minium I had the two three brothers were there they are working in the Gulf so we got we are for brother elder brother to leave the job and be with the mothers nobody's there to take care of her so in short we two three

your talk on a ship I wanted to I just want to make a small comment before i come to my questions and you know we do from Africa and you know the African religion killed where we already have our whole traditions and we asserted the slump but they're both traditions has not been ignored alhamdulillah our brothers and Sunnah wal Jamaah are doing a lot to help and the religious but you know as you have other adult sex who are preaching differently and there are some people from here from Saudi Arabia going to Africa Ghana as well and then they do a lot of preaching but you're yesterday's topic is very very important in Africa so I believe you might have some people and they die watchable from Saudi Arabia that would do that I with the Africa if they could be emphasizing a lot on ship okay exercise yeah undo ok I will answer this question shot laughing amazon putter ya Salam aleikum Sheikh Santa law I want to know the interpretation of the one of oil current among cattle Emerson but I did not seeno fitted into a spoken on a bottle and NASA jamia and according to death aya how much of the things the OS is committing with the genocide in Iraq II and Korea yeah she okay I would answer in sha Allah he is ecologic d'oeuvres an from Australia flowery Santa la yeah sure I have a question about this hadith of the prophet alaihi wassalam yes that I said Allah descends in the third quarter of the night in the first heaven and that is why we pray touch it and make drive at that time and that also applies for the data to other my question is which night doesn't apply to because when it's night here in Australia is not nice him at the other side of the town okay Adams me yes I understand your question oh I will I see inshallah thank you very much you're welcome O'Malia from Saudi Arabia I feel only come here so I'm to LA I think I have two questions yes question is like how can I give daba to my like non Muslim friends they are Hindus so what is the correct procedure to give Dawa as I inform them that only allies did so what is the correct procedures a chic I want that and my second question is sometimes like at the time of fasting for example if were like for example if husband is watching movies and if the Sun is not behaving well with the parents so people will generally say that why are you fasting no use of fasting if you behave like this this is your fast will not be accepted by Allah so is this correct to give the comments those who are disobedient to allah ok i will answer in sha allah okay Jessica la Rosa's welcome Hussein from Nigeria okay I think we lost her saying I think we will stop here and answer a few of yesterday's questions and then we will pick up the pace Sophia from Pakistan yesterday asked us the ruling of holding a must-have while the Imam is reciting in taraweeh as far as the salat is concerned it is valid holding the must have the Quran and reading from it behind the Imam does not nullify your prayer but is it recommended the answer is no except in one incident that if a person a man is behind the Imam and he is checking whether the Imam is reading from his memory correctly or not this is ok now for you holding a must-have would make you lose a number of sunnah first of all you will not be able to look at the place of your prostration which is a sunnah secondly you cannot put your right on the left on the chest because you have to hold the must-have thirdly you'll be annoying those to your right and left every time you turn a page or a change the way you're holding the most half and there is some movement in the process therefore it is not recommended but as stated before the solace is correct fatima from saudi arabia she says there's a confusion when falling from a standing position to prostrate what should touch the ground first my knees are my hands there's an issue of dispute it's an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars use the same hadith to say different opinions however the my personal opinion is that you fall on your hands first especially if you are preying on a marble ground or ground with pebbles if you go on your knees this might hurt your knees while if you go on your hands first discussions you're landing but again this is my personal preference a number of scholars back this up like Cheryl albani for example and others other scholars say no you have to fall down onto your knees first in accordance to the hadith of available merger and share community mean supports this opinion sheriff in bass may Allah have mercy on his soul and the souls of other scholars say that if you do this or you do that whatever your personal preference is and this is the most authentic it is something that is open for people to choose whatever they feel comfortable with second question of Fatima from Saudi Arabia is it permissible to have a recitation of the Quran for example as chassidus as a ringtone for your mobile dancer is definitely not and the reason is not because when the ayah is being recited in your answer in the middle of it you cutting it the reason is it's a form of disrespecting and humiliating the Quran you think a large l revealed it to be a ringtone even the adhan cannot be used as a ringtone because the advan is something to notify people of the time of salat so if you're doing it in the middle of the night and there is no salat you're mocking the Sharia and you're making fun of religion bashira from Qatar says what's the ruling of staying with the mother the stepmother if I understood the question correctly took a couple married what's the ruling of them staying in the parents of the wife or the parents of the husband both is permissible because they are all Muharram to each other but if the father is married to a woman who's not the mother of your wife by staying in their house his wife is not your mother-in-law she's a total stranger so you cannot mix with her and likewise with the woman living in her husband's parents house her second question was about someone who's sick is it permissible to go to sorcerers to unlock the spell on him this is totally prohibited going to sorcerers for medication or for curing or healing is not permissible and this is shirk it may and can nullify your Islam she asked about a hadith where the companions were giving some form of magic spell this is baseless that it's totally against Islam to deal with sorcery and magical spells so none of this is correct a 17 year old who is very fragile and sick and cannot fast can she feed and I asked her is it Chronicle or something that is recoverable I don't recall the answer but both ways if a 17 years old is sick or too tired too fast she may break her fast and pray a make up for it some other day after Ramadan if there is a chance of recovering but if the doctors say that her illness is terminal it's for good until she dies and she will not be able to fast in the future in this case you may feed a poor person for every day skipped Samra from saudi arabia she says that we know allah azzawajal had told us whoever does and the prophets a lesson in the authentic hadith whoever does a good deed Allah will multiply it into 10 this is by default how many times more the Prophet said that some up to 700 folds so it can be multiplied 700 times as in the surah in chapter 2 when Allah talks about the grain of wheat and how Allah social multiplies the good deeds of what you spend however how do we attain this by sincerity so when you're sincere the more sincere you are in offering any good deed regardless of that did the more multiplication you will get for it so if your deed is not so sincere you may not get past 10 you may be getting only one if your deeds are sincere but they're not in accordance to the Sunnah definitely you'll not be multiplied because you haven't you need to the you need to let me rephrase that you need these two things for your deeds to be accepted sincerity and the compliance with the Sunnah of the Prophet erase all Absalom and she says that is one letter of the or an equivalent to 700 good deeds in Ramadan no this is for all in Ramadan and other in Ramadan the Prophet said I do not say Alif Lam Meem is a letter Aleph is a letter lamb is a letter meme is a letter by itself and these are multiplied by 10 and up to 700 folds she says that chapter 112 is equivalent to the Quran no it's not the hadith says that whoever recites chapter 112 this is equivalent to one third of the Quran so if you recite a three times as if you've recited the Quran as a whole in reward may be other scholars say no it's not this it is that a class sincerity monotheism Coheed is one-third of the Quran so one-third of the Quran is description of a large so jealous beautiful names and attributes another third is about what is halal and what is her arm and the legislation's of it a third is about those who believe in Allah and his messengers and they're the stories of the messengers and the scription of Jenna which would be there a bite and those who reject and the messengers how they rejected them and how would they end up in hell so these are three thirds of the Quran Allah knows best Muhammad from Qatar says that he had a land and few months ago he changed his intention and now he wants to sell it so he's asking around how much it costs should he gives the cat dancers know until you display it for the cat so let's say five months ago you change your intention only this month you went to the offices and said listen I have this plot and I want this much in it so please advertise it only then the meter starts and after one whole year if it was not sold then you have to give the cat on the current price if it was sold and you still have the money you have to pay zakat for that money after a one-year of your intention and displaying it for sale his brother who they have agreed that he stays with his their mother and they support him is doing since so what how to behave if you give giving him money to stay jobless and to be with your mom in this case you have to reach a conclusion that we're not giving you the cash in your hand we will provide you with the food we will pay for the rent and if you need clothes we will support you and give you whatever you need for you and your children but we would not give you cash because you will misbehave and use the cash we give you in buying alcohol and doing sins and this does not please Allah zerochan said that was saying that yesterday's talk was suitable for diaries from Saudi Arabia going to Africa I wouldn't be lying if I tell you I don't know what was yesterdays talk about I think it was about the story of Molly American now I remember yes but I don't know where came through except maybe bad omens and going to the priests so this is Ali the basics of any day in Saudi Arabia this is the ABC that any day any students of knowledge any students in high schools or intermediate schools learn in our schools in Saudi Arabia so they all know it by default because that education system in Saudi Arabia is based on to heat and teaching the people how to worship Allah properly so I second your recall and definitely those going to make dara the first thing they have to do is to master to heat knowledge is and things that would call people to it I think we can take calls from now because I have like three questions left I met from Qatar says what is the interpretation of the ayah that whoever killed a soul as if he killed all of human kindness aya was revealed after the story in chapter 5 of the two sons of Adam who killed one another one of them killed the other so allah azzawajal is telling us that the killing of a person because he initiated it and he started the trend of killing others would be like as if he killed the whole of mankind and this is why the hadith supports this saying that whoever kills a human being the sins of that murder will be also accredited to the first son of adam who killed his brother now this doesn't mean killing is prohibited we know that we can kill for legitimate reasons but this is not for you and me this is only for the Muslim ruler who is the judge who orders the execution of XYZ who orders for the punishment of this and that other than this this is not for individuals to do Oh mwah seem from Saudi homo seem from Saudi I don't want to come off like you that I got to shake what exam actually i am from UK at the moment i am doing my own I came home I mean Mokpo ok my question is and I am in a hotel in zimzim tower they have the prayer facilities ranelagh i went to pray but i couldn't find what should my salad there is a lot of talk people were disturbing and i'm talking a lot now we have the facility in my room I can hear the Imam can my daughter myself follow that Imam in the room ok in my own room that's one question and the second question because I'm a traveler do you do I have to do the cigna ok and the third question shake as I mean Makka here weird writing my zakah fitrah the colors are absolutely trapped ok ukalaka woods is a go we have home sauna from Saudi no I come shake something la fake one of the best programs over TV thank you very much normal ahead I shake only one question we our Indian community plays Trey Zwicker exactly like Maghreb Salah I don't know whether it is there is the right way to do it and I'm not sure of the legislation being cocky aren't Sunni prayers I followed a harem they prayed to and then they get up and paid pray the third rocker she could just get us as to what is the right way of doing I will I will inshallah very minute after you your closet abroad one from Saudi hello Mario she said Antola my question is that how do we perform umrah to or two people at the same time yeah how do we perform over for two people okay i will answer you shabba okay thank you doesn't from Australia had the question and he said allah azzawajal as stated in the hadith descends to the lower heaven when it is the last third of the night so before Sun the break of dawn two hours three hours depending on the length of the night a lotta sense to the lower heaven and says who is there asking me so I should give who is seeking my forgiveness so that I would forgive who is there requesting something from me that I should grant him and this is every night and he says that also we know that the night of decree laila tov cutter is one night in the last 10 nights of ramadan so what is the nature of this hadith the night of putter when we know that the globe earth is in one part daytime and another part it's nighttime so when it's a day in Australia down under as they call it it's morning elsewhere but our night elsewhere it's the opposite so his confusion is when Allah says that he descends to the lower heaven and this is 24 7 around the globe so he is unable to say the question and he has all the right not to say the question because as al Osuna will jamar we do not think of Allah like any other thing when we acknowledge the fact that allah azzawajal has two hands as he described in the Quran this is what he said about himself and the Prophet as salam said that about himself we do not simulate or give examples Oh Allah's hands is like this or alazai we cannot even contemplate on it or imagine it because Allah is unlike anything you had ever imagined in your life and i'll give you an example and Allah the Almighty has the highest example if I say that an ant the small insect has an a leg or a hand and an elephant has a hand and I have a hand no one would say that these hands are similar at all and Allah has the highest example so when Allah tells us that he descends do you think for a second that it is like when i get off my share and sit on the ground stuff Allah or two really a las division cannot be thought of in such a fashion so sure how do you understand it we understand it as it is Allah tells us he'd essentially believe in that how this is something beyond our imagination and it we're not even supposed to go into it what about later to qatar sheikh laila tov kada did the Prophet arrested Sam tell us that it is one specific night for all it can be the 23rd in Saudi Arabia and maybe 27th elsewhere in Australia Allah knows so we believe that it was hidden from us so that we would perform an offer a lot of good deeds in these 10 nights the last 10 nights of ramadan not to be selective like some lazy people i know the night of the 21st they pray night prayer and they spend it in reading the quran the night of the 22nd the following night they go to the malls in the day shopping and have suhoor outside and as if Allah does not exist anymore and this is wrong you should do your level best to focus on these 10 whole night and do not contemplate or think or imagine a larger like you and I Allah is unlike anything we've ever thought of and we should believe what he has said as it is without doing any simulation or giving examples O'Malia from saudi arabia she says how do i call hindus to islam first of all you call them to the oneness of Allah proved to them that everything you see was created by Allah this would be a milestone if you succeed in doing this if they this regard their sixteen thousand plus gods they have and they believe only in the oneness of Allah social this is a milestone immediately they would follow because the Quran is there it's proof beyond beyond beyond doubt likewise it's the sooner like while wise is the beautiful religion of Allah second of all your behavior the way you speak and talk to them and deal with them by the way you practice Islam is also one of the greatest ways of Darwin when people sin if the man is watching movies and and soap operas while he's fasting or the Sun is disobedient out of anger and rage we sometimes cross the line and say why are you fasting Allah will not accept your fast if you're doing these hideous acts this is wrong this is totally separate his fast might lose reward but you don't have the right to say to someone don't fasts or don't pray some of the sisters do this unfortunately they see some bombshell beautiful woman wearing a miniskirt and having her hair out and perfume that you can smell from the other block and she comes in with her high heels takes her hijab and prayer cloth clothes and enters the message to pray and the sisters look at her and despise her is say why are you praying Allah will not accept your prayer are audible la this was done by one righteous person as the Prophet tells us are some there were two brothers a monk on top of the of the mountain and his sinful brother who's doing sends all day long so the monk went down and every time he sees his brother tells him you should refrain you should stop Alonzo L will punish you for that and the brother says leave me alone it's me and my lord it's none of your business one day the monk got so frustrated he said by allah allah azzawajal will not forgive her since Allah revealed to the prophet of that time tell the monk to resume his good deeds because I have nullified I invalid invalidated all of his good deeds and tell that a sinful person I have forgiven all of his sins so you should not do that call them to Islam in a nice and fashionable and diplomatic way Allah would open their hearts with the good words not with the harsh words and as usual we have like three four questions left tomorrow inshallah i'll try to answer them and until then I leave you fear vennila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and blessings of Allah be on Habiba p 7 love and blessings of Allah beyond but my soul beyond happy"
