  "title": "Is it permissible to send our children abroad for studies? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "that a boy was interested in going to America for studying and his parents during Hajj made istikhara and said o Allah if there is good in it let it happen if not turn it away so now he got admission and in a few days time he's leaving and his parents are asking was this the right decision first of all mr. Hara cannot be made except by the individual concerned so if my daughter is about to get married I cannot place the collar for her I can press the heart for me oh Allah if meeting the potential suitors or spouse good for me in this dunya etcetera etcetera then make it happen otherwise let it go but I cannot say Allah if him marrying my daughter is so and so and so make it happen she has to make that call for herself secondly you have to look into the action itself a person and this is a very far-fetched example but it might be any clear things up a person is interested in going to a nightclub so he praises the Hara and says hey what are you doing she I'm asking Allah if there is good it will happen if not Hallows Noah you make Asturian permissible things in things that the outcome of is positive sending your child to the u.s. who is not married who is not knowledgeable who is hot-blooded and young do you think that would be beneficial for him 99% would be harmful and devastating why the child the kid has been around his parents all of his life there's a curfew if he is late he's grounded if he does something wrong so he knows that he has to be home before 9:00 p.m. he knows that he has to do his chores he has to print a message it's set there's so many obligations because there is supervision once he goes to the US where everything is open and free it is difficult to stand in the face of a title wave if not impossible so how do you expect this poor young lad brilliant chap to stand firm steadfast on Islam when all this fitna is surrounding him at school and the market on in the park wherever he goes all around him so much fitna taking people out of Islam totally plus the doubts that is being casted upon him plus the things that he sees in admirers this is not like what we have in Pakistan look at this look at that even if he goes to the to the church in his message it his fear he would see the motto were like myself with the long beard and shouting and fear Allah you are going to hell in paradise is this and that why is he shouting but when he goes to church the guy comes in a three-piece suit well shaven nicely giving his sermon in a very soft voice general churches that is not the one with the music and the dancing in the Gospels etc and he says wow this is nice this is fun this influence is devastating now I don't say that it is haram to send your children learn you have to unfortunately at times acquire the technology and the knowledge the disbelievers that kafirs have we cannot do this without them going to study but at least his mother goes with him at least get him married and send him with his wife so 80% of the damage is contained rather than just send him off and keep your fingers crescent because crosses is Haram even Crescent is an invasion but this is a figure of speech don't sue me for that so what's happening is devastating to most of our youth when we send them to foreign countries unsupervised unprotected and not possessing the tools and means to keep them far away from fitna and from the doubts they are facing so this is his parents called this is his call I'm just an advisory I would not ever do this to any of my children not in a million years because I know what's there and I know how fragile and vulnerable our children are may allah azza shall protect all of our children and the muslim youth all over the world"
