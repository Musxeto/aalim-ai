  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good enlightening this day is alright as the first time always the night with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love and welcome to this new program of virtues of fasting we have hadith number eleven in the chapter that deals with fasting in the book of bulu al-maram which was compiled by al-hafiz qalani may allah have mercy on his soul and the hadith was narrated by anas may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said eat the which is the pre-dawn meal for there are blessings in this meal and this hadith was agreed upon we should have had a picture of the hadith displayed on your screen so maybe it's coming through the mail it's going to take it a while well here it is uh the prophet says eat the sahur which is a pre-dawn meal for there are blessings in this meal agreed upon first of all what is the meaning of agreed upon agreed upon is a terminology used when the hadith has been reported by both imam al-bukhari and al-imam muslim and such an agreement grades the hadith to be the highest level of authenticity so whenever you hear the word agreed upon you know that this is the highest level of authenticity and that this hadith is in the top rank and it comes immediately after the verses of the quran in acceptance and in authenticity the prophet says allah eat the sahul and here the prophet is ordering us eat so if you recall in a previous segment we said that there are verdicts that are given through what is known as and these five verdicts we apply them on whatever we do so we have an instruction an order and we have something that is highly recommended we have something that is permissible we have something that is not recommended or macro and then we have what is prohibited and forbidden so the norm is whenever allah in the quran or his messenger tells us an order that this has to be followed and it's an obligation so when allah says establish prayer then this means you must pray it is not something that well if you want go ahead if you don't refrain and likewise when allah says do not approach fornication this no one says yeah allah is saying that it's highly recommended that you do not but if you do it's okay no this we have to take it for as it is the scholars say unless there comes hadith or another evidence that takes it from obligation to a recommended thing and uplifts it from prohibition prohibition into something that is makru but we have to look into the various texts and evidences in order to comprehend and understand how to obtain such a verdict so here the prophet is ordering us to have sahur the majority of schools of thought say that this is recommended it's a recommendation it is not uh an instruction an order for us to comply with and how would we say that as long as there's an order scholars say that they looked at other evidences and they found for example that there are other evidences saying that it is permissible to join days in fasting without breaking them as the prophet did alayhi salsam with his companions and we will come to discuss this maybe on monday inshallah if allah permits us to do so so they say that such an evidence proves that if it were mandatory to have the sahar the pre-dawn meal then the prophet would have ordered them to do this likewise the prophet said in another hadith have the pre-dawn meal even if you sip few sips of water so they say that this is the minimum of sahur of the pre-dawn meal and this shows it's not an obligation but it is always best to be safe rather than sorry because as the prophet said as when he said in the hadith have uh or eat the sahur for there are blessings in this meal there is baraka so one would say what kind of barakah are you referring to well one of the biggest forms of barakah is complying by the order and instruction of the prophet are historic then he has gained and won a reward that is huge and and big and sahur has blessing but what do we mean by blessing blessings is the increase and the favors that allah puts in something so a lot of good sustainability and the growth of something this is a barakah and barakah is only from allah the blessing is only from allah and we have blessed things for example we have blessed sahur our prophet is blessed and and so on and maybe we would talk about the different forms of blessings later on uh let's go and investigate when the prophet says that there are blessings in the pre-dawn meal so one of the greatest blessings of sahur is that you are complying you are following you're obeying your prophet sallallahu alaihi and this is the greatest blessing ever why allah says if you obey him you will be guided and we desperately need this guidance can you leave home knowing that you will not reach your destination because you don't have a destination when you leave home you must have a destination so you need guidance and the proper guidance comes from allah azzawajal the only guidance comes from allah subhanahu wa so the best barakah the best blessing is from following and complying to the instructions of the prophet also part of the barakah found in sahur is that we differentiate ourselves from the people of the book and who are the people of the book the other jews and the christians the prophet says the separation the difference between our fasting and the fasting of the people of the book is the pre-dawn meal so we understand and learn from this hadith that the christians and the jews when they fast they do not have a pre-dawn meal while it's one of the characteristics of the muslims that they have this pre-dawn meal and one would say why should we be different than the jews and the christians well this is the essence of our religion to have our identity to be proud of it and to announce it to all allah says in the quran and who is better in rhetoric there is no one better in rhetoric than he who calls others to allah and does righteous deeds and proclaims that he is among the muslims nowadays people are ashamed of saying that we are muslims they are not proud of it as they used to be because of the media because they are feeling inferior and they have this inferiority complex that everyone is better than us because they don't know their religion and they're not proud of their religion and this is wrong our religion is based on going against the ways of the jews and the christians when it comes to their religion and when it comes to their customs and not only that we go against all other nations customs because muslims have their own identity and when we hear people and leaders from the western countries saying that the muslims must blend in this is not acceptable at all muslims cannot blend in muslims can cooperate muslims can achieve all success and things that benefit their religion benefit themselves and benefit their countries but they cannot blend in so you would not distinguish and differentiate between a muslim and non-muslim now this is totally out of the scope of islam and this is islam love it or leave it but you cannot tell people and tell muslims no you have to blend in you have to be like us you have to join the army you have to fight a wars no muslims have priorities their allegiances to quran and sunnah their allegiances to allah and to his messengers and going against their ways is part of our religion that is why in the fatih guide us to the straight path the path of those whom you have favored and blessed other than those who you have been angry with or you have sent astray and the interpretation that the companions all agree upon is that these are the jews and the christians whom allah have whom allah has his wrath over them the jews and whom allah had sent them astray the christians so every day we recite this in the fatiha in the is in the greatest surah of the quran which is composed of seven verses chapter number one we ask allah to guide us a straight path the path of those whom he had favored other than the jews and the christians now this is the essence of our deen and that is why the prophet tells us in the hadith of abdullah ibn's pleas with the man with his father woman and whoever imitates people he would be considered part of them whoever imitates whoever mimics people he would become part of them and that is why so many verses of the quran tells us that you should not take the jews and the christians allies so many hadiths tell us that we should differentiate ourselves from the jews and the christians and the idol worshipers for example the prophet tells us allah that you should go against the jews and christians and the idol worshipers and the fire worshipers by growing your beads and trimming your mustaches this is for men of course not for women and this is part of a religion it is mandatory it is not a sunnah in the sense that if i shave it tomorrow i'm not sinful no it is mandatory it's an obligation for every male to leave his beard not to shave it because shaving it is against the four schools of thought and it's against the way of the prophet and his instruction also the prophet is in a clear an authentic hadith tells us pray in your shoes and sandals pray in your shoes and sandals because the jews do not pray except barefooted they do not pray while wearing their sandals so in islam if i'm going to pray in an airport or in a mall or in the park i'm not obliged to take my shoes off on the contrary as long as my shoes are clean meaning that there are no impurities on them i simply can't pray with them on just to follow the sunnah and to be different than the jews and the christians and the prophet says that we should hasten in breaking our fast and delay and postpone our pre-dawn meal so that we differ from the jews the christians and the other non muslims the prophet forbade from offering voluntary prayer when the sun is rising and when the sun is setting so this is not permissible in islam because it imitates it mimics the disbelievers when not all of them of course but those who worship the the the devil who worship satan they specifically choose and target this time to prostrate for their lord and that is satan and part of going against the way of the jews and the christians is the hadith of the prophet salatu when he said may allah curse the jews and the christians for they had taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship and the prophet is saying this allah to warn the muslims not to follow suit the prophet is warning the muslims allah that they must not take the graves of himself as places of worship so going to his grave worship and worshiping allah next to his grave thinking that this is getting you closer to allah is a a reason to be cursed by allah azzawajal and that is why mother said if the prophet did not say this we would have elevated his grave and we would have done so and so and so and the companions they did not do this they buried him in the house of mother which was outside of the masjid later on 80 or 90 or 100 years later later on one of the uh caliphs of the umayya empire included the house when he expanded the mosque and everybody stood against him but unfortunately when you have the army you cannot no one can stop you and he did not listen to them so the prophet is telling us do not follow the jews and the christians in this because this also takes you away and deviates you from the straight path and we have a lot of influence from outsiders as muslims for example now a lot of muslim countries a lot of muslim people are being so loose in the commitment to islam for example we have national days and in islam this is an innovation we don't have anything such as national days or national anthems or a moment of silence or going to visiting the uh um this grave of of the unknown soldier whatever and putting some bouquets of flour all of this is totally prohibited and against islam because it is not part of our religion when you hear people saying that we have mother's day what do you mean by mother's day muslims celebrate mother's day every single year every single day of the year it's 24 7. otherwise you flunk the test if you do not honor respect and obey your mother every single hour of the year so when people come and say no just give her a good uh gift and honor her and on that day and then abuse her the rest of the year this has nothing to do with islam also if you go to the issue of customs you will find that the muslims are so far away from the instruction of the prophet islam not to imitate or mimic the disbelievers go to any restaurant five stars uh uh hotels or restaurants and you'll find that people are eating and drinking in silver or gold utensils and this is definitely prohibited in islam and the prophet told us hassan whoever consumes food or drink in it he would swallow and he would eat and drink from hellfire on the day of judgement and no muslim cares they have no problem with that not only that if you watch people eat it's another good habit i know but just for the sake of learning if you watch muslims eat they use the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand and they cut the meat and they eat with their left knowing that the prophet said alaihis salat was that the devil eats and drinks and gives and takes with his left as muslims we're not allowed to do this but it is the inferiority complex we feel so humiliated and small we would like to look like them we would like even to talk like them isn't it a shame when you're a muslim and you have your own language for me as an arab for example isn't it a shame when an arab speaks to another arab in english why because it makes me feel sophisticated sheikh when i speak to you in english i feel like you know i'm something subhan allah in like seven centuries ago in what they used to call the dark ages in europe they used to send their kids the rulers of these countries they used to send their kids to spain nowadays spain al-andalus to the muslim rulers palaces so that they can learn arabic and they can learn from the sciences that they have and they would humbly write letters requesting this nowadays it's the other way around if you study in arabia you are you your degree is worthless but if you take it from the u.s or from elsewhere wow this guy is sophisticated and this is not true but it is the weakness the muslims feel they don't have the dignity they don't have their honor and pride anymore because they're imitating the disbelievers and every single thing and the way they talk in the way they dress and even the in the means of entertainment they watch what do they like they like to watch movies soap operas talk shows that come from cbs abc nbc whatever they call them talk shows and they would like to watch wrestlings things that do with entertainment so all what they're brainwashed by are these means of the media and this is the easiest way to control the muslims brainwash them let them blend in and then when we want to occupy them we will send our armies and they are ready to receive us receive us with open hands now it is gonna be difficult they're gonna oppose us and they're gonna fight us back but when you brainwash them and they become followers like your tails for example for a dog any er they will go wherever you go then you can conquer them so islam says no you have to be proud without arrogance you have to be strong without violence and you have to have your dignity you have to have your your honor displayed wherever you go and part of the blessings of the pre-dawn meal is that it strengthens you so that you can fast because a person who does not have the pre-dawn meal is not going to fast as comfortably as someone who who did eat this pre-dawn meal and that is why whatever encourages you whatever supports you to fulfill your form of worship on the best form islam recommends this highly for example prayer while in submissiveness in hoshur is highly recommended yet when a person has to go to the bathroom and relieves uh he has to go to relieve himself islam tells him no if you want to relieve yourself do not pray and go and relieve yourself if somebody is extremely hungry and the food is being served and the prayer is being called for islam tells you eat first then go and pray not the other way around why because islam encourages you to do your form of worship on the best of fashion and manner so likewise when you fast if you have this pre-dawn meal then the fasting would be easier for you and you'll be stronger and that is why this is one of the blessings of suhur part of the blessings of this pre-dawn meal in arabic is called suhur is that you are following the footsteps of the prophet and this adds a lot of value see when you do something because allah ordered you to do it or because the prophet ordered you to do it that's a good thing and that's a positive thing what's more good and more positive for you is that when you do it with the intention of following the footsteps of the prophet sallam the difference is like the heavens and the earth because when you do it with this intention everything is paved in front of you everything is paid for you the road is easy because no matter how hardship you may face hunger thirst etc once you remember that i'm doing this for the prophet ali salazar or let me rephrase that i'm doing it in following the prophet you will find that this this form of worship has gained a lot of momentum among the blessings of the pre-dawn meal is that it makes you wake up just before fajr at the time of sahar and we know that this is one if not the blessed time of the whole day and the night that is before fajr when it's the third uh last third of the night when allah descends to the lower heaven and allah says are there or is there someone asking me so that i give him is there someone seeking my forgiveness so i would forgive him is there someone repenting so i would accept his repentance etc so this is one of the blessings of sahur you wake up to eat and you also manage to ask allah for forgiveness supplicate invoke allah azzawajal all of this is because allah azza because you are following the sin of the prophet islam and having your pre-dawn meal and among the blessings of salat of of suhur is that you wake up for fajr prayer so those who have their pre-dawn meal they have their suhur they will definitely have uh their time to prepare for uh fajr and they would play fajr with the congregation on time and we have like couple of minutes left so there's always an issue if i'm in doubt should i eat or once i hear the adhan of fajr i should refrain and likewise if i'm in doubt whether the adhan of maghrib is on or not should i break my fast or wait there is a firkhi rule which uh a legal maxim i think they call it which states that everything remains as it is until proven otherwise so if i'm fasting it's daytime now in saudi arabia i'm fasting alhamdulillah and in the studio it's really dark and i don't have a watch and i say to myself maybe it's maghrib time i cannot eat i should not and i must not eat until i am certain that the day is over and night has begun until i'm certain that the sun has set until i am most likely certain not necessarily seeing it it is the opposite when it comes to the pre-dawn meal because it is night time and i'm doubtful is the event has been given did the dawn break or not yet if i'm doubtful i can eat and drink until i'm certain that it's time for the break of dawn or until i am most likely certain so when it comes to pre-dawn meal a lot of the brothers and sisters may stop like 15 minutes a buffer zone or just to be safe rather than sorry this is wrong you must eat and drink until you are almost certain or certain that the break of dawn is due so that is usually announced by the evan but if you know that the person who give who gives the advan gives five minutes or four minutes early you can still eat until you feel satisfied that it is the break of dawn we have a short break stay tuned and afterwards inshallah we'll be taking your questions and welcome back we have uh fergan from au for khan from saudi for khan from saudi arabia how are you doing i'm fine for asking i wanted to ask uh when you're reading the quran do you have to um sort of read it loudly is it possible um that was actually without sound okay any more questions even even in salah i mean normally as well out and outside of salah and um any more questions okay and we have um muhammad say i have a question yes um actually you know i just took some loans from al-ghazi bank but they are saying there is no interest in sharia complaints but they are saying some commission or something so i just wonder you know whether it's i already took the money so i just want to know and just received some food from a non-muslim lady she is a non-muslim friend but my question is she is asking whether it's um allowed to eat or not in saudi yeah in saudi arabia okay okay thank you thank you you're welcome from saudi arabia asked what is the ruling on reciting the quran silently whether in salat or outside of the salah of course inside of the salat we have the sunnah of the prophet islam to recite the quran loudly in fajr maghrib and isha so this is the sunnah but it's not mandatory meaning that if a person prays fajr silently his prayer is valid likewise reciting the quran you have the option to recite it loudly or silently but the biggest problem is that a lot of the muslims think that silently is to have your lips sealed and you just scan it with your eyes and read it in your heart and this is not true and this is not acceptable if you pray like this with your lips sealed your prayer is invalid you have to move your lips and preferably your tongue of course as if you are reciting it but without a voice but if you do not do this your prayer is invalid and if you recite the quran with your lips uh sealed and you read it with your eyes scanned with your eyes this is not rewarded as the one who recites the quran by moving his lips whether silently or loudly we have shameem from saudi i have a question i have asked a lot of people but i don't get a answer okay now during ramadan the isn't it yes then why is it that the bad things and the sins still continue besides that the shaykh and this bracelet type for the newborn in the practice of some occasion or putting him in the cradle so is it possible is it okay to put something instead of gold some silver item from nigeria from nigeria what can i do for you i have i just want a comment uh regarding the the commencement of the month of ramadan i hope that this year in nigeria we started the first a day before saudi arabia so i want a general comment as to the citation of demand and the differences between countries because the time difference between nigeria and saudi is just two hours okay i will do that inshallah all right thank you all right we have uh abu aburduan from india your program is

masjid and praying praying uh praying there so how can she pray a salah okay okay and third question is please tell us any authentic uh fund raising people because there are many people they want to give their regard to the authentic people who can give the the people to syria like iraq like like many other countries like africa somalia so we need some authentic uh organization please if you have any any information please please know yes okay i need my mom and my sister and salah at home for taraweeh okay and um can we can i read from the mushaf while leaving them in salah okay i will answer your question inshallah okay and number eight from saudi i'm sorry of course from saudi yeah yes what can i do for you i want to ask you a question yes hello yes sir yeah yeah sheikh i have a question actually i have heard your conversation previously it was mentioned over there that if i have a say i if there is something for example if i oh if i borrow some 100 000 real for example from someone then it is fixed that after one year he is asking me to pay me hundred thousand plus five thousand or after two years he's telling me to okay you pay me hundred thousand plus ten thousand like that in whatever form i weigh is it allowed like that if it is fixed like this okay i have to pay five thousand extra if i pay it within one year or 10th of the next night if i paid within two years or 15 000 within three years i mean is it allowed or not i would like your answer okay i will answer inshaallah thank you very much you're welcome uh yusuf from nigeria yusuf from nigeria mute your television and listen to me from the phone please okay i'm coming from madeira please yes what can i do for you okay regarding the sighting of months okay so here in nigeria we started our passing a day before so good exam okay so what is the i mean the rules or the implications of it okay i will answer the question inshallah okay thank you very much we have abu adnan from saudi arabia to you as well yeah i have two questions here yes one question is that uh while i uh first in the morning they give adam so i should if i'm eating i should stop immediately i can complete my to complete the fasting in the morning the food i want to take okay the second discussion is that paying zakah if i have gold of 100 grams should i say the difference above 80 grams or i have to pay the complete 100 grams of okay i will answer the question we have uthman from jordan us man from jordan i have a question yes uh it's regarding money and booking for someone some money and you are about to go for hajj you you take that more priority for you it allows for you to go with the intention of paying back this money after your return so you're using the money to go for hajj or this is a separate loan actually the money i don't have it i i have it but i want to use it for for the hajj instead then after i pay my the money i'm going okay i will answer the question shall we uh we will take the last question insha allah and we will stop taking um calls sally from gambia yes okay i have a question one question to ask yes if if a woman has a dream like girl jewelry did she have to pay zakah okay uh callers please hold your horses for like 10 minutes seven minutes inshallah and i'll try to answer the questions at hand muhammad from saudi arabia he said he took a loan from a rashi bank and they are taking commission from him so is this allowed he says that he already has the money in his pocket you should have asked before getting this money but as a rule of thumb the islamic banks in saudi arabia such as al jazeera etc they do not give loans because a loan is money where you get it back with interest and this is totally prohibited and this is similar to the question of abu buruj from saudi arabia any money given to you in cash and you have to pay interest for that this is totally prohibited this is usually this is interest this is ribba and it is a major sin it is a a number 70 plus branches of riba the least is like one having intercourse with his mother incest so it is a major sense however these islamic banks don't give you loans they sell you commodities so they sell you iron they sell you air conditioners they sell your rice they sell you a plot of land so they sell you stocks and once you buy it and the transaction is done you buy it for an x amount of money to be paid in installments you take the commodity and you sell it elsewhere and definitely this is not their problem so they are charging you interest on selling you this commodity not on the money they're lending you because they cannot lend you money you have to take the merchandise and sell it elsewhere so i hope this answers your question his second question was uh the ruling on taking uh a gift as food from a non-muslim as you are in saudi arabia then all the meat is slaughtered islamically insha allah so if this non-muslim sends you food and preferably she's a christian or a jew of course you don't have jews not supposed to have jews but you never know this is permissible for you to accept this gift there's no problem in accepting such a gift insha allah if it's a non-muslim and then people of the book and if it's a hindu or if it's a buddhist or something and they give you meat and you doubt that this meat was not slaughtered they did not buy it maybe they slaughtered it himself or killed it himself maybe it's a dog meat and you're doubtful you may not accept this and feed it to the dogs or to the an animal shaming from saudi arabia says that he has a question he'd ask so many people and no one happened to answer him he says that we know that the hadith of the prophet allah whenever ramadan begins the gates of the heaven are opened the gates of hell are closed and the masters of the jinn are chained and locked up the hadith clearly indicates that the masters of the jinn the leaders of the jinn are the ones who are locked up not the small young young ones and the soldiers and and so on so these people are on the loose they're doing their job efficiently apparently but not as good as they used to before ramadan that is why in the hadith the prophet says assam and hence they would not reach their as they used to before ramadan second of all even if all the jinn were locked up we have our inner evil in us and that is why uh the prophet used to seek refuge from the jinn and from ourselves from the evils of our own souls so we have ourself evil as well so i hope this answers your question uh allah from saudi arabia says that we know that wearing gold for males in islam is prohibited we have a custom that we put a bracelet to the child newborn when we put him in the cradle as a form of celebration this is totally prohibited even if it was a child and even if the child is not held accountable you cannot give a cigarette to a three-year-old child to smoke it and say he's not accountable it's okay or give a champagne a glass of champagne to a nine-year-old because he's not accountable no this is totally prohibited putting silver to the boy is permissible but a bracelet is not permissible and this is one of the weirdest customs around bracelets are only for women nowadays you find men unfortunately wearing bracelets wearing necklaces and they think that this is a macho stuff i saw one of the men so-called daris you know hip uh uh diary he's not a dad he's not a scholar or a student of knowledge but he has good programs and he was wearing a bracelet a black leather bracelet in his hand this is totally prohibited it's imitating the gofar or imitating women you pick your pick and both are cursed by the prophet israel uthman from nigeria says like the question of our friend yusuf they all say that um ramadan was cited a day before saudi arabia which is saturday and we started fasting on sunday so what's the ruling on that the ruling is okay each region has their own sighting if we had one caliph for the whole entire muslim ummah not any tom dickhary going in in the in the caves of torabora or in iraq or in boko haram nigeria or in shabbat somalia saying i'm the khalifa i'm the caliph no the proper khalifa who has a proper country to rule and he has followers and he has people to give him pledge of allegiance and the muslims accept him not only a handful of of people out of intimidation except him so if this khalifa existed then we can spread the sighting for all the countries that he rules and this is what's happening nowaday and in a country where you have one ruler one president one king one prince whatever he rules his country his region and one sighting in one of this his region would suffice and so does it in nigeria about one from india says that a housewife how does she pay the car if she has cash she takes 2.5 if the cash reaches the 595 grams of silver which is a threshold which is the nissan if she doesn't have uh 595 grams of silver she has below that then there's no zakat if she has more she has to pay the cat for that from her cash if she doesn't have cash and she has gold for example the gold has to be 85 grams of pure 24 carat gold so if she has more than that then she has to pay the cut if she doesn't have cash she is obliged to sell some or she would be kind and cuddly to her husband trying to convince him to pay it for her as a gift and he says that second question in india and elsewhere they don't have a special place for women to pray in the masjid they don't have to in islam we don't have to designate a place for women to pray they pray at the end of the masjid wearing the proper hijab and being concealed and he's saying so how can a woman pray read prayer well actually eight prayers are not prayed are not to be prayed in the masjid eight prayers are to be prayed in an open area outside of the city at least outside of the building uh buildings and and inhabited places so um but if there were only messages to be prayed in and she were not was not allowed to uh go in she can pray outside of the masjid insha allah thirdly uh aburd one is asking are there any trustworthy organizations that we can give our zakat to so that they can deliver to syria and and refugees and muslims who are in need that the answer is yes there are but you have to look for them so there is lots of organizations trustworthy in kuwait in qatar you have al-munta del islami in uk and a lot of them they are advertising and you just have to go and give it to them insha allah aisha from i think the emirates she says she leads prayer she leads her mother and sister can she use the mush have to recite the quran and lead them into answer is yes there's no problem a man from saudi arabia says that what's ruling on eating while the advent is being given as stated before if you know that the adhan is called on time you should refrain eating uh immediately but if you know that the ima the imagine gives like two or three minutes just to be safe before the time the original time you can finish uh your food or at least what's in your mouth um he says that if someone has a hundred grams of gold we know that the threshold that anislab is 85 grams does he pay the zakat on the 15 grams which is more than 85 or on the total which is the whole hundred the answer is he pays for the whole which is the hundred grams and if he has a thousand he pays for the thousand not deducting the 85 grams from that utman from jordan he says that a person has debts on him and he has money to pay off the debt but he wants to go for hajj the answer is no he shouldn't because allah azzawajal only obliged hajj upon those who are capable and to borrow to go to hajj is not permissible because you are doing something that is highly not recommended and allah azza did not oblige it upon you and not to pay your debts on time is also not recommended and not permissible because allah azza would forgive the martyr all of his sins except for the debt so if you have a debt allah would not forgive it for you therefore you should not take something uh as such and elijah knows best we have time i think for a couple of callers so if you can take few uh callers um insha'allah sally from gambia says that the gold that a woman has does she have to pay the cat for that it's an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion is that she must pay as a cat for the gold or silver that she possesses whether this gold is worn or it is stored she has to give zakat for it and this is the most authentic opinion we have zahra from nigeria from what reciting the holy quran for your parents okay and secondly what is recommended for a person yes i have property for rental and uh the person who's renting is working for a uh you know kind of rebar is that permissible or not that's the only question i have thank you so much you're welcome okay uh zahara from uh well we have muhammad from saudi arabia and this is the last caller inshallah the question is that i heard that till the white and the black red is visible that you can have the sukhur even after the iran is said okay okay okay what's your question the question is that the habits of rasulallah says that the black and the white threat is visible till the suhur can be done okay i will answer the question from nigeria says that what's the ruling on reciting the quran for the deceased the answer is that this is not permissible because so many people died at the time of the prophet including his daughters including his uncle including his loved ones his companions and never ever he requested any one of his companions to recite the quran for them so this means that if he did not do it and if he did not recommend it this means that it's an innovation as for what would be most appropriate for us to do for our loved ones during the month of ramadan you can supplicate and invoke allah for them so before fajr raise your hands praise allah azzawajal offer salutation to the prophet and say oh allah forgive my father or allah expand his grave and make it one of the gardens of paradise fill it with fruit and everything that enlightens him and makes him a please and so on you can also do umrah if you are within the vicinity for him on his behalf you can uh also give charity and this is uh uh possible anywhere so if you have access of money and you just give it to the poor to the needy to those who cannot pay their medical bills or electricity bills and they are really poor or needy and you intended for your loved one or deceased this would reach them insha allah azza abdul qari from abu dhabi he says that he has property uh for rent and the tenant works in a bank or in a uh interest into institution interest-based institution so what's the ruling for you it's halal because he is uh paying you rent you're not leasing it to a bank you're listing it to this person and his income is haram for him it is halal for you with family around a nice meal we're making duan i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
