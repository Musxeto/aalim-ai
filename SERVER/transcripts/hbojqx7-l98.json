  "title": "Can a woman reveal her face, hands & hair when a potential spouse comes to see her? - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that by the grace of Allah a proposal from a practicing brother came for me alhamdulillah I am a practicing Muslim I want to know how much can I reveal in front of the brother hand and face only or he can see me in normal decent dress without makeup first of all may allah azza wajal choose the best for your sister and may Allah choose the best suitor to be your loving and caring husband now in Islam the marriage process is different than in other countries and religions in the sense that we do not have the concept of dating there are no prima premarital relationships like it is prevailing in non-muslim countries and unfortunately in some Muslim countries as well in Islam it's a very easy process a man proposes to the guardian of a girl they check upon him they look at his surroundings they ask and investigate if he turns to be okay the father who's the guardian of the girl sets a date where there would be an initial interview where the boy would come and meet the girl in the presence of the guardian the father and they sit for an hour or so looking at one another talking to chanting so that they can sense and feel whether there is chemistry or not and after this meeting the boy gives his approval and expresses his wish to continue if the girl is fine with that they give him a positive answer they make the engagement the marriage contract and the marriage takes place now this initial interview or meeting it is recommended by the prophet alayhi salatu salam so that a man would not be deceived after marriage and says well I didn't know that she was this ugly or that she was this short or that she was this in that and likewise the girl would not complain and object and saying that I didn't see him so I didn't think that he was this repelling the Prophet Elisha lacerum met one of his companions who came and said o prophet of Allah I proposed to a girl from the ants are so the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wasalam said to him did you look at her sometimes we propose because we know the father we know the family the reputation is as solid as gold but we don't know about the girl herself so the man said no I did not look at her so the Prophet said alehissalaam go back and look at her because the Unser's eyes have something in them meaning that the way they look might not appeal to you not only that might make you feel that you don't want to look at her so the Prophet ordered him Ali saw a twosome and in the hadith of Jabbar renard Allah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam ordered us that whatever you want to marry a woman if you can look at her so that it would attract you to marry her from these hadith and others the vast majority of schools of thought say that a man is permitted once he's proposing to a girl to look at her face and her hands and this shows you that niqab and the face veil is mandatory because if I can see the girl on the street or in the market or whenever she goes out of her home and I can look at her face and hands why would I have an interview with her I've already fulfilled what I wanted by looking at her face and I know how she looks yet this is a different issue that we will not go into the humbly school of thought said that no we can go a bit further he can look at her neck her head her arms and her legs meaning that if I were to be certain that this particular proposal is serious and he is worthwhile pursuing when he comes to meet my daughter I would ask my daughter to wear a normal decent dress where she can reveal her arm her hair is uncovered no makeup none whatsoever zero makeup zero eyeliners nothing and she would come to him in this fashion we know that one of the most things that attracts a suitor to his future wife is her hair so if she uncovered her hair and he sees what he likes then this would be a plus in sha allah azza wajal and Allah knows best"
