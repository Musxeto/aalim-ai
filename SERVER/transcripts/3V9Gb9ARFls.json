  "title": "How to distribute your wealth when alive? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "some people want to distribute their inheritance where they're alive to avoid any um conflict is this Halal yes and some so no it's an issue of dispute among Scholars alhamdulillah y we can choose whatever we want it is not in inheritance if you're alive how can you distribute it and this is why Scholars say you can divide your wealth but when you divide it while alive it has to be a true division not on paper because if a person says after I die I give this property to my son and and this property to my daughter once he dies tear it apart and throw it in the dust bin why this is a will this is not a gift what about if I say I give my son a 100,000 but I did not transfer it to his bank account it's not a gift once I die it's cancelled a gift must be possessed if I promise to give you something and I don't give it to you it's not binding it's cancelled so if I want to distribute my wealth in my life I have to bring it I go to my children and I give them in their hands or in their bank accounts in their name and I transfer it do I have to give my wife no this is not inheritance so if I have a million dollars I can distribute it among my children and leave my wife out of it would I be doing Haram no I'm not doing it intentionally to harm her she's still living with me we still have a property or we uh I'm still alive"
