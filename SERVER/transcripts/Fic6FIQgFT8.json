  "title": "Is it permissible to donate our organs after death for scientific research? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for his question uh is it permissible for me to write in my will that i want to donate my organs so that scientists would study it and maybe find out a cure this is an issue of dispute some scholars say that this is permissible i'm inclined to say that this is totally prohibited the body is not mine or yours it's allah and it is disgraceful for muslims to abuse or to autopsy or to open or even break the bone of a deceased muslim it's totally haram in islam so i believe that this is not permissible if they were to find cure through other means or doing such experiments on non-muslims bodies they can be my guest but muslims no they cannot work on their bodies after their death because their bodies are sacred must be taken care of must be buried honorably"
