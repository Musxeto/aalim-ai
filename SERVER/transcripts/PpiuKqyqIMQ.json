  "transcript": "Salwa says I'm expecting and the doctor inserts a probe for internal sonography so does social or woudl become mandatory after that Russell is not mandatory unless one of two takes place and I'm talking about the living about normal people because if a person dies also it becomes mandatory but this is not our point of discussion a normal person does not have to perform Russell unless there is sexual intercourse that involves penetration for both male or female whether there is ejaculation or not the issue of penetration mandates and obligates Russell to take place afterwards the second reason for Russell is ejaculation and this is when semen is ejaculated in a gushing gushing fashion accompanied by a feeling of sensation some call it orgasm the only exception is when ejaculation takes place when the person is sleeping and this is known as nocturnal emission other than that there is no need for Russell so Sarah there is no need for Russell for such an act nor for voodoo as well unless you discharge something from your private part in this case then you have to do that"
