  "title": "Aqeeqah: Can we sacrifice a Cow for the Aqeeqah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question of tonight is from a wish she says can we sacrifice a cow for our tea first of all some of the brothers and sisters may not know the meaning of a paper what is a Tia Tia is a sheep that is slaughtered as a sacrifice to Allah Almighty for thanking him for blessing us with a child and you born the Sunnah is once a person is blessed with a child he is to slaughter on the seventh day of the child's birth one sheep if it's a female girl or two sheep if it is a male boy and this is a sacrifice it's a highly recommended Sunnah that the Prophet did alehissalaam for his grand sons so this is a well based a well established Sunnah part of the way of the Prophet I saw it with cinnamon what to do with the meat scholars say that you are sacrificing it for the sake of Allah which means that the shedding of the blood is very bad a form of worship and this is sufficient whether you consume the whole thing whether you feed some of the poor and consumed the rest whether you divide it into three parts one as a gift to your loved one one as a charity a sadhaka and the third is to consume by yourself and your family and ham to let you can choose and pick whatever you wish now man which question is about sacrificing not a sheep but rather a cow so what is the ruling on doing such a thing scholars differed and the Hanafi and Shafi school of thought say that this is okay based on the allegation that in Islam it is permissible to sacrifice during Hajj if you're a pilgrim or if you're a resident but you want to offer over here which is a sacrifice to be offered in the season of Hajj and any expiation one has to give an offer for an error he had done in his haram during hajj or umrah the Prophet told the Sally salat-u-salam that such a sacrifice is usually done by one sheep yet it is permissible for seven people to share in a camel or in a cow which means that one one cow or one camel is equivalent to seven sheep but the Hanafi and Schaffer school of thought say that this can be cascaded to Atia as well and to any sacrifice one would like to offer other scholars and other schools of thought said this is not applicable because what the Prophet Adam had offered himself as a PIPA were always sheep and he did not tell us that it is better and more rewarding to offer a cow or a camel when it comes to a pika he limited that only to Hajj and Umrah now what would argue and say that logically it sounds ok a cow is bigger than a sheep and more expensive so long as it is applicable in Hajj and Umrah I see no reason not to have it applicable in a taper again we do not apply our logic when it comes to following the Sunnah simply because if someone says I have a horse that is a hundred thousand euros worth and I'd like to sacrifice it for the sake of Allah we tell him your sacrifice is not accepted this is why we said because we have only three types of animals that we can sacrifice camels cows and sheep and of course goats go under the category of sheep etc therefore it is not logic that should be applied and this is why it is safer it is definitely best for you to sacrifice a sheep if you were blessed with a baby girl rather than a sacrificing a whole cow if you are blessed by a baby girl let alone to share with other six in the cow so even if you slaughter a cow on behalf of your newborn girl this is not as good and rewarding and sacrificing a ship simply not because of the quantity of the meat but rather because this is what the Prophet s Salaam had done and performed one asks okay then I did it in the past I have already sacrificed cows or or camels on behalf of my children should I do it again the answer is Sharla no because it's an issue of dispute you've acted upon the knowledge you had at the time that it was permissible to reputable schools of thought adopted it so insha'Allah you were not in the wrong but from now on if the line of production is still ongoing once you want to give a pika I advise you to follow the Sunnah and to do that with sheep"
