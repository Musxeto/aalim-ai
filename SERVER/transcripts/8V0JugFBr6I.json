  "title": "Can you attend the funeral (Janaza) of a Shia? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that uh a woman is asking about her she a friend who died and they are requesting her to come to read the janazah prayer so is this valid in their masjid we have to look if this woman it was from the division of shia that are not considered to be muslims because there are shia are levels so are the sufis their levels so are those who say they are sunnah but they may not be uh sunnah per se as in following the correct akida but rather they're than so nowadays those who are not shia they call themselves sunnis but they may be even worse than those who are shia so first of all we have to look into this sister's religion if she was a shia who cursed the companions of the prophet allah who slandered mother aisha so she was in this case you are not allowed to go to their masjid and you're not allowed to seek forgiveness for her because she's not a muslim those who curse the wife of the prophet sallam and give kuttak fear and the curses and and and say bad things about all the companions of the prophet except a handful abu bakr um everyone they say bad things about them these are not muslims anymore as for the prayer format whether it's a sunni or other than the sunnis if they offer five or six takbir for the uh salatul janazah this is acceptable because it there are narrations not limiting it only to four but the most authentic is that it is four tech beers what to say you can simply add a for the deceased so the first tech beer you read the fatiha afterwards the second tech beer you offer salutation to the prophet sallam the third takbir you offer dua for the deceased the fourth tech beer you have a short pause and you say assalamualaikum once to the right as for uh requesting her to come the following day for reciting the quran this is an innovation and a congregation on biddah this is not permissible for you to attend"
