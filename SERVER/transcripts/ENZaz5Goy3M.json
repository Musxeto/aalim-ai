  "title": "He gave me an evil eye, can I ask Allah for revenge on that person? Evil eye vs Envy assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sh a few months back I noticed that uh I'm not being able to work well like uh I was not being able to do anything. I was getting tired and I was getting sick too often, depression and all the stuff. So I came to a conclusion that there is something wrong with me and it might be evil eye, envy, black magic and the likes. So I told you about my condition and you said that it's an evil eye. I did and alhamdulillah I feel much better than before. Now my question is um can I make dua to Allah by saying ya Allah whatever happened with me it's the result of someone's uh ill intention or someone trying to harm me by doing uh by envy black magic and the likes. So uh then avenge that person and teach him or them a great lesson. No problem in doing that but to forgive and move on is better for you. It's higher for your reward. And I don't know if I said this here or I made a or somewhere I'm getting too old to remember. There is a difference between envy which is which is a generic word and evil eye which is envy or is usually done with the intent to harm people. I see a beautiful card that you have. I envy you. You don't deserve it. I wish you lose it. I wish you smash it and have an accident. This is ill intent. And it's not necessarily that I say this in front of you or to see it. Maybe I can be in another a different country and know about it and still have envy towards you. And this is a major sin. Evil eye is not necessarily done with ill intent. In most cases, it's done accidentally without an ill intent. However, it is an impact of a person's personality through what he sees that it impacts what he looks at. So, a father could give an evil eye to his own son playing around. Look at him. He's like a genie. Look how he moves. Whoa, he's so strong. And boom, the son is sick. It's your evil eye. You did not say Allah. I didn't have an ill intent to my son, but it happens. So what you're suffering from most likely is an evil eye that took place without a person's intending it. As long as alhamdulillah the grace of Allah alone cured you keep on doing the and in couple of weeks time you'll be all clear and the man or the woman who gave it to you will inshallah move on and hopefully that he would not do it again."
