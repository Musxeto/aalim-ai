  "title": "Removing Muhammad from the name of a deceased person ! What about multiple names? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Uh shake in Bangladesh it's common to remove Muhammad from a deceased person's name. For example, if someone was named Muhammad Ali or Muhammad Firo Ahmed after death people refer to them or write down their name as late Ali or late Firo Ahmed. They claim that Muhammad is only valid for the living human being. So she is this practice justified or is it baseless? This is this is totally baseless and an innovation and it is part of most likely the the false and uh deviant belief of those cults and sects that believe that prophet Muhammad wasam is alive controlling the universe knowing the unseen and his hazer nazer as they say and this is of course bogus. It is wrong to give a person two or three names. So someone saysalamlaykum said Alam what's your name? He said Muhammad Ali said this is your name and your father's name and your family name said no no no I am Muhammad Ali. Whoa. And what is your father? He says is Abdahbdman Abdah by the end of the day it will be fudger before we conclude your name who are these people it's three in one it's even worse than the the the you know what your name is either Muhammad or Ali or Tar no the whole three names are mine this is ridiculous it's not known by the Arabs and it's only mostly found in the uh subcontinent in some of the countries that think adding Muhammad to the name gives it baraka. So what's your name? Muhammad Assam. What's his name? Muhammad Ali. And some of them put Ali with the name more baraka than Muhammad. And all of this is bogus."
