  "title": "If I delay washing my feet till the end of my ghusl, is my wudu valid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says if i perform rusul according to the sunnah so i'm following the steps of the sunnah which as you all know it includes wudu so if i do this and i perform a full wudo with the exception of delaying my washing of the feet till the end of the russel would my woodlaw be valid the answer is the gap is negligible so washing the rest of your body would not take more than a minute or half a minute and the whole area is wet and the whole body is wet so it's negligible and inshallah is valid but to be on the safe side make a full wadu with washing defeat to be safe"
