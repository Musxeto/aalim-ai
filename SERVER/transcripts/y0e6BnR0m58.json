  "transcript": "I'm at second question how can one make up for missed prayers it's an issue of dispute and I know that you guys have the concept of what is known as Casa Prayer which is making up a prayer now as Muslims we base our religion on Quran and Sunnah agree agree the Prophet said that in his salat WA Salam whoever oversleeps a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it now the Prophet commented and said there is no expiation other than that the Prophet gave us alehissalaam Salam - excuses one forgetfulness - over sleeping and we know that Allah does not burden us all beyond its capability if someone over sleeps a prayer he's not accountable because the pen has been lifted and if someone forgets a prayer Allah says in the Quran rabbun allah - allah in a sinner our partner do not burden us if we forget or her so why would the Prophet say are in salat WA Salam he must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no expiration other than that the answer is because once a person neglects prayer until the time runs out willingly then he had committed the major sin and he cannot make that up why share why can't we make up a prayer because Allah prescribed prayers at particular times in no salata can a trial mock me Nina buta verily that prayers had been prescribed upon the believers at specific times so assume someone comes from the UK for Hajj we know that the day of Arafah is on the ninth of the Haeju this brother comes a day before on the 8th wearing his farm everything is fixed he comes to the airport and they detain him for three days because there was a problem in his visa and after sorting it out to the embassy and with the agency on the 12th of the ledger they set him free so the man goes directly to alpha of course is not a single human being in Anitha and he stays there for the whole day which is the 12th of the hedger and someone says to him he what are you doing he says I am making up my hatch I was detained and was prevented from making my hatch so now so now I'm making it up what's the ruling on that the answer is this is totally out of the question why is that because allah azzawajal prescribed it to be performed on the ninth of the hedger failing to do so means that your Hajj was not done at the correct time at the correct date and hence you cannot make it up likewise the five daily prayers were prescribed at a particular specified time if you neglect doing it within the parameters of this prayer intentionally without a legitimate reason until the time runs out there it is gone and you cannot at all do that or offer that analyze Oh she'll knows best"
