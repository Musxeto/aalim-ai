  "transcript": "my question is if a person is interested in learning um islamic politics and economy like how the islamic state should be started who the muslim ruler is how we should be connected and have to punish and so much more according to sunnah and he wants to know this person wants to learn more about them so which are the best book that talks about the stick of politics and stick of economy that you would recommend if such in buddhism okay first of all this is a little bit way above my pay grade because this requires someone who's specialized in these things i have zero knowledge in politics and not that much adequate knowledge in economy i have general idea about islamic rulings and teachings so there are classical books in the politics and how to govern people and how to rule people these are classical books i did not go through them so i cannot recommend any of them but they're found there and available and it requires you to read the arabic versions probably you'll find some translated i don't know how good the translations are but it will benefit you a lot if you're doing this in your studies also the uh this is something that a lot of the scholars have praised in having some or a lot of good ideas related to islamic history as for economics you must do the classical to study the economics from the quran the sunnah perspective according to the favorite three generations nowadays islamic economy unfortunately is based on picking and choosing a lot of these sharia boards members or people who work in there are professionals instead of trying to find what is the best according to the quran the sunnah they collect all what has been said throughout history in the books of regardless if it is baseless or based on something it's just there in one of the hanafi books it was just there in one of the the maliki books it's a coat they just grab it and they put it in cards and they uh flash cards and they start to look into today's current economical systems how they trade credit cards transactions hedging [Music] betting margins etc everything loans and and the likes bonds they look all at these things and they look at their flash cards trying to see something that may coincide and fit so they say oops okay we found this in a chapter ebook who said this xyz what's the reference to it i don't know it's a chaffee uh uh school of thought so because it's in one of the books of so this opinion is there we can follow that okay what does the quran and sunnah say regardless we have something to follow unfortunately this is how the vast majority the vast not all of them this is how they work and this is how they get their bonuses and this is how they're getting paid a lot because they are twisting not breaking the laws they're bending the rules a little bit and we have a quote from xyz scholar who said this and this scholar is maybe six or seven generations after abu hanifah or after imam malik but it's there in the books so unfortunately this is on islamic you have to go to the islamic references study the quran and tafsir study the authentic hadith and what the scholars have said about the hadith and their understanding of it with the understanding of the three favorite generations then you will formulate your own knowledge about the science once you explore islamic economy or other economies you can relate to that and allah knows best you"
