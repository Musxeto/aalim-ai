  "transcript": "uh jian from belgium what are the best things to do uh in the last 10 nights akhi the sky is the limit and the prophet did not tell us allah to specifically do one thing however we know that the vast majority of his time was spent in night prayer so standing in prayer for the hajjud reciting the quran while in tahajud making long vikar while in ruku and sujud making lots of dua in your sujud and before offering salam all of these are part of the highly recommended things to do in the last 10 nights of ramadan however scholars usually answer this question by saying wherever you find your heart then you should do it so sometimes i may pray two hours and then get a little bit tired or bored and this is logical people do get bored we're not angels who pray without end so when you get bored you can sit down open the quran and recite 3 4 when you get bored you can engage in dua when you get bored you can listen to a lecture or read something from the seerah or ask allah for forgiveness and then you stand up for prayer again and do that in insha allah you'll be on the winning side"
