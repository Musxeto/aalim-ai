  "transcript": "um okay so I am a computer science student so I program a lot and I have a software that helps me like program sometimes whenever I get stuck it will like help me assist in writing my program so um so sometimes when I'm programming the AI will sometimes just finish the code for me and I'm so shocked because sometimes these are just in my thoughts I'm like whoa how did it know and then I get with swest that like oh you committed sh and all this but it takes me time to realize that you know the AI has so much knowledge from the internet like a bunch of data as well as it takes the data from what you typed and it tries to formalize like a final answer and my my issue is is I I don't want to keep thinking that I committed sh and then fall into this SWAT trap that I had years ago so what what do you think I should do in this case this is totally absurd you're a computer scientist uh student you should know of all people that this is not rocket science it's only matter of algorithms and predictions based on previous people's work and this is like Auto dictation or correction so if I write two letters and the computer or the smartphone finishes the whole word this is there's no shik in it oh it knows the future so I start rubbing it and saying okay maybe I'll it'll grant me three wishes there's nothing like that you should of all people know better that this is science there's no shik in it there's no uh um prediction of knowing the Unseen or and the likes so just word it off and move on"
