  "transcript": "[Music] ald I do apologize for the voice but your weather has its impact on us people coming from the desert so inshallah bear with me and I'll try to make it as soft as possible [Music] Islam places a great role on time because time is the essence of Our Lives it is something that unlike most of us think the countdown starts the minute we are born it's not like how old you are I'm 20 and 10 days years later I am 30 and it goes up it's the other way around how many days left in your life and Islam places a great deal on time as we can see this clearly in the Quran and in the Sunnah Our Lives unlike other religions unlike other people our lives are based on time from the very beginning the first thing you do when you wake up in the day is to pray F and you don't begin your day and that is it every time you're conscious of time so when is the second prayer when is the third the fourth and finally this is the last prayer of the day and you are quite aware of this it is something in your conscience that tells you time is important I have to know when time it is for prayer and you conclude your day or night if uh to say by witer night prayer so throughout the whole day there are times that are essential that is why Allah mentioned it in the Quran by [Music] saying which means that prayer has been obligated upon Believers on specific times what does that mean a lot of the Muslims don't know this but what was the last prayer we prayed some of us did not pray is that true possible why they'll pray it when they go back to their campus to their to their homes they pray it after M after the lecture after the match probably a lot of the Muslims did not pray maybe since they're anticipating the match the prophet says whoever sleeps over a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation there is no kaf for that except doing this which means that I did not forget and I did not sleep but I deliberately postponed the prayer until the time was over over until the following prayer was due so can I pray it after afterwards the answer is no you can't can't pray wouldn't be it be acceptable to make it up no you can't even if you do it's not going to be accepted from you what is this it's first time I hear such a thing well there's always the first the Hadith is Crystal Clear whoever sleeps or forgets must pray it as soon as he remers there is no experation I didn't do a sin to expiate it but the prophet is telling us that the importance of the prayer only if you sleep or forget that you can make it up otherwise you cannot make it up when do people stand in mounta and Haj what date hello what day do we go TOA in of hij so if someone books his flight he gets delayed for a couple of days then he makes it then he is held in customs for a couple of days on the 13th 13th of the he goes to on his own and he spends a day there mallah making VI reading the Quran is it his Hajj accepted why because it was not on time therefore time is very essential and a lot of the Muslims skip prayers like crazy don't make up for these prayers Allah will not accept it from you I know a lot of the Muslims where I come from from Saudi when they pray on time but when they travel to London for example they make which is is permissible they pray at the same time two at the same time is shortened to how much it does not change three and two and after 3 4 days being in London no mosques nobody's watching they tend to put to delay the whole five five prayers just before they go to bed so you just see them doing this alhamdulillah it's done 17 it's done alhamdulillah and after two three more days there's no prayer at all until they go back home make oh Allah forgive us and they go back to the routine they had been these people's prayer is not accepted because they deliberately postpone it until the end of the day and this is Haram not only throughout the day and night that time is essential and important we also have that through the week There's a precious and sacred day every week that we honor that is the day of of jum it is the weekly Festival the weekly Eid if you wish where Allah has granted us so many things on this great day that lots of the Muslims don't even know anything about it is only just to bring to your attention that on the day of of of of J of Friday there's a a period of time an hour in Arabic hour is not 60 minutes it's a period of time there's a moment in jum the prophet tells us that whoever coincides with that moment in prayer in supplicating In invoking invoking Allah Allah would answer his invocation God I have a very big problem with Calculus 301 it is bad what should I do I maybe I said should write short notes and put them in my pocket nobody knows no people here are so trustworthy I write it on my forearm and I have do this and maybe put it MP3 uh um headset I can communicate with others no and on Friday after you studied well and you did all what you can at the last hour of the day like half an hour before M just sit in the Masjid raise your hands praise Allah on the prophet offer him salutation and then ask Allah invoke Allah you will pass with the grace of Allah but don't do this without studying don't say okay I like this hour why should I study I just go there and invoke Allah no this is not this is insane he said I have I have Reliance on Allah you have true on Allah said yes I believe in Allah go to highriser and jump no this is insane sh no no you have strong you have to have with taking and achieving the necessary means but to sit home without any food and without going to cook and say oh Allah make me full you have to eat so no no I trust Allah Allah if he wishes he'll make me full you will be on a very severe diet um throughout the year we have seasons we have Ramadan after Ramadan we have Hajj after Hajj we have we have the fasting of we have fasting uh three days uh every month the white days we have Mondays and Thursdays so time is quite of essence and importance in our Islam and that is why Allah swore by time so Allah swore by what does mean time it's also the name of the period that is the afternoon Allah swore of Al Allah swore of and night and day f is uh uh Dawn which is the morning time that comes after fer time and all of this is to underline the importance of time so Allah swears with whatever he wishes only to show us the importance of these things the importance of his creatures now can we swear with anything other than Allah no we can only swear by Allah and his beautiful attributes Allah's Mercy Allah's uh uh Power Allah's honor we can do this Allah's words we can do this but we can't swear with um prophets and Messengers we can't swear with by the prophet Alam by saying by the Prophet this is right our friends from Egypt say this a lot they say what how do this where withi and our friends in a sham area and Jordan Syria they swear with your head or with the head of your father say the you swear with the things that you think highly of in Islam you can only swear by the by Allah because anything else would be associating others with Allah the almighty now the prophet tells us in the authentic Hadith that was reported by IM in the he says what does that translate to two blessings of Allah which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out good health and free time good health and free time these are blessings from Allah the word used in thei what is the meaning of in Arabic they did not translate it quite well is when you sell something below its original price so my watch costs for example 2,000 if I sell it for1 I would be I I would I would have had a a bad bargon and if you buy something way up or way more than its actual price then you also have a bad bargain the prophet is telling usam people with time and health are in the same fashion how much or how long did the matches of today took take excuse my English how long 6 hours 8 hours and still going maybe yeah okay at the time of yeah at at the side of Allah are you accountable for this time that was lost will Allah reward your good deeds no if you are renting a shop for a whole year and you're paying x amount of money if you spend two months doing nothing no decoration no selling and no buying the the place is empty wouldn't this these two months be considered as loss anyone who's doing it economics maybe would help probably it is definitely so this time is lost time it's from my life and the and the clock is ticking and the countdown had begun long long ago when I was created when I was 4 months old in my mother's womb Allah sends an angel and and the angel says before uh uh breathing the spirit into that uh in he asks oh Allah what is the lifespan is he happy or unhappy meaning would be or will be doomed to hell or to uh heavens and how long how old is he what about the things that he's going to do what are his Provisions so the minute he does this it is the countdown that starts now the prophet is highlighting the importance of time and he says make the most of five things before five others so what should we make uh uh the most of the Prophet said one life before death so make the best of your life before what before dying Health before sickness Health you're healthy now you're in the prom of your youth utilize this because few years down the line when you're as old as I am you're unable to do so many things you were able to do before the prophet saysat free time before becoming busy so if you don't have exams you think you you have exams coming soon but during the past 3 months you had all the ledure time you needed and wanted did you utilize this now can you utilize what you want to do in your time when you have exams no I'm preoccupied I can't attend lectures I can't go and do this and I cannot do that I cannot visit my uncles because I have to do my uh uh prepare for my exams Etc so the prophet is telling us free time before becoming busy youth before old age and those who are in their 60s or in their 70s unable to to pray night prayer as they used to when they were 20 or 30 years old so if someone someone is 70 years old and he tries to pray for a couple of hours it is difficult bones are aching back aches knees are not able to carry him and he's always sleepy even during daytime he's sleepy this is age it's not something that he can do anything about this is life and if eventually he's going to die soon power off end of story end of game Allah is it game over or does he have inshallah a better chance on the second life and the prophet says wealth before poverty now you have money utilize it because there will come a time and this is a cycle of Life Subhan Allah you start young and you get in your Prime and then you get old and end of story likewise Maybe you start medium you get some money you make Mah the best of it buy a new car buy a house and mortgage and then financial crisis and you lose you lose all Subhan Allah the wife divorces you the kids ask you for uh uh money Etc life is difficult but the prophet is showing you the way utilize these things so to utilize your time is something that is logical you don't have to become a Muslim to know this even the non-muslims know this right mallah I go to the uh uh I use the train and I go on in the tube and I see non-muslims holding books and reading M what are they doing they're reading Harry Potter okay at least they're reading they doing something useful with the time for couple of hours some brothers Muslims Mah holding the Quran reciting the Quran the whole mus in every 3 to 5 days because they commute a lot other brothers MP3s what is this this aasi aasi I'm listening to the Quran but he has a nice be Subhan Allah others with the Blackberry couple of hours of their time what are you doing chatting CH but in for the so are they utilizing their time even the non-muslims know the importance of time so they utilize and they try so we as Muslims we should do this because our religion orders us to do this is isn't that so the prophet says in the authentic whatever you hear the prophet's name offer salutation he said that if the day of judgment is being called it's now it's today and you have a small tree in your hand you were about to plant it if it's a day of Jud judgment what would you do crazy it's the day of judgment everything's got the prophet says if you see the day of judgment is being called and you have this small tree in your hand do not put it down until you plant it what does this mean this means that our religion is a positive religion it's a religion that benefits others not only us it's so stated that one khif of the ABI era came and saw an old man in his 70s planting a tree of olive uh tree and this takes approximately 20 to 30 years to harvest so the Khalifa The khif looked at him and said old man do you hope to live this long so that you would be able to harvest this olive tree and the old man looked at him he said oh kif you're a wise and great man I've enjoyed the olives that were planted long before I was born and I plant this Olive Tree so that those who come after me would be able to eat from it and this is the positive way of acting it's not a selfish way if it's me okay if it's not hell with everybody else I care less no a Muslim thinks for the welfare of the other of the community of course above all his own welfare his own reward at the side of Allah what good would it do me if you all go to paradise and I go to hell with all the respect yeah nothing personal but I'd rather go to paradise and then think about you later on so the prophet is encouraging us to plant this tree so that we could utilize our time and we would make the best of it also the prophet says in the authentic Hadith on the day of judgment do not even think that you will not be accountable for the things you you've done the prophet saysat a person will not be let go on the day of judgment on the day of Resurrection until he has been asked about five things in another Hadith four things but they all go in the same line he says he would be asked about his life and how he spent it so be sure the past 20 20 plus years ago Allah will ask you about each and every moment you have spent this life in and how and the prophet say and his knowledge and what he did with it what kind of knowledge physics chemistry math management accounting no the knowledge mentioned in this Quran in this Hadith as the knowledge mentioned in the Quran is the knowledge of Allah you know Allah right you know the Quran right you know the Hadith what did you do I know a lot of the brothers where I come from whenever I come to tell them that this is Haram or the prophet says they say I don't want to hear I don't want to hear why says because on the day of judgment Allah would tell me what did you do with your knowledge so if I listen to you Allah is going to punish me that's that's I never thought of it this way this is stupid with all due respect because Allah will punish you for not asking if you live in a a Muslim country or in a Muslim Community and you say I didn't know that a pint of ler is Haram I always thought that it's okay everybody's doing it I didn't ask but I didn't want to ask so that I would not burden myself Allah will punish you for that so not knowing is good if you have no means to learn but if you deliberately refuse to learn Allah will hold you accountable his knowledge and what he did with it his wealth where from he got it and where did he spend it in so it's not only where do you get your money okay I get my money from Halal means good you have you're clear where did you spend it at at the lotting I only buy two tickets a day if I win aldah jackpot if I lose it's okay with me I have no problem this is Lottery this is gambling this is a major sin Allah Associated it with intoxicant and which is nothing to be taken lightly where did you spend your money I bought a LCD 52 in it's a little bit expensive but it's it's good what do you watch on it uh peace [Music] TV masallah and you have to see Dr Zach Nik in big proportions so that Allah would reward you yeah I see a few things here and there she but Allah would ask you about every penny you spend if it's being spent wisely mashallah you're on the clear if not get ready and the prophet says and his body and how he used it how did you use your body did you use it wisely did you use it in fasting and praying and going for om and helping others in uh permissible activities in working out in staying healthy or you abused it you used to smoke you used to drink you used to fornicate you used to um intimidate people mallah I'm strong and bulky I can you know hit someone with the shoulder legal shoulder and I do this and and I scare people Allah would ask you about this on the day of judgment so we have lots of questions to answer may Allah make it easy Upon Us therefore our time our life is actually measured by days and the countown countdown had started long time ago alass one of the great used to say oh you B Adam the son of Adam you're merely a number of days every day that goes portion of your life is gone so our life is like the calendar paper it's made of like 360 days every time you take one this is one day of my life is gone and I'm I'm I'm losing days Mas may Allah be pleased with him one of the great Companions of the Prophet Alam and the one who used to carry the woo and he used to carry the sandals of the Prophet this guy was amazing he was a shepherd and before long he became the greatest or one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet due to the Quran that he recited he said I took 70 plus suras directly from the mouth of the Prophet Alam and he was also the Amir of Alfa and he was the one who used to teach Hadith and give and one of the prominent Scholars of the companions companions L Scholars he was one of the top uh ones among them he says I despise seeing a man not involved in something that draws him closer to Allah or something that benefits him in this life so what is he doing nothing wasting time if you're not working on your thesis or your papers or studying for University if you're not working for a good job if you're not fixing your car or your house or doing the plumbing if you're not doing something that benefits you in this life and at the same time you're not doing the time you're utilizing is not for getting closer to Allah what what are you doing says I despise such a person 8 hours watching a cricket match this or or a football match people here love football 20 men running after a ball full of air buy another 19 balls and give each one a Bowl come on why fight over it it's it's ridiculous but it's a strange country may Allah protect us all um Allah says in the Quran and this is what all righteous knowledgeable people put in front of them Allah says in [Music] the this is a question which cons is an eyeopener it should be Allah says in the Quran and and this is Allah's words you know is it authentic sh this is Allah's word that was preserved for the past 15 years and it will be preserved until the day of judgment Allah says in the Quran what translates to did you think that we had created you in play without any purpose and that you would not be brought back to us Allah created us just for the heck of it just to have fun eat drink and play and go to Unis and graduate and be unemployed for 6 years do you think this is what Allah created for no W I wish he did it would have been fun I would have enjoyed life I wouldn't have been going from one place to the other giving da Allah says the prophet say I would have had fun and like be like everyone else but this is not the case Allah is testing us this life is a test and not only the universities if I go outside someone bangs my car not my brother's car inah nothing happens to his car but if someone bangs my car this is a test if someone does not bang my car my car is safe this is a test am I thankful am I grateful am I patient am I tolerant do I have have sins I have to expiate from them by calamities that Beall upon me tribulations Etc life is a test marriage is a test having kids is a test obeying your parents is a test having a controlling mother who nags on your back 7 24/7 W this is a test but it is a test that you either fail or or or pass so everything in this life is a test so do you think that Allah has created without any purpose and that we're not going to go back to him well think again how much time you [Music] [Applause] have the our predecessors they used to utilize their time extremely well Abu may Allah be pleased with him he used to Divine the night into three portions one3 to sleep 1/3 to offer night prayer and one3 to study the Hadith of the Prophet to memorize it because he was and he still is on the top of the list in those who narrated Hadith of the Prophet The Prophet prayed for for him that he would never forget the Hadith and so he did not may Allah have mercy on his soul also used to do the same to divide the night because they had to manage their time most of the scholars and the used to utilize their time the one scholar known to have for example the book of The Book of in the book of in the Etc so many books but he used to utilize his time he mentioned in in the book of that I used to utilize the time but there are things in life that you cannot do anything about when your relatives come and visit you to connect the next K you have to invite them when someone wants to uh uh pay a a courtesy visit you have to accept their invitation so what would I do they they talk in nonsense they talk about things of this life I did this I did that I chitchat here and there so he said I thought of it and I understand from the Quran and Sunnah that I have to meet these people I can't live in isolation so I came up with this idea when they come I prepare the wood because they did not have pens they had the wood that they have to sharpen and the ink and they had these papers made they have to fold and prepare into books Etc so whenever they come to talk to me for half an hour I used to sit and utilize my tongue M yes okay establish doing things preparing things that do not require concentration but at the same time utilizing the time Abu altimi his son says that my father used to have me read to him books of knowledge when he's eating when he's drinking even when he goes to answer the call of nature I would stay outside and read so that he would be all the time utilizing they did not have any MP3s no iPads no iPods nothing so he had to do this for him when you look at the life of for example AI may Allah have mercy in his soul he died when he he was in his 40s not married lucky him they calculated they calculated the time of his life and they calculated according to the number of books he had written that he used to write 20 Pages a day not copying he was thinking it over and coming with great books and that's why we have we have in the of we have the book of we have the Muslim the commentary on Muslim all written in this short lifespan they say that IM the author of the author of the author of so many things had or used to write about 30 uh 40 pages a day and he would not miss one minute of his day to the extent that on his dying bed people were visiting him and one of those who visiting him said um may Allah make it easy on you Imam uh the prophet Sall wasallam said so and so and so and so he heard the Dua so it is dying bed he told his assistant go and get me the ink pot and the pen so that I can write this down and those around you said give us a break he's dying why what are you you're dying you're 80 plus years old and you're dying you want to write this thing down he said my friend a true practicing Muslim must not stop from acquiring knowledge who knows maybe this Hadith I'm going to write Allah would save me from hell with it look at the utilization of time they had they were not like us we on the other hand what do we do PlayStation Nintendo these these are the practicing Muslims H I'm not talking about movies I'm not talking about discotics I'm not talking about nightclubs I'm not talking about smoking a joint here or there I'm not talking about you know party time it's Saturday night it's th Friday well Saturday it's Thursday it's Friday Friday night I'm talking about your day-to-day time what do you do if you ask any Muslim what are you doing he say he says or he tells you I'm killing time what's a CRI what did time do so that you would kill it so it's a figure of speed share No you're actually killing your time and this time is the time that Allah would hold you accountable on the day of judgment no one would be let go on the day of judgment until he's asked about his time and that is why you should try to manage your time okay sh I'm going to quit University I'm going to go to the Masid and spend the rest of my time and life in the Masid it's very touching no I did that I don't want you to do this it would be insane because if you do this you would not be a practicing Muslim Subhan Allah so I'm not going to pray in the Masid I'm going to focus on my studies and um until I graduate afterwards I start to pray again you will not be become you will not be a Muslim any Muslim who does not pray he's not a Muslim he's a cafir she I fast I offer ha I make Om I give zakat I'm kind to my parents I'm truthful but I don't pray you're a [Music] c do I get there there was a debate between Dr Abu am Phillips and myself a couple of years ago in Green Lane Masid in Birmingham that is called the great great debate on the ruling on those who abandoned prayer it's nice you can I think download it from YouTube or you can buy it here but the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that whoever abandons prayer who does not pray at all he's a cafir even if his name is Muhammad and his father's name is Abdullah he's still a cafir because the prophet says Muslim that the thing that separates a man from kufur and Sh is prayer so if he abandons prayer he's a cafir and this is added in AB so it's it's a not an easy thing to uh uh uh do so what do you want us to do you want us to pray in the Masid fulltime or you want us to study or you want us to work out in the gym you want us to work in offices and gain money and become rich and then we repent to Allah we want you to become balanced you have to go and learn how to manage your time time management is essential but if you don't know the value of time what am I going to manage so what we spoke about was the value of time so how can I manage my time well this is something you have to do on your own you have to prioritize things always things that come on top are the things that please Allah prayers you never play around with prayers you have to pray on time this is a priority regarding prayers everything else must fit in its proper slot in the day now you know Salman and Pharisee you know him you know Abu D come on don't lie who's first time I hear this guy's name he's one of the companions one of the companions of the Prophet Alam he may Allah have uh uh be pleased with him was known to be the of the companion the wise men because he has so many uh statements that he used to say that were so beautiful that you could always remember them this man at the very beginning of time when the prophet migrated from mecah to Medina when the migrants with M arrived in Medina they were Stone broke they had nothing so what did the prophet doam he made them brothers in the beginning he used to take one from M and he would say to the one from Al he's your brother if one of you dies the other one inherits him as if he was his flesh brother you know so the prophet made ABD and brothers when you know this the story of course everybody's saying yes you you know the story of no no ABD was a merchant from qur but when he came to Medina he did not have anything when the prophet told him that this is your brother he came to him he said ABD rman everyone in Medina knows that I'm the richest in Medina so here's half of what I own this is my wealth 50% is yours he is the richest he could have said listen this is a, quid tried to do something with it he gave him half of his wealth not only that he had two wives he said I have two of the most gorgeous wives in Arabia of excellent lineage and I'm a very jealous person but because you're my brother because you're a Muslim and because the prophet told us to take care of you you look which one you like and I will divorce her and after she becomes Halal you can marry her if I was in his shoes oh yeah now you're talking money and a free mistress W ABD is one of the 10 heavenbound companions the top 10 Companions of the prophet in heaven what did he say may Allah bless your wealth and may Allah bless your family tell me where the Suk is and in a couple of weeks time he got married he got he made money he sold and and bought on credit not discredit credit without any riba and Subhan Allah after a few months time he became the richest man in Arabia this is balance did he skip a prayer F prayer why didn't you pray oh prophet of Allah you know I had a meeting last night was a dinner meeting we had to go to hne we had to go to this place and that there I ski fa no he never skipped one fa he never skipped one battle with the prophet he never skipped one lecture or any place that the prophet did or went to yet he became the richest man in Arabia so this is the balance we're talking about this is not our subject Manish our subject is that Abu D and Salman the prophet made them brothers so Salman went to visit his brother in his house he saw Mrs Abu D her name was um D he was married to two um she died he married another one and nicknamed her so he looked at her and he he saw that she was not taking good care of herself and that was before hijab that at the very early times of Medina so he said what's wrong why aren't you taking good care of yourself she said well your brother Abu D masallah he spends all night praying and all day fasting alhamdulillah meaning he's not going to have enough time to look even at his wife so Sal said okay and he waited until AB came and he served his guest Salman food okay brother this is food so Salman told him you eat first you're the owner of the house I said no I'm fasting he said eat he said no no I'm fasting he said W you will eat I will not eat until you eat so wait it and then said okay I'm going to break it's voluntary fasting what's the heck he broke his fast and he ate they prayed is after Isa AB performed Evolution and what are you doing I'm praying night prayer night prayer it's 8:00 go to sleep no no I want to pray Salman said go to sleep so he slept for an hour and then 9:00 stood up to pray s man was still awake said go to sleep 9 10 11 3 3:30 it's an hour almost to F Sal said now you come you go and pray so the old woke up washed prayed uh night prayer and after they finished Salman addressed Abu D teaching him and the prophet said about Sal Salman is one of us and his story is a different ball game altogether he's known in in the books of history as the Seeker of truth how his father was the guardian of the fire that the fire worshippers Worship in Persia in Iran and how he fled and believed and then he went to irq and to a priest to another priest and how he was go he went to Sham and then how he was sold as a slave only seeking the truth this is a different story so after they prayed night prayer just before F Salman said to Abu D Abu D Allah has rights over you and your wife has rights over you and your body has rights over you and your guests have rights over you so give each its due right Abu did not swallow this quite well so prayed for with the prophet went to the prophet and he said listen to what Salman said he said so and so and so and so what did the prophet sayam Salman has said the truth meaning that our religion is based on balance you have to balance you cannot be a good and you don't know what your kids are doing or you your wives don't uh uh get the time to spend with you quality time every time they talk to you no no no I'm busy I'm busy I'm answering emails I'm doing lectures I'm traveling and you cannot be a good Muslim if you're 24 hours sitting with the Ms and the kids playing around and having quality time never attending prayer in the Masjid and you cannot be a strong Muslim if you don't work out you know with with your Billy like M 6 seven foot ahead of you and someone's ask you what's the size of your shoes I don't know I haven't seen my legs a long time you have to have the balance the balance in acquiring proper knowledge of the Quran and Sunnah and the balance of being a good citizen benefiting the Muslims studying engineering medicine accounting Islamic accounting uh uh economics Etc and you have to be a good parent a good husband a caring good loving husband and a good driver no offense a good driver when you're driving on the street you have to to be a good neighbor so many of us don't know our neighbors why yeah they're C so what the prophet had cfer neighbors he used to take care of them he used to visit them so we have to have the balance not to go to extreme on the account of other things and I apologize for becoming late and for this also uh lecture on time management but I hope we will manage our time inah later on in a better way"
