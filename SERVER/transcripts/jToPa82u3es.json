  "transcript": "[Music] from YouTube talking what happened as uh I think there is nothing is understanding now for me as a job I'm also for my parents because sometimes parents has their own definition of happiness and Super Why So In some cases comparison there are children to divide what you want and the children of existed two so for example like maybe first to the children you have to go to work at a company or you have to marry a massage three times whatever I want um so maybe you can tell me or suggest me what I should do so we can find our happiness there is no middle ground in the Quran in the scholars views you must be obedient to your parents dutiful and respectful full stop but no much don't but this is what you should do now there are extreme cases but these are red generally speaking you cannot please everybody so it's like saying the president of Indonesia tells me to do this and this and I'm not happy so what are you gonna do if you don't obey him he will put you in jail because this is a crime I don't like the red light in the street so I will not stop if you don't stop will you pretend maybe you'll have an accident so you don't have a choice with your parents Associated being beautiful to your parents with to hit I mean this is the most honorable form of worship you can do after hate now unfortunately because we watch a lot of movies we watch a lot of soap operas we watch a lot of talk shows that show us how the kuffar are living and dealing with their parents in America you're 16 years old you take your back and leave your parents cry your parents no no after 10 years you're homeless you want to come home you're very safe no leave in Islam we don't have this we're always with our parents whether they're good or bad and I say that you have to formulate and condition yourself to be good with them and everyone has a test in my counseling sessions a lot of the people come to me and like the sister she says my mother does this my mother does that my mother says bad thing about me she's not fair with my siblings she always favors them over me and she gives him money and not me and whenever she sits with the relatives she says I'm evil I am this and that and not them so I say to her out of ten what is your calamity with your mom I'm depressed I'm getting anxiety I cannot breathe I cannot eat how much she says 10. I said okay would you like this test or breast cancer chemotherapy radiation the full nine yards I said oh this says okay would you like this or to be in Yemen or Syria where chemical bombs are dropped on you and you see your family and children being burnt in front of you and you cannot do anything she said no no this would you like this or you have your child seven months old skin over bones walking 20 kilometers under the heat of the Sun for half a glass of water and you see him giving his last breath and you cannot help him he says no no no this okay look at the rohingya in Brahma the Buddhist monk come and Slaughter the children the infants and they play football with their heads in front of the parents look at the ogre in China forced to shave their beards take off their hijab eat and drink pork and wine in Ramadan part of brainwashing would you like this is okay now let's ask let me ask you again your Calamity out of 10 with your mother how much she said so always be grateful everyone has a test now let me ask you if your mother your mothers like this my mother died nine months ago may Allah have mercy on her if your mother was the kindest person was very generous was always saying good words where is the test you have to be kind because she's kind to you she's giving you money she's the same beautiful words she's treating you and your wife and your children in the best of fashion you have no no other choice but to be kind where is the test there is no test the test is which is the opposite here is where you have to show your tolerance show that you're doing it for the sake of Allah not for the sake of people and this is what defines you as a real practicing Muslim from someone who's not so my sister take it from someone who's been there if you have a mother today go and kiss her feet tomorrow when she dies it's closed the door is closed no more may Allah make us all among those who are beautiful respectful and obedient to our parents"
