  "transcript": "beyond is over the last two episodes we discussed chit-chatted about repentance seeking allah's forgiveness how shaytaan works his steps and how people subhan allah may allah protect us all can plunge down the curve of iman without noticing how he starts to manipulate people through small sense then major sense then doing it publicly and ending to be advocating and calling people to such the sins this is how shaytaan works and this is why the prophet alaihis salat was salam's most popular and frequent dua was o allah turner of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion and the companions used to ask the prophet do you fear for yourself are you afraid and you are the messenger of allah azzawajal and the prophet said sallallahu sallam that the hearts are between two fingers of allah's hand and he twists them as he pleases so without us asking allah azza to make us steadfast we are doomed we've seen so many so-called righteous people praying in the first row of the masjid ending up not praying at all we've seen so many long beards in accordance to the sunnah of course because the length of the beard has nothing to do with how righteous or pious you are fidel castro has a very big and long beard but this doesn't make him a muslim but we indicate that people who used to abide by their principles and follow the sunnah who used to have long beads who used to be committed to the we've seen them down the years how they've changed how they plunged in these worldly matters they've been deceived they've been lured and attracted by the beauty of this world which made them compromise their deen and unfortunately not only they had compromised their deen shaytan made them think that what they're doing now is the right practice of deen and what they used to be years back is not sunnah anymore but rather it's an old school of thought it's extremism and what they're practicing now is moderation so this is why it is essential for us to continuously repent to allah and to make duha o allah i'm not sure of myself o allah i have no confidence in myself like nlp people say have confidence in yourself believe in yourself you can do the difference you can make this it's not you it is allah supporting you so you have to express your poverty your humility express your need to allah and not to anyone else but allah in the battle of badr in the eve of the battle of badr few hours before the battle at night the prophet kept on raising his hands out of his supplicating to allah asking allah for support asking allah for guidance o allah give us the victory you promised o allah be with us o allah grant us the chance to defeat our enemies because if they win then you will not be worshiped on earth after us meaning that we are the only believers on earth at the moment he is expressing his poverty until his cloak fell of his shoulders so this is the connection between you and allah we don't have any priests that you can go to and sit in a box and say forgive me father for i have sinned and then he listens to all what you have to say i did this and i went to 54th street and i did this and i went to this light club and the priest is writing down the addresses yes what did you do how kinky it was we don't have this alhamdulillah islam it's you and allah azza you don't have to come to me you don't have to go to the imam of the masjid you sin you repent to him and he tells you the almighty do not expose your sin do not tell a soul about what you had done this is between you and him and if he conceals you in this life he will conceal you on the hereafter as well however very few are given the chance to repent very few are those blessed by allah to repent because you cannot repent if he does not allow you to do so and this is why we have so many people in negligence so many muslims in defiance and if you tell them repent he says from what i'm not doing any mistake i'm not sinning allah mentions in chapter nine at the very end of those three who did not go with the prophet assalam in the battle of tabuk and when he came back 80 plus of the hypocrites came and gave their excuses which were lame the prophet salallahu accepted their excuses and took their pledge of allegiance and not only that sought forgiveness for allah azza though he knows that they are lying but the prophet does not judge people with what is in their hearts because this is only allah's knowledge that can tell he judges people by what so appears to him by the facts as what's in your in your heart this is up to allah there will be a day of recompense there will be a day of judgment when cabinet may allah please with him went to the prophet salaam and explained that he has no legitimate excuse none whatsoever the prophet saw some ordered the muslims to buy caught him and his two friends who said the truth and nothing but the truth to buy caught them for fifty days not to speak to them not to reply to their salams not to communicate with them in any shape or form it's a long story but a very beautiful one the conclusion was allah after 50 days revealed his repentance and acceptance to them so the prophet allah was happy and joyful allah says in the quran that he had repented upon them so that they would repent to him so allah azza is the one who accepted their repentance allah does not in a sense repent because allah doesn't sin but this is the arabic word tab repented has two meanings a person who sins would repent and the one who forgives the sin would also in a sense repent meaning accepts the repentance of those who repent so allah azza accepted the repentance so that they may repent which means that it is first for allah to accept it in order for them to be guided to repent to allah and therefore the problem is whom among us would allah azzawajal guide in the remaining beautiful nights of ramadan to repent to him nine nights left maybe less will you be able to repent from all of your sins or are you selective no see i can repent from this and that but the other sins whoa no man i can't repent maybe next year maybe a few years from now even if you're selective will you repent the majority of muslims will not and why is that as mentioned yesterday first of all because they do not acknowledge their sin and this is the first way of treatment if you're ill but you are not willing to confess you're not willing to admit your illness you'll never take the medication why should i take a medication when am i when am i fit so the first step to repentance is to admit your guilt and subhanallah a very beautiful hadith the prophet calls it the master of seeking of forgiveness what is that meaning that this is this is the best dua that you can ask allah azza for forgiveness through it and the prophet tells us allah this beautiful dua if you say it in the morning with certainty if you die during the daytime you will end up in paradise and if you say it in the evening with certainty and you die you will go to paradise isn't it worthy that such a beautiful and authentic dua be given and taught to all of our children let alone the adults of course isn't it worthy when it has this great reward that we memorize it and say it every morning and every evening with contemplation with certainty so you can say it like a parrot but your heart is not active then it has no value but when you say it actively and you know what it means wow it has wonderful effects what is this dua say the prophet says o allah you are my lord there is no god but you you have created me and i am your slave and i'm keeping my promise and covenant to you as much as i can look at this introduction you praise allah azzawajal with his beautiful name allah and tarabi you say oh allah you are my lord i declare this and i'm your servant so you are showing and expressing allah's greatness and your humility there is no god but you ant you have created me and i'm your slave abducted i am keeping my promise and covenant to you as much as i can what covenant do we have any covenants between us and allah yes we do even before we were created something that is instilled something that is in our genes something that is in our instinct in our fitrah what is that covenant it is to worship allah azzawajal and not to associate any others with him it is not actual praying and fasting and hajj no this comes later on and it differs from one person to the other from one religion to the other however the instinct the fitra how people are made is the same the prophet says allah there is no newborn child he's given birth to except he is born on the fitrah on the basic instinct what is the basic instinct to eat to attack to mate no the prophet says assalam it is his parents that makes that make him a christian a jew or a fire worshiper so the prophet is allah directing us is telling us that the fitra is islam and this is why when jibril on the miraculous journey the night journey brought the prophet allah with milk and wine to drink from the prophet islam chose milk jibril told him you have chosen futra this is nature this is instinct the basic instinct of mankind had you chosen wine you would have gone astray and so would of your umm so would of your followers so islam is a religion of basics and the true nature of a human being everything in islam is natural in the sense that it doesn't go against your nature as a person everything in islam is natural islam doesn't tell you don't get married because mating is a natural thing but at the same time it doesn't tell you to go and have orgies because this is not natural so islam channels things it tells you you'd like to fulfill your sexual desires this is natural get married unlike other religions where it tells you to live a life of celibacy and not to get married and if you get married this is filth and this is no it's not not a single prophet of allah azzawajal was not married they were all married which indicates that this is a favor and blessing of allah islam is a religion of nature it doesn't tell you to be aggressive or to be rude it tells you to coexist be lenient and kind to your parents connect to your kinship be kind to the needy and to the poor be kind to animals live and coexist in this universe with everything and everyone else islam is a religion of nature what harms you it tells you it's prohibited for you intoxicants harm you then refrain pork harms you dead meat harms you all of these things are haram so islam tells you refrain from that anything that draws you close to allah or anything that is beneficial for you islam gives you the green light so this is the covenant that was between allah the hadith says i seek refuge with you from the evil of what i do i would become sharimasonat i seek refuge in you i admit that i have shortcomings i have sins but i'm weak i'm vulnerable i have no one to turn to i have no rock to depend on however you are my lord and you are the only one i worship so i turn to you and i seek refuge with you from the evil of what i do i acknowledge your blessing and i acknowledge my sins i confess and i acknowledge your blessings and your favors upon me that are without count and this is something we fail as human beings to appreciate we think that whatever we have is naturally ours and we deserve it this is why we do not acknowledge allah azzawajal and that we should be obedient be worshipping him all the time subhanallah it is reported that a man came once to a scholar and he was complaining of poverty and requesting money requesting dua requesting anything so the man told him subhanallah you're complaining of poverty would you accept would you accept a hundred thousand dirham for your hand he said no of course not i wouldn't give you my hand for a million durham so about let your leg what about your eye what about your hearing what about the ability to taste and feel and the man's saying definitely not i would not give you any of those so the man said subhanallah you have millions of dirhams yet you're still complaining of poverty when you go and answer the call of nature every day like most normal people you don't see the favor and blessing of allah unless you cannot go to the bathroom for four or five days when you're stuck and you can't go and you feel the pain then you fa then you appreciate allah's favors upon you and this is one of our biggest problems and this is why we're always complaining we don't see allah's favors upon us if you see someone and you ask him how are you he starts to whine he says i cannot complain enough i have diabetes i'm hypertension patient my wife ran with away with my best friend my daughter is marrying a hindu my son is a drug addict my boss hates my guts he deprived me of my raise they didn't give me bonus for three years and my neighbor is throwing garbage in front of my house and he always takes my favorite parking spot under the tree and the shade other than that alhamdulillah everything is fine subhanallah this is what people say and this is what they say every single day on the contrary there are those whom you see them bed ridden for years i visited one i think it was in in london or in birmingham i don't remember and subhanallah this brother was bedridden for 10 years and you can see all the equipment in the medication in his small room his children tried their level best to help him and assist him but he's bedridden i went to visit him and subhanallah the face was glowing with light he's a bearded brother in his mid 60s paralyzed has so many illnesses diabetes had couple of strokes etc you name it his side is paralyzed he's unable to move his right arm i think and and the man from the minute i walked in till the minute i walked out was astonishing all what he had was alhamdulillah oh allah azza has given us so much allah is so generous allah azza has blessed us and i'm looking this guy blessed you excuse me let's go and play squash but then i realize it's not what you see it's what's in your heart and this is why the prophet said are some allah does not look at your bodies or at your wealth allah looks at your hearts and your deeds so if your heart is filled with iman this is what pleases allah if your deeds are in compliance to the sunnah you're not innovating you're not doing any this is what allah azza holds you accountable to and this is what pleases allah almighty so you have to acknowledge allah's blessings over you and i acknowledge my sin and this is a punchline acknowledging your sins once you acknowledge your sin you've made it now you are close to being forgiven because allah azzawajal wants you to acknowledge your sin and wants you to seek his forgiveness so that he would forgive you the hadith goes on to say so forgive me for there is none who can forgive sin except you this beautiful my brothers and sisters you must memorize it as you memorize any verse of the quran you have to repeat it twice a day in the morning and the evening of kaar you have to contemplate on it and say it with certainty because this is your key to paradise with the grace of allah azzawajal once you acknowledge your sin and seek allah's forgiveness allah would forgive your sins the prophet tells us that when a servant of allah sins and says o allah i have sinned so forgive my sin allah almighty says my servant knows that he has a lord that forgives sins and punishes over sins and he sought my forgiveness i forgive him and the servant does it again and allah says the same statement twice and the servant does it third time and allah azza repeats the same forgiveness and in the fourth time allah says a very shocking thing says my servant acknowledges his sins and knows that i forgive sins let him do whatever he wishes for i forgive him now this doesn't mean that he may do whatever he wishes and allah will continue to forgive him but it means that as long as you sin and you acknowledge your sin and you acknowledge that allah is the one who forgives it so your repentance is sincere and true then no matter how many times you fall and walk allah would continue to forgive your sins and this shows you the greatness of allah the almighty when he does not hold us accountable for every tiny thing because he knows our weakness he knows how human nature is however he gives us the solution he shows us the door he tells us the way out and that is by repenting and by seeking allah's forgiveness continuously nine nights left starting tonight will you be up to the challenge will you be able to repeat frequently the dua of may allah be pleased with her when the prophet said allah say o allah in you are most forgiving and you love forgiveness or pardoning so pardon me would you be able to repeat it if you would then you are successful and guided and if you can't repent if you're unable to repent if you are not willing to repent or have the guts to take a decision and repent then may allah azzawajal have mercy on you and me as well we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back and we're back uh michelle from jordan hello yes yes what's your question um i'm pregnant and when i pray i was wondering if it's i pray in a chair sometimes for the um after isha prayer the taqweer and because it's continuous but the other prayers um the five daily ones i pray normally but it's harder for the talk like i said it's continuous but i don't know if i'm praying it correctly because when i do it in the chair i stand the whole time except when i have to go down and prostrate to allah because it's harder in that position so i do that one in a chair and also the um the bowing that how we bow two times i got also in a chair and i was wondering if it's correct and if i'm receiving only half the reward because i'm doing it in the chair but my excuses because i'm seven months pregnant i don't know if it's good or not or if i should not do it in a chair at all okay i will answer you any more questions no that's all thank you you're quite welcome uh sin dao from saudi i have two quick questions number one um that yes that friday uh now i i had somebody making a presentation that you cannot do uh laughing after the friday priya if the imam is still in the market so i want to get your opinion on this second and then the second question uh we have about four of us who are we work in the company and then we make a small place where we do our prayers uh when we hear the the azan outside and then we make our prayers immediately we don't wait for the masjid to start the prayer before we do we do because we are at the workplace immediately we hear that we make our prayer and is this okay or we have to do it according to the timetable of the market okay i will answer inshallah yes from saudi arabia my question is whatever foreign we missed throughout the life how can we offer them can we offer them in this last 10 nights of uh whatever first for the salah and if we miss the sun yes that if we miss the sunnat and uh even the nafil that also we can perform in this la little okay and what uh and what more salah we can offer in this night's uh i wonder okay i will answer you shalom yeah one more question yes uh sheikh in india like in my parents house they have a maid she is hindu so i explain her about islam everything so i advise her to read her books also that hindu books scriptures and even quran and i told her to see the difference so i want to know can we give as a gift quran translation book to non-muslims translation or the arabic text not arabic text means arabic will be there and with that translation will be there okay any more questions no just this one okay sharifah from saudi arabia i want to ask my friend want to ask you but she cannot reach you uh she wants to ask about the because we know that the birthday is not according to islam okay uh but uh she want to ask because her her business is uh selling cake now there's a people who is making uh uh have a order for her she's making a birthday cake what is this uh is that it is good or no this is only her question okay thank you that's all thank you you're quite welcome asia from saudi i have three questions yes question number one suppose uh the ma someone is praying in the taravi now like in haram and there are so many people there a year and you know and break the uh you break the wazoo uh it is very difficult to go and make a buddha again so what is the ruling on that question number two uh can i uh uh read the quran uh on the or mnc and uh hear the reciter uh from the audio and video and say along with that reciter is that permissible when i'm learning the quran when i'm reading the quran i i want to improve my tajweed so i want to hear the reciter i look at the script i look at you're the decider and say along with him so this will give me other or not question number three uh this uh some people they say there is a uh kazan umri kazanamar that means the whole life they have not done the namaste they have to pray and they pray on after each for they keep on praying and praying is this from quran and sunnah and if it is not what is the solution we have muhammad from nigeria hello muhammad is can you invite a christian to a prayer okay i will answer inshallah uh um mute your tv please i don't memorize the the honor can i make it uh just uh other dua okay i wanna answer inshallah okay michelle from jordan she says she is pregnant in her seventh month may as well grant her a righteous and healthy practicing child and she says that during voluntary prayers she stands up but when it is rukur and this is bowing and the two prostrations and this is sujud she sits on a chair and of course she does um this i wish the director puts the camera on me a little bit uh yes thank you so the record is like this which is sitting and the sujud is further down this is the sunnah your hands on your thighs and knees not as people do it in front of them this is wrong this is baseless so she says that can i do this the answer is definitely yes you can do that would i have half of the reward what is she talking about she is referring to the hadith of the prophet haslam that the prayer of a person sitting down is half the reward of a prayer of a person praying standing up this is when you have no legitimate reason but when you have such a legitimate reason as yours your reward is full so even if it is really difficult for you to bow and prostrate to make rook or sujud when you are praying farida for prayer you may have the permission to do it sitting down as well and allah knows best sindaw says that someone said we are not permitted to pray nephil prayer after friday except when the imam leaves the masjid and this is totally wrong this is baseless it has nothing to do with islam the sunnah is that if you're going to pray the nephili the ratiba the sunnah prayer after friday in the masjid that you pray it four raka's two by two this is what the prophet used to do but if you did not pray it in your masjid and went home then the sunnah is to pray two in your home only this is what the authentic sunnah is uh he says there are four of us praying in the company where we work and the minute is given we pray our fault prayer now i will not go into the issue of that as long as the message is close you have to go and pray in the masjid because i don't know about the circumstances at work whether they are operators and they have to be at the machine and they cannot have time to leave i don't know but basically yes the default is that muslims pray in the masjid secondly once the adhan is given then the prayer is due so if the in the the minute the man says and you begin your prayer your prayer is valid you are not related to the in the masjid and that you have to wait until that time whether you're a man or a or a woman the minute that that is given that's it you can start your prayer um ali says uh what about the prayers that a a person missed throughout his life some people say pray these prayers or some of it during night of decree because it's equivalent to 84 years so this would make up for everything that you've missed and also the uh question of uh asia of this is also related to it no this is baseless prayer is like any other form of worship that is covered or designated to a certain period or time hajj is fixed on a particular date on the ninth of hajj you have to be in arafat if you missed the whole day and night of arafat and you could not be at mount alafat your hajj is invalid even if you come a day later or a day earlier you have to spend a moment of the day or night in arafat if you did not on the ninth of the hija your hajj is invalid even if you have legitimate reason and you came a week later it's still not valid salat is the same thing allah azza says in the quran that prayer is given at prescribed times so if you pray five seconds before the time is due your prayer is invalid all muslims agree upon that while the sun is setting and there is just about a minute for it to completely disappear one says allahu akbar his prayer is invalid likewise if the time of maghrib is over without any legitimate reason and you want to pray maghrib at the time of asia it is unaccepted so whatever you've lost and missed in the previous days it's gone you cannot make them up what to do you just seek allah's forgiveness and offer a lot of good deeds and pray voluntary prayers and allah is most forgiving once you repent allah raises your sins and do not go back to that she says that we have a hindu made can i give her a translation of the quran some scholars say yeah this is permissible because the arabic text is less in volume than the hindu test or the english test or the any translation so this does not take the ruling of a mushaf i personally believe that you must not do this either give her a translation of the meaning of the quran in any language that has no arabic text because the arabic text is sacred this is the quran this is the word of allah azzawajal so we must not give it to non-muslims out of respect sharifah from saudi arabia says that her friend makes um cakes and she uh sells them probably on the instagram which is a craze nowadays everybody's cooking and making sweets and food and selling it on instagram so she says that is it permissible to make such cakes for birthdays and the answer is allah azza tells us in chapter 5 that one must not associate or collaborate with people except on virtue and goodness and to refrain from collaborating with them on evil and vice so if someone tells you to make a cake and you don't know what the occasion is no problem make a cake but if they tell you that this is a birthday cake oh this is for christmas or this is for easter or this is for um something that islamically is not permissible and they declare this or they want you to write it on the cake it is not permissible for you to sell them such a thing muhammad ali from saudi arabia i want to ask one question while tarabi prayer is in progress some people who come late and then start making jama for isha isha prayer what is ruling about that doing this is okay okay i will answer inshallah okay and asia first question if someone is in haram and we see that there are approximately 1.5 million worshipers in the haram praying tarawih and doing so she says that if he breaks his wudu what should he do because if he tries to leave his spot and go to the lavatories it will take him not less than an hour and even if he wants to go back probably he would not find a place to go back to the answer would be that it is permissible as long as only wudu to take a glass from zamzam containers which are in the thousands and perform we'll do there this is water there's nothing wrong in doing that at all in sha allah but she or he cannot pray without wudu allah would not accept their prayer without wudu the minute you break it will do you have to leave and make wudu to join the prayer again muhammad from nigeria muhammad okay michelle from jordan michelle from jordan we we've lost michelle as well okay uh as your second question what's the ruling on listening to the reciter whether from the internet or from a cassette recorder uh reciting while i am reading and following from the quran and reciting with him so that i would fix my tajweed and i would fix my recitation to try my level best to perfect it the answer is definitely this is permissible and you are rewarded what you are not permitted to do is to recite with him while in prayer but if you are just sitting idle there and learning it through this way this is definitely a very good thing to do and you are rewarded muhammad from nigeria says what is it permissible to invite okay we have another muhammad from nigeria muhammad hello yes can you invite a christian to prayer and invite him to islam i've lost muhammad again i'm i'm sorry familia from saudi assalam alaikum my mother she's actually in india she wants to do a takeoff in her house so is it permissible or she has to do it in the masjid okay any more questions no thank you you're quite welcome from okay yeah ali mute your television and listen to us from the phony ali tv yes call him from sudan okay mute your tv and speak what's your question i have three questions that i want you to ask me with yes what is the importance of reciting seven times christian yes this is before the isha prayer can we pray maharib okay can we still pray makri okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from nigeria his question says that can we invite a christian to prayer no a christian cannot stand in line with us in prayer he's a kafir he may sit at the back and watch the muslims pray this is not a problem but for him to join the actual congregation no this is not permissible um from saudi arabia says that she while praying witter she does not know how to recite the kunut allah mahdina feman hadith in arabic can she recite anything else the answer is yes though kunut itself is not mandatory as many people think not only that it was never proven that the prophet salaam prayed kunut in whittier the only hadith that we have is the hadith of a man with his father when he was a seven or eight year old child he says i went to the prophet salaam and asked him to teach me a dua that i pray or ask allah azza so the prophet told him allah mahdini and hadith etc and this shows you this young child at the age of seven or eight and maybe nine asking the prophet for dua to pray witcher while our children don't even pray the fart prayers may allah guide them all so to insist on doing it every night this is not part of the sunnah so if you leave it some nights and and pray some nights this is good and if you don't pray at all this is also acceptable and there's no problem in that so can you make uh dua in other language or other than this is permissible from saudi and that time we listen our prophet's name and we have to answer uh immediately so we can uh for a while we can stop for a minute and then uh answer sallallahu alaihi salam salatu salaam then we can continue sick okay any more questions yeah that's all okay inshallah maria from the emirates yeah my mother had a nose operation also known as the rhinoplasty about a week ago because she was feeling very insecure about her nose and she it was really bugging her um she never really had a bad intention into doing it and she didn't do this to make herself look any more beautiful and before the operation my mother didn't have much knowledge about the islamic point of view towards cosmetic surgery and she's a real practicing muslim she always prays she follows the quran and now at the moment she is feeling really regretful because she's been listening to many scholars who have different points of view based on cosmetic surgery i just want to know is this acceptable is it like did she commit a sin doing this and also my second question is is that you have to give your gold as zakah once in your life or every year okay i will answer inshallah okay thank you okey-dokey uh familia from uh saudi arabia she says that can her mother perform erticaf in the masjid in india let me rephrase that can her mother perform at the cafe in her house in india the answer is no we said that ertikaf can only be performed in masjid for both men and women ali from sudan he says what's the importance of the journeymen in our seven times this is not authentic and what is the significance of allah in yes three times this is sunnah whoever says three times oh allah i i ask you of paradise paradise says oh allah admit him to me and also whoever says oh allah i seek refuge in you from hell fire three times in the morn and without specifying it morning or evening uh also the hellfire says oh allah give him refuge of me this is the dua of prophet yunus in the belly of the whale it's a recommended dua whenever you have a calamity or a problem or you want to ask something for allah you say this uh dua as well and among other uh reasons and then he concluded with seidel still far which i read to you and explained in the beginning of this show mrs say it says from oman if maggie time is so dark but before isha can we pray the answer is yes the end of maghrib is when the redness at the twilight in the west direction of west disappears once it disappears this is time for asia however a lot of the countries make this an hour and a half gap between sunset and isha and this is wrong usually richer time is due after an hour give or take five minutes after sunset so you have to be careful not to uh abide by these timetables that have an hour and a half fixed throughout the whole year like here in saudi arabia this is wrong this is what they always publish and print out but this is not the right thing to do um says that when i'm making vikker subhanallah alhamdulillah i hear the name of the prophet salallahu can i hold and offer solicitation that says definitely yes offering salutation to the prophet alisa sam is the best of vikr so it is part of your diker and there is nothing wrong with that maria says her mother did a nose job and she didn't do it to get more beautiful and she thinks that this was not a cosmetic surgery and she's regretful now the answer is easy if it was not for beautification and it was for a medical reason a sinus or she has a problem in her nose that needed fixing by the doctors not just to beautify there's nothing wrong in that alhamdulillah and the final question is zakat on gold do you once in a lifetime the answer is no it is due on your cash on your gold on your silver on your jewelry that is gold and silver only every single year if it reaches the threshold or known as not once in a year every single year the only thing that is mandatory once in a year is your pilgrimage and allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet you tomorrow next time i live without beyond happy"
