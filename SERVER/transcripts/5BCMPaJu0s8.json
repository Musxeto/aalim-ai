  "title": "Imam offers taraweeh in 4 rakahs, should I pray behind him or go to another masjid - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Junaid says my messages imam offers that are we with four raka should i pray behind him or should i go to another message that follows the sunnah the issue of praying for raka for night prayer with - tisha hood and went Aslam is an issue of dispute in the Hanafi school of thought they say you can pray 2 rakaats two Rakas or four requests for records or even six records and six records in a row in the evidence they have is that mother aisha said that the Prophet Ali Saleh to Sam used to pray you used to offer three records with one Salaam and five records with one Salaam and and not sitting except in the fifth and seven records with one salaam not set not sitting except in the seventh and ninth Rakas with one salaam sitting on the eighth and sitting on the ninth the final the shehad so they say that when you want to pray you pray for you and pray six no problem and also their evidence is that mother aisha said the Prophet SAW solemn used to pray for rak'ahs don't ask about how long beautiful perfect they are then he used to pray other for truckies below that in length so some scholars thought that this means that he used to pray for rak'ahs with went asleep but we as students of knowledge know that it is not permissible to take one single hadith and overlook the other evidences this is not the way of true students of knowledge you have to do your due diligence so collect all the hadith that speak about the quantity of night prayer the format and then try to come up with a unified conclusion and what do we mean by that see their evidence is that the hanafis and others use are valid and authentic but in the hadith that is agreed upon meaning that Buhari and Muslim agreed upon which makes it the highest level of authenticity the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said salat olele night prayer is Magne Magne he sprayed in pairs two Rakas salam two rakahs salam two rakahs salam and if you fear Fechter then offer one raka of Witter so this hadith clearly states that it shouldn't be more than two rakahs and this is why the Hannah the humbly school of thought say that anything above two is void and unaccepted because it defines the instruction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam however what do you answer the hadith of the Prophet you should pray three sitting in the last raka prayed five sitting in the last Rekha etc scholar said that this is clear this is Witter so the Prophet used to pray night prayer isolated and then when he wanted to perform Witter he used to either do that by 2 plus 1 or 3 sitting only in the 3rd or 5 sitting only on the fifth or 7 etc so by this point of view you collect all hadiths you authenticate all hadith and you implement all hadith with this understanding without the need of ignoring or neglecting one hadith because it doesn't fit with your opinion so those who say you can pray for come to the hadith of Salah to late night prayer is two by two and have a problem we have dilemma they can't combine between the two so dating like this hadith as if it was not said though it is of the greatest grades of authenticity so now we have an issue the Masjid next to my home they pray for raucous with two tashahud and one salam like they pray of the Anisha so should I pray there my own preference is that you should not pray with them because they defy they go against the hadith of the Prophet Allah salatu salams a lot to lady mammoth now do I say that they are wrong and sinful no no no they are following a respected school of thought and they are laymen there are people of ignorance they don't have knowledge maybe they are PhD holders in physics but they have zero knowledge and Islamic knowledge or in sciences so you cannot blame them this is the best they can do is follow their Imam blindly but for you who have knowledge no look for a message it that follows the majority of Muslims and play praise like the majority of Muslims 2 rakaats with Salam two Rakas with with Saran and you will be safe in sha allah and a word of advice to those extreme Hanafy brothers and sisters now ok I know that your school of thought says you can pray for but does it say you must not pray to they say no we can pray too so a word of advice as long as there is room in your mat hub in your school of thought why not be safe rather than sorry if the vast majority of Muslims say that you must pray 2 rakaats why insist on praying for when your school of thought allows you to pray 2 rakaats just to be safe to be with the majority to be with the rest of the Muslims now if you don't a new system praying for then you know that your blindly follow your Imam and your Imam is prejudiced your Imam who's leading your prayer is doing this out of control so that his congregation would not go elsewhere so he right he decides to control them and tell them only for Rakas is allowed otherwise you're out of our congregation you must not raise your hands or we will kick you out of the Masjid this is his house it's not the house of Allah if he has the authority to kick people because they have the conviction of following the Sunnah of the Prophet Isis I mean he doesn't and he wants to do this then you be careful of your Islam because you're not following Quran the Sunnah you're following this dude and he is definitely miss guiding you"
