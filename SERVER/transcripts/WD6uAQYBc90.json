  "transcript": "uh so sh I'm uh I'm asking this question on behalf of a sister so the sister has met a potential spouse and after praying isara she feels that she wants to move forward with this however her situation is a bit complicated because she lives in the UK by herself and her parents are divorced and live in different countries so she has spoken to her dad who is supportive and has no issue with it however um the situation the the issue is more about her mom because mom doesn't approve it due to the fact that they are they don't know one another uh enough and the different of enity and also um the fact that she hasn't met the guy uh in person so the sister is trying to make a video call with her mom the brother and his family but the mom declined it so um her question will be what's your advice on on this uh situation the prophet sallallah alai Alam said there is no marriage valid without the approval and consent of the Guardian the W and in this sister's case her Wally is her father so what makes it or breaks it is her father's approval her mother's consent or approval or even agreement in Islam has no weight and I don't say this out of disrespect to mothers we're talking about Halal andam we're talking about a legislative issue what validates or invalidates a marriage contract the mother has nothing to do with it so if the mother is emotional is someone who who's impulsive someone that shoots from the hip someone who doesn't care as some mothers might be and she rejects proposals coming to her daughter the daughter is not obliged at all to listen or obey her mother as long as her father is qualified he's person of uh uh wisdom his say and he checked this brother's credentials family moral conduct and the likes and it all came back to be positive he's a religious uh uh committed person in this case they could go ahead with the wedding with the marriage even if the mother doesn't show up even if she opposes it even if she says I will curse you till the day of judgment all of this has no value in Islam whether she likes it or not tough bananas this is the Islamic perspective now we're not saying this for you to go and say that to your mom of course not I'm saying this to you and to other mothers who who are listening to know their position to know their status in Islam when it comes to the marriage of their sons or daughters they don't have the right to block it so in your case saying this to you so that you would be diplomatic dutiful polite and respectful with your mom to the best of your ability at the end of the day go ahead and marry him with your father's approval even if she does not approve of it"
