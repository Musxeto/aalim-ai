  "title": "The Days for  Slaughtering",
  "transcript": "this is a very good question for asking the day slaughtering are limited you are allowed to start slaughtering only after the prayer ofid prayer so if someone Slaughters half an hour before the prayer his slaughtering is not accepted so after you finish the Eid prayer not you can Slaughter after pray and before the you don't have to sit and listen to the sermon though it is highly recommended however the time starts from after the prayer of Eid and it extends until the sunset of the 13th day of the Just Before Sunset if the sun sets it's over it's gone so you have the day of Hajj and the three days afterwards so this list makes it 4 days in total but be careful you have to slaughter before the sunset of the last day and Allah knows rest"
